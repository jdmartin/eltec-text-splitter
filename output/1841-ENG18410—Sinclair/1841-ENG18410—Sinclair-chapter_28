  CHAPTER XXVIII.
If happiness will not come of itself, most very sagacious people set forth in search of that
     enjoyment which none are willing to do without, though many plans are generally tried, before
     the right one be discovered. Agnes now declared that she was "ridiculously happy," while
     plunged in a whirl of preparations for Harrowgate, trying on every bonnet at every milliner's,
     and discussing the tone and coloring of silks or satins, with as much care and science as an
     amateur in paintings would devote to the study of a Titian or a Vandyke, while her spirits were
     restored to their highest pitch, by a letter she had accidentally seen from Captain De
     Crespigny, expressing the greatest delight in the prospect of seeing Sir Patrick and "his
     charming sister" once more, and mentioning that he was about soon to arrive at the Granby, in
     attendance on his uncle, who had already preceded him there. Agnes at once restored herself
     now, to the pleasing certainty of Captain De Crespigny's sincerity, and every ribbon she chose,
     or every costume she ordered, had an immediate reference to his taste. "La
      toilette est une belle invention;" but Marion's dress, without causing half the trouble
     and fracas occasioned by that of Agnes, seemed invariably to fit better
     than any other person's, and the colors she wore were always in the most perfect harmony.
Agnes never became wearied of the pleasurable bustle in which she was now engaged, till at
     length, when the imperial was packed, and the last box with extreme difficulty closed, she
     declared herself to be quite in love with life, and sprang into Sir Arthur's carriage, radiant
     in all the joy of a thousand anticipated triumphs. It might have been a study for any artist
     wishing to sketch a frontispiece for "The Pleasures of Hope," to see Agnes indulging all her
     own impossible expectations and ineffable wishes; but unlike the Goddess of Hope, she required
     no anchor whatever to rest on. Her drafts on the bank of futurity were unlimited by a single
     consideration of reason or probability, and like the Chinese plant that lives without requiring
     any nourishment from the earth, she existed upon a diet of airy nothings, and in a pleasing
     delirium of unreal fancies, wherein Captain De Crespigny generally acted the principal part. In
     the mind of Agnes—or rather in the empty space where a mind is supposed to be—she hung up a
     splendid picture-gallery, grouped and painted according to her own taste, displaying shadows as
     vivid as realities; and ignorant apparently that ever "hope told a flattering tale," she seemed
     scarcely to have a past or present period in her existence, the whole being formed into one
     bright futurity, glittering with splendid impossibilities.
If those who waste and enervate their intellects by building castles in the air, could be
     supposed able to create scenes in reality, as easily and rapidly as they do in imagination, it
     would, perhaps, be the most vivid conception man could form of omnipotent power. Agnes' chateaux en Espagne were in a most florid style of architecture, but
     scarcely lasted long enough to become finished edifices, as the phantoms came dashing through
     her mind in ceaseless variety, all apparently fragments, or slight sketches of future
     greatness, but without a probable access except the fool's ladder of hope. Her own visions were
     all, certainly, to be realised, and those of every other person disappointed, for the
     mortifications of even her intimate friends enhanced the pleasure of anticipated success; and
     while her plans were like the portraits of Queen Elizabeth, without a single shade, or like
     temples of spun sugar, all sweetness without solidity, the crowning joy of all was, to be
     envied, even more than to be admired.
While Agnes thus piled hope upon hope, her wishes were dedicated to very solid possessions.
     In childhood her world had been a world of bon bons and rattles, and now
     the kaleidoscope of her imagination was filled with an ever-changing galaxy of jewels, titles,
     equipages, toys, gold, bijouterie, and coronets, among which the Marquisate of Doncaster owed
     some of its prominence to the distinguished place it claimed in the herald's office. Conscious
     that she had been born with a peculiar genius for fine ladyism, Agnes considered the world as a
     large easy chair, wherein she might lounge away life in a perpetual gala, enjoying all the
     luxuries, and amused with all the trivialities of life. Having an idea that her undoubted
     birth-right was distinction and happiness, she considered it an undeserved injury to be
     deprived of a single delight on which her heart was set. Carelessly despising the duties or
     affections of life, she coveted only its diversions, and her favorite consolation, amidst its
     actual annoyances, was frequently to

Blow sportive bladders in the beaming sun,
And call them worlds.

Sir Arthur had always been one of the few old people who would ever allow himself to be
     considered well and happy, but he cultivated a placid, cheerful good-humor, which enabled him
     now to prepare with apparent equanimity for exploring his way through the unknown seas of
     Harrowgate society, though he entered the carriage to be conveyed there with very little more
     inward satisfaction than he would have felt on stepping into a cart which was conveying him to
     Newgate, being fully persuaded that no fish had ever been as much out of water in the world
     before, as he was about to feel himself.
Impatience only lengthens the hours which it seems desirable to accelerate, and time appeared
     to have become entirely motionless; while Agnes peevishly thought, during her journey, that the
     minutes passed like drops of lead, and that every day had some additional hours, till that day
     of days should at last arrive which was to rise the curtain and display Harrowgate to her view,
     though she almost ceased to repine at any present inconveniences while bewildered and lost in
     gay hopes for the future.
Sir Arthur good-humoredly whispered to Marion, as they drove along through Yorkshire, that
     with such a mute as Agnes beside him, he felt almost afraid of the bow-string, and that she was
     the mere tableau of a travelling companion, who seemed, like Lady
     Macbeth, to be literally walking and talking in her sleep. While Marion and her uncle beguiled
     their long journey with agreeable discussions and lively remarks, Agnes, perfectly absent
     during most of the way, and out of humor during the rest of it, uttered a thousand
     consequential complaints about the cold, the heat, the sun, the dust, the air, or the
     closeness, while Sir Arthur smilingly remarked, that Agnes' life seemed to be a sea of
     troubles, but hope served as a cork jacket to support her through them all.
Like the fairy who turned a gloomy grove into a crystal palace, Agnes had now, in her private
     mind, metamorphosed the Admiral's old green chariot into a glittering saloon at Harrowgate,
     filled by a crowd of admirers, each gifted with almost superhuman merit and distinction, who
     were to fall prostrate at her feet, making proposals which sometimes she gracefully accepted,
     and sometimes as gracefully declined. Nothing was real around Agnes at present; but as the
     picture of a friend supplies the want of the original, so the imaginary attentions of Captain
     De Crespigny and other victims, consoled her for their being absent, and her life became a
     lively comedy, where the curtain never fell, and she was herself always the principal figure on
     the stage.
Neither Alnwick Castle nor Harewood House attracted a moment's attention from Agnes, who
     cared no more for the magnificent landscapes they passed, than did the post-horses that drew
     the carriage; and when the party stopped at Caterick Bridge to dine, she had just put on the
     family diamonds of the Duke of Kinross, who waited to conduct her to the altar. It was a
     favorite speculation with Agnes, that she was to become acquainted in the public room at
     Harrowgate, with some handsome incognito, the sort of perfect Adonis
     whom alone it would be possible to marry; and after dancing, flirting, dining, and supping with
     him, he was to turn out the Duke of Somebody, who should make her a long-sighed-for declaration
     of undying attachment, while Barons, Earls, Viscounts, and above all, Captain De Crespigny,
     should be plunged into the depths of despair by her accepting him.
Agnes' lovers were never estimated according to the qualities of their head or heart, but
     according to the trivialities of their dress and appearance. Like the Grecian artist, in love
     with an image of his own forming, the description of her intended lovers, with which she
     occasionally favored Marion, resembled a lecture on comparative anatomy, so emphatic was she on
     the necessity of his being neither too tall, nor too short, too dark, nor too fair; while she
     would evidently have considered a bad temper less objectionable than a bad complexion, and was
     ready to tolerate a man who was dissipated, rather than one who was awkward.
In the estimation of Agnes, "good society" was composed entirely of lords and ladies, while
     her fancy very seldom strayed out of the peerage; though she did sometimes take the trouble to
     fancy herself admired by some distinguished commoner of more than ordinary celebrity, merely
     for the pleasure of rejecting him, and swelling her right honorable triumph, when she exchanged
     her wreath of roses for a coronet. Those who had been proverbially inconstant to other ladies,
     would now become unchangeably devoted to her; and if she heard of any individual more than
     commonly fatal to the peace of other ladies, her fertile mind suggested scenes of romance and
     rapture, where the injuries of others would be more than revenged by the distracting suspense
     in which she meant to hold her intended victim.
While the world thus ran upon castors in the imagination of Agnes, no novel could be nearly
     so interesting as her own rose-colored dreams, because in none could she be herself the
     heroine; but when reading the most romantic romances, they served occasionally to suggest new
     scenes of emotion and pleasure, which could be adapted with variations to her own case, while
     all she saw in books flitted like a gay phantasmagoria from her mind, except what could be in
     any way applied to herself. The business of life, in short, was, she thought, to make every man
     living in love with her, and to get through existence like a party of pleasure, crowding into
     it the greatest possible variety of amusements, and ending the whole with orange flowers,
     Brussels lace, wedding-cake, and favors.
None of the sacred duties or home affections ever entered into Agnes' calculations. She lived
     merely for the triumphs of society; while Marion existed for the happiness of home, seeking
     only the redeeming points of life, and absorbed in a prevailing desire to deserve and to obtain
     the attachment of those who were by nature nearest and dearest to herself. As the proverb says,
     "A long road or a bad inn teach us to know our companions;" but all that a generous person can
     do for others, and all that a selfish person fancies he could do, Marion did, with unobtrusive
     attention, for Sir Arthur and Agnes during the journey; while her sister sarcastically
     remarked, that even if Dash wagged his tail to her, she seemed grateful for his regard.
