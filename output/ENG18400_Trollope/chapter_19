<head> CHAPTER XVIII. </head>
<p>AN EXPLANATORY EPISTLE, WHICH DOES NOT PROVE SATISFACTORY — PLANS FOR THE FUTURE,
				FOLLOWED BY ACTIVE MEASURES TO CARRY THEM INTO EFFECT — A MORNING VISIT TO MRS.
				GABBERLY.</p>
<p>
				During the whole of the day which followed Miss Brotherton's
				expedition to Hoxley-lane, that young lady remained waiting at home, not very
				patiently, for Sir Matthew Dowling's promised communication. But still it came not,
				and when, at an hour too late to hope for it any longer, she at length retired to
				bed, it was in a state of irritation and anxiety that left her little chance of
				quiet slumber.</p>
<pb n="189"/>
<p>Pale, harassed, and fearing she knew not what for the little fellow, for whose safety
				she had undertaken to answer, Miss Brotherton joined her good nurse at the
				breakfast-table, incapable of thinking or speaking upon any other subject. But it
				was in vain that the gentle-spirited Mrs. Tremlett again and again declared it to be
				"impossible, and quite out of all likelihood, that Sir Matthew should mean any harm
				by the boy;" Mary, though "weary of conjectures," could by no means end them by
				coming to the same conclusion; nor did the following letter, handed to her while she
				still sat before her untasted breakfast greatly tend to tranquillize her. It was
				from Sir Matthew Dowling himself, delicately enveloped, highly scented and sealed
				with prodigiously fine armorial bearings on a shield, almost large enough to have
				adorned the panels of a carriage. But all this perfection of elegance was lost on
				poor Mary, whose heart, indeed, seemed to leap into her throat, as she tore open the
				important despatch. It contained the following lines:</p>
<quote><p>"My charming Neighbour!</p>
<p> "If you knew, or could at all guess, how fervently I admire the beautiful
				benevolence you have manifested, in trying to quiet the fidgetty spirit of poor
				window Armstrong, you would be better able to appreciate the vexation I feel, at not
				yet being able fully to answer your inquiries concerning her boy. Think not, my
				dearest Miss Brotherton, that I neglected this business yesterday, on the contrary,
				I do assure you I gave my whole attention to it; nevertheless, I have by no means
				succeeded in learning what you wish to know. The facts of the case are these. A most
				respectable stocking-manufacturer, with whom, however, my foreman is better
				acquainted than myself, employs a multitude of young hands, most of whom are
				apprentices, in the different branches of his business. It was to this person, that
				the weak and wavering poor woman for whom you are interested, agreed to intrust her
				boy. Indentures were accordingly prepared, and I gave my superintendent orders to
				have the little fellow supplied with all necessaries, desiring that no time might be
				lost in getting him ready, as I knew that people belonging to this stocking-weaving
				establishment were likely to pass through Ashleigh in a day or two, and I wished, if
				possible, to avoid having the trouble of sending him to his destination myself. Now
				it unfortunately happened, that my man, Parsons, obeyed this order much more
				literally than I intended; for meeting in Ashleigh the persons I had named to him
				the very next day, he immediately mentioned the circumstance to them, and finding
				that they had a comfortable van, and every thing convenient with them, the whole
				business was arranged and done before I returned from a visit I had been making at
				Netherby. This was certainly being more prompt than was necessary, but it would have
				mattered little, comparatively speaking, had he not been such a goose as to let the
				van drive off, without even asking to which of the manufactories of the
				establishment it was going. Yet, although this is vexing, my dear Miss Brotherton, I
				should think it could not be very important. I have told Parsons to write about it
				immediately, <pb n="190"/> and he shall wait upon you with the information you wish
				for, as soon as he receives it. </p>
<p>"Will you, my fair friend, join us in a little pic-nic party, projected by our young
				people for Thursday next, 'under the green-wood tree in Blackberry wood?' Lady
				Clarissa is, of course, to be one of our society, and she will communicate all
				particulars respecting place and time.</p>
<p>
				"Ever, my dear Miss Brotherton,
			</p>
<p>"Very faithfully yours, " Matthew Dowling. "</p></quote>
<p>Having read this letter to the end, she turned the sheet, and began a reperusal of
				it, without uttering a word, and when she had again reached its conclusion, she put
				it into the hands of Mrs. Tremlett, still without speaking a word. Before, however,
				that excellent, but not rapid lady, had got half through it, poor Mary's agitation
				broke forth — </p>
<p>"What do you think of it, nurse? for Heaven's sake, give me your opinion without
				delay! I am quite sure, that the poor creatures in Hoxley-lane, whom I have beguiled
				with my presumptious promises, will pine themselves to death with this uncertainty.
				Tremlett! for mercy's sake finish reading it, and tell me what I can do more!"</p>
<p>It might not have been very easy for any one to have satisfactorily answered this
				inquiry; but the good Mrs. Tremlett was altogether incapable of forming any opinion
				worth hearing on the subject, for in truth she neither shared, nor fully
				comprehended the vague fears, that were tormenting her young mistress.</p>
<p>Having, however, at length, despite of Mary's interruptions, contrived to reach the
				end of the epistle, her first words were — </p>
<p>"Don't, my darling Miss Mary! — let me beg of you to refuse at once. There is nothing
				in the whole world so dangerous and cold-catching, as these foolish parties on the
				damp grass. And besides, the evenings are drawing in now, and I'm sure" — </p>
<p>"Oh! Nurse Tremlett! Nurse Tremlett!" interrupted Mary, more angry with her than she
				had ever been in her whole life before, "How can you be so cruel as to trifle thus?
				Why won't you try to think a little for me about this strange mysterious business,
				and give me your opinion?"</p>
<p>"Lord bless you, Miss Mary, if you were to kill me, I could no more help thinking of
				you first than I could fly," replied Mrs. Tremlett. "And, indeed, my dear, I don't
				see what you should put yourself into such a fuss for. What can you think is going
				to happen to the little boy! You'll just spoil that poor sickly body, my dear child,
				if you encourage her in having such tantrums, because her boy set out upon his
				journey a day, may be, earlier than she expected."</p>
<p>"Then you really and truly do not believe it possible, nurse, that Sir Matthew
				Dowling should have smuggled the boy away, without intending to let us know where he
				has sent him?" said Miss Brotherton.</p>
<p>"Good gracious, no, Miss Mary," replied her friend.</p>
<pb n="191"/>
<p>For a moment, this opinion brought some consolation with it, simply from the decision
				with which it was uttered; but the next, all her anxiety returned again, for though
				she felt that there was, perhaps, something improbable and exaggerated in the idea
				of the child's being kidnapped in the face of day, and at it were before a hundred
				witnesses, there was at least no delusion as to his unhappy mother's state of mind
				respecting him, nor in the fact of her having in some sort pledged her own word,
				that the poor woman and her lame boy should receive tidings of him.</p>
<p>A little further conversation with Mrs. Tremlett, convinced her that her opinion on
				the subject could be of no great value, inasmuch as it was founded solely on the
				notion, that "it was not likely, Sir Matthew Dowling should want to hide away the
				little boy."</p>
<p>"No!" thought Mary. "Nor was it likely he should have acted, looked, and spoken as I
				saw him do, when his poor girl lost her senses from agony at my having witnessed it.
				If I misdoubt him unjustly, I will be careful that it shall not injure him. I will
				await his own time for information. If it comes, no one will be the worse for the
				impatience with which I shall have waited for it. But, if it comes not, I can be
				doing no wrong by taking every means of seeking it."</p>
<p>In conformity with this resolution, Miss Brotherton not only waited with tolerable
				external composure herself, but continued in a great degree to tranquillize the
				spirits of the widow Armstrong, likewise; and during a whole week, Sir Matthew
				Dowling was permitted to remain unmolested. Miss Brotherton, indeed, did not meet
				him under the greenwood-tree, pleading an indisposition, which was not quite
				imaginary, as her excuse, but she troubled him with nor more questions.</p>
<p>On the day fixed for this <hi>al fresco</hi> meeting of nearly the whole
				neighbourhood, Edward Armstrong was appointed to pay his first visit to Millford
				Park. During her almost daily visits to his mother, she had remarked that, though he
				uttered not a word in contradiction of the reasonings, by which she sought to show
				the improbability that any mischief could have befallen Michael, his speaking
				features expressed no confidence in them, and wishing upon this day of general
				riding and driving, to remain within her own gates, she determined to take the
				opportunity of conversing with him alone.</p>
<p>She was by herself in her pretty boudoir when he arrived, and perceiving that his
				pale face was flushed by heat and exercise, she made him sit down on the sofa,
				beside her.</p>
<p>There was something singularly sad in the utter indifference with which his young eye
				wandered over all the striking and unwonted objects that surrounded him. When bad to
				sit beside the young lady on her silken couch, he obeyed without seeming at all
				conscious that the rest he needed was now afforded in more dainty style than usual,
				and all the intelligence of his soul seemed settled in his eyes as he looked into
				the face of Miss Brotherton, and faintly murmured — </p>
<p>"Is there any news of him?"</p>
<p> "No, Edward, there is not," replied Marry, firmly; "but surely, <pb n="192"/> my
				dear boy, this delay cannot justify the look of misery it produces on your
				countenance. Tell me, Edward, what is it that you fear for Michael!" </p>
<p>"I do not know myself," replied the boy. "And yet I think it over in my head day and
				night only to find out what is the very worst possible they can do to him."</p>
<p>"But is that wise, Edward, or is it right, think you, while your poor mother has only
				you left to comfort her, that you should only strive to fill your own head and hers
				with the very worst thoughts your fancy can conjure up?"</p>
<p>"I do not fill mother's head with them," replied Edward. "I have never told her one
				single word of all my dismal thoughts."</p>
<p>"Then you are a good boy, and I love you for it. But what are your dismal thoughts,
				Edward? You may tell them to me."</p>
<p>The boy hesitated for a moment, and then said — "I think Sir Matthew Dowling is a
				wicked, cruel man; and I think that he would be more likely to be wicked and cruel
				to Michael than good to him."</p>
<p>"What is it has made you think Sir Matthew cruel and wicked, Edward?" demanded Miss
				Brotherton.</p>
<p>"Because he is hard and unjust to those who labour for him — and because I have seen
				him laugh and make sport of the tears of little children."</p>
<p>There was something in the accents of the boy that startled Mary. — She felt inclined
				to exclaim — "How much more older art thou than thy looks!" so thrilling was the
				tone, and so profound the feeling with which he spoke.</p>
<p>"Yet still," she replied, "it is difficult to see that he could gain any advantage by
				ill-using Michael in any way bad enough to make you look so miserable, Edward."</p>
<p>"If he keeps him from me is not that enough?" said the pale boy, looking
				reproachfully at her.</p>
<p>"But, Edward, you knew that he was going to leave you; and your mother, at least,
				consented to it."</p>
<p>"Yes, she did consent to it. Poor, dear mother! She did consent to it. But had I been
				true, as I ought to have been, she never would," said Edward, clasping his hands and
				closing his eyes with a look of intense suffering.</p>
<p>"Explain yourself, my dear boy," said Mary, kindly. "In what have you been otherwise
				than true?"</p>
<p>"We agreed together — poor Michael and me agreed together, never to let mother know
				how bad we were served at the mill — and, above all, we agreed that she should never
				know how miserable Michael was at the great house, 'cause we was sure she'd have him
				away, and so lose the bit of comfortable food she has been having. But it was wrong
				and wicked to deceive her. We should have told her all, and then Michael would have
				never gone!"</p>
<p> "You acted for the best, my dear boy, and must not reproach yourself," replied Mary;
				"and so far am I from thinking it wrong to keep her mind easy in her present state
				of health, that I strongly advise her <pb n="193"/> being still comforted as much as
				possible by our manner of talking to her. Fear not, Edward, that I shall neglect the
				safety of Michael, because you will not hear me talk of his being in any danger. I
				will not rest till I know what has become of him." </p>
<p>Mary said this in a tone that left no doubt of her sincerity; and it was then for the
				first time that Edward seemed to remember her greatness. He stood up before her with
				a look of tender reverence inexpressibly touching, and said solemnly — "Then God
				will bless you for it!"</p>
<p>"And he will bless you, my dear child!" replied Mary, with tears starting to her
				eyes. "He will bless and comfort you for all your duty and affection. Keep up your
				spirits, Edward, and, above all things, never be idle. It is for your mother's sake
				as well as your own that I am so anxious you should learn to read and write, dear
				Edward — and by degrees we shall get you on to ciphering, and who knows but we may
				make a clerk or accountant of you, and so enable you to get money, even if your
				health is not very good."</p>
<p>The boy smiled languidly as he replied, "I should like it very much, if I was to live
				long enough."</p>
<p>"You will get stout and well, Edward," said Mary, cheerfully, "now that you have no
				hard work to do. And you shall come up to the same school that all my boys and girls
				go to here — and when school is over, you must come every day to my kitchen with a
				little basket for your mother. You understand, Edward? And once every week you must
				come up into this room to me with your books, that I may see your writing and hear
				you read a little."</p>
<p>A gleam of hope and joy kindled in the boy's beautiful eyes as he listened to her,
				and a bright blush mantled his pale cheeks; but it was like the flitting sunshine of
				April chased by a heavy cloud almost before its warmth could be felt or its beauty
				seen. "Oh! if Michael could but hear that!" he exclaimed, while tears, for the first
				since the conversation began, burst from his eyes. " <hi>That</hi> was what poor
				Michael always wanted. If I could but learn, and so get my bread without
				mill-slavery, Mike always said he would not mind working himself, 'cause he was so
				strong. But now that very thing is come; and he, maybe, will never know it!"</p>
<p> Heavy and fast the drops fell from beneath the hand which he had raised to conceal
				his face, till Mary, as she watched him, wept for company. This, however, was not
				the way to help him, and conquering a weakness so every way unwise, she spoke to him
				with affectionate but steady firmness of the exertion it was his duty to make at
				time when his mother had none but him to comfort her. She had touched the right
				string — the little fellow's nerves seemed braced, and every faculty awakened by the
				words she uttered; and if he took back to his mother no tidings of poor Michael, he
				brought to her support a young spirit strong in endurance, and an intellect that,
				for the first time, had whispered to its owner hopes, promises, and aspirations,
				which seemed to make the life he had often loathed a new-found treasure to him. Mary
				saw not all that passed in the young mind she had rescued from the listless langour
				of despair, yet she perceived enough <pb n="194"/> to satisfy her that she had done
				him good, and that, however vain her hopes of benefiting the miserable Drakes might
				be, there could be no doubt that, in this case at least, her efforts would not prove
				wholly abortive. </p>
<p>It is wonderful what an energy and renewed impetus this conviction gave to her
				spirits! No mildew can blast more surely, or bring a more lamentable feeling of
				withering over the heart, than that caused by the cold and false philosophy which
				would check every effort to do good, lest, by possibility, success might not attend
				it.</p>
<p>The remainder of this day was by no means spent unhappily by the warm-hearted little
				heiress. The schoolmistress was made to expect Edward on the morrow — and the cook
				was made to expect Edward on the morrow. One Mercury was despatched to the town for
				a choice collection of slates, copies, spelling-books, and the like, and another to
				Mary's tailor in ordinary, with instructions to call on the widow Armstrong, and
				take measure of her son. All this business, and a good deal more tending the same
				way, having been satisfactorily got through in the course of the day that kept all
				the Ashleigh world safely entangled in the thickets of Blackberry wood, Mary
				Brotherton lay down to rest, and slept exceedingly well, though not urged thereto by
				having shared in their pleasant fatigues.</p>
<p>She rose the next morning with a sort of pleasant consciousness of increasing power
				to walk alone in this busy world, and gaily announced at breakfast to Mrs. Tremlett
				her purpose of immediately making a visit of speculation to Mrs. Gabberly, in order
				to ascertain if any gossip was yet afloat respecting the disappearance of Sir
				Matthew Dowling's far-famed protegé. The distance from Miss Brotherton's mansion to
				Mrs. Gabberly's cottage was not great, and the heiress traversed it without having
				any fear of officers before her eyes, or any other protection than her parsol.</p>
<p>She was, of course, received with expressions of unmitigated astonishment at her
				absence from the gala of the preceding day.</p>
<p>"What on earth, my dear child, could have kept you away?" said the animated lady.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I was afraid of taking cold, Mrs. Gabberly. Mrs. Tremlett took care I should
				remember how short the days are growing."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Tremlett! — Nonsense! — Well now, I can tell you that you just lost the most
				delightful day that any body ever had. Such a dinner! — Game of all kinds — almost
				all in savoury jelly too! Think of that! So wholesome, you know, with the spice; and
				eating it in the open air, and all. Depend upon it, my dear Miss Brotherton, that if
				you suffer yourself to be boxed up by that ignorant old woman, you will very soon
				lose your health altogether. And do you know I can't help thinking that you do look
				rather feverish to-day — your eyes have that sort of brightness. I wish to goodness
				you would let me feel your pulse."</p>
<p>"Nothing will do my pulse so much good, my dear Mrs. Gabberly, as your telling me all
				the news you heard yesterday," said the young lady, good-humouredly shaking the hand
				that was extended to ascertain her state of health.</p>
<pb n="195"/>
<p>"Well now, my dear, I am sure I have no objection in the world to tell you, and
				certainly one does pick up a vast deal of information at such a party as that. Will
				you believe it? two of the Simmonses are going to be married."</p>
<p>"Really! That's very good news, I suppose. Had you a great many people there?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Every body, just every body, but your own dear self; and I can truly say that if
				you had been there, it would have been quite perfect!"</p>
<p>"You are very kind; but a person so very much afraid of taking cold, is always
				troublesome on these <hi>al fresco</hi> occasions. Lady Clarissa was there of
				course?"</p>
<p>"Of course, my dear. And <hi>such</hi> a flirtation with Sir Matthew! God knows, I
				ain't over strict in any way: I despise it, because it shows such ignorance of life
				and good society. But I must say, I <hi>do</hi> think they carry the thing a little
				too far. Of course, a lady of rank and title like Lady Clarissa, is not to be judged
				altogether like common people. I am quite aware of that, and nothing can be more
				thoroughly vulgar than forgetting this. And I certainly have lived too much in
				really first-rate good society, not to know it. But, nevertheless, you know, there
				is reason in roasting eggs, and even an earl's daughter <hi>may</hi> get talked
				of."</p>
<p>"Was Lady Dowling in presence?" inquired Miss Brotherton, smiling.</p>
<p>"No, my dear, thank God she was not, or we should have had sour looks with our
				sweetmeats, I can tell you."</p>
<p>"Did Sir Matthew bring his little favourite with him? The little boy he has adopted
				you know?"</p>
<p> "Oh! dear, haven't you heard all that yet? Well now, upon my word, Mary Brotherton,
				it will <hi>not</hi> do, your shutting yourself up in this way. Catching cold,
				indeed! As if I, the daughter of my own poor dear father, wasn't likely to know more
				than Mrs. Tremlett about catching cold! Why, my dear, the little boy has been sent
				away I don't know how long, with a monstrous premium, paid by Sir Matthew, to get
				him entered at one of the first commercial houses in Europe. Dr. Crockley was
				exceedingly agreeable and attentive to me all day yesterday. And, indeed, so he was,
				I must say, to every body. We do sometimes differ about spinal complaints, and I
				think he is a great deal too speculative. But it is impossible to deny that he can
				be very agreeable when he chooses it, and it was he that told me all about this last
				noble act of Sir Matthew. To be sure he is an honour to the country if ever there
				was one, Sir Matthew, I mean. It is such men as that, Miss Brotherton, that brings
				wealth and prosperity to our glorious country. To think only of the hands he
				employs! Fifteen hundred children taking all his mills together, he told us
				yesterday, besides several women and men. Oh! it is glorious to be sure! However,
				Dr. Crockley did just whisper to me, but I don't believe he meant it should go much
				farther, he did certainly hint, that poor cross Lady Dowling, did not like to have
				the little fellow in the house, and <pb n="196"/> that was one reason why good Sir
				Matthew was in such a hurry to place him." </p>
<p>"Did you happen to hear to what part of the country the boy had been sent, Mrs.
				Gabberly?"</p>
<p>"Why, no! my dear, I can't say I did. But that makes no difference you know. Every
				body is aware that it is a noble situation for him, and that's the main point of
				course."</p>
<p>"Oh! certainly. I only asked from idle curiosity. And I suppose, Mrs. Gabberly, that
				it is because I am so idle, that I do often feel curious about things that nobody
				else seems to care about. Do you know I am dying to get into a factory, and see all
				these dear little children at work. It must be so pretty to see them all looking so
				proud and so happy, and all enjoying themselves so much! I really must get a peep at
				it," said Miss Brotherton.</p>
<p>"Law! my dear! What a very queer notion," replied Mrs. Gabberly.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is," said Mary smiling, "as nobody else in the whole neighbourhood ever
				talks about it; but if I have such a fancy, there can be no reason why I should not
				indulge it, can there?"</p>
<p>"Why, good gracious, my dear child! only think of the dirt! You would be downright
				poisoned, Mary."</p>
<p>"Poisoned? How can that be, dear Mrs. Gabberly, when every body agrees that it is
				such a blessing to the country, to have brought such multitudes of children to work
				together in these factories?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, my dear!" replied Mrs. Gabberly, knitting her brows. "This is some of Mrs.
				Tremlett's vulgar ignorance, I am very sure. How can a girl of your good
				understanding, Miss Brotherton, speak as if what was good and proper for the working
				classes, had any thing to do with such as you. Fie! my dear! Pray never let any body
				in the neighbourhood hear you talk in this strange wild way, I do assure you, that
				there is nothing that would do you so much injury in the opinion of all the first
				families hereabouts. And nobody knows this neighbourhood better than I do."</p>
<p>"I am quite aware of that Mrs. Gabberly," said the young lady very respectfully, "and
				that is one reason why I wish to talk to you about this notion of mine. Is it really
				true, Mrs. Gabberly, that none of the ladies in the neighbourhood ever go into the
				factories?"</p>
<p>"To be sure it is. Why should they go, for goodness sake?"</p>
<p>"Oh! I don't know exactly. — But I cannot see why they should not — if they wish it,"
				replied Miss Brotherton, modestly.</p>
<p>"Well now, but I do, my dear. And I do beg and entreat that you won't talk any more
				about it. I am quite sure, Mary, that somebody or other has been talking nonsense to
				you, about all this. If you had got any friends or connexions towards Fairly now, I
				should think they had been telling you all the romantic stuff that has been hatching
				there about factory children, and God knows what beside. But I don't believe you
				have ever gone visiting that way, have you, my dear?"</p>
<p> "And who is there at Fairly, dear Mrs. Gabberly, who would be <pb n="197"/> likely
				to talk to me on such a subject?" said Marry, colouring to the temples, with
				eagerness to hear the answer. "Good gracious! my dear, did you never hear tell of
				that poor wrong-headed clergyman, George Bell? Such a difference to be sure between
				one man and another. My dear good Mr. Gabberly never in his life breathed a word
				that could hurt the feelings of his neighbours. He visited them every one, and was
				on the best and most friendly terms with them all, which is what I call living in
				the true spirit of Christian charity. Whereas this tiresome, troublesome, Mr. Bell,
				has taken it into his head to find out wrong, where every body else sees nothing but
				right; and God forbid, my dear, that you should take it into <hi>your</hi> dear
				innocent head to follow any of his mischievous fancies; I wonder what he'll get by
				it? Great goose he must be, to be sure, not to see that he is going exactly the way
				to set every body that can be of the least use to him smack against him in all
				things!" </p>
<p>"What is it he does, Mrs. Gabberly, that is so very wrong?" demanded Miss
				Brotherton.</p><p>"What is it he does? Why just every thing he ought not to do, my
				dear, that's all. You would hardly believe, perhaps, that a clergyman should
				actually encourage the poor to complain of the very labour by which they live? And
				yet I give you my word and honour that is exactly what he has been doing. It's
				incredible, isn't it, almost? He positively says, loud enough for all the country to
				hear him, that the labour in the factories — such a blessing as it is to the poor —
				he actually says that it is bad for the children's health. Such stuff, you know, my
				dear, as if the medical men did not know best; and there's numbers of 'em that
				declare that it's quite impossible to tell in any way satisfactory that it can do
				'em any harm at all. And, upon my word, I don't know what poor people will come to!
				It's quite out of the question to attempt pleasing 'em. If they've got no work they
				are perfectly outrageous about that, and ready to tear people to pieces just to get
				it; and no sooner is there enough to do, than away they go bawling again, swearing
				that the children are over-worked; isn't it provoking my dear?"</p>
<p>"Mr. George Bell," said Mary, very distinctly.</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear, that's the name of the foolish man who seems to take a pleasure in
				making people fancy they are not well enough off, when I'm sure, by all I can hear
				and understand, these very identical people may consider themselves first and
				foremost of the whole world for prosperity," replied Mrs. Gabberly.</p>
<p>"Fairly?" rejoined Miss Brotherton, interrogatively.</p>
<p>"Yes my dear, Farily's where he lives, if I don't mistake."</p>
<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Gabberly," said the young lady, rising somewhat abruptly; "I am
				very glad you had such a pleasant day yesterday. Good bye." And without permitting
				the stream of Mrs. Gabberly's eloquence to well forth upon her afresh, the heiress
				slipped through the parlour door, and escaped.</p>
