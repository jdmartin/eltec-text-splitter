<head> CHAPTER XIX. </head>
<p>A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY — A PLAIN STATEMENT, LEADING TO THE CONVICTION THAT EVEN WHERE
				IGNORANCE IS NOT BLISS, KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ALWAYS HAPPINESS — A HASTY FRIENDSHIP THAT
				MAY NEVERTHELESS PROVE LASTING.</p>
<p>
				To order the carriage, and to give Mrs. Tremlett notice that she
				wished her to make all speed in preparing to accompany her in it, was to Miss
				Brotherton the work of a moment. As the business she was upon might, however, take
				some hours, she urged her old friend to eat luncheon as if certain of having no
				dinner; and having given time for this, and interrogated her coachman concerning
				distance and so forth, the hopeful, animated girl, sprung into her carriage as the
				clock struck two, determined not o re-enter her mansion till she had lost some
				portion of the ignorance which had of late so cruelly tormented her.</p>
<p>The roads were good, and by the help of a short bait, Miss Brotherton and her
				companion reached Fairly turnpike a little after four. Here she made inquiries for
				the residence of Mr. Bell, and having learned in what direction she should find it,
				repeated the instructions to her coachman and bade him drive on.</p>
<p>"Are the horses to be put up there, ma'am?" demanded the coachman.</p>
<p>"Yes — no, James, not there I suppose — that is, not at the clergyman's house; but of
				course you will be able to find some place quite near, you know; and William must
				wait — no, not wait, but come back as soon as he knows where you put up, that I may
				send for you when I am ready."</p>
<p>To these, not over-clear, instructions James answered "Yes ma'am," and drove off.</p>
<p>In obedience to the directions received at the tollbar, the carriage soon left the
				high-road, and proceeded down a grassy lane, which harvest carts for the time and
				rolled into smoothness. Less than a quarter of a mile of this, brought the wanderers
				to another turning, that in five minutes placed them before the gates of an edifice
				the aspect of which made Mary pull the check-string.</p>
<p>"That looks like a parsonage-house! Does it not?" said Miss Brotherton.</p>
<p>And before Mrs. Tremlett could answer, William had already opened the door, and let
				down the steps. It was very easy to get out, and very easy to inquire if Mr. Bell
				were at home; but when answered in the affirmative, Miss Brotherton felt that it was
				not very easy to decide in what manner to explain the cause of her visit to the
				object of it. She had by no means settled this point to her satisfaction, when the
				door of a small parlour, lined with books, was opened to her, and she found herself
				in the presence of the gentleman she had so unceremoniously come to visit.</p>
<pb n="199"/>
<p>There was much in the countenance of Mr. Bell to reassure a more timid spirit than
				that of Mary Brotherton; nevertheless she stood before him for a minute or two in
				some embarrassment, not so much from fear of him, as of herself. Did she fail to
				make him at once understand the motive of her inquiries, he could not avoid thinking
				both them and herself impertinent, and this consciousness caused a much brighter
				glow than usual to mantle her cheeks, as the stood before him, with her eyes fixed
				timidly, and almost beseechingly, on his face.</p>
<p>Although Miss Brotherton had not quite the easy and <hi>(tant soit peu)</hi> assured
				air of a woman of fashion, there was enough in her appearance to indicate her claim
				to observance, as well as admiration, and Mr. Bell opened the conversation by
				earnestly requesting that she would sit down.</p>
<p>His aspect had done much towards giving her courage, and his voice did more.</p>
<p>"You are very kind sir," said she, "to receive so courteously a stranger, who has in
				truth no excuse whatever to offer for thus intruding on you. Nevertheless, I am
				greatly tempted to hope, that if I can succeed in making you understand the object
				of my visit, you will forgive the freedom of it."</p>
<p>"And I," returned Mr. Bell, smiling, "am greatly tempted to believe that let the
				object of this visit be what it may, I must always feel grateful to it. Is there any
				thing, my dear young lady, that I can do to serve you?"</p>
<p>"There is indeed, Mr. Bell!" she replied, with great earnestness of voice and manner.
				"I am come to you for instruction. Though you do not know me, you probably may know
				the place at which I live. My name is Mary Brotherton, and my house is called
				Millford Park."</p>
<p>"Certainly, Miss Brotherton, both your name, and that of your residence are know to
				me — on what subject can I give you any information that may be useful?"</p>
<p> "Circumstances, Mr. Bell, have lately directed my attention to a subject which my
				own situation in life, as well as the neighbourhood in which I live ought to have
				long ago made thoroughly familiar to me — such is not the case, however; I am
				profoundly, and I fear shamefully ignorant respecting the large and very important
				class of our population employed in the factories. I am in possession of a large
				fortune wholly amassed from the profits obtained by my father from this species of
				labour, and I cannot but feel great interest in the welfare and prosperity of the
				people employed in it — especially as I understand a very large proportion of them
				are young children — and moreover, that from some cause or other, which I can by no
				means understand, the whole class of 'the factory people,' as I hear them called,
				are spoken of with less kindness and respect by those who have grown rich upon their
				industry, than any other description of human beings whatever. I am told, sir, that
				it would be <hi>unsafe, improper</hi> , and altogether <hi>wrong</hi> were I to
				attempt making myself personally acquainted with them, as I would wish to do — and
				having accidentally, Mr. Bell, heard your <pb n="200"/> name mentioned as a person
				who took an interest in their concerns, I have come to you thus unceremoniously, in
				the hope that you would have the kindness to give me more accurate information on
				the subject, than I have found it possible to obtain elsewhere." </p>
<p>Mr. Bell, who had placed himself immediately opposite to her, looked in her young
				face, and listened to her earnest voice as she spoke, with the deepest attention. It
				soon became sufficiently clear that he considered not this intrusion as requiring
				apology, but that on the contrary his very heart and soul were moved by her words.
				He paused for a moment after she had ceased speaking, as if unwilling to interrupt
				her by his reply; but when he found that she remained silent, he said,</p>
<p>"The subject on which you are come to converse with me, my dear Miss Brotherton, is
				assuredly the very last I should have expected to hear named by a young lady in your
				position — for it is one from which the rich and great of our district turn away
				with loathing and contempt. Yet is it the one of all others to which I would if
				possible direct their best attention, involving as it does both their interest and
				their duty beyond any other. But I fear I cannot enter upon it without wounding many
				prejudices which of necessity you must have imbibed, and proving to you that much
				which doubtless you have been educated to consider right, is on the contrary most
				lamentably wrong. Can you bear this my dear young lady?"</p>
<p>"I hope I could, in a search after truth, Mr. Bell, even if my mind were in the
				condition you suppose," replied Mary. "But this is not the case. You will not have
				to remove many false impressions I think. — It is the total absence of all knowledge
				on the subject, which I am bold enough to ask you to remedy."</p>
<p>"And most willingly will I endeavour to do so, to the very best of my ability,"
				replied Mr. Bell. — "But to me it is a beguiling subject, and if I detain you too
				long, you must tell me so."</p>
<p>"Fear not," replied Mary, smiling. "I shall be more willing to hear, than you to
				speak."</p>
<p>"You are of course aware, Miss Brotherton," resumed the clergyman, "that the large
				proportion of young labourers to whom you have just alluded, are calculated to
				amount, in Yorkshire and Lancashire alone to upwards of two hundred thousand."</p>
<p>"Is it possible?" exclaimed Mary. "Alas! Mr. Bell you must not think that ' <hi>of
					course</hi> ' I know any thing — had you named two thousand as the number, my
				surprise would have been less."</p>
<p>"But so it is, Miss Brotherton. Above two hundred thousand young creatures, including
				infants among them, counting only five years of life, are thus employed in the
				counties I have named; and they surely form a class, which both from their numbers,
				and their helplessness are entitled to English sympathy and protection?"</p>
<p> "Unquestionably!" cried Mary, eagerly, "I always feel that the labouring poor have
				great and unceasing claims upon the sympathy and assistance of the rich. — But this
				claim must be equally great I <pb n="201"/> should suppose amongst all the labouring
				classes. Is it not, Mr. Bell?" </p>
<p>"I feel it difficult to answer your question by a negative," he replied, "because,
				taken in its broadest sense, it most assuredly demands an affirmative. Nevertheless
				it is unquestionably true that at this moment there is no race of human beings in
				any portion of the known world — the most wretched of negro slaves not excepted,
				Miss Brotherton — who require the protection and assistance of their happier
				fellow-creatures, in the same degree as the young creatures employed in our
				factories."</p>
<p>Miss Brotherton looked at him, not doubtingly, but with considerable surprise, and
				timidly replied, "But the negro slave, Mr. Bell, has no choice left him — he is the
					<hi>property</hi> of his master."</p>
<p> "Neither has the factory child a choice, Miss Brotherton. He too is a
					<hi>property</hi> ; nor is it the least horrible part of the evil which
				noiselessly has grown out of this tremendous system, that the beings whom nature has
				ordained throughout creation to keep watch and ward over the helpless weakness of
				infant life, are driven by it to struggle with, and trample down the holiest and
				dearest of human ties — even the love of a parent for its offspring. Picture to
				yourself a bleak winter's morning, Miss Brotherton, when the mother of factory
				children must be up hours and hours before the sun to rouse her half-rested little
				ones; and nervously watching her rude clock till the dreaded moment comes, must
				shake the little creatures, whose slumber the very beast of the field might teach
				her to watch over and guard, till they awake, and starting in terror from their
				short sleep, ask if the hour be come? The wretched mother, and the wretched child
				then vie with each other in their trembling haste to seize the tattered
				mill-clothes, and to put them on. The mother dreads the fine of one quarter of the
				infant's daily wages, which would be levied, should it arrive but a minute too late,
				and the poor child dreads the strap, which, in addition, is as surely the punishment
				for delay. Miss Brotherton, I have seen with my own eyes the assembling of some
				hundreds of factory children before the still unopened doors of their prison-house,
				while the lingering darkness of a winter's night had yet to last three hours. I
				shall never forget one bitter morning, last January twelvemonth! The last piteous
				summons from a dying parishioner had left me no choice but to exchange my pillow for
				the bitter biting blast of Howley-common, and the path across it leading me within a
				hundred yards of a large cotton-factory, I witnessed a spectacle, which to my dying
				day I shall never recall without a shudder! There was just moon enough to show me
				all the dreary sternness of the scene. — The ground was covered deep with snow, and
				a cutting wind blew whistling through the long line of old Scotch firs which
				bordered an enclosure beside the road. As I scudded on beneath them, my eye caught
				the little figures of a multitude of children, made distinctly visible, even by that
				dim light, by the strong relief in which their dark garments showed themselves
				against the snow. A few steps further brought me in full view of the factory gates,
				and then I perceived considerably above two hundred of these miserable little
				victims <pb n="202"/> to avarice all huddled together on the ground and seemingly
				half buried in the drift that was blown against them. I stood still and gazed upon
				them — I knew full well what, and how great was the terror which had brought them
				there too soon, and in my heart of hearts I cursed the boasted manufacturing wealth
				of England, which running, in this direction at least, in a most darkened narrow
				channel, gives power, <hi>lawless and irresistible</hi> to overwhelm and crush the
				land it pretends to fructify. While still spell-bound by this appalling picture, I
				was startled by the sound of a low moaning from the other side of the road, at a
				short distance from me, and turning towards it perceived a woman bending over a
				little girl who appeared sinking to the ground. A few rapid steps brought me close
				to them, and I found on examination that the child was so benumbed and exhausted as
				to be totally incapable of pursuing her way — it was her <hi>mother</hi> who was
				urging her forward, and who even then seemed more intent upon saving a fine, than on
				the obvious sufferings of her sinking child. I know, poor wretch, that little choice
				was left her, and that the inevitable consequence of saving her from the factory,
				and leading her gently home to such shelter as her father's roof could give, would
				be to watch her perish there for want of food." </p>
<p>"Alas! alas! is it thus my wealth has been accumulated?" exclaimed Miss Brotherton,
				shuddering. "Is there no power in England, sir, righteous and strong enough to stay
				this plague?"</p>
<p>"Miss Brotherton!" returned the clergyman, "such power, and such righteousness, MUST
				be found, or this plague, as you well call it, will poison the very life blood of
				our political existence; and long ere any serious danger is likely to be dreamed of
				by our heedless rulers, the bloated wealth with which this pernicious system has
				enriched a few, will prove a source of utter destruction to the many. Never, my dear
				young lady, did the avarice of man conceive a system so horribly destructive of
				every touch of human feeling, as that by which the low-priced agony of labourine
				infants is made to eke out and supply all that is wanting to enable the giant
				engines of our factories to out-spin all the world! But you must see it, Miss
				Brotherton, you must watch it with you own eyes, you must follow the hateful
				operations of this atrocious system into the thousands of sordid and forgotten huts
				which cover its miserable victims, ere you can possibly understand its moral
				mischief. There is no strength, no power in words to paint it."</p>
<p>"Its moral mischief," said Mary, eagerly; "explain that to me, Mr. Bell, for it is
				the point I find most puzzling — why is it that these poor factory-people, because
				they labour more unremittingly, as it should seem, than all the world beside, why,
				for this reason, instead of being honoured for their industry, are they invariably
				spoken of with contempt and obliquy?"</p>
<p> "Your question, Miss Brotherton, involves by far the most terrible portion of this
				frightful commercial mystery," he replied; "but, as I have told you, nothing except
				personal investigation can enable the inquirer to arrive at the whole truth
				respecting it. Were a patient, accurate, and laborious detail of all the enormities
				committed, and all the <pb n="203"/> sufferings endured, under the factory system,
				to be presented to the public, it would be thrown aside by some, as greatly too
				tedious for examination, and by others as a statement too atrocious to merit belief.
				Yet, England MUST listen to it, and that soon, or she may mourn her negligence when
				it is too late to repair it. That marvellous machinery of which we make our boast,
				Miss Brotherton, is not more perfect in its power of drawing out the delicately
				attenuated thread which it is our glory to produce, then the system for reducing the
				human labour necessary for its production to the lowest possible price is, for
				degrading the moral nature of the helpless slaves engaged in it." </p>
<p>"That the system has such a tendency I cannot doubt, after the repeated assurances
				which have reached me, that so it is," replied Mary. "Nevertheless, I am still
				unable to comprehend why it should be so."</p>
<p> "You have only to take advantage of your residence near Ashleigh, Miss Brotherton,
				the dense population of which subsists almost wholly by factory labour, in order to
				understand, but too well, why this terrible result is inevitable. You are as yet too
				young a lady for me to expect that you should have very deeply studied the nature of
				the human mind, or made yourself fully aware how greatly the habits and character of
				all human beings depend upon education, and the circumstances in which they are
				placed. Nevertheless, if you turn your attention to the subject, you will not, young
				as you are, be long incapable of detecting the dangers which beset the hearts and
				souls of those whose unhappy destiny have made them factory labourers. The dark
				little circle in which they move from birth to death, from father to son, from
				mother to daughter, is so uniform, that almost any average individual case may
				fairly serve as a specimen of the whole class. Boys and girls, with few exceptions,
				labour indiscriminately altogether in the factories. While still almost children,
				they form connexions, and are married. Having worked in the mills, probably from
				five years old to the hour of their unweighed and thoughtless union, the boy assumes
				the duties of a husband with little more knowledge of moral or religious
				responsibility than the brute animal that labours with a thousand times less
				degradation in the fields; while the childish wife comes to her important task
				ignorant of every earthly usefulness, save what belongs to the mechanical drudgery
				in which throughout the whole of her short, sad life, she has been made to follow
				the uniform and ceaseless movements of machinery. She cannot sew, she cannot cook,
				she cannot iron, she cannot wash. Her mind is yet more untaught and undisciplined
				than her hands. She is conscious of no responsibility, she knows no law by which to
				steer her actions, or regulate her spirit, and becomes a mother as she became a
				wife, without one single thought of duty mixing itself with her increasing cares. By
				degrees, both the husband and the wife find employment in the factory less certain.
				It is for children, children, children, that the unwearied engine calls, and keenly
				does the hungry father, and the mother too, watch the growth of the little creatures
				to whom they have given birth, till the slight limbs have firmness enough to stand,
				and the delicate joints are sufficiently under the command of the frightened will to
				tie threads <pb n="204"/> together under the potent inspiration of the overlooker's
				strap. Then comes a state of deeper degradation still. The father is idle, for often
				he can get no work, and it is to the labour of his little ones that he looks for
				bread. Nature recoils from the spectacle of their unnatural o'erlaboured aspect as
				they return from their thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, hours of toil. He has not nerve
				to look upon it, and creeps to the gin-shops till they are hid in bed. The mother
				sees it all, and sternly screws her courage to the task of lifting their bruised and
				weary limbs upon their bed of straw putting into their mouths the food she has
				prepared, their weary eyes being already closed in sleep, and preparing herself to
				wake before the sun on the morrow, that with unrelenting hand she may drag them from
				their unfinished slumber, and drive them forth again to get her food. This is no
				varnished tale, Miss Brotherton, but the bare, naked, hideous truth. And can you
				wonder that beings thus reared and ripened should form a degraded class? Can you
				wonder that all others should turn from them, as from a race with whom they have
				nothing in common? If some sad accident, preceding birth, distrubs the beautiful
				process by which nature prepares the noble being she has made to be lord of all, and
				an abortive creature comes to life, curtailed of all its fair proportions, both of
				mind and body, all within reach of the hapless prodigy shudder as they mourn, and
				the best and wisest among them pray to God that its span of life be short. But
				believe me when I tell you, Miss Brotherton, that the effect which the factories of
				this district is producing upon above two hundred thousand of its population, is
				beyond all calculation more deplorable, and many a child is born amongst them whose
				destiny, if fairly weighed against that of such a one as I have described, would
				appear incomparably more terrible." </p>
<p>"Can such things be, and the rulers of the land sit idly by to witness it?" cried
				Mary shuddering.</p>
<p>"It seems as if the rulers of the land knew little, and cared less about it," replied
				Mr. Bell. "The profoundly ignorant opinion that there is some connexion between our
				national prosperity, and the enormous fortunes amassed by some score of
				North-country manufacturers has, I believe, produced much of the lamentable
				non-interference of which the disinterested few complain, who are near enough to
				look upon the frightful game. Some individual voices have been most gloriously
				raised on this tremendous theme, and if they will be steadfast and enduring, they
				must and will prevail — for human nature, with all its vices, is not framed to look
				coldly on such horrors, and permit them. But the remedial process is so slow — it is
				so difficult to arouse the attention, and awaken the feelings of busy men concerning
				things at a distance, whose connexion with all that they deem important they are too
				ignorant of, or too preoccupied to trace, that the keenest observers, and those who
				would the most deeply deprecate any remedy but a legal one, begin to fear that mercy
				will be clamoured for with very dangerous rudeness, before the parliament of England
				shall have roused up it wisdom to the task of affording it.</p>
<p> "And in what way, Mr. Bell, is it wished, or hoped, that the legislature <pb n="205"/> should step forward to cure this dreadful evil? Is it proposed to abolish the use
				of machinery?" </p>
<p>Mr. Bell smiled, and shook his head.</p>
<p>"You perhaps think," said he, "that there is a great disproportion between my strong
				sense of the vice and suffering produced by the factory system, and the measure for
				its mitigation to which I now limit almost my wishes. But it would be vain to look
				back to the time when steam engines were not, and there would indeed be little
				wisdom in addressing our lamentations to their introduction. It is not the
				acquisition of any natural power, principle, or faculty, that we should deplore; all
				such, on the contrary, should be hailed as part and parcel of our magnificent
				birthright, and each new use we learn to make of the still much-unknown creation
				around us, ought to be welcomed with a shout of praise, as a fresh fulfilment of the
				supreme command 'replenish the earth and <hi>subdue</hi> it.' It is not from
				increased, or increasing science that we have any thing to dread, it is only from a
				fearfully culpable neglect of the moral power that should rule and regulate its
				uses, that it can be other than one of God's best gifts."</p>
<p>"But how," demanded Mary, "how, if machinery continues to be used, can any Act of
				Parliament prevent the necessity of employing children to wait upon its operations,
				instead of requiring the strength of men, as heretofore, to perform what the
				steam-engine does in their place?"</p>
<p>"No Act of Parliament can be conceived capable of inducing a manufacturer to employ
				the weaker, and at the same time the more costly agent, in preference to a more
				powerful and cheaper one," replied Mr. Bell. "No reasonable man would ask this, no
				reasonable man would desire it, and assuredly no reasonable man would attempt to
				enforce such an absurdity by law. No, Miss Brotherton, this mighty power, as surely
				given for our use as is the innocent air that fans the woodbine yonder, has at
				length, after some few thousand years of careless overlooking on our part, been
				revealed to us. But let us not fly in the face of benignant nature, and say like
				Caliban, "You taught me language; and my profit on't Is, I know how to curse." </p>
<p>"If used aright the recannot be a doubt that this magnificent power might, in all its
				agencies, be made the friend of man. It requires no great stretch of ingenuity to
				conceive that it might be rendered at once a source of still increasing wealth to
				the capitalist, and of lightened labour to the not-impoverished operative. But that,
				as things are at present, this great discovery, and all the admirable ingenuity with
				which it is applied, acts as a ban instead of a blessing, upon some hundred
				thousands of miserable victims is most true, while all the benefit that can be shown
				as a balance to this horror, is the bloated wealth of a small knot of
				master-manufacturers. But so monstrous is this evil, that its very atrocity inspires
				hope, from the improbability that when once beyond all reach of contradiction its
				existence shall be known by all men, it should be permitted to continue."</p>
<pb n="206"/>
<p>"Then why is it not known?" demanded Mary, her colour heightened as she remembered
				her own entire ignorance upon the subject a few short weeks before, "surely it is
				the duty of all lookers-on to proclaim it to the whole world."</p>
<p>"Alas! Miss Brotherton! It is more easy to raise a voice, than to command attention
				to it. Loud and long must be the cry that shall awaken the indifferent, and rouse
				the indolent to action. But this loud, long cry, will be uttered, and by the
				blessing of God it will be listened to at last."</p>
<p>"But tell me Mr. Bell," resumed his deeply interested auditor, "what is this moderate
				enactment in mitigation of these wretched people's sufferings, which you say would
				content you?"</p>
<p>"All that we ask for," replied Mr. Bell, "all that the poor creatures ask for
				themselves, is that by Act of Parliament it should be rendered illegal for men women
				and children to be kept to the wearying unhealthy labour of the mills for more than
				ten hours out of every day, leaving their daily wages at the same rate as now."</p>
<p>"And would <hi>that</hi> suffice," demanded Miss Brotherton with astonishment, "to
				effectually relieve the horrors you have been describing to me?"</p>
<p> "Miss Brotherton it would," replied the clergyman. "I would be loath to weary you
				with details," he continued, "but a few items may suffice to make you see how
				enormous are the benefits which would follow such an enactment. At present, if a
				large demand for manufactured goods arises, instead of being, as it ought, a
				blessing to the industrious hands that must supply it, it comes upon them as a
				fearful burden, threatening to crush the very springs of life in the little
				creatures that are chiefly to sustain it, while the golden harvest that it brings is
				not for them, but for their masters. For the miserable meed of an extra penny, or
				sometimes three-halfpence a day, the young slaves (who, observe, have no power of
				choice, for if they, or their parents for them, refuse, they are instantly turned
				off to literal starvation — no parish assistance being allowed to those who resist
				the regulations of the manufacturers), for this wretched equivalent for health and
				joy, are compelled, whenever our boasted trade flows briskly, to stand to their work
				for just as many hours as the application of the overlooker's strap, or
				billy-roller, can keep them on their legs. Innumerable instances are on record of
				children falling from excess of weariness on the machinery, and being called to life
				by its lacerating their flesh. It continually happens that young creatures under
				fifteen years of age, are kept form their beds all night. Fifteen, sixteen,
				seventeen, hours of labour out of twenty-four, are cases which recur continually,
				and I need not say with what effect upon these victims of ferocious avarice. Now not
				only would all this be mended, the positive bodily torture spared, and as far as is
				consistent with constant in-door occupation, the health of the labourers preserved,
				were it made unlawful to keep them at positive labour for more than ten hours of
				every day; not only would all this follow from the enactment, but innumerable other
				advantages, some of them more important still, would, <pb n="207"/> beyond all
				question,be its consequence. In the first place, were there no power of executing
				great and sudden orders by irregular exactions of labour, the recurrence of those
				fearful intervals when the starving operatives are thrown out of employ by the
				accidents which cause a deficiency in the demand, would not happen — for in that
				case the capitalists would find themselves obliged to be beforehand with the demand,
				even though some portion of their enormous wealth should for a time lie idle. From
				this would also follow the necessity of often employing adult hands, where now the
				cheaper labour of children, forced from their very vitals through the day and night,
				may be had for the sin of demanding it. Then would the unnatural spectacle of a
				stalwart father idly waiting to snatch the wages from the little feverish hand of
				his o'er-laboured child be seen no more. Then would there be strength and spirits
				left in the young to profit by the Sunday-schools now so often ostentatiously opened
				in vain, because the only way in which a little piecer can keep holiday is by lying
				throughout the day stretched upon his straw in heavy sleep. Then too, the
				demoralizing process by which the heart of a mother is rendered hard as the nether
				mill-stone, by the necessity of goading her infants to their frightful toil, would
				cease. Boys and girls would no longer have to return to their homes at midnight —
				there would be time and inclination then, for those comfortable operations of the
				needle and the shears, which 'Make old clothes look amaist as weel as new.' Then
				would not the disheartened ministers of God's church strive in vain to make the
				reckless, joyless, worthless race listen to his words of faith and hope. Then, Miss
				Brotherton, they would arise from that state of outcast degradation which has caused
				your friends to tell you that it would be 'unsafe, improper, and altogether wrong,'
				for you, and such as you, to make personal acquaintance with them." </p>
<p>"And do you really think all this mighty, this glorious good, would follow from an
				enactment so moderate, so reasonable, so every way unobjectionable?"</p>
<p>"I have not the slightest shadow of a doubt, Miss Brotherton, that such good would
				follow it, and more, much more, than I have named — more than any one could believe
				or comprehend, who has not, like myself, been watching for years the misery, the
				vice, the degradation, which have resulted from the want of it."</p>
<p>"Then why, Mr. Bell, have not such representations been made to the legislature as
				must ensure its immediate adoption?"</p>
<p> The good clergyman shook his head. "It is a most natural, question, my dear young
				friend — allow me so to call you. All are my friends who feel upon this subject as
				you appear to do. It is a most natural and a most obvious question. Yet would my
				reply be any thing rather than easy of comprehension were I to attempt to answer it
				directly. I sincerely hope I shall converse with you again on this subject.
				Documents are not wanting, my dear Miss Brotherton, to prove that all, or nearly
				all, that private individuals can do, in the way of petition and remonstrance, has
				been already tried; nor are we yet without hope that good may come of it. But it
				must be long, and perhaps the longer the better, ere <pb n="208"/> your young head
				and innocent heart, can conceive our difficulties. You would hardly believe the
				ingenious devices to which frightened avarice can have recourse in order to retard,
				mutilate, and render abortive a measure having for its object a reduction of
				profits, with no equivalent save the beholding smiles instead of tears, and hearing
				the sounds of song and laughter instead of groans!" </p>
<p>"But while you are still waiting and hoping for this aid from our lawgivers," said
				Mary, "is there nothing that can be done in the interval to help all this misery,
				Mr. Bell?"</p>
<p>"Nothing effectual, my dear young lady," he replied mournfully. "I may, with no
				dishonest boasting say, that my life is spent in doing all I can to save these
				unhappy people from utter degradation and despair. But the oppression under which
				they groan is too overwhelming to be removed, or even lightened, by any agency less
				powerful than that of the law. Nothing, in fact, can so clearly show the powerful
				oppression of the system as the total inefficiency of individual benevolence to heal
				the misery of those who suffer under it. Its power is stupendous, awful, terrible!
				Nature herself, elsewhere so omnipotent, here feels the strength of unchecked human
				wickedness, and seems to bend before it. For most certain is it, that in less than
				half a century, during which the present factory system has been in operation, the
				lineaments of the race involved in its are changed and deteriorated. The
				manufacturing population are of lesser and of weaker growth than their agricultural
				countrymen. The development of the intellectual faculties is obviously becoming
				weaker, and many whom we have every reason to believe understand the physiology of
				man as thoroughly as science can teach it to them, do not scruple to assert, that if
				the present system continues, the race of English factory operatives will dwindle
				and sink in the strongly-graduated scale of human beings, to something lower than
				the Esquimaux."</p>
<p>"Gracious Heaven!" cried Mary, clasping her hands with an emotion that almost
				amounted to agony, "and all these horrors are perpetrated for the sake of making
				rich, needlessly, uselessly rich, a few obscure manufacturing families like my own!
				This is very dreadful sir," she continued, while tears burst from her eyes. "I have
				gained knowledge but not peace by my visit, and I must leave you with the sad
				conviction that the hope I had nourished of making my fortune useful to the
				suffering creatures among whom I live, is vain and idle."</p>
<p> Mr. Bell listened to this melancholy assertion, and sighed because he could not
				contradict it. "Yes;" said he, at length, "it is even so; and if any proof were
				wanted of the depth and hopelessness of the wretchedness which the present system
				produces, it might be found in the fact, that despite the inclination I feel both
				for your sake, and that of the poor operatives, to encourage your generous
				benevolence, I cannot in conscience tell you that it is in your power effectually to
				assist them. That you may save your own excellent heart from the palsy of hopeless
				and helpless pity, by the indulgence of your benevolence in individual cases of
				distress, I need not point out to you; but that any <pb n="209"/> of the ordinary
				modes of being useful on a larger scale, such as organising schools, founding
				benefit societies, or the like, could be of any use to beings so crushed, so
				toil-worn, and so degraded, it would be idle to hope." </p>
<p>Miss Brotherton now rose to depart — but as she extended her hand, and began to utter
				her farewell, it occurred to her that it was possible her new friend might, by
				conjecture at least throw some light upon the destination of little Michael, and
				avoiding as much as possible the making any direct charge against her rich
				neighbour, she briefly narrated the facts of Michael's adoption, dismissal, and
				unknown destination, with little commentary on either, but concluded by saying,</p>
<p>"The mother of the child is in great anxiety about him, an though I cannot conceive
				it possible any harm can have befallen the boy, I am in some sort a fellow-sufferer
				with her in the anxiety which this mystery occasions, from having almost pledged
				myself to learn the place of his destination. Can you, dear sir, suggest to me any
				means by which this information can be obtained?"</p>
<p>"Some part of this history has reached us already," replied Mr. Bell. "It has been
				somewhat industriously bruited through the neighbourhood, that Sir Matthew Dowling,
				notoriously one of the most tyrannical millocrats in the whole district, has been
				moved to kindness in behalf of some poor widow's son, and taken him to be reared and
				educated with his own children — I trust I am excusable, knowing what I know, for
				misdoubting the disinterested benevolence of any act of Sir Matthew Dowling's.
				Nevertheless it is certainly not easy to perceive why, after having so
				ostentatiously distinguished the boy, he should kidnap him, as it were, from his own
				house, in order to get rid of him. If, instead of being the object of especial
				favour, the little fellow had fallen under the rich knight's displeasure, Miss
				Brotherton, I should think it by no means improbable that he might have consigned
				him as an apprentice to some establishment, too notorious for its severity to make
				it desirable that his selection of it should be made known. But of this there seems
				neither proof nor likelihood."</p>
<p>Miss Brotherton turned pale as she listened to this suggestion. "Nay, but there is
				both truth and likelihood in such a suspicion," she exclaimed with considerable
				emotion, and after a moment's consideration, added, "I know no reason why I should
				conceal the cause I have for saying so — if you know not all, how can you give me
				counsel?"</p>
<p>Hurriedly, and as briefly as possible, Miss Brotherton then recounted the scene she
				had witnessed in the green-room of the Dowlinglodge theatricals, but there was an
				unconscious and involuntary fervour in her manner of narrating it, which rendered it
				impossible to listen with indifference, or not to feel at the recital some portion
				of the indignation she had felt when it occurred.</p>
<p> "It must be looked to, Miss Brotherton," replied her warm-hearted new acquaintance.
				"The boy must be traced, tracked, found, and rescued. I think there are few of these
				wretched prison-houses of whose existence I am ignorant, and it is probable I may be
				able to help you in this. Should I obtain any hint likely to be useful in the <pb n="210"/> search, I will call upon you, if you will give me leave, to
				communicate it." </p>
<p>Most earnestly and truly did the heiress assure him that it was impossible she could
				receive a visit more calculated to give her pleasure, adding that whether the hint
				were obtained or not, she trusted the acquaintance she had so unceremoniously began,
				would not drop here and that by returning her visit, he would prove to her that he
				was not displeased by it.</p>
<p>It rarely happens between right-hearted people who meet for the first time, if one of
				the parties conceives a liking for the other, that it fails to prove mutual; and it
				was with a cordial sincerity, as genuine as her own, that Mr. Bell expressed his
				hope that their acquaintance would ripen into friendship.</p>
<p>Too intently occupied by all that had passed, to remember her own arrangements, Mary
				forgot that her carriage was not at the door, and while these parting words were
				exchanged, walked forth, expecting to find it. It was Mrs. Tremlett who first
				recollected that the coachman had been ordered to put up his horses at the nearest
				inn, but this was not till they had traversed the little garden, and were already in
				the lane; for though the good nurse had been little more than <hi>personnage
					muet</hi> during the foregoing scene, she had taken a deep interest in it, and
				it was much with the air of one awaking from a dream, that she said, "My dear Miss
				Mary! you have forgot that the carriage is sent away."</p>
<p>"Indeed have I!" said Mary, laughing, "and no wonder. But there stands our faithful
				William, he will tell us in what direction we may find it."</p>
<p>"Will you not return, Miss Brotherton, while it is made ready?" said the
				clergyman.</p>
<p>"Not if you will walk on with us, dear sir. The evening is delightful, but already
				quite far enough advanced to make it prudent not to lose any time." And having given
				orders that the carriage was to follow, they strolled on towards the turnpike.</p>
<p>"There," said Mr. Bell, pointing to the towering chimneys of a large factory at some
				distance, "there, Miss Brotherton, is an establishment where, though carding and
				spinning go on within the walls, and some hundreds of children and young girls are
				employed in attending the machinery that performs the process, the voice of misery
				is never heard, for there the love of gold is chained and held captive by religion
				and humanity."</p>
<p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Mary, as she looked at the sinless monster to which he
				pointed. "It is not of necessity then, that this dangerous trade is fatal to all
				employed in it."</p>
<p> "Certainly not. Were but its labours restricted both for young and old, to ten hours
				a day, there is no reason on earth why it should not be carried on with comfort and
				advantage to every individual concerned in it, and with credit, honour, and
				prosperity to the country. But you can hardly guess what up-hill work it is, when
				one good man has got to stand alone, and breast the competition to a whole host of
					<pb n="211"/> bad ones in his commercial enterprises. The high-minded owners of
				yonder factory are losing thousands every year by their efforts to purify this
				traffic of its enormities — and some thousand small still voices call down blessings
				on them for it. But while it costs them ten shillings to produce what their
				neighbours can bring into the market for nine, they will only be pointed at as
				pitiably unwise in their generation by all the great family of Mammon which
				surrounds them. Few, alas! will think of following the example! All they can do
				therefore is in fact but to carry on a system of private charity on an enormous
				scale — but till they are supported by law, even their vast efforts, and most noble
				sacrifices can do nothing towards the general redemption of our poor northern people
				from the state of slavery into which they have fallen. And yet I do believe, Miss
				Brotherton," he continued, after a pause, "I do most truly believe that these greedy
				tyrants would fail more rarely than now they do in their efforts to realize enormous
				wealth, if the system were to undergo exactly the change we ask for. The plan of
				under-selling may indeed in some few instances enable a very lucky man to run up a
				blood-stained fortune; and blood-stained it must be, for whenever this method of
				commanding a sale is pursued, and ruin does NOT ensue, it is demonstrable that the
				bones and marrow of children, working unlimited hours, must have been the main agent
				in the operation. But it is quite certain that the underselling system must upon the
				long run be ruinous. If all the losses upon our production were fairly set against
				all the gains from the immoderate working of young hands, the slavery scheme would
				appear as little profitable as holy. But here is your carriage, my dear young lady!
				God bless you! and may we live to rejoice together over an effectual legislative
				remedy for the evils we have passed this our first interview in deploring!" </p>
<p>So saying, he extended his hand to assist her into the carriage which had already
				drawn up beside them — but Miss Brotherton stepped aside while he performed this
				office to her friend, and then laying her hand on his arm, drew him back a step or
				too to the spot from whence the factory chimneys he had pointed out to her were
				visible.</p>
<p>"Tell me, before we part," she said, "the names of those to whom that building
				belongs?"</p>
<p>" Wood and Walker ," replied the clergyman.</p>
<p>"Thank you!" she replied; "I shall never hear those names without breathing a
				blessing on them!"</p>
<p>Friendly farewells were once more exchanged, and the meditative heiress was driven
				back to Millford-park in silence so profound, that her old friend believed her to be
				asleep, and carefully abstained from any movement that might awaken her. But Mary
				Brotherton was not asleep.</p>
