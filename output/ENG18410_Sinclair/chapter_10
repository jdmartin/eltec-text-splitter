<head>  CHAPTER X.</head>
<p>Years having thus rolled on, bringing joy to some, and laying sorrow more or less on all,
     Marion Dunbar, fresh in the spring-tide of youthful bloom, had nearly completed her seventeenth
     year, and was hurrying on still in a whirlpool of education at Mrs. Penfold's, exerting herself
     more zealously for the credit of her teachers than she ever would have done for her own.</p>
<p>One evening about this time a message reached Marion, desiring that she would instantly
     hasten to Mrs. Penfold's private sitting-room, which was, on all extraordinary occasions, that
     lady's hall of audience, and a solemn summons to which was usually of ominous import. Marion,
     however, conscious that her own recent diligence had been quite pre-eminent, and her success
     most distinguished, heard the word of command with a flutter of pleasing anticipation, for to
     her the future was always full of hope. Too old now for medals and ribbons, she yet indulged in
     the gay recollection of her former triumphs, and remembered with a smile, as she hurried up
     stairs, how often Sir Arthur had formerly declared, while pretending to frown upon her, that
     "he hated to see girls flouncing about with medals, and defying the world!" yet how silly, when
     she one day entered his drawing-room, with deepening color and a look of modest consciousness,
     half concealing and half displaying her honors, he had advanced to meet her, wearing his own
     Grand Cross of the Bath, to prove, as he said, that he was indeed fit company for so
     meritorious a young lady.</p>
<p>Humming a favorite air, with a buoyant, joyful step, and radiant smile, Marion hastened to
     the door of Mrs. Penfold's apartment, where, after trying to compose her features into a
     suitable expression of sober respect, with dimpling cheek, and still almost laughing eyes, she
     entered, making, as she had been taught, the usual respectful courtesy exacted by Mrs. Penfold,
     such as might have been suitable for an introduction at Court, or for a public performer
     receiving the plaudits of a numerous audience, and then, with a bright, speaking look, full of
     hope and vivacity, she paused, to ascertain the object of her unexpected summons.</p>
<p>To Marion's astonishment and dismay, Mrs. Penfold was pacing about the room, evidently in a
     state of furious irritation; while in her hand she carried that endless bill, the growth of
     many years, for board, education, masters, and sundries, which had so often already greeted the
     unwilling eyes of her young pupil, whose whole inward spirit recoiled with shame and
     apprehension, while she silently measured the length and breadth of its contents, every item of
     which she already knew by heart, and could almost have recapitulated without a prompter.</p>
<p>Had Marion herself been a ruined gamester or a spendthrift, she could scarcely have felt more
     guilty and ashamed than now; but after standing an entire minute without being observed, and
     perceiving Mrs. Penfold unable to speak, from the effort it cost to restrain her anger within
     decent bounds, Marion, with the frankness natural to her candid disposition, came at once to
     the point, saying, with heightened color, and scarcely articulate voice, while her beautiful
     deep intelligent eyes were fixed with an earnest gaze on Mrs. Penfold.</p>
<p>"I fear no satisfactory answer has come this term from my brother?"</p>
<p>"No! nor there never will be!" thundered Mrs. Penfold, in a voice that made the gentle Marion
     absolutely cower before her. "There, Miss Dunbar! look at that bill!" added she, flinging it
     furiously into the lap of Marion, who had sunk upon a seat. "How much will a shilling in the
     pound be for that? Four hundred guineas absolutely lost—wasted—squandered upon you!"</p>
<p>Unable to speak from consternation, though such scenes were already but too familiar to her
     memory, Marion fixed her eyes on the unwelcome bill, apparently examining its contents, while
     her thoughts were in the mean time painfully occupied in devising what would be right for her
     to say or do in this unexpected crisis. A long pause ensued, during which Mrs. Penfold seemed
     resolute not to speak; therefore Marion, with a strenuous effort, endeavored to new-string her
     nerves, and say something, while the large heavy tears forced themselves into her eyes.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Penfold," replied she earnestly, "you know how ready I would be to send my brother
     another letter of remonstrance, if that could be of any avail, but now he never so much as
     answers me. I seem indeed to be quite forgotten by both Patrick and Agnes!"</p>
<p>Marion paused to recover her voice, and to choke back her tears, after which she continued in
     a firmer tone, while Mrs. Penfold listened, with a dry, harsh, unmoved expression of
     countenance.</p>
<p>"You are justly dissatisfied about my brother's payment, but if there be the least cause to
     doubt your being ultimately remunerated, send me immediately home. I dare not go of myself, but
     you have power to dismiss me, and let it be done. The sorrow and mortification must all be
     mine, but whatever falls on myself alone, I shall always be able to bear."</p>
<p>"Miss Dunbar! you have anticipated exactly what I am obliged to do, and what it would have
     been well for me if I had done sooner!" replied Mrs. Penfold, angrily flouncing into a chair,
     and pirouetting it almost round, so as to look Marion full in the face. "I am sorry for you
     certainly, because, though your music is not yet exactly such as to do me much credit, and your
     Italian is sometimes far from grammatical, yet on the whole there cannot be a better-disposed
     girl, nor one who has testified a more constant desire to please me."</p>
<p>Marion's heart was melted by even this very slight expression of regard, and nothing could
     exceed the troubled beauty of her eyes, when she raised them gratefully to Mrs. Penfold, but
     conscious that her presence was not exactly the place for a scene, as that lady had long been
     considered incapable of a tear or a smile, she averted her face, and struggled for
     composure.</p>
<p>"I have learned for the first time to-day." resumed Mrs. Penfold, her voice becoming more
     stern as she proceeded, "that before your father's death, Sir Patrick twice, in the most
     profligate manner, paid off his creditors with a shilling in the pound! In consequence of great
     losses now at the Doncaster races, and having paid what he calls his debts of honor to a
     ruinous amount, Sir Patrick has yesterday fled to the sanctuary at Holyrood House for refuge,
     and the creditors have already seized everything. No wonder indeed! it was full time! He is all
     promise and no performance,—for ever feeding us with empty spoons!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Penfold angrily changed her position, and with another indignant glance at Marion,
     continued,</p>
<p>"Even Sir Patrick's large rent-roll would scarcely suffice in a life-time to pay the half of
     us off. Good worthy Sir Arthur too, his own uncle, he has cheated, and the property being
     entailed, we have only Sir Patrick's life to depend upon for what he owes us! This is a very
     heavy blow to me, and extremely hard to bear!"</p>
<p>While thus bemoaning herself. Mrs. Penfold forgot, like most selfish people, that any one had
     to suffer besides, though the parted lips, the tearful eyes, and the pallid cheek of Marion
     testified in a language not to be mistaken, the depth and intensity of her grief, while with
     astonishment and dismay, she heard this short summary of Sir Patrick's history and
     circumstances.</p>
<p>Long after Mrs. Penfold had ceased to speak, Marion gazed in her face, as if expecting more,
     while her every nerve continued quivering with agitation, till at length she closed her eyes in
     speechless agony, bewildered by the sudden transition from joyful anticipation to blank
     despair. Formerly she had heard of difficulties and bankruptcies, as she had heard of the
     plague or the bow-string at Constantinople—things dreadful to those who might be affected by
     them, but quite foreign to herself, and now, like a clap of thunder, all had suddenly burst
     over the heads of those who were nearest and dearest to her, with apparently destructive
     effect. She yet felt as if the whole were some hideous dream from which it might be possible to
     awaken,—the voice of Mrs. Penfold rang painfully on her ears,—every surrounding object faded
     from her vision,—her thoughts became confused,—a vague sense of burning misery was at her
     heart,—and one only wish remained distinctly prominent on her mind—the wish to be alone.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Miss Dunbar," continued Mrs. Penfold, in a monotonous complaining voice, "no wonder
     you are shocked that I who have labored so hard to realize a small independence, should be
     swindled out of it in this way by your brother. Lady Towercliffe tells me that among his
     intimate friends he is known by the nick-name of "Sixpenny Dunbar!" on account of his having so
     often already played a similar game, but once catch him beyond the bounds of Holyrood now, and
     he'll never be at liberty to try such manœuvres again. We are to offer a reward of £500 for his
     apprehension!"</p>
<p>"My poor uncle and Agnes!" exclaimed Marion, in a voice of anguish, while hot tears fell like
     rain over her cheek, and a confused apprehension of ruin, bankruptcy, and disgrace hovered
     darkly through her mind, though she scarcely yet knew what to think or to fear. "I must go
     home, if I yet have a home! Wherever they are, let me find them! I must see my uncle.—Patrick
     cannot be all you say! oh no! It is some dreadful mistake! Whatever happens, I trust and hope,
     Mrs. Penfold, you will be repaid. It shall be my first earthly wish—my duty sooner or later, to
     see it done! Now let me go instantly home!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Penfold most heartily seconded her pupil's desire to depart, while one of the heaviest
     pangs which Marion had to endure on this occasion, sprang from the stern angry coldness with
     which her <hi xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</hi> preceptress appeared about to bid her a last
     farewell.</p>
<p>A tumult of gossiping wonder and curiosity arose among the pupils, when it became whispered
     that Marion was to "leave" on an hour's notice. Many questions were asked, much astonishment
     was expressed, and even a great deal of real sympathy excited, but Marion shrank from the
     clamorous exclamations of her young companions, who could not so much as guess the measure and
     depth of her misfortunes. Often had she shared their sorrows, and willingly would she have
     accepted any consolation they could offer, but the worst of her trials could not be spoken to
     mortal ears, and in lamenting for her brother's disgrace, she could only bear her wound, like a
     stricken deer, into solitude and silence.</p>
<p>There are insects that live a life-time in an hour, and it seemed to Marion as if she had
     really done so, since the time when sparkling with gladness, she flew to Mrs. Penfold's
     presence. Now, heavy with sorrow and anxiety, she slowly retraced her steps, and on reaching
     her room, sank upon her bed in a paroxysm of tears, delivering herself up to many painful
     thoughts, or rather to her feelings, for she could not think amidst the tumult of an agitated
     mind, when suffering thus under the most painful of all transitions, from hope to despair.</p>
<p>It was during the unoccupied half-hour after dinner, when Mrs. Penfold allowed her pupils a
     gasp of rest from their labors during the day, that they gathered in groups at every window, to
     criticise a hackney-coach and very tired broken-down looking horses in waiting, while the
     pupils all watched for Marion's departure, anxious to catch a last glimpse of their favorite
     companion. She had been shut up alone, ever since her interview with Mrs. Penfold, and tried to
     occupy herself in packing up her few possessions, while endeavoring to compose her mind, both
     of which tasks occupied more time than she wished or expected. But all now over, and trying to
     assume an aspect of serenity, with pale cheeks and swollen eyes, she entered the school-room,
     carrying in her hand a large and very heavy-looking casket.</p>
<p>The young community crowded round to say a thousand affectionate farewells, when, for a
     moment, Marion looked at them all with her own beautiful smile, but unable to control her
     emotion, she turned away her head, and burst into an agony of tears.</p>
<p>"Miss Dunbar, my dear! the sooner this is all over the better!" said Mrs. Penfold, hastily
     advancing, with a look of irritable vexation. "No wonder you are sorrow to leave us; but what
     can't be cured must be endured. Remember to be diligent in practising your music, as the
     success of my establishment depends on the conduct of all my young ladies. The only recompense
     I am ever likely to receive for my care, will proceed from your attention not to do me any
     discredit. Now, farewell, my dear, and try bear up the best way you can!"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Penfold!" faltered Marion, while a flash of bright intelligence lighted up her eyes;
     "allow me, for a single moment, to see you alone!"</p>
<p>"No! no! my dear! I hate scenes; therefore let us now take leave. I wish you well!" added
     Mrs. Penfold, in a tone that sounded marvellously sincere. "I really do! Whatever has happened
     is your misfortune, not your fault!"</p>
<p>"One single word, if you please," whispered Marion, coloring the deepest carnation, and
     leading the way to an inner room, while Mrs. Penfold followed, with an air of royal
     condescension. "The fault is indeed, as you kindly remark, not my own; but for my sake, Mrs.
     Penfold, spare my brother's name in all you say. It gives me pleasure to think that I can do
     something towards settling our account myself, and I would think no sacrifice worth a thought,
     that enabled me to do so. My mother's trinkets were divided between Agnes and me; besides which
     my dear kind uncle has been lavish in his gifts. This gold repeater cost a great sum, and that
     locket is set in diamonds."</p>
<p>"Well, my dear!" interrupted Mrs. Penfold, relaxing into a look of graciousness, "such
     honorable sentiments show that you have not been under my care in vain; and though these pretty
     trifles are not equivalent to what you owe, yet half a loaf is better than no bread!"</p>
<p>"All that I ever possessed, the gifts or legacies of friends and relations, I leave in pledge
     with you, Mrs. Penfold, as an assurance, that if brighter days ever come, I would redeem them
     at twenty times their value. Keep these till then. Whatever ornaments I might ever wear, would
     be a reproach till you are paid. Some debts never can be sufficiently discharged, and among
     these is what I owe to your care during many past years."</p>
<p>The bright eyes of Marion were dimmed with tears of sincerity and emotion when she concluded;
     and, placing the casket in Mrs. Penfold's astonished hands, she hastened out of the room.
     Giving a last, long look at those inanimate objects to which she had been accustomed, and
     feeling that even to these she could not without regret bid a final adieu, Marion threw herself
     into the carriage, and drove off, so overpowered with anguish and anxiety respecting her
     brother, that she scarcely noticed the phalanx of white pocket handkerchiefs, waved to her as a
     last farewell from those beloved companions, among whom so large a share of her young
     affections had hitherto been lavished; and thus she took a final farewell of Mrs. Penfold's
     finishing seminary for young ladies, where she was never destined to be finished!</p>
