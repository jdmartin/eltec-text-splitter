<head>  CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<p>Marion found it more and more difficult every day, to account for the bitter, angry contempt
     with which Agnes spoke of Clara Granville, her dislike to whom never seemed for an hour to lie
     dormant, as she was perpetually making allusions to her, which caused very frequent irritation
     between herself and Sir Patrick, who sometimes angrily left the room, and yet occasionally
     joined in her invectives against the whole Granville family, in a tone of reckless, angry
     derision, which was to Marion completely perplexing and unaccountable. If Agnes felt dull or
     out of spirits, she complained of being excessively Granville-ish; or if Sir Patrick were
     observed for a wonder, in any single instance, to economise, she called him a Granville-ist;
     but if her brother either laughed, or flung himself out of the room, according to the humor he
     was in, it was in a fit of Granville-ism; and Marion became surprised to perceive that the
     mention of that name was never, even by chance, like that of any other name, a subject of
     indifference; and conscious that some secret was connected with it, not imparted to her, she
     carefully avoided all allusion to Clara.</p>
<p>Agnes one day jestingly announced to Sir Patrick that the Granvilles had taken out perpetual
     tickets at the Charitable Soup Kitchen, and meant to dine there every day on broth; and the
     next morning she rather inconsistently found fault with them, because at least twenty poor
     people assembled at their lodgings every day, to be fed, as if it were a House of Refuge.</p>
<p>Marion observed that all the innumerable books for charitable subscriptions, which were
     circulated from door to door, Agnes liked to examine, for the gossiping amusement of
     ascertaining how much was given by each or her friends, though never for the purpose of adding
     her own name, as her purse was a complete valetudinarian, always complaining of exhaustion, yet
     always capable of any exertion dictated by inclination; and Sir Patrick also, though he
     generally swore an impatient oath or two, when he saw the succession of dingy looking books
     brought into the drawing-room, sometimes amused himself with a supercilious glance at the
     contents.</p>
<p>Whenever the object was judicious, the Reverend Richard Granville's name, and that of his
     sister, appeared for a small sum, such as they might be able to afford; and Marion felt
     convinced there was much single-hearted goodness, and courageous disregard of mere appearances,
     when beneath the pompous £5 5s., of Lady Towercliffe, she saw the modest unobtrusive ten
     shillings, or half-a-crown of Miss Granville. It was probably all Clara could give, and she did
     not feel ashamed to proclaim the very small amount, though Agnes, like most persons who are
     mean themselves, in respect to giving, was splendid in her notions for others, and exclaimed
     outrageously against the absurdity of bestowing a paltry trifle at all.</p>
<p>"Five shillings to the Infirmary! did ever anybody hear such nonsense! as if an Infirmary
     could be supported on five shillings! It is so like Clara Granville's trumpery ideas! I daresay
     she thought the fortune of the institution made by such a donation! It will scarcely buy a
     packet of James' powders for one of the invalids!"</p>
<p>"But when Clara spares five shillings, are we to give nothing!" asked Marion, seeing Sir
     Patrick's pompous butler, as usual, carrying away the book untouched.</p>
<p>"Better give nothing than make ourselves ridiculous, like the Granvilles. Nobody will guess
     that this book was brought here! I wish Clara had given her superfluous money towards the
     better equipment of their own one solitary man-servant,—the merest attempt at a footman I ever
     beheld, with such a lodging-house look! Like the waiter from some second-rate inn! Did you ever
     see anything so ugly, and out of taste, as that little yellow cottage of the Granvilles',
     standing close to the old palace, like a kippered salmon nailed to the wall!"</p>
<p>An angry flush burned upon the cheek of Sir Patrick, who did not trust his temper with a
     reply to Agnes' tirade; and Marion hastily withdrew her eyes from his countenance, on
     perceiving that he had bit his lip till the blood seemed ready to spring, while his eyes
     flashed fire. In a moment afterwards, he whistled half a tune, threw open the window, and
     finally hurried out of the room, while Agnes looked mysteriously at Marion, and said nothing,
     though the expression of her eye plainly told that something was wrong.</p>
<p>Sir Patrick never entered a church; but Sunday being a day of impunity, when he might go to
     his club, and become a gentleman-at-large, without the possibility of being arrested, he
     invited a weekly supper party to meet him at Douglass' Hotel, every Saturday night, punctually
     at twelve o'clock, which held together till so late an hour on Sunday mornings, that once
     having carried a candle to the door, when letting out Captain De Crespigny, the day-light
     flashed in upon them, and they saw the congregations passing along every street to church.</p>
<p>Sir Patrick's life had now become one continual subterfuge. '<hi xml:lang="fr">Il jurait
      bien, mais il payait mal</hi>;' and he was heard frequently to declare, that he could not but
     fancy it might be, to an old experienced fox, a great amusement, when he afforded a good day's
     hunting to sportsmen, from the strange delight he felt himself in baffling duns and teasing
     bailiffs. He cared for nothing, not even for his debts and creditors, but over-reached
     everybody, paid nobody, and treated all mankind in different styles of insolence; but his
     favorite diversion was, nearly to out-stay the hour of twelve on Sunday night, knowing that his
     ill-treated creditors had offered a reward of £500 for his capture, and that the whole way
     along the High Street, emissaries were ambuscaded, in the eager hope that some fortunate night
     the clock might strike Monday morning before he was safely sheltered within the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Once Sir Patrick had indeed lingered several minutes too late; and when he approached the
     ditch, forming a line of demarcation between the debtor's refuge and the world in general, a
     rope was drawn completely across the street, while two men like constables, in large loose
     duffle coats, and hats slouched over their faces, had taken their station, each holding it
     resolutely at opposite ends, in the certain expectation of entrapping him, though the courage
     of both seemed for a moment to waver, when they saw the tall, well-knit, and
     finely-proportioned figure of Sir Patrick, as he strode onwards, with his usual military
     bearing and commanding aspect. After exchanging a look, however, they tightened the rope, and
     were about, with a rapid manœuvre, to coil it round him, when Sir Patrick, seeing their
     intention, rushed forward on the nearest, and levelled him to the ground with a single blow,
     saying, "You dastardly rascals! do you suppose that a dozen such fellows could be a match for
     any gentleman!"</p>
<p>"I'm a better gen'lemen than you, Sir!" said the other, in an insolent blustering tone.
     "Every guinea in your pocket, Sir, there's ten men in the world have a better right to than you
     have! I think a gen'leman born means a gen'leman as pays his debts!"</p>
<p>"Then here is what I owe to you!" replied Sir Patrick, flinging him almost across the street,
     with a violent blow on the head. "Only dare to stand in my way again, and every joint or bone
     in that miserable carcass of yours shall be fit for the surgeons. I intend to keep this rope
     till the day you are hanged!"</p>
<p>Agnes made her Sundays literally a day of rest, by remaining most of the morning in bed, to
     recover the fatigues of the previous week; and even in the afternoon, a "Sunday shower" often
     kept her at home. She had been taught at Mrs. Penfold's, to consider the most superficial
     attention to religion, as being little short of angelic, and to believe that the utmost extreme
     of rational devotion, if she wished to be inordinately pious, would consist in going once every
     Sunday to a pew in some fashionable chapel, where the stream of the preacher's eloquence might
     be permitted to flow in at one ear, and out at the other, without there being any occasion for
     her to analyse or understand what he said, satisfied that her duty was more than done by
     appearing there at all,—besides which, she occasionally read prayers at home, in a careless
     mechanical way, which was anything but praying—she had a magnificently bound bible on her
     toilette, more for ornament than for use—she wore all her dresses for the first time at chapel,
     dined on roast beef every Sunday, and spent the evening in writing letters or in reading, or
     rather in sleeping over some volume of religious poetry or tales—what Sir Patrick laughingly
     called "a half-good book."</p>
<p>Both Agnes and her brother spoke with unmitigated and indiscriminating reprobation of
     Methodists, Roman Catholics, Unitarians, Independents, or any other sect of whom they knew the
     name, because, having always belonged nominally to an orthodox chapel, they considered it a
     matter of course, when thinking about the matter at all, that they must be orthodox too;
     though, if Agnes had been obliged to give a summary of her own doctrines, it would have been a
     confused medley, containing many of the heresies she reprobated by name, without knowing their
     nature. Thus sailing down on the stream of her own inclinations, without effort or reflection,
     Agnes would have been indignant and astonished beyond measure to be told, that she was not
     performing in a most commendable manner "The Whole Duty of Man," or at least more than the
     whole duty of woman, while she looked upon all those who evinced a greater reverence for
     religion as mean hypocrites or fanatical enthusiasts—being very much of opinion with the
     divine, who said that orthodox meant his own opinion, and paradox other people's.</p>
<p>Marion silently, and very unobtrusively, pursued the even tenor of her own way, with that
     deep and ardent devotion of spirit which had first been awakened to life by the happy
     instrumentality of Clara, whose apparent estrangement from her family now she deeply deplored,
     while many an anxious conjecture frequently crossed her mind, whether she, along with her
     brother and Agnes, must share in that alienation which she could neither fully understand nor
     in any degree diminish; and on the Sunday morning after her arrival at St. John's Lodge, before
     setting out for chapel, she had been surprised and mortified to observe, that Agnes' occupation
     in bed consisted in tearing up, to make matches, a numerous collection of notes from Miss
     Granville, all containing apologies for not accepting various invitations to St. John's Lodge.
     "What can this all mean?" thought Marion, in agitated perplexity, as she pursued her way to
     chapel. "It is very unlike Clara to be so repulsive! and equally unlike Agnes to be
     importunate! I fear something is greatly wrong; but Clara is too just and too good to mingle me
     in any quarrel of which I do not so much as know the cause. When we meet I shall at once ask
     Clara for an explanation. We must all yet be reconciled and happy, as in former days."</p>
<p>There is nothing which extravagant people grudge so much as paying for a pew in church; and
     those often who squander money upon everything else, meanly evade subscribing this just and
     necessary tribute for the maintenance of religion and good order in society. It is astonishing
     how many who pay their way with lavish liberality during the interval to concerts and balls,
     will stand, week after week, like paupers, in a chapel-aisle, begging for a seat, rather than
     hire one for the season; and on this occasion Marion, finding that neither Sir Patrick nor
     Agnes had ever imagined any necessity for providing themselves with a local habitation of their
     own, followed a stream of people into chapel, and stood for some time near the door, in that
     most awkward and conspicuous of all situations, waiting for the chance of being shown into a
     seat by some compassionate pew-opener.</p>
<p>The street had been crowded by a dense mass of carriages, while Marion felt almost bewildered
     by the loud crash of equipages driving up and driving off, breaking the line and backing out,
     as if they had been assembled on the benefit night of some popular actor, while a flood of
     pedestrians crowded along the foot-path, as if their lives depended on being first. She was
     astonished also at the unprecedented concourse of people already assembled in chapel, with
     looks of eager excitement and flushed expectation. Every aisle appeared filled to excess, and
     the staircase seemed one solid mosaic of faces, while the congregation were all crushing,
     elbowing, and pushing forward, in impatient haste. Voices were heard, at length, speaking
     aloud, in angry contention, for places—a sound which grated strangely and startlingly on the
     ear in a sacred edifice; and when at length the heat became unbearably intense, a loud crash
     was heard, of persons breaking the window for air.</p>
<p>Marion, intimidated at having ventured alone into so dense a crowd, and at a loss to guess
     what could occasion so much excitement, would have made her way out; but the pressure behind
     rendered it as impossible to retreat as to advance. On few occasions do people betray so great
     a want of kind consideration, and even of hospitality, as when comfortably ensconced in an
     extensive pew at church, occupying room enough for three or four others, and carelessly staring
     at those who are vainly waiting, with hesitation and confusion such as Marion's, in hopes of
     being obligingly accommodated with a place. Her color deepening every moment, and her veil
     drawn closer, Marion shrank from notice, while one person after another elbowed his way
     forward, and closed the door of his pew, with the authoritative, self-satisfied air of a
     proprietor, heedless how others might be situated; and still Marion anxiously glanced around
     her in vain, for the obscurest nook in which to subside unseen.</p>
<p>At length, when the first loud peal of the organ had sent forth its solemn tones, summoning
     every heart to devout attention, Marion felt a gentle touch given to her arm, and on looking
     round, her hand was clasped for a moment with a look of heartfelt affection by Clara Granville,
     who silently led her to the seat, at some distance, from which she had followed her, and giving
     one more affectionate pressure of the hand to Marion, she composed herself into a look of
     devout and fervent attention, forgetful evidently of all but the important services of the
     hour, while Marion's heart beat with rapture to find herself once more beside her most beloved
     friend, and that friend unchanged.</p>
<p>The prayers were not merely read, but prayed—not in the every day matter-of-course tone, so
     common in the pulpit, nor in a pompous, self-sufficient, commanding voice, but with deep
     thrilling solemnity, and in a manner calm, graceful, and dignified, by a young clergyman of
     most intelligent and serious aspect, who evidently felt all he said, and became so utterly
     absorbed in his duty, that it appeared as if he almost imagined himself alone, and visibly
     present with the Divine Being whom he addressed.</p>
<p>The young preacher's appearance was singularly striking and prepossessing. His dark
     Spanish-looking complexion, and rather foreign features, were animated by an expression of the
     brightest intelligence, while in his eye might be traced the calm dignity of a highly
     cultivated intellect, and the benevolence of a Christian who hoped all things and believed all
     things, judging others as he would himself be judged. In preaching, he avoided the arena of
     controversy, but his arguments were clear and comprehensive, his eloquence irresistible, as
     much by the fire and splendor of his genius, as by the depth and solemnity of his reflections,
     while the attention was enthralled, the judgment convinced, the heart awakened, and the inward
     feelings touched in their most secret recesses. Without a thought of affectation, he was
     simple, dignified, full of earnestness, self-conviction, and fervent devotion, while there were
     passages of grandeur when he alluded to the solemn mysteries, and higher truths of revelation,
     which might have made a mere philosopher feel as if the wing of his imagination had been broken
     in attempting to follow; and yet there were thoughts and illustrations so clear and
     comprehensible, that any ignorant child from a charity school might have understood them.</p>
<p>Amidst the brighter scintillations of his genius, it was evident that he understood the whole
     alchemy of human nature, and while almost insensibly revealing the magnificent proportions of
     his own mind, he understood and sympathised with all the trials, temptations, and sorrows of
     human nature, and considered the whole art of happiness for man to consist in unreserved and
     heartfelt submission of his own will, his own hopes, wishes, and affections to the will of his
     Maker, desiring to have nothing, to be nothing, to do nothing, and to expect nothing, but
     according to His wise and holy decrees—to let the stream of events run on, seeking to extract
     the best happiness from them as they occurred, without one rebellious wish that they had been
     otherwise, but only with a fervent prayer that they may, and a firm belief that they shall,
     carry him forward, though the course be rough and perilous, to a calm, bright haven of
     ceaseless and unutterable joy.</p>
<p>When the congregation had dispersed, with a degree of silence and solemnity very different
     from their noisy and irreverent entrance, Marion walked for some time, leaning on the arm of
     Miss Granville, but so entranced that she was unable yet to break the chain which had carried
     her mind and feelings captive to another and a better world. She had never before felt so
     deeply impressed with the transitory nature of all around her, the insignificance of those joys
     and sorrows with which she was encompassed, and it seemed to her but a day or an hour, till the
     curtain of eternity should rise, and the glories of a great hereafter become visible to her
     sight.</p>
<p>"You have been deeply interested by all we have heard?" said Clara, in an accent of gentle
     interrogation, but with an expression of peculiar meaning in her countenance, which Marion was
     at a loss how exactly to interpret.</p>
<p>"Interested!" exclaimed Marion, with youthful enthusiasm. "If all the sermons I ever heard
     were compressed into one, they could scarcely equal what has been said to-day!"</p>
<p>"Do you remember the preacher?" asked Clara, coloring and smiling. "But no! how could that be
     possible, when you never met before! Here he comes! Allow me to introduce you, then, to my very
     dear brother Richard. You know each other already, by the description of one who loves you
     both!"</p>
<p>Mr. Granville advanced to Marion with frank and prepossessing kindness, but though his manner
     was most ingratiating, his countenance wore an expression of pre-occupation and fatigue, while
     he walked hurriedly past, after cordially shaking Marion by the hand, who observed to Clara
     with surprise, that his hand felt as cold as ice.</p>
<p>"That is always the case with Richard after preaching," replied Miss Granville. "The solemn
     feeling of responsibility which he has on entering the pulpit, often agitates and overawes him
     to a degree you would scarcely credit. The extravagant enthusiasm with which he has lately been
     followed, makes him still more anxious to use rightly while it lasts his influence with others,
     though, as he says, nothing is so transient in this transitory world as the popularity of a
     preacher, and his chief solicitude is to remind men that it is the word preached, and not the
     preacher, which they are come to hear, and always to preserve the simplicity of his own mind,
     unadulterated by any inordinate wish for applause."</p>
<p>"I am sure his words and thoughts have all the force of genuine feeling," said Marion,
     earnestly. "He preaches from heart to heart, which is the only way to strike a light between
     them. It seemed to-day, as if he were steering us through an ocean of immeasurable
     thought."</p>
<p>"But," replied Clara, "Richard is deeply impressed with the danger to a preacher himself,
     arising from the adulation with which he is followed by crowds in search of novelty, who give
     that respect to the mere ambassador delivering his message, which he wishes to claim solely and
     entirely for his Divine Master. He quoted to me yesterday a quaint old author, who says that
     God humbles men in this life, that He may exalt them forever; but Satan exalts men in this
     life, that he may cast them down for eternity. It is a solemn truth, and Richard feels the
     danger as he ought."</p>
<p>"Then it is a danger no longer, if seen and rightly avoided," replied Marion. "He already
     lives, I have heard, in a better world, while he acts in this, but so much applause must be apt
     sometimes to draw down your brother's thoughts from heaven to earth, if he hears all that is
     said and thought. Lady Towercliffe remarked, as we came out, that his eloquence does him
     immortal honor."</p>
<p>"Yes! as Richard himself once observed, 'immortal honor for twenty-four hours, or perhaps a
     week;' but that is no object of legitimate ambition to a preacher of immortality. My brother is
     blessed with one Christian attainment almost in perfection, and that is an actual dread of
     worldly applause. No penny trumpet could be more insignificant in his estimation than the
     enthusiasm of a few excitable young ladies, and I have seen him often carefully avoiding those,
     who would be 'frothing him,' as he calls it, with preposterous praise. He compares popularity
     to the sails of a windmill, raised to the clouds one minute, and down below zero the next; but
     fashionable notoriety has no attraction for one who aims at real usefulness. If he did not
     despise it, he would despise himself. He is engrossed with the fervent, heartfelt hope of doing
     good according to his opportunity, and in perfect simplicity performing his duty to God and
     man."</p>
<p>"How mean and low in comparison do those appear who are living only for the opinions of men,
     and the trumpery tinsel of this world, yet how difficult it must be to rise above earthly
     ambition," said Marion. "No patent of nobility could confer half the distinction on your
     brother that he enjoyed to-day, surrounded by a multitude all aroused to enthusiasm by his
     words. A mere author writes in solitude, and never knows the full influence of what he has
     written; but an orator reaps an immediate harvest of honor, and sees it before his eyes, which
     must be ten thousand times more apt to intoxicate him with success."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Clara, "no enthusiasm can rival what is felt at the moment for a popular
     preacher. His eloquence rouses feelings stronger than in any nature, while men become conscious
     that it would be their highest honor and best safety to encourage such thoughts as he suggests.
     You would smile sometimes to see how Richard's steps are beset as he leaves the chapel, by
     crowds anxious to catch a glimpse of his countenance, to request an introduction, to express
     their warmest thanks, to entreat he will print his last sermon, or to beg for an
     autograph."</p>
<p>"It is taking pains to destroy what they most admire, when people throw such temptations to
     vanity in a clergyman's way," said Marion. "Even I could not but perceive, as he passed, the
     reverential glances, and the whispered announcement of his name on every side, as he hurried
     onward, looking neither to the right hand nor to the left; but he sets an example of what he
     teaches, to live for high and holy purposes. It is only by carrying a light himself, that a
     clergyman can give light to others."</p>
<p>"Yes, Marion! it was not in mere words, of course, or of sacrilegious presumption, that
     Richard declared, on being ordained, his own solemn conviction that he was specially called to
     be a minister of the church. Unlike the Jews, who had Christ in their Bibles, but not in their
     hearts, his whole spirit was imbued with the pure holy faith and morality of the everlasting
     Gospel, and he considered it the highest of earthly honors to be consecrated for that solemn
     office."</p>
<p>"I was often told formerly," said Marion, "that your brother had talents which would have
     raised him to eminence—or rather to pre-eminence—at the bar, and in the House of Commons—or, as
     Pat has always said, meaning the greatest compliment of all—on the stage; but, dear Clara, how
     different, and how greatly superior, to feel, as he must do, with an approving conscience, that
     all his abilities, time, and strength, are consecrated to an object, which his heart, without
     one momentary feeling of doubt or self-reproach, may delight in—that all his studies, duties,
     and occupations increase his own fitness to be happy for ever; while, at the same time, they
     are for the good of all mankind, and for the glory of God. Your brother most truly said to-day,
     that a sinner is 'the drudge of Satan;' but if there be real greatness upon earth, I think it
     is that of an honored and useful minister in the Church of Christ, whose character is modelled
     upon the Holy Scriptures, as some insects take their hue from the leaf on which they feed."</p>
<p>"True, Marion! Richard's profession is, indeed, in the way he fulfils it, 'twice bless'd,' as
     a means of both giving and receiving happiness. It is with him a labor of love, in which every
     duty is a pleasure, and his object is, to keep us in mind of our individual importance in being
     believers; for as the glory of the sun is reflected in a single drop of dew, so may the
     character of Christ be represented in that of the humblest Christian; and like a stone in an
     arch, each atom has a place to fill, which must be conscientiously kept, whether more or less
     important and conspicuous, with unswerving steadiness, for in no other can it be so
     advantageously situated."</p>
<p>"I am entirely convinced of that," said Marion. "As your brother said to-day, Christians must
     never feel themselves raised above the homely duties of every-day life, nor give mere moralists
     occasion to say that their faith is not evidenced by their works."</p>
<p>"No," replied Clara, "let the ravens croak while the eagle pursues his steady flight towards
     the sun, heedless of all but his high destination. Yet, as Richard says, Christian mothers
     should instruct their own children, wives should find their first earthly duty in associating
     with their husbands, the heads of houses should watch conscientiously over the belief and
     conduct of their servants, a clergyman's vocation is within his own parish, and every family
     should be a little kingdom in itself, ruled and governed by the law and the Gospel of Christ,
     so that, as benighted wanderers in the dark are often cheered and guided by seeing, as they
     hurry onwards, the light and warmth gleaming round the hearth of a stranger, the sinner, also,
     in his dark and dreary course, when he beholds a passing glimpse of that peace and joy which
     are to be found in a Christian household, and there only, might be tempted and encouraged to go
     home and do likewise."</p>
<p>"I wish it were so oftener," said Marion, while her thoughts reverted sorrowfully to St.
     John's Lodge.</p>
<p>"It is in speaking with single-hearted simplicity of home duties and home affections, that
     Richard always excels himself," continued Clara, warmly. "There he preaches as he practices,
     for he cultivates happiness to diffuse it all around him, and he is, in reality, all that other
     men wish to appear. He deprecates, in general, pulpit oratory, as men are often apt to mistake
     mere excited feeling for true devotion; and he considers that attention in church at most to be
     depended on that which does not require to be pampered with novelty. Eloquence has so often
     been perverted to such evil purposes, both moral and political, that Richard sometimes tells
     me, he thinks, on the whole, this world would have been a better world without oratory at all,
     because brilliant talents and enthusiastic tempers usurp so often the place due only to
     principle."</p>
<p>"It often occurs to me," said Marion, "that half the actual history of our own lives is
     unknown to us now, but will be probably revealed hereafter;—in what respect, for instance, our
     circumstances in life would have been altered, had we on various occasions acted
     differently—how near we may have been to meeting with great events which never actually
     occurred—what impression has been made on others by our conduct and actions—who really loved
     us, and what is the extent of good or evil which our conversation or our writings may have done
     in the world. To your brother how many interesting discoveries would such revelation probably
     disclose!"</p>
<p>"Richard's own endeavor is generally to maintain a calm, rational, and argumentative style of
     reasoning with his congregation, and yet he is carried away irresistibly by his feelings,
     sometimes into such a burst of eloquence as we heard to-day," added Clara; "you would sometimes
     fancy, even in conversation, that Richard's mind, like some great volcano, was undergoing an
     overwhelming eruption, while he pours forth in resistless torrents, the burning lava of his
     thoughts and feelings."</p>
<p>Marion listened with increasing interest to Clara's remarks, and watched with affectionate
     sympathy, the kindling brightness of her friend's expressive eyes when she spoke of that
     brother so tenderly beloved, and so unspeakably respected, of whom, from his earliest boyhood,
     she had heard nothing but praise, for none had ever measured the stature of his mind without
