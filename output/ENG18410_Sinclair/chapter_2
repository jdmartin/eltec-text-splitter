<head>  CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>The two most dashing, bold, and mischievous boys at Eton during their day, had formerly been
     Sir Patrick Dunbar and Louis De Crespigny, who astonished the weak minds of masters and pupils,
     by the strange and startling invention displayed in their exploits, as well as by the ingenuity
     with which both got safely out of every threatening predicament, and the sly humor or cunning
     with which they frequently shifted the disgrace, or even the punishment, of their offences, on
     others who deserved it less, or perhaps not at all. Invariably at the head of every mad
     exploit, or at the bottom of every secret design, how they could possibly have escaped being
     expelled was a frequent topic of subsequent wonder among their contemporaries in the classes;
     but their delight was to run as near the wind as possible, and still to display their skilful
     pilotage by baffling justice, and evading the utmost rigor of the law, while always ready
     rather to do harm than to do nothing.</p>
<p>When very young, the two enterprising friends, both since gazetted into the 15th Light
     Huzzars, had shown an early predilection for military life, by frequently escaping to the
     neighbouring barracks, assisted by a ladder of rope on which they descended every night from
     the windows. A gay, joyous reception invariably awaited these lively boys at the mess-table,
     where they sung many a jovial song, and cracked many a merry jest over their claret, till,
     after some hours spent in rapturous festivity, they stole silently back within bounds, and were
     re-admitted at the window, by their respective fags, who had received orders, under pain of
     death, to keep awake and answer their signals for the ladder by instantly lowering it. The
     spirits of both these young companions were more like the effect of intoxication, than mere
     sober enjoyment; and, on one occasion, they set the table in a roar, by having a rivalship
     which would best imitate the gradual progress of becoming tipsy, though drinking nothing but
     cold water; in which exhibition they showed so much talent for mimicry, taking off the
     surrounding officers before their faces, and making so many home-thrusts and personal remarks,
     that the scene was never afterwards forgotten in the regiment. On another occasion Sir Patrick
     caused himself to be placed in a coffin, stolen from the undertakers, and was carried through
     the barracks by his companions, who made paper trumpets with which they played the dead march
     in Saul, while all the sentries saluted as they passed. Such juvenile exploits in the dawn of
     life were now the subject of many a laughing reminiscence, and had been followed by others on a
     more extended scale and of more matured enterprise, at Mr. Brownlow's, a private tutor, where
     the two young men afterwards distinguished themselves in a way not easily to be forgotten,
     causing their better disciplined companions to wonder, though in very few instances to
     admire.</p>
<p>In the favorite aristocratic achievements of driving stage-coaches, breaking lamps, wringing
     off knockers, assaulting watchmen, with other fistic and pugilistic exploits, they were nearly
     unrivalled; and occasionally their genius had soared into an extraordinary display of
     dexterity, in transposing the signs suspended over shops, and in filching silk handkerchiefs
     from the pockets of their friends, merely as amateurs, but still the deed was done, and the
     laugh raised literally at the expense of the sufferer, as the plunder was retained to be a
     future trophy of success. Each successive stage of their youth, in short, supplied an
     inexhaustible fund of standing jests and lively anecdotes, the wit of which mainly consisted in
     their mischief, while they betrayed an utter recklessness about the opinions or the feelings of
     others, till at length the patience of their unfortunate private tutor was so completely
     exhausted that he gave them a secret hint to withdraw, which they accordingly lost no time in
     preparing to do, but not till they had enjoyed a very characteristic revenge. When Mr. Brownlow
     had taken a party of friends with him one evening to the theatre, Sir Patrick suddenly
     discharged from the gallery the whole contents of a prodigious bag of flour, which powdered all
     the heads, faces, and coats, in the pit, perfectly white, and caused an uproar of anger and of
     irresistible laughter throughout the house; and the same evening Louis De Crespigny, as a
     farewell frolic, abstracted a stuffed bear from the neighbouring hair-dresser's, and having
     equipped it in the costume of Mr. Brownlow, hung it from the lamp-post, where a panic-struck
     crowd was speedily assembled by the alarming report that the reverend gentleman had committed
     suicide. A strict investigation took place respecting the authors of these unpardonable tricks,
     but, though suspicion fell at once upon the real culprits, and the circumstantial evidence
     against them seemed irresistibly strong, Sir Patrick argued his own cause with so much skill
     and vivacity, while De Crespigny looked so innocently unconscious of the whole affair, that,
     with a silent frown from the master, of stern reproof and suspicion, they were, not honorably
     acquitted, but allowed to return home without any public mark of censure or disgrace; and soon
     after both joined their regiment at Dublin.</p>
<p>De Crespigny and Sir Patrick had but one companion whom they acknowledged as their equal at
     Eton, in all the spirit, enterprise, and vivacity of their characters, but who was, in a
     thousand other respects their superior, for seldom, indeed, has there been known, in one so
     young, a character of as much intensity, or which displayed a combination so singular, of
     superb talents, rare judgment, sound principle, deep piety, and energetic feeling, as in
     Richard Granville, an object of admiration to all, and of envy to many; though jealously lost
     half of its bitterness in association with one so eloquent and single-hearted in conversation,
     so courteously amiable and conciliatory in manner, and with so fine a principle of tact, ready
     as far as possible to enhance the pleasures, to palliate the faults, and to share the sorrows
     of all his companions. Cultivated in all that could adorn the heart as well as the head, in
     whatever was amiable, high-spirited and generous, Richard Granville had but to follow the
     impulse of natural feeling as well as of principle, and he out-did the very wishes of his
     friends, while no one excelled him in all the manly exercises suited to his early years. His
     countenance was illuminated with an expression of intellectual energy, at times almost sublime,
     while there was a living grace and amiability in his manner irresistibly attractive. Brave,
     liberal, and resolute, he entered with eagerness into all the offensive recreations of his
     companions, and no one excelled him in riding, fencing, and cricket, while he was the best shot
     in his own country; but he firmly declined ever to squander his time or money on any game of
     chance, cards, billiards, or gambling in any form. While Sir Patrick's betting-book was from
     the first a model of skill, in hedging bets, and all the manœuvres of jockey-ology, young
     Granville said all that eloquence and affection could dictate, to point out how dangerous and
     dishonorable was the course on which he seemed about to enter, but in vain, for Sir Patrick
     finished the discussion by offering to bet him £5 he would not be ruined in less than ten
     years. "I have a fortune and constitution which will last me till thirty," said the young
     baronet; "and I do not wish to live a day longer."</p>
<p>"It is easy," said Prince Eugene, "to be modest when one is successful; but it is difficult
     not to be envied." While the very presence of young Granville in the room, with his riotous
     young associates, seemed as if it held up a glass to their mind's eye, testifying the folly and
     evil of their course, yet Richard Granville abhorred display, while Sir Patrick and De
     Crespigny frequently declared he was "too clever and too good for them;" and unavoidable
     circumstances afterwards combined to estrange the young men still more. A law-suit had been
     going on almost since the period of their birth, conducted in an amicable way by their
     guardians, in which the interests of all three were so deeply concerned, and the case so
     exceedingly complicated, that years passed on, during which the youths had all grown to
     manhood, and the case remained still undecided; while the one-sided view which was given to
     Dunbar and De Crespigny on the subject caused in them an angry feeling of hostility and rancour
     against their amiable and high-minded young relative, who was so enthusiastically desirous to
     enter the English church, and devote himself to those sacred duties, that he scarcely wished a
     favorable decree, which would prevent the necessity for his pursuing a profession at all.</p>
<p>A Scotch law-suit may be compared to a game at battle-dore between the tribunals of England
     and Scotland, while the gaping client sees the shuttle-cock for ever flying over his head,
     higher and higher out of reach, and sent backwards and forwards with ceaseless diligence, but
     no apparent progress; or it is like a kitten playing with a ball of worsted, which is allowed
     to come often apparently within her grasp, and is then, when she least expects, twitched away
     farther than before. The Granville case had been decided by the Court of Session, against the
     two cousins, Dunbar and Crespigny, but being appealed to the House of Lords, was recommended
     for consideration, re-argued, re-considered, and nearly reversed, while replies and duplies,
     remits and re-revisals, commissions of inquiry, and new cases, followed each other in ceaseless
     succession, and many of the lawyers who were young men when the case began, grew grey in the
     service, while it yet remained in suspense. A grand-uncle of Sir Patrick's had fifty years
     before, bought an estate of £12,000 a-year from the Marquis of Doncaster, to whom young De
     Crespigny was now heir presumptive; but Mr. Dunbar having, it was conjectured, entertained some
     suspicion that the title deeds were not perfectly valid, as an entail had been discovered
     afterwards, by which it was generally thought that the land must be restored to the original
     owner, he hastily and most unfairly sold the property to the late Mr. Granville for £350,000,
     and dying intestate, after having lost nearly the whole sum in a mining speculation, it could
     not be proved whether Sir Patrick's father had acted as an executor for the deceased or not, so
     as to render himself responsible for his debts, and liable to refund the sum paid by Mr.
     Granville. Thus, whether the entail held good, and carried the estate back to Lord Doncaster,
     or whether it had been legally broken, so as to entitle the Granville family to keep it, or
     whether, if it were refunded, the price could be claimed from the heirs of Mr. Dunbar, still
     continued a mystery never apparently to be solved.</p>
<p>For many generations past, the ancient Marquisate of Doncaster had been inherited by a
     succession of only sons, all strict Papists, who had each in his turn been reckoned by the next
     heirs exceedingly sickly and unpromising, but still the wonder grew, for not one had ever died,
     till he left a substitute in regular rotation, to supply the vacancy which he created himself;
     and a long train of minorities in the family had caused the accumulation of wealth and property
     to be enormous, when the present proprietor succeeded fifty years before our story commences.
     Nothing could exceed his own astonishment at the unembarrassed magnificence of the fortune, of
     which he most unexpectedly found himself in possession, as his father had been in the habit of
     concealing the amount of his own income, and allowing his heir rather less than nothing,
     saying, that as he himself had never had anything to eat till he had no teeth to eat with, he
     was resolved that his successor should be similarly treated. In pursuance of this plan, the old
     nobleman even on his death-bed, had actually expired with a practical joke on his lips. He sent
     for his son, gravely told him that with debts, mortgages, and settlements, the very encumbered
     estate he was about to inherit would scarcely pay its own expenses, and recommended him to live
     in future with the most penurious economy. When the will was opened, finding to his unutterable
     joy, that he had merely been played upon by the old humorist, who, in reality left him £40,000
     per annum clear, so great was Lord Doncaster's surprise, that he declared his good fortune at
     the time to be "almost incredible;" and it might have been supposed, that he never afterwards
     completely believed it, as his personal expenses were always in a style more suited to the old
     Lord's threat than his performance, and he became a fresh instance of what may be so often
     remarked, that the most extravagant heirs in expectancy become the most avaricious in
     possession.</p>
<p>There was one singular peculiarity in the settlements of Lord Doncaster's family, that so
     long as he had no son, or if his son at twenty-one declared himself a Protestant, he had the
     power of selling or bequeathing the estates according to his own pleasure or caprice; and the
     ancestor who had inserted this clause in his deed of entail, made his intention evident, that
     the succession should go to the Roman Catholic Church, rather than to a Protestant heir; but
     the present peer had taken advantage, on so large a scale, of his own childless privilege, to
     sell the family estates, that his two deceased sisters, Lady Charlotte De Crespigny, and Lady
     Caroline Smytheson, used secretly to complain, that little would be left for their children, if
     he persevered in turning every acre into gold; yet no one ever could guess how the large sums
     were squandered or melted away, which the old Marquis was continually raising, unless they
     went, as was strongly suspected, in the form of "secret service money," among the priests by
     whom he was surrounded.</p>
<p>Nobody had a better right to be eccentric than Lord Doncaster!—old, rich, unmarried, and
     originally educated at home,—a misfortune sufficient in itself to engender so many
     peculiarities, as to render a man unfit for society ever afterwards. The aged peer was shy,
     proud, and arbitrary beyond all conception, avaricious about trifles, yet lavish to excess on
     great occasions, suspicious of all men's motives and intentions, and yet confiding to the last
     extreme of weakness, in the Abbe Mordaunt, his confessor, despising all men, and yet anxious
     beyond measure for the world's good opinion, addicted to the very worst female society, when he
     might have enjoyed the best, hating company, and yet sometimes plunging into it, when and where
     he was least expected, jealous to excess of his next heir, Louis De Crespigny, whom he enslaved
     to his caprices, as if even his existence were to be given or withheld at his option, yet
     sometimes whimsically cordial in his manner to him, though ready to take fire in an instant if
     his condescension led the lively youth into the slightest approach towards confidence or
     familiarity.</p>
<p>Mr. Howard Smytheson, the wealthy brother-in-law of Lord Doncaster, having purchased most of
     the De Crespigny estates, as acre after acre, farm after farm, and house after house, came
     successively into the market, bequeathed them on his decease to an only daughter then an
     infant, and it became a favorite day-dream with the old peer, that his nephew and niece should
     be educated for each other, while to this end he tried his utmost power of conciliation with
     the maiden sister of Mr. Howard Smytheson, to whose care the young heiress had been consigned,
     hoping that thus all the amputated limbs of his vast property might yet be reunited in their
     pristine magnitude, to which very desirable end he thenceforth directed his whole conversations
     with young De Crespigny, to whom he more than hinted that, unless their will were the same
     about this marriage, his own will after death would be found very different from what his
     nephew probably anticipated and wished.</p>
<p>The private vices of Lord Doncaster had been so very private, that though much was suspected,
     little could be known; yet, while he had few visible or personal expenses, and no imaginable
     outlet for his fortune, he invariably spent all his income, and considerably more, being one of
     those personages occasionally seen who excite the wonder and speculation of relations and
     neighbours, by unaccountably frittering away fortunes of almost royal splendor, without any
     appearance of royal luxury or royal liberality. Wearied of the world, in which he had nothing
     more to desire, and of himself, as he had nothing to think of or to do,—bored in short with the
     want of a want, Lord Doncaster's life was indeed a mere heartless pageant of mean ostentation
     and fretful pride, sternly insulated in a state of solitary old-bachelor despotism, and
     absorbed in himself to a degree which no ordinary mind could conceive or comprehend. Encumbered
     with so many unoccupied hours, it was a subject of as much wonder how he disposed of his
     superfluous time, as of his superfluous fortune; but he settled that question, by remarking one
     day to his nephew, that "the great business of life is, to shuffle through the day anyhow till
     dinner time." Like all parsimonious men, Lord Doncaster could not endure to hear any one else
     reckoned affluent, and Louis De Crespigny knew that a certain receipt for irritating him was,
     to over-estimate everybody's income, consequently he amused himself occasionally by audibly
     giving out Lord Towercliffe's fortune to be £15,000 a-year, and estimating his friend Sir
     Patrick Dunbar's rent-roll at a clear sum of £20,000 per annum, while he slyly watched his
     uncle's rising choler, and patiently heard, for the fiftieth time, an elaborate explanation,
     that it was impossible, and a sober calculation which reduced both the offending parties almost
     to beggary.</p>
<p>In the month of August, as regularly as time revolved, Lord Doncaster delighted to read in
     the newspapers, his own pompous advertisement, the only original composition he was ever known
     to attempt, in which he prohibited poachers and strangers from shooting on his moors in
     Argyleshire, Mid-Lothian, Yorkshire, Galloway, Cromarty, and Caithness, but except the annual
     appearance of this spirited manifesto, no public evidence ever came forth of that extraordinary
     wealth which property so extensive must be supposed to produce. No charitable donations bore
     witness to Lord Doncaster's liberality—no country objects were encouraged by his public
     spirit—and the monuments daily arising in memory of departed merit, made a vain appeal for his
     pecuniary tribute of respect and regret, for Lord Doncaster neither respected nor regretted any
     man.</p>
<p>It was an often-repeated axiom of Lord Doncaster's, that every man cheats or is cheated; but
     in one instance, and one only, his Lordship had shown apparently some kind feeling, or rather
     perhaps he might be said to have exhibited a capricious freak of benevolence, though the result
     had been such as to afford him an excuse ever afterwards for not again attempting a single act
     of gratuitous liberality.</p>
<p>The nearest relative to his ancient family, after Louis De Crespigny and Miss Howard, was
     Mrs. Anstruther, a distant cousin, who, after making a low and almost disgraceful marriage, had
     suddenly died, it was believed by her own hands, thus consigning her two young children to
     helpless, and apparently hopeless poverty, till at length they were very unwillingly invited,
     or rather permitted to become residents in an almost menial capacity at Beaujolie Castle, in
     Yorkshire, where, as they could neither be drowned like kittens, nor shot like puppy-dogs, the
     Marquis caused them to be treated like the "whipping boys" in Charles the First's
     time—sometimes employed as playmates to amuse his nephew and niece during their holiday visits
     to his residence, but more frequently treated in a sort of mongrel way between dependents and
     slaves by the heartless and tyrannical old peer, who considered them as mere poachers on the
     preserve of his family honors, having forced their way into existence by some untoward
     accident, and become absolute blots in the creation, liable to be suspected, and even accused
     to their faces of every low and vicious propensity, in consequence of which, from an early age,
     he destroyed their self-respect, and irritated their evil passions by the most rash and
     unfounded aspersions—theft, swindling, lying, and gluttony, were among the principal counts in
     his Lordship's indictment, when he sometimes vented a paroxysm of ill-humor on these his
     unhappy dependents; and many a time the tears of Mary Anstruther, and the flashing eye of her
     brother Ernest, bore witness to the anger and grief with which they listened to his bitter and
     often unmerited upbraidings.</p>
<p>At times, however, Lord Doncaster found it convenient for his own private purposes to
     patronize the Anstruthers, and threatened, in the hearing of all his young relatives, that if
     Louis De Crespigny's conduct did not in all respects satisfy him, an heir more subservient to
     his wishes might be found, and though the culprit must be his nephew, he need not be his
     successor, while the glance of his eye towards Ernest aroused hopes, wishes, and even
     expectations of the wildest extravagance, which were then confirmed for a time by his being
     promoted to temporary attention and consideration, not only displayed ostentatiously by their
     capricious patron, but extending to the increased respect and observance of the servants, the
     thermometer of whose obedience rose and fell according as the sunshine of Lord Doncaster's
     favor shone upon his young relative or not; yet brief as these periods of increased importance
     had always been, they made an indelible impression on the young and ambitious minds of those
     usually neglected children. "The child becomes a boy, the boy a youth, and then the game of
     life begins in earnest."</p>
<p>Without education or principle, and with no friend on the wide earth to confide in or to
     consult, the two young Anstruthers, like weeds that will yet flourish though trampled upon,
     grew up vigorous in body, and enthusiastically as well as devotedly attached to each other,
     with a depth and power of affection which appeared, before long, the only redeeming quality in
     characters wherein strong passions and weak principles promised little, and threatened much, to
     all with whom they might hereafter become associated.</p>
<p>The resemblance between them was as remarkable as their attachment, both having dark
     Italian-looking countenances, of remarkable symmetry, with a singularly excitable and
     determined expression in their large lustrous eyes, while it was remarkable that neither could
     by possibility look any one steadily in the face. There was a wild, almost feverish brilliancy
     in the eye of Ernest, expressive of a fiery impetuosity, amounting at times almost to an
     appearance of insanity, when, after being obliged to crouch and flatter for his bread before
     Lord Doncaster, he would retire with Mary, and give loose to all the angry torrent of his
     long-suppressed emotions. The sister's heart cowered sometimes before the flood of invectives
     and imprecations with which he relieved his heart by speaking of his wrongs, while he seemed to
     cherish a gnawing belief that fortune herself had shown him a most unaccountable and undeserved
     enmity, which he was resolved, by fair or by foul means, to subvert. "I shall yet rise above
     all the accidents of fortune! It shall be done, I care not how, Mary," said he sternly. "We
     must not be over-particular on that score, for, as the proverb says, 'a cat in mittens will
     never catch mice!'"</p>
<p>Bold, fearless, and ready, with a keen appetite for danger, a fearless ambition, consummate
     cunning, and an insatiable thirst for adventure, it seemed sometimes as if he would put his
     mind into a pugilistic attitude, and buffet his way forward to pre-eminence in spite of all the
     malice of fortune and of mankind. With a temper vindictive, harsh, and deadly, his blood
     mounted like mercury in a thermometer at the very thought of success, and often when he spoke
     to his sister in the lowest whisper of their future prospects, she would start and look hastily
     round as if in terror, lest the wild dreams of his undisciplined mind might be overheard and
     resented, for he nourished a feverish hope, which he called a presentiment, but which amounted
     almost to a monomania, that the splendid residence in which they were now only tolerated on
     sufferance, "as reptile dependents," would one day become his own.</p>
<p>If every man living might remove at pleasure all those who stand inconveniently in his way,
     political economists would have nothing to fear from a too rapidly increasing population, and
     the day-dreams of Ernest, which gained strength and consistency every hour, were prolific in
     both deaths and marriages. He carefully collected in the Peerage all the instances there
     recorded, in which distant relations had succeeded through a long mortality of twenty or
     five-and-twenty intermediate heirs,—he remembered that neither Louis nor Caroline had yet
     endured the measles,—he thought their Shetland ponies very dangerous, and, in short, if their
     days had been measured by him, the measure would have been short indeed. His personal vanity
     was excessive, and amidst his wild schemes of aggrandisement, the first and foremost had lately
     been to marry his lively, frolicsome, little cousin, and occasional playmate, Caroline Howard
     Smytheson, in whose infant manner, heedless and good-humored as she was, he flattered himself
     there might be traced an evident appearance of preference, while he could not but also remark,
     that before any of the young party had attained the age of maturity, and Caroline was yet a
     mere infant. Louis De Crespigny had already begun to exercise his genius for flirtation in the
     society of his humble cousin Mary Anstruther,—humble only in circumstances, but possessing that
     pride without principle, which goes before a fall.</p>
<p>Time had ripened the faults of the two young Anstruthers, and perfected also their
     extraordinary beauty of person, when, after Ernest had attained the age of nineteen, a whim as
     sudden, and apparently as unaccountable as their adoption, caused Lord Doncaster, or rather the
     Abbe Mordaunt, unexpectedly to announce that they were dismissed from the house. Various
     rumours were circulated among the servants to account for this harsh and hasty decision, but
     nothing could be discovered for certain. Ernest was reported to have expressed himself with the
     greatest rancour and contempt respecting a report in circulation, that Lord Doncaster intended
     to marry the Abbe Mordaunt's beautiful niece, then on a visit at Kilmarnock Abbey, near
     Edinburgh. The Abbe was said to have missed some valuable jewels belonging to his niece Laura,
     who accused both the Anstruthers of having been seen in her room,—a large sum of money, it was
     hinted, had mysteriously disappeared—some people said that Ernest had been discovered at a late
     hour of the night attempting to enter the sleeping apartment of Lord Doncaster, without being
     able to give any satisfactory account of his intentions, and others declared that Louis De
     Crespigny's assiduities to Mary Anstruther had recently become rather too obvious, while
     surmises arose against her character; but whatever might be the cause, they were both hastily
     transferred on a few hours' notice from the splendors of Kilmarnock Abbey, to a small obscure
     lodging at Portobello. As Ernest was about to leave that house which had so long been his home,
     with Mary sobbing in uncontrollable grief on his arm, anger and despair were fearfully stamped
     on their young faces, when the Abbe Mordaunt advancing silently, placed a small sum of money in
     their hands, which the young man furiously dashed upon the ground, and trampled upon, saying in
     accents of strong and almost terrifying vehemence, while his countenance exhibited a dark
     insidious expression of almost maniacal fury, "I would not be human if I did not hate your
     niece and you!—my curse shall rest on both till I am revenged! Take back your paltry gold, I
     shall build up my own fortune, or perish in the ruins! I shall live by my own hands, or—by own
     hands I shall die!"</p>
<p>From that day forward the names of Mary and Ernest Anstruther never passed the lips of Lord
     Doncaster or the Abbe, who ordered the servants also to abstain from ever mentioning them,
     which only piqued the curiosity of the second table into greater activity than ever; but though
     many vague conjectures, dark suspicions, and absurd rumours, were promulgated throughout the
     establishment, nothing certain could be ascertained, except that they returned no more to
     Kilmarnock Abbey, and that a final extinguisher had been placed on all their prospects and
     hopes from Lord Doncaster.</p>
<p>About this time Mrs. Bridget Smytheson sent Miss Howard, then only six years old, to school,
     and seemed so little anxious to encourage an intimacy between the young heiress and Louis De
     Crespigny, whom she had long disliked, that Lord Doncaster, piqued and indignant, angrily
     reminded her of his sister Lady Caroline's dying injunction, to which she had promised implicit
     attention, that if the cousins, after they were grown up, could be ascertained to have to have
     a disinterested preference for each other, every opportunity should be given them to become
     attached and engaged.</p>
<p>"Certainly, Lord Doncaster; and I shall fulfil my pledge," replied the over-dressed, and
     rather under-bred aunt, in her usual tone of fantastic affectation; "but these boy-and-girl
     intimacies are not the most likely to produce that romantic love with which young people ought
     to begin their married lives; and besides, how could their preference be disinterested, where
     the brilliant prospects of both are continually descanted on as motives to their union. No! I
     have a considerable spice of romance in my composition; and when they do meet again, it shall
     be under very different circumstances."</p>
