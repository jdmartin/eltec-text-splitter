<head>  CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<p>Nothing had ever surprised and annoyed Captain De Crespigny more than the unadmiring
     indifference with which, week after week, Marion received his visits. Her easy, good humored
     courtesy of manner was unpardonable! No peculiar consciousness became visible in her manner,
     when he addressed her; no accession of sensibility in her voice; no agitation in her smile; no
     increase of her natural timidity; no desire of captivation, nor the slightest coquetry in
     displaying her own fascinations.</p>
<p>To be thus treated like a cousin or a brother was mortifying in the extreme, and appeared to
     him perfectly unaccountable, because he little guessed the contrast which incessantly presented
     itself to Marion's mind, between the low, every-day tone of his thoughts, on all the essential
     objects of existence, and the elevated sentiments or generous feelings, to which she had lately
     become accustomed in the society of Mr. Granville. Captain De Crespigny's conversation always
     diverted her on account of its eccentricity; but in the selfishness and vanity he inadvertently
     betrayed, she saw how little he could know the real nature and value of that happiness
     springing from principle and affection, which alone could satisfy her heart.</p>
<p>Formerly, Captain De Crespigny would have gloried in surmounting difficulties, if he had ever
     found any difficulties to conquer; and now he was determined not to become discouraged, though
     he felt, if such a thing could be possible, almost humbled. His eye followed Marion wherever
     she turned, and he was now for ever by her side, though she evidently made it her continual
     business to avoid him, as she had latterly become more aware than before of his assiduity.</p>
<p>Fortified by the consciousness of her own secret engagement, and by the knowledge that Agnes
     had a well-founded belief in his attachment to herself, Marion's countenance, which told every
     transient emotion of her heart, never betrayed a thought of love; and it seemed to Captain De
     Crespigny as if her heart must be of granite, so cold and hard beneath a smiling stream. She
     was long of even suspecting the worst, and would not fully believe when she did, that his
     volatile fancy had really changed; yet a spell seemed over her, that she could not escape from
     Captain De Crespigny's society, without giving offence to Sir Patrick and Agnes, who both, for
     different reasons, insisted on her being present when he called, though, unlike her sister, who
     would have sacrificed every one to herself, she would have sacrificed herself for every one,
     and only thought with considerate affection, how she could best spare the feelings of Agnes,
     and at the same time escape from occasioning any jealousy, the fear of which now haunted her
     like a perpetual night-mare.</p>
<p>One morning, when Agnes was seated in a state of exceedingly full-blown satisfaction,
     expecting Captain De Crespigny's usual visit, and considering him as much her own property as
     either her reticule or her work-box, she observed Marion, who had occupations for every hour of
     the day, hastily gather up her drawing materials, and glide towards the door, evidently anxious
     to escape without observation, but in vain.</p>
<p>The barometer of Agnes's countenance had become exceedingly stormy, while watching Marion's
     progress; and being one who rather enjoyed the excitement of a quarrel than otherwise, she
     asked Marion in a voice raised an octave higher than usual, which sounded as sharp and cutting
     as an east wind, where she was about to go, adding, in her most sarcastic tone,</p>
<p>"Pray inform me, Marion, why I am to be left in solitude here, when everybody knows that in a
     place like this I cannot possibly receive visitors alone. One would suppose that you wished to
     prevent me from seeing Captain De Crespigny this morning."</p>
<p>"By no means, Agnes. But is there any occasion for me to remain, when Patrick of course
     accompanies him here as usual?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, Marion. You know perfectly well that Patrick may or may not be here, for that all
     depends on whims like your own, and nothing renders it correct to receive gentlemen in the
     morning, except there being two of us at home. I expected more friendship and consideration
     from you; but people never will think of any one but themselves!"</p>
<p>"You are like a Hebrew scholar, and always read me backwards, Agnes. I have only to know your
     wishes in order to comply with them," replied Marion, good-humoredly re-seating herself, and
     adding, with a beautiful timidity of manner and voice, "I cannot but think that, until you are
     actually engaged, it would perhaps be better if—if—Captain De Crespigny's attentions were not
     to—to be at all divided."</p>
<p>"Divided!" exclaimed Agnes, looking perfectly sublime in her anger. "What can you mean?"</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Agnes," replied Marion, trying to steady her voice, and to hide her confusion. "I
     mean that Captain De Crespigny has the reputation of being a confirmed flirt; that I hope and
     trust, if it be really for your happiness, he is, as you think, irretrievably attached and
     engaged to yourself; but if a housemaid enter the room, he cannot resist attempting to look
     handsome, and to attract her admiration; therefore you cannot but suppose he will endeavor to
     waste some of his fascinations occasionally upon me, and till he is my brother, I would rather
     avoid any such absurdity."</p>
<p>"Your meaning is plain enough now, and requires no interpreter!" said Agnes, with an angry
     toss of her head. "Every one must see and know, that Captain De Crespigny is exclusively and
     entirely devoted to me."</p>
<p>"That is a point, Agnes, of which no third person can be an adequate judge," replied Marion,
     evasively; "but I am as anxious to believe it as yourself."</p>
<p>"If you entertain any fear of causing me a disappointment, make your own mind perfectly easy,
     as mine is. If Captain De Crespigny could hesitate a moment between us, I should scarcely think
     him worth living for, and still less worth dying for. Be assured I shall never endure a
     moment's uneasiness on your account. Here he comes, regular as the rising sun, and quite as
     welcome."</p>
<p>After all the lively badinage of Captain De Crespigny's first reception was over, Marion
     quietly retreated into the deep embrasure of a window, where her work-table stood, and busied
     herself with answering some notes, while almost entirely shaded from observation; yet still
     Captain De Crespigny's eye incessantly wandered to the place where she sat, for there was
     something unintentionally <hi xml:lang="fr">piquante</hi> in the total indifference with which
     she thus secluded herself from his attentions and civilities. Observing, at length, that Marion
     had begun carefully pruning the dead leaves from a bouquet of rather drooping flowers, which
     seemed still vainly affecting to look fresh and gay, he broke off in the middle of a sentence
     from Agnes, and clandestinely approaching the table when Marion was looking in another
     direction, he stole them all away, and substituted one so fresh and fragrant that Marion
     uttered an exclamation of rapturous admiration. She neither blushed nor looked down, however;
     but as if it were no more than an every day civility, held it up to Agnes for admiration, and
     endeavored to attract her towards the table by the perfume of her beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>"Nothing withered or blighted should ever be here," said Captain De Crespigny, in his most
     sentimental tone. "I should like, in one respect, to resemble flowers, which give nothing but
     pleasure to all who see them. Are you writing prose, or is this Poet's Corner? If I had the pen
     of Moore, I could find one subject for my muse more beautiful than any he ever wrote upon, and
     feelings more deep than he ever expressed! My eyes have ached for the last half hour with
     trying to see you; and half my eye-strings are cracked with looking from so great a
     distance."</p>
<p>Marion was now seriously annoyed, and a glow of indignant vexation mantled upon her cheek;
     but Captain De Crespigny, mistaking her blushes and silence, began to flatter himself that the
     fortress was not so impregnable as he had feared. A scrap of paper lay on the table, which
     Marion had carelessly flung aside, after trying a pen, by writing down several times her own
     Christian name, and Captain De Crespigny having picked it up, laughingly added to it the name
     of De Crespigny.</p>
<p>"How does this look?" asked he, showing her the signature of "Marion De Crespigny," while a
     gleam of light shot through his dark eye-lashes. "This is a valuable autograph, which I shall
     certainly preserve. The signature is not yet a common one, but I hope it may become so, as no
     other looks half so well to my eye—or to my heart."</p>
<p>"There may be another that I should very much prefer," replied Marion, decidedly, while the
     bright carnation mounted to her cheek, and she turned her large eyes towards Agnes, who stood
     at some distance placid and secure, in the certain belief that her own supremacy was
     established, and that the conversation probably related to herself. "Give me back that paper,
     Captain De Crespigny, for it contains a mischievous forgery—a name that can never exist upon
     the earth."</p>
<p>"But it may in fairy-land, and it shall!" replied he, with undaunted pertinacity. "The fates
     are perpetually weaving people together, and may do something for me! When we are unwillingly
     separated for a short period, sometime hereafter, I shall every day see this name appended to
     the most interesting accounts of your garden, your lap-dog, and——"</p>
<p>"And my sister!" added Marion, coldly. "She is always the first object of interest to me.
     Agnes! do come here and admire the last few stitches I have added to this bible-cover."</p>
<p>"How well it will look at Beaujolie Park!" muttered De Crespigny, almost inaudibly, in that
     low musical voice which had been irresistible, and with a significance of manner which Marion
     seemed not to remark. "I hope one day to see it there."</p>
<p>"I intend it as a present to Agnes," replied Marion, dryly.—"That and the prayer-book are
     both for her dressing-table."</p>
<p>Captain De Crespigny, assuming a look of respectful despondency, examined the volumes during
     several minutes in silence; but having accidentally opened the service of matrimony, he
     smilingly pointed it out to Marion, saying, "he hoped this might be considered a good omen,"
     and doubling down the page, he placed the prayer-book opposite to her, saying, "Let me request
     you will study that till we meet again, as I wish to ask your opinion of it."</p>
<p>Before Marion had time to reply, or to hurry away, as she had been for some time projecting,
     Agnes advanced with an air of exceedingly forced vivacity, while there was a perceptible
     flutter of anger in her tone, and Marion felt as much confused as if she had been guilty of a
     real indiscretion, when she saw that her sister's face had become as white as the wall, her
     eyes glassy, and her manner unusually excited, though she tried to assume a careless tone,
     saying:</p>
<p>"What is all the world talking about here? Captain De Crespigny, you must have learned the
     whole mysteries of worsted work by this time!"</p>
<p>"I was merely showing your sister that most interesting of all compositions, the marriage
     service," replied Captain De Crespigny, throwing as much meaning into his voice as it could
     carry, "and mentioning that the fashionable blacksmith for these occasions now is my cousin,
     the Dean of Chester."</p>
<p>Agnes looked down with an interesting blush, and Marion looked up with a start of
     astonishment, at the hardened intrepidity of manner in which Captain De Crespigny carried on
     his double game, adapting his tone equally to suit either or both of his companions; and it was
     with a sensation of extreme relief that she saw him at last rise to take leave, looking most
     charmingly distressed; but he had glanced at his watch, "never being able to measure time at
     St. John's Lodge," and an unlucky engagement obliged him to depart.</p>
<p>"All engagements are unlucky," observed Agnes, impatiently. "I never made one yet, without
     afterwards finding it a tyrannical restraint."</p>
<p>"There is only one engagement I ever wish to make," replied Captain De Crespigny, in a
     sentimental voice, but carefully looking at nobody. "I hope soon to make an engagement for
     life!"</p>
<p>"What is all this!" exclaimed Sir Patrick, entering the room. "Can De Crespigny not be
     persuaded into remaining with you two or three hours longer, girls?"</p>
<p>"We have not yet tried the experiment," replied Marion, seeing Agnes unwilling to speak. "I
     intend to be busy this morning reading your favorite character in Shakespeare, Malvolio. He had
     the very common fault of over-estimating himself."</p>
<p>"To some people that is impracticable!" replied Captain De Crespigny, with a self-satisfied
     smile. "The world really spoils me for one."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," observed Sir Patrick, "you flatter yourself, and that is the most dangerous of all
     flattery."</p>
<p>"Not to me! I only wish it were possible for me to think as much of myself as every body else
     does."</p>
<p>"I hear old Doncaster is likely to make a die of it soon; therefore wait till you are
     established at Beaujolie Park, and then you shall see how much we all think of you!" replied
     Sir Patrick, laughing. "I hope you mean to be the most hospitable Marquis in the whole peerage
     of England?"</p>
<p>"Most undoubtedly! Hospitality is my weakness, if I have any! Dunbar, my very dear friend, I
     make a point of your coming to dine with me once a-year at Beaujolie Park! I am sorry it will
     not be in my power to offer you a bed; but the Highflyer passes my door at nine every evening.
     I wish for a very long visit from you! We are old friends, my good fellow! so I must really
     stretch a point! I am quite serious! therefore come by the early mail for breakfast, and take
     the evening one for your departure! I always was, and always shall be the most hospitable man
     upon earth! Have you half a moment to spare to-morrow? I want you to help me in my bargain for
     a bay horse with Duncombe of ours. He has the prettiest sister in the world, if that will be
     any inducement to come. I wish he would throw her into the bargain! Good morning! I could not
     stay a minute longer to save all your lives!"</p>
<p>"How I do sometimes hate Captain De Crespigny!" exclaimed Agnes, with angry vehemence, after
     he had made a very conceited exit from her presence, accompanied by Sir Patrick, while she
     watched him from the window, as he sprang upon his horse, and galloped out of sight. "I know he
     is perfectly devoted to me! I cannot allow myself to doubt it! My whole happiness in life is
     cast on that die, and must not be lost! No!" continued she, speaking to Marion in a tone of
     unwonted perplexity, "it would indeed be a disgraceful triumph, to awaken in my heart
     affections which, if they must die, I shall die with them. My hopes and feelings appear all
     frozen into icicles this morning; yet I can scarcely tell why! A sensation of utter
     discouragement torments me! What is man, and what is woman that trusts him? If all my happiness
     is now torn up by the roots, I shall never again incur the grief of forming any earthly plan! I
     shall continue for life a bankrupt in hope and peace! Do not speak to me, Marion! Do not look
     as if you believed the worst! I will not hear it! I know you wish to say and do all that is
     kind; but I detest sympathy! I abhor being pitied! and I will not be advised."</p>
<p>Even after she had retired to the gloomy solitude of her lonely room, Agnes buried her face
     in her hands, as if she would hide herself from the whole world, and struggled to banish
     thought; yet the suspicion would force itself into her mind, that Captain De Crespigny intended
     to treat her as she had seen him treat others; and though formerly she had often laughed at the
     credulity of those girls who believed half the rubbish he talked to them, now she repeated to
     herself all his professions of admiration, his looks, smiles, innuendoes, implied flattery, and
     openly expressed interest, till her cheek regained its bloom, her eyes their brightness, and
     she looked into her mirror with perfectly restored self-complacency, and with renovated
     confidence in the truth, honor, and sincerity of Captain De Crespigny.</p>
