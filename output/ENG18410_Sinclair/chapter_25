<head>  CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<p>When Captain De Crespigny called two days after this at St. John's Lodge, to take leave
     before setting out for Yorkshire, he looked so absent and so agitated, that Agnes became quite
     elated and flattered by what she attributed to his unconquerable regret at being obliged to
     take so long a leave of herself. She even forgave him for enquiring almost immediately what had
     become of Marion, and answered with careless vivacity, "She is gone to her favorite home at
     Portobello. Marion perfectly idolises her uncle. I should require to attend a series of
     lectures on naval tactics, and to take a course of nautical novels for a month, before I could
     get on with the Admiral as she does! My sister talks about the battles of Trafalgar and
     Camperdown, as if she had fought at them herself, but really somehow or other, I never can find
     a word for good, worthy sir Arthur!"</p>
<p>"And yet," observed Sir Patrick, "you never seem very much at a loss for conversation, Agnes,
     when I have the pleasure of seeing you! It is years, countless years, since I have entered his
     house, or since he has entered mine; but suppose we go down together some day, and cut out
     Marion at once, by doing the agreeable in our very best and most fascinating style!"</p>
<p>"If my uncle Doncaster were such a man, I should certainly make up to him greatly!" said
     Captain De Crespigny, in a tone more than commonly in earnest. "It would be well worth your
     while to try."</p>
<p>"Sir Arthur has nothing to leave! you are quite mistaken there!" replied Agnes,
     inadvertently. "When we were perfect children, and all on the very best terms, he used to say
     that it would be quite enough for an old sailor like him, if he could bequeath us his watch and
     enough to bury him! As Pat says, he might make his will on his thumb-nail. Oh! rest assured he
     has nothing to leave!"</p>
<p>"I did not suppose he had," continued Captain De Crespigny, gravely. "A small income in his
     liberal hand has done more good than the very largest in any other person's. It is an odd
     phenomenon in nature, that the lightest purse always is the most open to others, while the
     heavier a purse grows the more its mouth becomes contracted! A sort of spasmodic affection, I
     think!"</p>
<p>"I wonder if it will ever be engraved on people's tomb-stones how much they die worth?" said
     Agnes. "That would be all the good many people can ever get by their wealth, and what they are
     much more proud of, in this mercenary world, than of any personal good qualities."</p>
<p>"Young ladies are for ever working me purses, and I have nothing to put in them!" exclaimed
     Sir Patrick, throwing his own up in the air, and catching it again. "Sir Arthur and I are both
     fighting under the banner of poverty now; and that one word expresses in a small compass all
     earthly annoyance."</p>
<p>"Oh, no! There are many things worse!" exclaimed Agnes magnanimously. "What a vulgar, low,
     mercenary idea! so like you, Patrick!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Agnes! If your good opinion were worth a farthing, I should grudge to have lost
     it!"</p>
<p>"But Dunbar! <hi xml:lang="fr">revenons a nos moutons</hi>," interrupted Captain De
     Crespigny, trying to look indifferent. "Surely there is no just cause or impediment why we may
     not ride down to Portobello this morning, and call on good, worthy Sir Arthur together. It is a
     perfect disgrace to us both that we never go near his house, much as I always have respected
     him, and always shall."</p>
<p>"This is a very sudden fit of cordiality! When did you feel the first symptoms coming on?"
     asked Sir Patrick drily, while Agnes began vehemently winding some skeins of silk. "Let me feel
     your pulse, De Crespigny. I am ready to bet your uncle against mine—and the odds are
     considerable—that half an hour since, you would no more have thought of paying a P.P.C. visit
     to old Sir Arthur, than to Lord Nelson's monument. My dear fellow, I know you—and you ought to
     know me better than to suppose me capable of paying a dull, penitential visit there!"</p>
<p>"Well, be it so! This is no time for me to recommend disinterested attentions, Dunbar, as I
     am on wing for Yorkshire, obliged during a whole long dreary month to play the amiable! Did you
     ever try that experiment, Miss Dunbar?"</p>
<p>"Of being amiable? no, never! I am not come to that yet! Whenever people mention a young lady
     as being amiable, you may depend upon it she has nothing better to recommend her. I leave mere
     hum-drum good qualities to such people as Clara Granville."</p>
<p>"Omit her in your conversation altogether, Agnes! I told you already, that she must never be
     named here," interrupted Sir Patrick, with angry vehemence. "Why will you continually intrude
     that family on our conversation?"</p>
<p>"I do not, Patrick. I beg leave to deny the honorable gentleman's last assertion! It is three
     days at least since I have so much as named Clara Gran——"</p>
<p>Before Agnes could finish her sentence, Sir Patrick, always afraid to trust his temper when
     irritated, as he knew the hurricane to be fearful if allowed to rage, had strode to the door,
     and burst out of the room, as if the very house were scarcely large enough to hold him. This
      <hi xml:lang="fr">denouement</hi> Agnes had confidently anticipated, being perfectly aware
     that her brother never withstood a second repetition of Clara's name, therefore she had
     artfully tried the experiment of producing an explosion, which might at any hazard expel him,
     and secure to herself a <hi xml:lang="fr">tete-a-tete</hi> leave-taking with Captain De
     Crespigny, from whom she now confidently anticipated a formal declaration.</p>
<p>When Sir Patrick's angry footsteps died away in the distance, it was not without some real
     agitation, therefore, and a great deal more assumed, that Agnes allowed her long, dark
     eye-lashes to droop over her cheek, and called up a rather ostentatious blush, while she sat
     for several minutes in silent embarrassment; but though Captain De Crespigny assumed his most
     fascinating expression, he seemed resolute not to begin the dialogue; and while affecting to be
     considerably embarrassed himself, an arch smile nevertheless glittered in his eye, and played
     about his mouth.</p>
<p>"Is it true," asked Agnes, at length, in a subdued voice, and without looking up, "that you
     are actually going for some months to-morrow? I must tie a knot on my pocket handkerchief, not
     to forget you during so long an absence."</p>
<p>"I would much rather tie a knot of a different kind," said Captain De Crespigny, in his usual
     rallying tone. "But necessity has no law. Going, going, gone! Positively the last time! Knocked
     down to Miss Dunbar. A great bargain. The best article on hand."</p>
<p>"You are an admirable auctioneer, and shall dispose of me next," said Agnes, laughingly
     selecting a rose-bud from her bouquet. "I must give you something to take away, very beautiful,
     and which I am sure you will like."</p>
<p>"That must be yourself, then," replied Captain De Crespigny, looking most cruelly charming.
     "I hear the young ladies are all to wear black crape on their left arm after my exit. I did
     expect a public dinner from them, but that is too common-place. My tailor received one lately
     on removing from one street to another, and the waiter at Carlisle on retiring from his
     profession. I wonder nobody ever voted me a testimonial. My speech on the occasion would be
     exquisite."</p>
<p>"Patrick thinks you very much addicted to make speeches," replied Agnes, with sly emphasis.
     "I suppose, as you are setting out so suddenly, that Lord Doncaster is seriously ill now. A
     number of old people have died off lately. He must be two hundred at least, for I have heard of
     him so long! I remember three years ago hearing that his memory had failed."</p>
<p>"Not at all—not in the very least. He thinks himself younger and handsomer every year. He is
     actually addicted still to flirtation in all its branches. He told me the last time we parted,
     that many ladies, if he chose, would prefer him to me. Perhaps they might. I dare say he was in
     the right. We never grow old in our family—never! and we have all excellent memories,"
     continued Captain De Crespigny, fixing his dangerous eyes on Agnes. "Mine will be stored with
     many never-to-be forgotten recollections of the last few months, 'remembered,' as public
     orators say, 'till the latest moment of my existence.' Memory has put all these scenes in her
     pocket for me, to be enjoyed hereafter; and how delightful would a life-time be, made up of
     such hours as I have spent in this house! I feel myself striking root in it, like a cutting of
     geranium!"</p>
<p>"Indeed!" replied Agnes, smiling most benignly; "geraniums are very great favorites of
     mine—very great, indeed—so I wish you were metamorphosed into one."</p>
<p>"If all the events of life could be modelled on a plan of my own, what a pleasant little
     place the world would be!" said Captain De Crespigny, admiring the polish of his boots. "I
     might then continue here some time longer, as a volunteer in the corps of your victims, who are
     as numerous now as a disbanded army. Do pray let us call over the muster-roll of your admirers
     and count them. I could die in my chair with curiosity to know how many they are!"</p>
<p>"Not above three or four cases of life and death!" said Agnes, laughing. "But you jest at
     scars who never felt a wound."</p>
<p>"I most heartily sympathize with them all," replied Captain De Crespigny, with an
     extra-sentimental sigh. "I have gone through every sorrow of life myself—outraged affections,
     and all that sort of thing. You cannot conceive, Miss Dunbar, how like we victims are sometimes
     to the frog in the fable, inflated with empty hopes."</p>
<p>"I must shut my eyes to that."</p>
<p>"Your eyes should never be shut. They are much too beautiful! With respect to your admirers,
     they might say, like the weather-cock to the wind, '<hi xml:lang="fr">Si vous ne changez pas,
      je suis constante!</hi>' The whole world has been pulling caps for you all winter, and you
     pretend to have limited yourself to three or four victims! Impossible! You are concealing the
     half of them! Forgetting Captains A——, B——, C——, and D——. I have as many young ladies as that
     dying for me. Now, do let us run over an authentic list of their names. Show me all your
     court-yards at once. I could bet the finest camellia at Loddige's, that you do not name them
     all."</p>
<p>"Who shall I say?" exclaimed Agnes, getting up an extempore blush, and her archest smiles. "I
     have a most inhospitable memory for bores, and shall forget two-thirds of them. Captain Digby,
     slightly wounded; Colonel Meade, pierced through the heart; Captain O'Brien, slowly recovering;
     Mr. Deveril, despaired of; Lord Wigton,——"</p>
<p>"Killed outright!" interrupted Captain De Crespigny. "You mention him in rather a more
     relenting tone than the rest, like Bonaparte, when he wept over one wounded man, alter
     condemning hundreds to death. But you are come to a period already. Is there no other worthy of
     remembrance?"</p>
<p>"Only one, whom I cannot name!" replied Agnes, turning away. "Last, but not least."</p>
<p>"Ah! some poor fellow with nothing, I suppose—waiting, perhaps, for the death of a rich
     relation; but those tiresome old bores always live for ever, and a day besides. Whoever he is,
     let me advise you not to think of him; a man should as soon ask the sun in the hemisphere to
     wait for him, as a young lady in the full blaze of her beauty and attractions. No, no, Miss
     Dunbar, take my advice. Be like time and tide. I have a real cousinly interest in your welfare,
     and should be delighted, on my return, to find this room fragrant with cake, and glittering
     with favors. I shall come down on purpose, if you ask me! I positively shall!"</p>
<p>If a look could kill, Captain De Crespigny must have withered away beneath the glance of
     Agnes' eyes, which streamed with indignant flashes of anger and surprise; but unconscious,
     apparently, of being otherwise than most agreeable, he continued, in his most captivating
     manner.</p>
<p>"I must be off now to Macleay's. Half a dozen friends are dying to obtain a likeness of me,
     and a deputation of ladies made me promise lately to sit for them. I wonder what can induce me
     to take so much trouble," added he, with a gay, triumphant laugh. "The painter is quite afraid
     he shall be robbed and murdered for it."</p>
<p>"Humility is not certainly your cardinal virtue," said Agnes, with a look of angry scorn,
     which few could have withstood. "You cultivate an extensive acquaintance."</p>
<p>"Very! I must really see whether people can be induced to cut me, for it is exceedingly
     troublesome. I know sixty-four families with three young ladies in each. It would puzzle the
     calculating machine to make out how many that amounts to. But, meantime, I must unwillingly say
     the most hateful of all words—farewell. I have been putting off time here, expecting Dunbar for
     the last half hour, though little able to afford so many minutes. My idiot of a watch must
     surely be too slow, or your brother would have been back about the sale of mad Tom. I have
     twenty minds to buy him, if Dunbar did not ask so very long a price."</p>
<p>"You are intending, I believe," asked Agnes, "to enter him for the—the Chiltern
     Hundreds?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly! but the Doncaster St. Leger. He would be the first horse in that line, though
     asses are perfectly accustomed to them. Good morning! <hi xml:lang="fr">au revoir!</hi> I mean
     to Londonize for a few weeks, then go to Paris, and afterwards disperse myself over every
     corner of the uncivilized globe. Can I do anything for you anywhere? Geneva velvets? Parisian
     bonnets? Swiss muslins? I am at your service in every quarter of the world. May I beg my very
     best regards to your sister."</p>
<p>So saying, Captain De Crespigny bowed himself out of the room, with very much the air of a
     popular actor who expects three rounds of applause, and Agnes having, with a face as unmoved as
     if it had been enamelled, coldly given him her hand, with an ill-supported smile on her
     quivering lip, wished him a pleasant journey, and turned almost haughtily away; a bolt of ice
     seemed to have fallen upon her heart, and in that small moment was comprised the agony of ages;
     but the greatest wonder in nature is the entire self-command given to many, and especially to
     women, by means of which they can hear what involves the happiness of a life-time, and yet
     betray no visible emotion.</p>
<p>The strongest feelings on earth never are discovered. Feeble minds can conceal nothing, but
     those who have strength of mind to suffer most deeply, are those who have strength of mind also
     to hide what they do endure. On slight occasions, Agnes was a most accomplished fainter; but
     now, having stood, with a specious smile on her countenance, till the door had finally closed,
     she rushed to the privacy of her own room, and closed the door, then seating herself, in all
     the luxury of solitude, she meditated with silent astonishment on all that had passed.</p>
<p>No coroner's inquest can be summoned on a deceased flirtation, and whether it die a natural
     death or a violent one never can be known, as it may be caused merely by some trifling
     oversight, perhaps by the cruel aspersion of an enemy, or simply by whim and caprice, as in
     this case seemed the most probable, and to Agnes the most mortifying. Wounded in all her most
     sensitive feelings, a crowd of angry and depressing thoughts crowded into her brain, while she
     could not but feel that the arrows which had struck her were most cruelly barbed and most
     skilfully aimed. It was harrowing to her vain, proud spirit, to imagine that Captain De
     Crespigny could really be indifferent. It seemed, indeed, almost impossible! Could his
     carelessness be all assumed! Had he, indeed, an honorable scruple of engaging her upon the
     uncertainty of his uncle's demise. It might be so. Agnes felt that entire despondency would
     come soon enough, if come it must; and anxious to believe in Captain De Crespigny's attachment,
     she seemed now resolved to keep up the farce with herself a little longer. She felt certain
     that he had cast back a look of regret on leaving the room, which spoke volumes, and these
     volumes she filled up according to her own imagination. The parting had, perhaps, been as
     painful to Captain De Crespigny as to herself, but what could he do if Lord Doncaster always
     continued to be the "undying one," standing in the way of their mutual happiness. Agnes now
     lived over every scene which had passed between herself and her supposed lover. She could not
     imagine those feelings expressed to any other which seemed created by herself alone. She
     recapitulated all his civilities to herself, remembered how his last sigh had been sighed, how
     his last look had been looked; and, after a glance at the mirror, which proved as usual an
     effectual safety-valve to any feelings of mortification, she became at last restored to the
     agreeable conviction, that the most considerate, self-denying, and constant of lovers was
     Captain De Crespigny.</p>
<p>"And," exclaimed Agnes, with another triumphant glance at the mirror, "as he said only
     yesterday, '<hi xml:lang="fr">on peut fuir sans oublier</hi>.' Let him admire any other if he
     can!"</p>
