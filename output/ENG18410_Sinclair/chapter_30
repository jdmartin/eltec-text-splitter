<p>"Patrick," exclaimed Agnes, hurrying into Sir Arthur's sitting-room the morning after her
     brother's arrival at the Granby, while a brilliant color lighted up her cheek, and her eyes
     sparkled with animation, "Lord Wigton is coming in a few minutes to hear me sing that new song
     of Bellini's, therefore pray tell the waiters we are not at home to any living mortal, and do
     hold this music till I give a last touch to my ringlets."</p>
<p>Agnes impatiently held out a large roll of paper, but almost screamed with astonishment on
     looking up, to perceive that she had addressed Captain De Crespigny, evidently that moment
     arrived from a long journey.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Miss Dunbar. We are well met!" said he, with rather satirical emphasis. "I am
     in a very cut-throat humor to-day, and shall certainly put an end to little Lord Wigton!"</p>
<p>"You have nearly put an end to me," replied Agnes, unable to steady her voice; "but I am
     rather glad to see you! Perhaps you may be allowed to remain here, though that tiresome man
     does so teaze me about singing."</p>
<p>"Wigton told me he was coming to see, or rather to hear Marion!" said Sir Patrick, emerging
     from a distant window.</p>
<p>"To hear me!" exclaimed Marion, with unfeigned surprise and perplexity, while thunder and
     lightning both lowered on the forehead of her sister. "That must be a mistake! I heard nothing
     of any appointment, and have not had a minute's conversation with Lord Wigton since we arrived
     at Harrowgate. He heard me only once by accident, and probably never will again."</p>
<p>"Unless by design!" whispered Agnes, angrily. "Marion, you have certainly some underhand way
     of getting on with people, which baffles my comprehension!"</p>
<p>Marion turned away, and silently resumed her place beside Sir Arthur, who had been amusing
     himself by standing at the window, while she told him what carriages came round to the door,
     what parties of pleasure were setting out or returning, and what travelling equipages appeared
     in sight, of which seldom fewer than ten or twelve arrived in a day; and by ascertaining the
     coat-of-arms or coronets emblazoned on the panels, she sometimes formed a tolerable accurate
     guess who might probably be their occupants. After talking together with great vivacity for
     some time, Sir Arthur suddenly felt the arm of Marion on which he was leaning, give an almost
     convulsive start, while she seemed with difficulty to suppress a half-uttered exclamation of
     delighted astonishment. She now leaned eagerly out of the window, to examine a travelling
     chariot which had driven up to the door, from whence a lady, apparently in the utmost extreme
     of weakness, was carefully supported out by a gentleman, and before another moment could
     elapse, Marion had rushed down stairs, and was clasped in the arms of Clara Granville.</p>
<p>"Did you get my letter?" exclaimed her friend, in feeble and agitated accents, while, after
     the first rapturous greetings, they had retired alone into a sitting-room. "No! is that
     possible? How could the post have been so long delayed? But perhaps it may be as well, for
     there was grief as much as joy in it."</p>
<p>Marion observed now with alarm, that the appearance of Clara, always interesting, had become
     almost painfully so. The summer bloom had entirely vanished from her face, and not only had her
     form shrunk, but there was a deep and settled sadness in the expression of her eye, when she
     added,</p>
<p>"The doctors have ordered me to go by easy stages abroad, but they recommended me first to
     try a few weeks here. The sight of you will do me more good than any medicine, and I had little
     difficulty—very little indeed, Marion—in persuading Richard to take the Granby on our way to
     the south of France, where we are to go health-hunting and scenery-hunting during the
     approaching winter; but you must see now, as I do, and as everybody does, except my dear
     brother himself, that I am hastening fast to that country where the sun always shines, and the
     flowers never fade."</p>
<p>A start of indescribable emotion now shot through the heart of Marion, for in the pallid,
     emaciated countenance of Clara, she already read a sentence of death, and she gazed upon her
     friend with a growing conviction, which filled her heart with anguish, that soon, very soon
     they must be separated for ever! but Miss Granville, observing her emotion, affectionately
     added, "Few have more reason to value their lives than myself, Marion, and mine I shall do all
     in my power to preserve. We ought to be perfectly and cheerfully satisfied with every event as
     it comes, and while I have such a brother as Richard, my existence is precious to me. I know,
     however, that at all events another will reward him for his kindness to me, and one whom he
     values even more than his sister has happily learned to appreciate him as I do! Indeed, how
     could it be otherwise? My home will soon be an eternal world, and if I might have a choice, the
     sooner, perhaps, the better. It grieves me to take my brother now from his duties, without a
     single hope of my own restoration. I know that, for I feel it here! Change of air and scene can
     do no permanent good, and I wish we had been allowed to remain stationary, as it matters little
     where I die, compared with the importance to many of where Richard lives."</p>
<p>Marion's voice, the faithful index to her feelings, trembled with emotion when she replied;
     but a moment afterwards, a smile of pleasure lighted up her dark speaking eyes, when Mr.
     Granville hastened into the room, with a look of animated happiness on again meeting Marion,
     and his whole countenance had that look of deep sensibility which becomes externally visible,
     when the whole mind and heart have been awakened to those affections which end with life, and
     only then. To cover their confusion, and conceal her own feelings, Clara assumed a tone of
     unwonted vivacity, saying, with an affectation of extreme gravity, "Allow me to introduce my
     brother,—Miss Dunbar, Mr. Granville! I can recommend both as desirable acquaintances, and hope
     you may find each other out by degrees! My duty is done, and now it is your own fault if you
     are not speedily friends!"</p>
<p>Marion became every day more conscious that no one can appreciate the real joys and the real
     sorrows of human life but those who live for its friendships and attachments, while she would
     have thought wealth or rank, without affection, like a body without a soul; but Agnes cared
     comparatively little by whose means she obtained her title, equipages, and diamonds, provided
     they were likely to excite envy and admiration. In her estimation, the coarsest materials of
     happiness were the most to be coveted, and the marriage contract, instead of being anticipated
     in the light in which it would have appeared to Marion, as giving her the privilege of devoting
     a life-time to the happiness of the person she loved best on earth, was merely contemplated as
     entitling her to an expensive <hi xml:lang="fr">trousseau</hi>, a large establishment, and a
     set of family jewels. In the mind of Agnes, Captain De Crespigny seemed only an appendage to
     his future rank and future expectations, while she rehearsed over her own coming greatness with
     exulting anticipations; but Mr. Granville might have lost all that mortal man can lose, even
     life itself, and still retained the same place as at first in Marion's affection. The depth of
     her feelings was tempered, however, by the supremacy of yet higher and holier duties and hopes,
     those of sound and enlightened devotion, in which it was her greatest happiness to think that
     she had at length secured "a guide, philosopher, and friend."</p>
<p>No man knew the world more thoroughly, or had viewed it on both sides with more careful
     scrutiny than Captain De Crespigny, who often boasted that he saw the working of people's minds
     as if their heads were like a glass bee-hive, and yet he was completely perplexed, on arriving
     at Harrowgate, to account for the extraordinary intimacy which had sprung up so suddenly
     between the beautiful Agnes and his whimsical old—, but certainly not venerable relative, Lord
     Doncaster. It seemed to him at first a laughable jest, but before long he became struck by the
     increased coldness of his uncle's manner, which was, if possible, more cynical and repulsive
     than ever, since the time when Agnes had inadvertently irritated the vanity of Lord Doncaster
     by her incautious jests during their first interview.</p>
<p>Curiosity now induced Captain De Crespigny, in some degree, to resume that intimacy with
     Agnes, which he came intending entirely to discontinue; for he had meant that his attentions
     should be solely and exclusively devoted to the captivation of her still more fascinating
     sister, whom he was intent upon adding to the list of his conquests; but Marion continued to
     receive Captain De Crespigny with careless civility, resolved apparently to forget all that had
     hitherto been unpleasant or pleasant between them, while every moment she could spare from
     attending to her uncle was dedicated to the Granvilles. Clara never left her private
     sitting-room, partly from bodily weakness, but chiefly to avoid meeting Sir Patrick, whom she
     had not expected to find at Harrowgate,—and his name never passed her lips except once, when in
     answer to a remark of Marion's, she said, "I shun another meeting with your brother, not from
     indifference,—very far from that. If I were only more safe from the attachments and delusions
     of this world, it would be unnecessary to avoid him as I do; but I am consoled for my own
     sorrows, Marion, by thinking of my brother's happiness, and by believing that you will
     hereafter value and experience together the affection of reason and principle, with a
     sufficient tinge of romance to give it some flavor."</p>
<p>"In that case," replied Marion, frankly, while a bright color glowed on her cheek, "I should
     think myself gifted with the largest share of happiness that the world can offer, and much more
     than the whole world could bestow, if unaccompanied by the hope of that felicity we are
     promised beyond it."</p>
<p>"And which I shall share with you at last, though the joy of this world I cannot remain to
     see and to partake of, with those who have all my affection and all my prayers," replied Clara,
     solemnly, while her lips trembled with a smile such as floats sometimes on the countenance of a
     Christian at last, "when all the mortal dies."</p>
