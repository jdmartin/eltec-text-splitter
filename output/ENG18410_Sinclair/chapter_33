<head>  CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
<p>Marion and Sir Arthur were engaged next morning to meet the Granvilles at breakfast in the
     private parlor of Mrs. Crawford, and they had advanced considerably in the consumption of their
     muffin and first cup of tea, when a very plainly dressed young lady glided into the room with a
     timid, agitated step, and giving a slight nod to the party, silently seated herself beside
     Marion, who, in compassion to her apparent shyness, averted her eyes. She seemed recently
     recovered from an illness, being thin and emaciated to excess, while it appeared as if her hair
     had been entirely shaved off, as she wore a cap fitting close to her face, and neither curl nor
     braid to vary the almost spectral whiteness of her whole aspect. Marion ventured a second
     glance at the interesting invalid, and observed a smile quivering about her mouth, which she
     seemed vainly endeavoring to suppress, and a sly glance towards herself, which enlightened her
     in a moment, for, with an exclamation of joy, she sprang from her seat and was instantly
     embraced, with laughing delight, by her old friend Caroline, whom she had lately learned to
     know as Miss Howard, the heiress of countless thousands,—not the more, nor the less dear to her
     on that account, but still the beloved companion of all her early frolics and school
     enjoyments.</p>
<p>"I wished to try your powers of recognition, and Sir Arthur's," said Caroline, with tears of
     laughing and almost hysterical joy. "I am changed—greatly changed, so that my best friends
     could scarcely recognise me, and if my enemies were also deceived it would be well. Dear
     Marion! I am still pursued and persecuted by that wretched madman, the terror of our school
     days, the horror of all my subsequent life! My aunt finds her nerves so shattered with the
     whole affair, that our kind friends here have undertaken me for a week or two, and it is
     thought that, amidst the crowd collected at Harrowgate, I may be in comparative safety. My life
     has been rendered almost a burden to me in the country, where not a corner of the earth seemed
     safe from that wretched creature's intrusions, and it is thought that he must bribe some of our
     servants to betray all my plans; yet, among them all, I scarcely know whom to suspect or whom
     to trust! Remember, dear Marion, that here I am to be treated as some humble cousin of Mr.
     Crawford's, and on no account let your brother, or a living soul in the house, suspect that you
     ever saw me before. Agnes also must keep my secret, and Mrs. O'Donoghoe, who has heard nothing
     of my real history, agrees to be my <hi>chaperon</hi>."</p>
<p>"Then you should adopt her name, for Patrick always calls the widow, 'Mrs.
     I-don't-know-who.'"</p>
<p>The most agreeable conversations are those of which there is generally least to be repeated,
     and that which followed round the cheerful breakfast-table at Mr. Crawford's, was carried
     tranquilly on, in a pleasing animated tone, on subjects of immediate interest as well as of
     permanent importance, showing, in the most prepossessing colors, characters, and feelings,
     inspired by the finest impulses which adorn the heart and mind of a Christian. Amidst the
     enlightened discussions and unreserved vivacity of a conversation, displaying the ease and
     fascination of high life, without its flippancy, frivolity, and pretension, those who have
     lived to discover that what is called the gay world, is sometimes but a dull world after all,
     might there have learned for what important purposes the power of speech and the power of
     thought have been given, if rightly used and enjoyed. There was the joyous relaxation of happy
     hearts and well-ordered minds, without the effervescence of empty affectation, or the flash of
     bewildering excitement, which Marion had lately been accustomed to find among those who seemed
     little better employed than Domitian of old, in catching flies, and who prefer living upon
     exaggerated trifles, to enjoying that calm, rational and intellectual intercourse which is
     registered in the heart for ever.</p>
<p>With feelings of deep and animated pleasure, Marion gathered from Mr. Granville a rich
     harvest of sound opinions, amiable sentiments, and original ideas, while, with the free-masonry
     of real attachment, many a sentence, which seemed addressed by him to the whole company,
     attained its full meaning only in her heart. Richard was very seldom, as Agnes expressed it,
     "tuned up to nonsense pitch." He wasted none of his hours on the mere flummeries of
     conversation, but the frequent sparkling of his wit shone the brighter for its occasional
     gravity; and never had Marion seen him in a more buoyant and happy frame than now, when
     developing the thoughts and affections of a mind and heart cultivated to the highest tone of
     refinement, fortified by the strongest principles of religion, and imbued with a supreme regard
     for all that is noble, generous, or graceful in the conduct and characters.</p>
<p>To Sir Arthur, the social circle imparted feelings of inestimable happiness. He had long
     considered human life as having nothing left for him now, but the one great opportunity to
     prepare for eternity, not to be trifled away in its smallest details; and he had remarked to
     Marion the evening before, after spending an hour in the public saloon, "I tire more of that
     Vanity Fair in the next room, than I would of breaking stones on the road! I should become an
     idiot before long, if I lived the sort of butterfly-life they do here, in a whirl of exhausting
     and frivolous amusement."</p>
<p>The respectful deference paid by Mr. Granville to his age, his infirmities, and his high
     character, was in itself most gratifying to Sir Arthur; but more than all, he now saw his
     beloved Marion, surrounded by those who loved and valued her, the happiest of the happy.
     Inspired by the desire of pleasing, and unchecked by any fear of being misunderstood or
     misrepresented, there was now a spirit and originality in her expressions, and a native
     eloquence in what she said, enlivened and assisted by a sunlight brilliancy sparkling in her
     eyes, and beaming in her whole countenance, which was beautiful to behold, while her partial
     and affectionate uncle thought there was poetry in her look, and music in every tone of her
     voice.</p>
<p>Their discussions diverged after a time to the scenery and remarkable places around
     Harrowgate, while Mr. Granville, deeply read in antiquity, described with picturesque and most
     felicitous effect, all that seemed best worth visiting in the neighborhood, enlivening his
     animated sketches with many amusing remarks and original anecdotes, and giving to everything he
     treated upon, some new and unexpected interest, while Mr. Crawford varied the subject by an
     entertaining comparison of what he had seen and known abroad, particularly as connected with
     the Roman Catholics of Italy and France.</p>
<p>The convent which existed near Harrowgate having come under consideration, Mr. Crawford
     described at great length what he had seen there during a visit which he had paid to it many
     years before, and recounted several almost traditionary anecdotes of former times, in which the
     names of Lord Doncaster and the Abbe Mordaunt, became almost insensibly blended, very much to
     their discredit, while Marion reflected with wonder and regret that such men were frequently
     now the chosen attendants of her own young and beautiful sister. There was degradation even in
     their looks, and still more in their conversation; but she hoped, trusted, and believed that
     the Abbe's influence would be terminated when Agnes discovered that his attentions were not
     really likely to influence those of Captain De Crespigny.</p>
<p>Mr. Crawford mentioned with peculiar and melancholy interest the very beautiful niece of the
     Abbe Mordaunt, whom it was evident that he had intimately known, and very greatly admired,
     while he awakened the keenest interest in Marion and Miss Howard, by alluding to an abortive
     attempt he had made at Beaujolie Castle, to take a last leave of Miss Mordaunt, after she had
     been beguiled into forsaking the faith of her fathers, and was supposed to be on the point of
     retiring within the walls of a convent.</p>
<p>Marion could not but smile at the description given by Mr. Crawford, of his first and last
     visit to Lord Doncaster, when he had called at Beaujolie Castle sixteen years before, at which
     time the aged peer, though leading a life of retirement, made it by no means a life of
     solitude, as the vices of his early years enslaved him then as they enslaved him still, and the
     libertine of fifty years then, was a libertine now, when tottering on the brink of death. It
     became evident that the proprietor of Beaujolie Castle, though a great lord, was by no means in
     any respect a great man, being penurious in everything except the indulgence of his own vices
     and superstition.</p>
<p>"It makes me shiver yet," said Mr. Crawford, "to remember the large cold hall, paved with a
     curious mosaic of black and white marble, and the chilling, uninhabited room into which I was
     first ushered. Your uncle, Lord Doncaster, Miss Howard, never at that time associated with any
     living individual of his own rank in life. Those who do not cultivate good society, are always
     in bad; and it was supposed that he had strong reasons against admitting any one to his
     residence. The drawing-room was like a lantern with windows on every side, the floor so
     polished that it might have taken fire from the perpetual friction, and a scanty Turkish carpet
     served but to cover half the slippery floor."</p>
<p>"I always wish, in such a room, to be rough-shod," said Sir Arthur, "or to wear skates."</p>
<p>"You will remember, Miss Howard, that no foot was ever allowed by your uncle to tread on its
     icy surface," continued Mr. Crawford, smiling. "But pathways of green baize were laid along the
     floor in every possible direction, where it could be supposed that any reasonable person might
     desire to walk. A broad line stretched from the door to the fire-place, and tributary streams
     of baize branched off towards the sofa in one direction, and the writing-table in another,
     while directly leading towards an invisible door in the book-case, was a still narrower stripe,
     which it required some skill to keep upon rigidly."</p>
<p>"Were no sign-posts raised to point out the proper direction for travellers?" asked Marion.
     "Nor threats of prosecution held up in case of a trespass?"</p>
<p>"No! but I certainly did commit one unawares, for while examining the invisible door, it
     accidentally flew open, when a lady whom I could not distinctly see, hastily concealed herself,
     and beside her stood, without exception, the most beautiful boy I ever beheld, bright and
     radiant like a cherub. When I called him forward, he laughingly disappeared, and no sooner did
     I leave that room, than the door was hastily locked inside."</p>
<p>"It sounds like the prettiest romance imaginable!" exclaimed Marion, eagerly. "In that old
     house, and among so many ancient portraits, what could be more picturesque?"</p>
<p>"A poor relation of Lord Doncaster was at this time the talk of all Yorkshire for her
     beauty," added Mr. Crawford. "Young De Crespigny, then almost a boy, had come home, I remember
     hearing, and admired her only too much; but whether she married, or what became of her, perhaps
     you will tell me, Miss Howard, as I never heard?"</p>
<p>"Then you are not informed of all that has occurred in the world during your natural life,
     though you seem very nearly so!" replied Caroline. "Whenever I hear a story told, I like to put
     a hat on its head, a stick in its hand, and to send it travelling rapidly round the world; but
     the mystery relating to Mary Anstruther was, like that of poor Miss Mordaunt, and of others in
     the same house, carefully hushed up, and my uncle's family soon after moved to Scotland. Louis
     De Crespigny was, even then, I am told, formed to gain and to keep the heart of any girl, with
     a perfect consciousness of his own powers, and very little scruple in using them!"</p>
<p>"He still has a very deep sense of his own supernatural merits," observed Marion, "and finds
     many admirers to agree with him, though I think his uncle must have been still handsomer once.
     The features of both are very peculiar!"</p>
<p>"I often think," said Caroline, coloring and hesitating, "that Sir Arthur's young friend,
     Henry De Lancey, looks as if the whole family of Doncaster had been distilled into one. He has
     the hair dark as midnight, for which my uncle was so celebrated; that remarkable drooping
     eyelid, too, as if his eye-lashes were too heavy to be lifted with ease, and the magnificent
     outline of his profile."</p>
<p>"You are right," exclaimed Sir Arthur, in a deep, low, musing tone. "The madman, Howard or
     Anstruther, who acted so long as my clerk, and still persecutes you, once hinted something of
     the kind, in an unguarded moment. I have been ever since on the watch to strengthen the clue,
     but in vain. If I could but live to see that mystery solved!"</p>
<p>"You shall!" said Caroline playfully. "What should hinder you? I must make it my business
     now, to ferret out more respecting the story of that Miss Mordaunt, which has faded into
     oblivion, like the thousand other wonders of the past.</p>
<quote>
<l>Of course, she lived until she died; but where,</l>
<l>Or when, I never heard; nor you nor I need care."</l>
</quote>
<p>"But I do care," said Sir Arthur, earnestly. "It seems to me, as if there were here some
     scattered links of the chain by which we might discover Henry's origin. Truth has been too long
     already at the bottom of a well; but we must invent some diving-bell to bring her up! It would
     give me satisfaction, whatever his connexions are, to identify them!"</p>
<p>"May he live to wonder at his own good fortune!" said Caroline, gaily. "People must exist
     twenty years in the world, as I have done, before they can find out what a strange place it is,
     and what extraordinary changes occur here sometimes."</p>
<p>Pleasure has a time-piece of its own, which certainly does not adhere to the ordinary
     measure, for hours and minutes most perversely run on, always fastest when it would be most
     agreeable that their course should be delayed. Marion seemed to awaken from a dream of
     enjoyment, when Sir Arthur struck his repeater at last, and found he had remained till nearly
     the hour of luncheon; but, before the party dispersed, they agreed to meet often with closed
     doors, in the same sociable way; and, exchanging a thousand pleasing plans and anticipations of
     coming enjoyment together during the following few weeks, they then separated.</p>
