<head>  CHAPTER XLIV.</head>
<p>During the deepest midnight, the unseen light is still incessantly approaching, though man
     remains insensible of its progress till the glorious dawn of morning; and thus the march of
     coming events hurries daily on unnoticed and unknown. Never before had it appeared, to the
     impatient mind of Agnes, that the sands of her hour-glass fell so slowly and silently. In her
     heart there was scarcely sufficient depth of soil for grief to strike a very permanent root, as
     her superficial feelings were calculated only to produce a mushroom crop of petty discontents
     and selfish grievances. Sharp and acute as the pang of her disappointed vanity had been, it
     seemed destined not to be very lasting, as Marion, on returning one day from a long walk,
     almost smiled to find Lady Towercliffe seated in their small parlour, and diligently pouring a
     torrent of lively gossip into the ears of Agnes, who felt little disposed at first to become
     interested in all the ill-assorted marriages people might choose to make, or to care who had
     died, or were likely to be born: but gradually her mind had been opened to the consideration of
     whether Miss Brown were a suitable match for Mr. Grey—whether £500 a year might possibly be
     enough to maintain Captain Jackson of the 10th and Lady Maria Meredith, whose individual
     expenditure on dress amounted to £400 per annum each, and whether it would be best for
     Lieutenant Stanley and Miss Maynard to marry and settle in Australia, or to continue single and
     remain at home.</p>
<p>Agnes had no possible chance of seeing the parties, or of influencing their decision. She
     would probably never hear more of them, nor had she been previously aware of their existence,
     yet the magic of Lady Towercliffe's eloquence gradually led her on to argue the merits of each
     case, as if she had been the arbiter of their fate, till at length, being insensibly roused
     from her stupor of melancholy indulgence, the visit was concluded by Agnes joyfully consenting
     to dine at Lady Towercliffe's next day, to meet a party of friends.</p>
<p>After having feared that her sister never would smile again, Marion now, with glad surprise,
     heard Agnes once more actually laugh, and she could not but wonder that Lady Towercliffe, by
     putting her through a course of gossip, and administering to a "mind diseased" a strong mixture
     of love affairs, quarrels, sicknesses, and bankruptcies, had acted on the spirits of Agnes as a
     counter-irritation, so that, in the contemplation of other people's miseries, she attained a
     spurious resignation beneath her own. As sorrow is the rust of the soul, everything that
     traverses the surface, has a tendency to scour it away, and the scattered links of Agnes'
     happiness seemed brightening now again, as if they might at last be reunited into as glittering
     a chain as before, while her cheek resumed its wonted hue and her tongue its wonted volubility.
     After the first great affliction of life, it is said that the sufferer never is again the same,
     "that the heart can know no second spring;" but now there seemed every probability that, though
     the drooping pinions of her ambition had been lowered, Agnes might soon put a patch on her
     worn-out spirits, and be only too much restored to her former self. When the carriage next day
     arrived, which was to convey her to Lady Towercliffe's, Marion, ever ready to enjoy any
     happiness reflected from the eyes of others, bid her good night with a sensation of real
     pleasure at this unexpected revival.</p>
<p>There are strange coincidences in every day life, and the small dinner party at Lady
     Towercliffe's accidentally contained the two last persons on earth who would have wished to
     meet. When Lord Towercliffe received Agnes with friendly cordiality at the door, he had not yet
     relinquished her hand before he suddenly felt his own grasped with a convulsive start, and when
     he hastily looked up, the countenance of his newly arrived guest had grown pale as that of a
     spectre, her eyes were closed, and he felt her hand become as cold and heavy as lead. Too
     well-bred to notice her strange emotion, which there was an evident effort to conceal, he
     naturally ascribed it to the remembrance of recent family affliction, when now, for the first
     time, entering society again, and he silently led Agnes to a seat beside Lady Charlotte Malcolm
     and Miss Howard Smytheson.</p>
<p>Agnes did not once look round the room, but she heard the low, deep tones of a voice with
     which she had too long been familiar, though now it must for ever be to her the voice of a
     stranger. Captain De Crespigny had been, some time previously, dividing his fascinations
     between the only two young ladies in the room, and he continued still, with the same light
     laugh as before, to exhibit his rare gift of conversational humor and vivacity, after giving a
     slight bow to Agnes, which she did not even see. A mist was before her sight—a ringing in her
     ears—her very heart seemed benumbed—and her only desire being to avoid notice, while her
     parched lips refused to articulate, she silently fixed her large eyes on Lady Caroline Malcolm,
     assuming an aspect of attention, and inwardly thankful that there was something in the room at
     which she could look, while circumstances had thus so painfully and so very unexpectedly "awoke
     the nerve where agony was born."</p>
<p>The world, usually one great "School for Scandal," had not yet circulated the story of
     Captain De Crespigny's inconstancy, and Agnes' disappointment; therefore, dreading above all
     things the contemptuous pity bestowed on a case like hers, she now exerted herself, from the
     fear of ridicule more than even of censure. The strongest emotions of existence are concealed
     in the great drama of life; and though Agnes felt herself grow blind when dinner was announced,
     yet she afterwards retained a confused recollection of having walked down stairs, leaning on
     the arm of an officer whom she had never seen before, discussing the hue of a ribbon, or the
     probability of a war, while her whole heart, mind, and spirit, were torn with contending
     emotions.</p>
<p>Strange is the ignorance in which people may live respecting the real thoughts and feelings
     of those with whom they are at the moment in actual contact! Agnes possessed an energy and
     pride of spirit which supported her now, while with flushed cheeks, and eyes brightened by
     agitation, her volubility became like a delirium. What she said to the stranger might be sense
     or nonsense, she neither cared nor knew, while her own laugh sounded unnatural in her ears; but
     still her companion listened and smiled, looking even more admiration than he felt, and while
     Agnes rattled on with apparent recklessness, he was inwardly conjecturing whether this could
     possibly be the beautiful Miss Dunbar who had endeavord to "entrap" his brother officer De
     Crespigny, artfully attempting what she had not been artful enough to achieve.</p>
<p>When the endless dinner was ended at last, and the ladies rose to withdraw, Agnes could
     willingly have fled from the house for solitude; but Lady Towercliffe, to beguile the interval,
     importunately begged for music, and persecuted her to sing. It was weeks since Agnes had
     attempted a note, but, anxious to avoid notice, she tried to remember the songs best known to
     her. Each as it rose to memory, seemed filled with remembrances in which she dared not indulge.
     Who but the unhappy can tell the power of music in recalling vanished years and vanished joys!
     One song Captain De Crespigny had formerly accompanied, another he had admired, a third he had
     copied out for her. All their sentiments of love and constancy he had with ready flattery
     applied to herself, and each had been played or sung only for him.</p>
<p>Hopes and feelings now for ever extinct, crowded into her memory; a cold, curdling anguish
     gathered round her heart; the notes died away inaudibly, and Agnes at length, leaning her
     forehead on the music-desk, burst into an irresistible flood of tears, while her eyes rested at
     these words,—</p>
<quote>
<l>"Long hours have passed on</l>
<l>Since that name was too dear;</l>
<l>Now its music is gone,</l>
<l>It is death to my ear!"</l>
</quote>
<p>"Poor thing!" whispered Lady Towercliffe, "Her uncle's death makes a sad change in their
     circumstances, and she lives too much alone now. People rave about the pleasures of solitude,
     but I never could find them out! They are excellent for poetry, but, like the Arabian apple,
     they turn to ashes when tried. I never could keep up the shuttle-cock with only one
     battle-dore."</p>
<p>"Nor I! particularly in conversation," said Captain De Crespigny, entering. "There is old
     Crawford below stairs, with single-handed diligence, stringing off his whole book of anecdotes;
     I left him at No. 5, so he has three yet to come, before the gentlemen escape! The last he told
     was perfectly stupendiferous! That man's mind is like an old chest, but there is an end to all
     agreeable conversation, when people begin drawing for it on their memories! I am so wearied
     now, that I shall give any one £5 who can amuse me for half an hour!"</p>
<p>The solitude at Seabeach Cottage was not destined to remain much longer uninterrupted, as the
     very evening subsequent to Lady Towercliffe's party, after Agnes had retired in feverish
     dejection to spend some time in her own room, Marion was startled by a loud impatient peal at
     the bell, and the next moment her hand was eagerly clasped in that of Henry De Lancey, whose
     countenance, in returning thus to his altered home, was pale and haggard with strong emotion.
     Marion started up, giving an exclamation of sudden joy at his unexpected appearance, while a
     momentary smile flashed on her countenance, like a gleam of sunshine on the dark face of a
     wintry cloud; but his eye sadly wandered towards the portrait of Sir Arthur, with a long
     lingering look of deep affection, and, covering his face with his hands, he threw himself on a
     sofa, remaining for some time buried in silence while his whole frame shook with emotion, one
     burst of grief following another.</p>
<p>It was long, very long before Henry could listen to the mournful detail of all Sir Arthur had
     said and suffered in his short and fatal illness; but the feelings of Marion were soothed thus
     to meet at last with one who thought and felt like herself. Grief that disperses itself in
     words and tears is speedily over; but theirs was of that calm, concentrated nature which
     consumes the heart, though Marion assured Henry that nothing had yet done her so much good, as
     this happy, but most unexpected meeting.</p>
<p>"Did you suppose, Marion, that I could remain absent at a time like this! Impossible! I no
     sooner heard all, than I applied for leave. It is sad, indeed, to find so changed a home. I
     cannot speak of that! He was too good for this world, and is gone to a better! I can only weep
     to look around me here, where his affectionate smile can welcome me no more."</p>
<p>"Yes!" faltered Marion. "But memory, like a miracle, restores him to me every day! I seem to
     behold his face, to hear his voice, to know his thoughts. That calm and cheerful portrait
     appears to tell me sometimes how gladly he is done with all the weary business and
     heart-sinking trials of this vain, perplexing world."</p>
<p>"When such friends part, 'tis the survivor dies," observed Henry, mournfully. "But it has
     been hinted to me, Marion, that the man I esteem the most in this world has trifled with your
     affections! I cannot believe it! I was long in his confidence, and if there be truth in man, he
     loves you with an attachment which nothing can alter. Half the miseries in life proceed from a
     want of explanation. No! there is some mystery we cannot solve. A thousand mistakes may occur
     in the absence of friends; but for his sake, as much as your's, and for my own sake, most of
     all, I shall outstrip the swiftest courier, and return with his entire justification. But there
     is another business also to be discussed," added Henry, with a sudden change of tone and
     countenance, while his face glowed with a look of strong excitement, and he bit his lip till
     the very blood seemed ready to spring out. "Your sister, Marion! Agnes has been made the sport
     of an unprincipled, heartless, coxcomb. His conduct embittered the last days of my benefactor
     and friend! He must and shall be made to repent it!"</p>
<p>"Henry! what do you mean?" interrupted Marion, startled and alarmed by his evident
     irritation. "Do not make me regret having entrusted you with all our girlish fancies and
     follies! Such things happen every day!"</p>
<p>"No, Marion! Had the insult been only to Sir Patrick, he considers the happiness of others,
     and even his own honor, as trifles compared with immediate convenience. His sister's peace of
     mind might be destroyed without his having the wish, or me the right to interfere, but, in
     respect to Agnes, as the niece of Sir Arthur, it is not so. I know how her heart was gained,
     and has been crushed. It is said that ten years of ordinary suffering would not have made such
     ravages as are already visible in the countenance of Agnes, and she must not be so treated with
     impunity. But a day of retribution may come upon him, yet!"</p>
<p>"Dear Henry!" interrupted Marion, anxiously, "Do not add to what we have already suffered, by
     imprudence on your part. I little thought that any circumstance could ever make me otherwise
     than happy to meet you, but your impetuosity now really alarms me!"</p>
<p>"It does no such thing! at least it should not," said Henry, assuming for a moment his old
     vivacity of manner, but it would not do. A tone of cheerfulness in that house, now jarred
     painfully on his ear, and again fixing his eyes on the portrait of Sir Arthur, he added, in a
     low, deep tone of intense feeling: "No, Marion!—in this room, consecrated to kindness and
     affection,—on this seat, so long occupied by the most generous of benefactors, and before that
     Holy Bible in which be instructed us both, I promise to speak, act, and think, as he would have
     dictated. My situation now is most perplexing! De Crespigny has acted the part of a brother
     towards me since I joined his regiment. He has courted my friendship and intimacy to a degree
     for which I can scarcely account, but for which I felt most grateful, till within these few
     days, when a strange and most perplexing communication has been made to me."</p>
<p>An air of deep and anxious thought gathered over the countenance of Henry; he covered his
     face with his hands, and Marion listened in silence, when he continued in a rapid, agitated
     voice.</p>
<p>"The unhappy madman, Howard, wrote me lately a long, incoherent letter, in which he accused
     De Crespigny of having instigated him twelve years ago, to that dreadful deed which made me
     motherless; adding, that the very peculiar weapon then found on the bed, had been furnished by
     him; and I have ascertained since from Martin, that De Crespigny, when a boy, had precisely
     such a knife given to him. I am told that he has been making many secret inquiries lately,
     respecting the papers found in my mother's bureau; and he frankly mentioned the subject once to
     me himself, saying, I little knew the deep interest he still had in investigating that affair.
     He is a man I cannot, and do not suspect of a dishonorable thought in his transactions with
     gentlemen; but though entirely acquitting him on that point, Marion, I am determined to speak
     my whole mind to De Crespigny this night. He is now at Mrs. Smytheson's, in the next house, and
     we are going to town together, when his ears shall ring with my opinion of his conduct to
     Agnes!"</p>
<p>"Then, dear Henry, be prudent! It would not benefit us, if you and Captain De Crespigny were
     to get into an Irish rage, and shoot each other. Love once extinguished can never be forced
     back, and we cannot bring repentance to those who are destitute of feeling; therefore, for our
     sakes, be silent."</p>
<p>Young De Lancey strode a few hasty turns up and down the room, in agitated silence, and
     seemed preparing to depart, when the door was slowly opened, and Agnes glided into the room,
     while Henry started, looking doubtfully at first, as if he scarcely recognised her; and then
     advancing, he received Agnes with an expression of warm-hearted kindness, which brought the
     hectic color for a moment to her cheek.</p>
<p>When Henry glanced at the expression of settled melancholy on the beautiful features of
     Agnes, a gleam of indignant emotion flashed across his countenance, but it was succeeded by an
     effort to appear cheerful; and by "smiles that might as well be tears," when he extended his
     hand, saying, with all the vivacity he could assume,</p>
<p>"Here I am, quite unexpectedly, Agnes! like snow in summer, or a burst of sunshine at
     midnight! A little surprise will do you and Marion good! It acts like an electric shock! I
     remember the time, Agnes, when you never gave me above three fingers to shake, and now your
     whole hand is presented, therefore I may feel really welcome."</p>
<p>"Yes, Henry!" replied Marion, seeing her sister unable yet to speak; "we shall now endeavor
     to get up our spirits!"</p>
<p>"That may be easy for those who have any spirits to get up!" added Agnes, in a tone of
     peevish melancholy. "But if Marion chooses to look through a Claude-Loraine glass, and declare
     that the whole earth and sky are <hi xml:lang="fr">couleur de rose</hi>, must I wipe my eyes
     with my elbow, and say the same? All I can do is, if possible, to forget myself to stone. You
     were always a light-hearted being, Henry! Would it make you serious to be told of one like me
     whose heart is turned to ashes! The world is a Castle of Desolation now, with not a tie that
     binds me to the earth—not one!" added she bitterly, while her eyes were purposely averted from
     the reproachful kindness of Marion's expression.</p>
<p>"Agnes," interrupted Henry, in his kindest manner, "you wasted much good advice on me
     formerly, but now it is my turn. As an old French lady once judiciously remarked, '<hi xml:lang="fr">Il n'y a pas de plus grande folie, que d'etre malheureux</hi>.' For Marion's
     sake and your own, do not treasure up grief as if it were gold! When one plan of happiness
     fails, we should always change horses, and drive on with another! It is a fatal mistake to
     throw up the game of life, if our favorite hope fails! Try pleasure now, on some new pattern!
     We should look on both sides of existence, and keep hold of it with the best handle!"</p>
<p>"I will! I will!" exclaimed Agnes, flinging back the long entangled ringlets from her pallid
     face, and forcing a wild, haggard smile into her distorted features. "Does that please you,
     Henry? Do I look sufficiently happy? Why are you so disconcerted? Let us all be cheerful again!
     Shall I sing to you, or how shall we be merriest?"</p>
<p>"Surely, Agnes, as we cannot mend the past, or direct the future, you might make some of the
     present. Remember the old proverb, 'There is a silver lining to every cloud,'" continued Henry,
     assuming a tone of animation. "You might find a thousand occupations which become an excellent
     substitute for what people call happiness. Try geology, or book-making, or worsted work! But,
     Agnes," added he, more seriously, "above all, take the strong staff of religion, rather than
     the feeble reed of earthly hope, which has pierced you, as it will pierce all who trust in it.
     Why are we placed on earth? Not to contrive a plan of life for ourselves, but to learn from
     above what is the real meaning of happiness—its surest source—its brightest fountain! Behind
     the machinery of all human events, God is at work for our real good, and every misfortune may
     be transformed into a blessing, if we receive it as a Fatherly correction, and take the good it
     is intended to do us."</p>
<p>With absent, listless indifference, Agnes took leave of Henry when he was about to depart;
     but Marion's eye glistened with emotion, as she wished him good-night, entreating that he would
     return soon and often.</p>
<p>"Trust me for that, Marion! It can never become a mere duty to visit here," replied Henry,
     hastily dashing away a tear. "This room is my home, more than any other on earth. Every chair
     and every table is endeared to me, and how much more the living inhabitants. Even that old
     geranium, all run to wood, and covered with dust, is consecrated by a thousand old
     recollections. Adieu!"</p>
