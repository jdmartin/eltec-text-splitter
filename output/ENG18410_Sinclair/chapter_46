<head>  CHAPTER XLVI.</head>
<p>While Henry continued thus entranced with perplexity, Marion's attention was gradually
     attracted by a noise at her side, and, looking suddenly round, she was startled to behold
     crouching in the remotest corner of the room, the figure of a human being, which filled her
     with horror and dismay, so haggard, so emaciated, so unlike anything she had ever looked upon
     before, that scarcely could she suppress a shriek of dismay. It was a face of woe and
     wretchedness, once seen never to be forgotten, and she had formerly seen it. The sunken
     temples, the hollow eyes, the lurid glare of insanity in the eye, and the clusters of hair,
     black as death, blown by the night-wind in large damp masses on his forehead, all brought the
     wretched Howard instantaneously to her mind; and, grasping Henry's arm, with an exclamation of
     terror, she attempted to hurry with him out of the room. Scarcely, however, had she made a step
     towards the door, when the madman darted forward, and closed it, then wheeling round, he said,
     in a low, husky voice, while his strength seemed so subdued, that the grasp of an infant might
     have mastered him,—</p>
<p>"You have discovered me, and there is no escape! Be it so! 'Welcome death,' as the rat said,
     when the trap fell down. Here the tragedy began, and here let it end!"</p>
<p>He paused for several minutes, and gradually his face assumed a look of ungovernable anguish,
     while he added, in a dreary, desolate tone, unlike any human voice,—</p>
<p>"I could weep for my own ruin,—for my sister's,—but the time is past. Never shall I shed
     another tear! Our sin be on the Abbe Mordaunt's head! The withering curse of a dying man be on
     his head! The misery of eternal ruin be on his head, as it is on mine! For his own purposes he
     nurtured every wild passion in our young blood. He taught me the mad ambition that was my
     ruin,—promised me impunity here and hereafter, if I assisted in his schemes; and now, after
     being his tool, I am, like a useless tool, cast aside! But could he silence my outraged
     conscience? No! The gibbet is forever hovering before my sight, and the curse of heaven is
     borne to my soul in every blast!"</p>
<p>"Yet you are still in this world of hope, where none can be finally condemned," said Henry,
     solemnly. "Till the grave closes over your head, mercy and pardon may yet be asked, and may yet
     be granted! Ernest Anstruther, from the hour of my mother's death until now, you have most
     barbarously injured me, but mortal man must not keep up immortal anger. I only obey our
     beneficent Creator in saying, that if you repent, I heartily forgive you. Your life is probably
     forfeited to the outraged laws of man, but may your soul find mercy in its utmost need."</p>
<p>"I have been your deadliest foe, De Lancey, and haunted your steps with my hatred from
     childhood; but it is done," continued Anstruther, with a look of bleak and barren agony. "I
     will not live to be caged in prison, a spectacle of scorn and infamy, to die a death of shame.
     How different from what I once hoped! There shall be no to-morrow for me in this world! A fire
     is at my heart, which can only be quenched by death! It is better not to be, than to be
     miserable! I shall give my body to the beasts of the field, or the birds in the air. I shall
     find a bed where no dreams shall haunt me, and a sleep from which there is no awakening! A wolf
     may lose his teeth, but you cannot change his nature! As a madman I have lived, and as a madman
     I shall die! We must sleep in the bed we prepare for ourselves! Before that sun shall have
     traveled another hour, you, Henry De Lancey, shall be raised to honor, and I shall have died,
     covered with infamy and disgrace. I never stir now, without the fatal means of release."</p>
<p>Marion shivered from head to foot, at the ghastly sound of Anstruther's voice, but paralyzed
     with terror, she dared not stir, for already a loaded pistol was in his hand. A fearful ghastly
     smile distorted his countenance,—the smile of a maniac,—a smile such as may be seen on the lips
     of a corpse, and an expression gleamed in his eye, which it curdled her blood to look upon, and
     might have struck terror into the strongest mind; but Henry, in a calm, deliberate voice,
     replied,—</p>
<p>"There is no such dreamless sleep, Anstruther, as you describe! Even Satan himself believes
     in futurity! Whatever be your sorrow, and worse than sorrow, your sin, do not madly hasten to
     that world where there is no peace and no pardon. Take pity upon yourself."</p>
<p>"Mine has been a desperate life, and it shall have a desperate end," replied Ernest, with a
     sullen, deadly smile on his bloodless lips; but trying to assume a tone of reckless
     indifference, he added, "I never was one to choke upon the tail! I have gazed at the moon, and
     fallen in the gutter, but, De Lancey, for the sake of that good old man, Sir Arthur, who was
     your benefactor and mine, I will not die without doing you justice. The wax of secrecy may now
     be broken, and here are papers clearly and indisputably to prove that you are the legitimate
     son of Lord Doncaster. They purify your mother's character from every aspersion, and testify
     without doubt your title to be Lord Dunraven."</p>
<p>Had an apparition arisen through the floor, or had a cannon gone off at Henry's ear, he could
     scarcely have been more startled and astonished, while, with an exclamation of joy and rapture,
     Marion rushed up to him, saying, in accents of tremulous joy, while he stood bewildered with
     surprise, and then grasping the packet in his hand, staggered to a seat, "It is then as uncle
     Arthur once almost believed! Oh, Henry, what joy! If he had but lived to hear it! Can this be
     possible!"</p>
<p>After a few moments given to emotion and wonder, while Henry seemed almost as if his spirit
     had taken wing from the body, Marion having in some degree recovered herself, looked round, and
     observed with surprise that they were alone! The madman, taking advantage of Henry's agitation,
     had rushed wildly from the house, to be seen and heard of no more. Henry rose, intending
     instantly to give an alarm, and to follow in pursuit of Anstruther; but scarcely had he stirred
     a step, before he and Marion were startled by hearing, in the adjoining room, a shriek so
     shrill and appalling, so heart-broken and delirious, that in an agony of alarm, they hurried
     forward to the hall. A confused murmur, a buzz of suppressed astonishment had arisen among the
     assembled crowd, in which were many countenances expressing strong fear, others wearing only an
     air of gaping curiosity, many with their hands clasped in amazement, and others expanding them
     in terror, but all listening with looks of motionless attention, while every eye was turned
     towards the table on which the murdered body had been laid, and a deep silence ensued, of
     hushed expectation, as if the stage were about to exhibit a tragedy of exciting interest.</p>
<p>Henry glanced rapidly around, and saw standing beside the corpse a tall female, whose aspect
     filled all present with surprise. Her worn and haggard countenance seemed cold and rigid as the
     figure on a tomb-stone, and her cheek had become overspread with a damp and leaden paleness;
     while in speechless horror, which seemed as if it amounted almost to insanity, she pointed her
     long, ghastly finger towards the body. A hundred eyes were now bent on hers, and her bewildered
     glance swept for a moment round the assembled crowd, with a look of unutterable wretchedness,
     till at length her eye fell on Lord Doncaster. On him she now fixed an unshrinking gaze, while
     she spoke in a low, hoarse whisper, which sounded with terrifying distinctness through the
     large old hall, and fell upon every ear with a solemnity and awfulness like the knell of
     death.</p>
<p>"I knew all, but could not hinder it! No! I would have died to prevent this! There was death
     in my brother's eye when he left me! I pursued him, but it was too late! Day by day, step by
     step, we have sunk into deeper crime and misery! Who would think that I had ever been young,
     innocent, and happy? The barrier was first thrown down by him who lies here! Hour by hour the
     deepening shadows grew darker! Long, long have these eyes been drenched with the tears of a
     broken heart! My wretched brother swore that every pang I suffered should be avenged! I would
     have pardoned, I would have forgotten all, if I might but have saved my brother, and sheltered
      <hi>him</hi> from death. I have warned, I have wept, implored! I have prayed on my very knees;
     but in vain! All is now over! Every law of God and man has been violated! None in all this
     assembly can see as I do the horror of our guilt—none can hate it more! The past maddens me,
     and the future—oh! what is there in the future for me!"</p>
<p>With a shuddering groan, Mary Anstruther sunk back on a chair, and she trembled like a leaf
     in the blast of autumn, while a mortal silence ensued. Lord Doncaster with brows knit, and lips
     firmly compressed, seemed resolute to conceal the emotions evidently struggling and boiling
     within his breast; and the by-standers, in dismay, had all shrunk back from the unhappy woman;
     but Henry now, with an irresistible impulse of pity, approached, and spoke a few soothing words
     to her, when she suddenly looked up, and seeing the expression of unfeigned commiseration with
     which he gazed at her, burning tears forced themselves into her eyes, and, with a look of
     piercing woe, she added in a low, husky, choking voice—</p>
<p>"I have asked pity, and all are not pitiless! I am used to misery—that cannot draw tears from
     me now, but kindness does,—your kindness especially. My heart was dumb and frozen! I never
     thought to weep again. Many is the long day since I have been pitied! Many is the long day
     since I have deserved it! Yes!" added she, grasping Henry's arm with almost iron force, while
     she spoke in a voice so strange and deep, it thrilled to every heart. "The time is come for me
     to tell all and die. The secret of your life was begun with bloodshed, and here in bloodshed it
     has ended. The thought that your mother died by my brother's hand has, from that fatal hour,
     gnawed like a fiery serpent at my heart. My soul is shaken to the very dust; but while I have
     breath to speak, let me confess how we slandered your mother—how we caused her to be driven as
     an outcast from this house—how we deceived your father, and cheated you, Henry De Lancey, of
     your birthright."</p>
<p>At this moment Lord Doncaster, who had seemed almost paralyzed with agitation, and as if the
     springs of life were drying up within him, suddenly rose, and waving back the Abbe Mordaunt and
     others who were crowding around him, he placed himself opposite the wretched woman, and fixed a
     look of searching examination on her death-struck countenance, while he seemed afraid to trust
     his own voice, lest it should betray the tumult of his feelings; but after a momentary
     struggle, he passed his hand across his eyes, and said in a low tone of doubt and
     uncertainty,—</p>
<p>"It seems like a resurrection from the dead! It cannot be! Is Mary Anstruther yet in
     being?"</p>
<p>"I have dreamed of such a man once," replied she, casting a desolate look around. "My heart
     was not then bursting, as it is now, because none can help me."</p>
<p>Henry's eye became fastened with a look of settled intensity on the countenance of Lord
     Doncaster, who walked a few agitated steps about the room, and then added, in a voice of stern
     astonishment:</p>
<p>"You speak of a deception! Let me know all? What of Laura Mordaunt?"</p>
<p>"Not of Laura Mordaunt, my Lord, but your lawful wife! The story of your previous marriage,
     invented by the Abbe, was a hideous lie. Had she been told the reason why you spurned her from
     the house, she could have disproved it. We told her only that your affections had been changed.
     She was too proud to complain; yet she did at last write a letter, which never reached you. She
     there made a solemn appeal to your justice and compassion, claiming for her son the affection
     and the station to which he is entitled. She became persuaded, by the Abbe's contrivance, that
     her marriage had been illegal. All—all was foul and horrid falsehood. We each had our various
     interests to serve! the Abbe to embezzle his niece's fortune—Ernest to keep his place near the
     succession—and I——"</p>
<p>Mary Anstruther's almost unearthly voice, which sounded unlike the voice of a human being,
     now entirely failed; her teeth chattered, she shivered from head to foot, and her eyes became
     fixed on the stiffened corpse by her side, while Lord Doncaster, with a scarcely audible groan
     of bitter regret, locked his hands over his heart, as if to still its palpitations, and
     listened, in agitated silence, for more. At length the wretched woman continued, while her
     voice became faint, and her very blood seemed to freeze at the sound of her own words.</p>
<p>"The slow progress of a breaking heart was not rapid enough for Ernest's hatred. He believed
     she was the cause of our ruin, and he murdered her! I would die a thousand deaths now to
     restore Laura Mordaunt—to undo all that I have done! Oh! that memory itself would fail! I am
     haunted and tortured by those over-living remembrances!"</p>
<p>Lord Doncaster looked as if a flash of lightning had blinded him, while, after gazing for a
     moment in almost vacant astonishment at Mary Anstruther, he put his hand to his head, and, with
     a suppressed groan, leaned against the table for support. A feather might have thrown him down,
     but he was evidently trying to collect his senses, and murmured hurriedly to himself in broken
     accents, "No! no! Impossible! It is all proved! She was guilty! Who can doubt it?"</p>
<p>"My Lord! it was a cruel, horrid, slanderous falsehood!" cried Mary, in a tone of solemn
     earnestness. "Night and the grave seem already closed over my wretched head. Take, then, the
     assurance of a dying creature, that Lord Mordaunt was innocent. Let me do one good action on
     the earth, before I perish for ever! She deserved a better fate! Let her young son enjoy the
     titles and honors of his ancestors. Letters will be produced after my death, proving his right.
     I desire all here to witness the last words I shall speak before my lips are sealed by death in
     everlasting silence, that there stands Henry, Lord Dunraven, the lawful son of Lord Doncaster!
     And now my destiny is accomplished! Already I seem separated from the living, though not yet
     united to the dead! Let my end come quickly, as it comes surely."</p>
<p>Henry's very heart trembled with agitation, and it seemed as if his veins ran lightning,
     while he fixed a long and agitated look on Lord Doncaster, whose countenance became convulsed
     with agitation, his brain seemed contracted by a spasm, the thread of life appeared suddenly to
     snap, a thick mist obscured his sight, and before his newly found son could rush forward to his
     support, he had fallen to the ground as if shot.</p>
<p>The room was immediately cleared of strangers, and the Abbe Mordaunt fled without delay to
     the continent, where he soon after buried himself in the monastery of La Trappe.</p>
<p>During several succeeding days, all that mortal man could do was done to restore Lord
     Doncaster, while Henry watched over his recently-discovered parent with incessant attention,
     and hoped, but hoped in vain, that Lord Doncaster might live to recognise and bless him; but
     the varied and vehement emotions of the last few hours had been too much for his aged frame. He
     continued during some time insensible, and, at length, after a short but severe struggle,
     expired.</p>
<p>Henry was acknowledged, however, before long, and recognised by the world, as not a doubt
     could remain on any mind of his identity and his claims, after those papers had been read
     bequeathed to him by the Anstruthers, and before the wretched Mary had quitted the earthly
     scene of her misfortunes and crimes, she was consoled by the forgiveness and the prayers of
     young De Lancey, now Marquis of Doncaster.</p>
<p>The whole unfathomable abyss of Henry's feelings and affections was now irradiated with hope,
     and he felt himself almost overwhelmed by the torrent of happiness about to pour upon him,
     when, hiding his face with his hands, tears of indescribable—of almost insufferable joy gushed
     from his eyes. The change seemed sudden as spring, bursting forth amidst the arid deserts of
     Siberia, after the snow has been melted away in the night, and the barren ground is, as by
     magic, clothed with blossoms, and warmed with sunshine. It appeared as if a word might yet
     break the charm—as if he might awaken and find the whole a dream of enchantment, but the
     crowning of all his earthly joy, was, when he at length claimed, in the open face of day, that
     true, constant, and disinterested affection of Caroline Smythe, which had so long been to him
     like a spring of water in the desert to a lonely traveller, cheering and refreshing his heart
     in the long pilgrimage of life.</p>
<quote>
<l>Oh, doubly sweet is sunshine after rain,</l>
<l>Rest after toil, port after stormy seas.</l>
</quote>
<p>The language of happy love, interesting above all else to the parties themselves, is
     uninteresting to others, but who ever had a brighter lot than Caroline and Henry, while they
     looked far into the future, anticipating together a long life of mutual confidence, cheered by
     "the soul's calm sunshine, and the heart's best joy."</p>
<p>"I begin now to fancy nobody in the world happy but myself!" exclaimed Henry, gaily. "I am
     almost ashamed to be so much better off than I deserve! but, as Lady Townly says, Caroline, 'We
     must squeeze as little as possible of the lemon into our matrimonial sherbet!'"</p>
<p>"Must I actually give up the delightful romance of loving you as a friendless adventurer,
     Henry? What would Lydia Languish have said to such a droll, every-day, common-place reality? I
     do not absolutely hate you," said Caroline, with a conscious laugh, and a slight relapse into
     her usual capricious vivacity, "but we must have one little quarrel yet! There is a
     circumstance respecting me, which has hitherto, for very good reasons, been kept secret, and
     now, it must, most unfortunately, come out!"</p>
<p>"What can that be?" asked Henry, smilingly watching the variations of Caroline's countenance.
     "I am quite as ready for a quarrel as you are; therefore tell me the worst at once!"</p>
<p>"It is an objection against me which I heard you once say would, in any case, be
     insuperable!" added Caroline, archly. "When all is told, you will certainly change your
     mind!"</p>
<p>"Then I shall be much changed, indeed! What magical spell do you intend to use?"</p>
<p>"Henry! you made a rash vow once, in my hearing, never to marry an heiress," said Caroline,
     trying to speak in a tone of gravity, and looking away. "Would you not abhor and avoid the
     heiress of Howard Abbey, including all the broad acres of Beaujolie Manor?"</p>
<p>Henry looked at Caroline in silent perplexity; but the blush, the frolicsome laugh, and the
     air of arch caprice with which she spoke, all at once enlightened his mind, and, seizing her
     hand with the most lover-like <hi xml:lang="fr">empressement</hi>, he gaily exclaimed, "Well,
     Caroline! since it must be so, I forgive you for being an heiress; but in no one whom I liked
     less could I have endured this! I love you in spite of it! I do, indeed! You merited already
     more than I ever can offer; but, Caroline, we love each other truly; and, for better, as well
     as for worse, I shall love you forever!"</p>
