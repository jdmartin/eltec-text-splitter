<t:head>HOW CHARLES FARED.</t:head>
<t:p>Having thus found protectors for poor Emily, and disposed of her assailant to the entire
     satisfaction of all mankind, let us turn seawards, and take a look at Charles.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:pb n="62"/>Now, "no earthly power,"—as a certain ex-chancellor protested—shall induce me to do
     so mean a thing as to open Charles's letters, and spread them forth before the public gaze.
     Doubtless, they were all things tender, warm, and eloquent; doubtless, they were tinted rosy
     hue, with love's own blushes, and made glorious with the golden light of unaffected piety. I
     only read them myself in a reflected way, by looking into Emily's eyes; and I saw, from their
     ever-changing radiance, how feelingly he told of his affections; how fervently he poured out
     all his heart upon the page; how evidently tears and kisses had made many words illegible; how
     wise, sanguine, happy, and religious, was her own devoted Charles.</t:p>
<t:p>Of the trivial incidents of voyaging, his letters said not much: though cheerful and
     agreeable in his floating prison, with the various exported marrying-maidens and transported
     civil officers, who constitute the average bulk of Indian cargoes outward bound, Charles mixed
     but little in their society, seldom danced, seldom smoked, seldom took a hand at whist, or
     engaged in the conflicts of backgammon. Sharks, storms, water-spouts; the meeting divers
     vessels, and exchanging post-bags; tar-barrelled Neptune of the line, Cape Town with its
     mountain and the Table-cloth, long-rolling seas; and similar common-places, Charles did not
     think proper to enlarge upon: no more do I. Life is far too short for all such petty details:
     and, more pointedly, a wire-drawn book is the just abhorrence of a generous public.</t:p>
<t:p>The letters came frequently: for Charles did little else all day but write to Emmy, so as
     always to be ready with a budget for the next piece of luck—a home-bound ship. He had many
     things to teach her yet, sweet student; and it was a beautiful sight to see how her mind
     expanded as an opening flower before the sun of tenderness and wisdom. Each letter, both in
     writing and in reading, was the child of many prayers: and even the loveliness of Emily grew
     more soft, more elevated, "as it had been the face of an angel," when feeding in solitary joy
     on those effusions of her lover's heart.</t:p>
<t:p>Of course, he could not hear from her, until the overland mail might haply bring him letters
     at Madras: so that, as our Irish friends would say, with all her will to tell him of her love,
     "the reciprocity must needs be all on one side." But Emily did write too; earnestly, happily:
     and poured her very heart out in those eloquent burning words. I dare say Charles will get the
     letter now within a day or two: for the roaring surf of Madras is on the horizon, almost within
     sight.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:pb n="63"/>Nevertheless, before he gets there, and can read those letters—precious, precious
     manuscripts—it will be my painful duty, as a chronicler of (what might well be) truth, to put
     the reader in possession of one little hint, which seemed likeliest to wreck the happiness of
     these two children of affection.</t:p>
<t:p>I am Emily's invisible friend: and as the dear girl ran to me one morning, with tears in her
     eyes, to ask me what I thought of a certain mysterious paragraph, I need not scruple to lay it
     straight before the reader.</t:p>
<t:p>At the end of a voluminous love-letter, which I really did not think of prying into, occurred
     the following postscript, evidently written at the last moment of haste.</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh! my precious Emmy, I have just heard the most fearful rumour of ill that could possibly
     befall us: the captain of our ship—you will remember Captain Forbes, he knew you and the
     general well, he said—has just assured me that—that—! I dare not, cannot write the awful words.
     Oh! my own Emmy—Heaven grant you be my own!—pray, pray, as I will night and day, that rumour be
     not true: for if it be, my love, both God and man forbid us ever to meet again! How I wish I
     could explain it all, or that I had never heard so much, or never written it here, and told it
     you, though thus obscurely: for I can't destroy this letter now, the ships are just parting
     company, and there is no time to write another. Yet will I hope, love, against hope. Who knows?
     through God's good mercy, it may all be cleared up still. If not—if not—strive to forget for
     ever, your unhappy</t:p>
<t:p>"<t:hi>Charles.</t:hi></t:p>
<t:p>"Perhaps—O, glorious thought!—Nurse Mackie may know better than the captain, after all; and
     yet, he seems so positive: if he is right, there is nothing for us both but Wo! Wo! Wo!"</t:p>
<t:p>Now, to say plain truth, when Emily showed me this, I looked very blank upon it. That Charles
     had heard some meddlesome report, which (if true) was to be an insuperable barrier to their
     future union, struck me at a glimpse. But I had not the heart to hint it to her; and only
     encouraged hope—hope, in God's help, through the means of Mrs. Mackie and her papers.</t:p>
<t:p>As for the poor girl herself, she asked me, in much humility, and with many sobs, if I did
     not fear that her Hindoo mystery was this:—she was the vilest of the vile, a Pariah, an
     outcast, whose very presence is contamination!</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:pb n="64"/>Beautiful, loving, heavenly-hearted creature! so humble in the midst of her
     majestic loveliness! how touching was the thought, that she thus readily acquiesced in any the
     deepest humiliation holy Providence had seen fit to send her; and though the sentence would
     have crushed her happiness for ever, till the day of death, that she could still look up and
     say, "Be it to thine handmaid even as thou wilt."</t:p>
<t:p>As I had no better method of explaining the matter, and as her infantine reminiscences and
     prejudices about caste were strong, I even let her think so, if she would: it was a far better
     alternative than my own sad thoughts about the business: and, however painful was the process,
     it was something consolatory to observe, that this voluntary humiliation mellowed and chastened
     her own character, subduing tropical fires, and tempering the virgin gold by meekness.</t:p>
<t:p>Oh! Charles, Charles, my poor fellow, "who have cast your all upon a die, and must abide the
     issue of the throw," I most fervently hope that gossiping Captain Forbes spoke falsely: it is a
     comfort to reflect that the world is often very liberal in attributing the honours of paternity
     to some who really do not deserve them. And if a rich old bachelor looks kindly on a foundling,
     is it not pure malice on that sole account of charity to hail him father? Besides—there's Nurse
     Mackie.—Speed to Madras, poor youth, and keep your courage up.</t:p>
