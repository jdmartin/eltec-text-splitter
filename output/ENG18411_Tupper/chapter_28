<t:head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</t:head>
<t:head>JULIAN TURNS UP: AND THERE'S AN END OF MRS. TRACY.</t:head>
<t:p>There is a muddy sort of sand-bank, acting as a delta to the Mullet, just where it spreads
     from deep to shallow, and falls into the sea. Strange wild fowl abound there, coming from the
     upper clouds in flocks; and at high water, very little else but rushes can be seen, to testify
     its sub-marine existence.</t:p>
<t:p>A knot of fishermen, idling on the beach, have noticed an uncommon flight of Royston crows
     gathered at the island, with the object, as it would appear, of battening on a dead porpoise,
     or some such body, just discernible among the rushes. Stop—that black heap may be kegs of
     whiskey;—where's the glass?</t:p>
<t:p>Every one looked: it warn't barrels—and it warn't a porpoise: what was it, then? they had
     universally nothing on earth to do, so they pushed off in company to see.</t:p>
<t:p>I watched the party off, and they poked among the rushes, and heaved out what seemed to me a
     seal: so I ran down to the beach to look at the strange creature they had captured. Something
     wrapped in a sail; no doubt for exhibition at per head.</t:p>
<t:p>But they brought out that black burden solemnly, laying it on the beach at Burleigh: a crowd
     quickly collected round them, that I could not see the creature: and some ran for a magistrate,
     and some for a parson. Then men in office came—made a way through the crowd, and I got near: so
     near, that my foolish curiosity lifted up the sail, and I beheld—what had been Julian.</t:p>
<t:p>O, sickening sight: for all which the pistol had spared of that swart and hairy face, had
     been preyed upon by birds and fishes!</t:p>
<t:p>There was a hurried inquest: the poor general and Emily deposed to what they knew, and the
     rustics, who escorted him from Oxton. The verdict could be only one—self-murder.</t:p>
<t:p>So, by night, on that same swampy island, when the tide was low, they buried him, deeply
     staked into the soil, lest the waves should disinter him, without a parting prayer. Such is the
     end of the wicked.</t:p>
<t:p>In a day or two, I noticed that a rude wooden cross had been set over the spot: and it
     gratified me much to hear that a rough-looking crew of smugglers had boldly come and fixed it
     there, to hallow, if they could, a comrade's grave.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:pb n="95"/>However, these poor fellows had been cheated hours before: Charles's brotherly care
     had secured the poor remains, and the vicar winked a blind permission: so Charles buried them
     by night in the church-yard corner, under the yew, reading many prayers above them.</t:p>
<t:p>Two fierce-looking strange men went to that burial with reverent looks, as it were chief
     mourners; and when all the rites were done, I heard them gruffly say to Charles, "God bless
     you, sir, for this!"</t:p>
<t:p>When the mother heard those tidings of her son, she was sobered on the instant, and ran about
     the house with all a mother's grief, shrieking like a mad woman. But all her shrieks and tears
     could not bring back poor Julian; deep, deep in the silent grave, she cannot wake him—cannot
     kiss him now. Ah well! ah well!</t:p>
<t:p>Then did she return to his dear room, desperate for him—and Hollands once, twice, thrice, she
     poured out a full tumbler of the burning fluid, and drank it off like water; and it maddened
     her brain: her mind was in a phrensy of delirium, while her body shook as with a palsy.</t:p>
<t:p>Let us draw the curtain; for she died that night.</t:p>
<t:p>They buried her in Aunt Green's grave: what a meeting theirs will be at the day of
     resurrection!</t:p>
