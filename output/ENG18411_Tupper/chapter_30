<t:head>CHAPTER XXX.</t:head>
<t:head>FINAL.</t:head>
<t:p>Gladly would the laird have had marriage at Dunstower, and have given away the beauteous
     bride himself: but there must still be two months more of decent mourning, and the general had
     long learned to sigh for the maligned delights of Burleigh Singleton. So, Glenmuir could only
     get a promise of reappearance some fine summer or other: and, after another day's
     deer-stalking, which made the general repudiate telescopes from that day forth (the poor man's
     eyes had actually grown lobster-like with straining after antlers)—the travelling-carriage, and
     four lean kine from Inverary, whisked away the trio towards the South.</t:p>
<t:p>And now, in due time, were the Tamworths full of joy—congratulating, sympathizing,
     merrymaking; and the three young ladies behaved admirably in the capacity of pink and silver
     bridesmaids; while George proved equally kind in attending (as he called it) Charles's
     "execution," wherein he was "turned off;" and the admiral, G.C.B. was so hand-in-glove with the
     general, H.E.I.C.S., that I have reason to believe they must have sworn eternal friendship,
     after the manner of the modern Germans.</t:p>
<t:p>How beautiful our Emmy looked—I hate the broad Scotch Aamy—how bright her flashing eyes, and
     how fragrantly the orange-blossoms clustered in her rich brown hair; let him speak lengthily,
     whose province it may be to spin three volumes out of one: for me, I always wish to recollect
     that readers possess, on the average, at least as much imagination as writers. And why should
     you not exercise it now? Is not Emmy in her bridal-dress a theme well worth a revery?</t:p>
<t:p>For a similar reason, I must clearly disappoint feminine expectation, by forbearing to
     descant upon Charles's slight but manly form, and his Grecian beauty, etc., all the better for
     the tropics, and the trials and the troubles he had passed.</t:p>
<t:p>When Captain Forbes, just sitting down to his soup in the Jamaica Coffee-house, read in the
     <t:hi>Morning Post</t:hi>, the marriage of Charles Tracy with Amy Stuart, he delivered himself
     mentally as follows:</t:p>
<t:p>"There now! Poets talk of 'love,' and I stick to 'human nature.' When that fine young fellow
     sailed with me, hardly a year ago, in the Sir William Elphinston, he was over head and heels in
     love with old
     <t:pb n="99"/> Jack Tracy's pretty girl, Emily Warren: but I knew it wouldn't last long: I don't
     believe in constancy for longer than a week. It does one's heart good to see how right one is;
     here's what I call proof. My sentimental spark kisses Emily Warren, and marries Amy Stuart."
     The captain, happier than before, called complacently for Cayenne pepper, and relished his
     mock-turtle with a higher gusto.</t:p>
<t:p>It is worth recording, that the same change of name mystified slanderous friends in the
     Presidency of Madras.</t:p>
<t:p>And now, kind-eyed reader, this story of '<t:hi>The Twins</t:hi>' must leave off abruptly at the
     wedding. As in its companion-tale, '<t:hi>The Crock of Gold</t:hi>,' one grand thesis for our
     thoughts was that holy wise command, "Thou shall not covet," and as its other comrade
     '<t:hi>Heart</t:hi>' is founded on "Thou shalt not bear false witness," so in this, the seed-corn
     of the crop, were five pure words, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." Other morals doubtless
     grew up round us, for all virtue hangs together in a bunch: the harms of secresy, false
     witness, inordinate affections, and red murder: but in chief, as we have said.</t:p>
<t:p>Moreover, I wish distinctly to make known, for dear "domestic" sake, that so far from our
     lovers' happiness having been consummated (that is, finished) in the honey-moon—it was only
     then begun. How long they are to live thus happily together, Heaven, who wills all things good,
     alone can tell; I wish them three score years. Little ones, I hear, arrive annually—to the
     unqualified joy, not merely of papa and mamma, but also of our communicative old general, his
     friend the G.C.B., and (all but most of any) the Laird of Glenmuir and Glenmurdock, whose heart
     has been entirely rejoiced by Charles Tracy having added to his name, and to his children's
     names, that of Stuart.</t:p>
<t:p>Mr. and Mrs. Tracy Stuart are often at Glenmuir; but oftener at Burleigh, where the general,
     I fancy, still resides. He protests that he never will keep a secret again: long may he live to
     say so!</t:p>
