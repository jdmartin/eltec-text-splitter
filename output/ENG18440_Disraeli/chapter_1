<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>It was a bright May morning some twelve years ago, when a youth of still tender
       age, for he had certainly not entered his teens by more than two years, was ushered into the
       waiting-room of a house in the vicinity of St. James's Square, which, though with the general
       appearance of a private residence, and that too of no very ambitious character, exhibited at
       this period
       <pb/> symptoms of being occupied for some public purpose.</p>
<p>The house door was constantly open, and frequent guests even at this early hour crossed the
       threshold. The hall table was covered with sealed letters; and the hall porter inscribed in a
       book the name of every individual who entered.</p>
<p>The young gentleman we have mentioned found himself in a room which offered few resources
       for his amusement. A large table amply covered with writing materials, and a few chairs were
       its sole furniture, except the grey drugget that covered the floor, and a muddy mezzotinto of
       the Duke of Wellington that adorned its cold walls. There was not even a newspaper; and the
       only books were the Court Guide and the London Directory. For some time, he remained with
       patient endurance planted against the wall, with his feet resting on the rail of his chair;
       but at length in his shifting posture he gave evidence of his restlessness, rose from his
       seat, looked out of the window into
       <pb/> a small side court of the house surrounded with dead walls, paced the room, took up the
       Court Guide, changed it for the London Directory, then wrote his name over several sheets of
       foolscap paper, drew various landscapes and faces of his friends; and then, splitting up a
       pen or two, delivered himself of a yawn, which seemed the climax of his weariness.</p>
<p>And yet the youth's appearance did not betoken a character that, if the opportunity had
       offered, could not have found amusement and even instruction. His countenance, radiant with
       health and lustre of innocence, was at the same time thoughtful and resolute. The expression
       of his deep blue eye was serious. Without extreme regularity of features, the face was one
       that would never have passed unobserved. His short upper lip indicated a good breed; and his
       chestnut curls clustered over his open brow, while his shirt collar thrown over his shoulders
       was unrestrained by handkerchief or ribbon. Add to this, a limber and graceful figure, which
       the jacket
       <pb/> of his boyish dress exhibited to great advantage.</p>
<p>Just as the youth, mounted on a chair, was adjusting the portrait of the Duke which he had
       observed to be awry, the gentleman for whom he had been all this time waiting entered the
       room.</p>
<p>"Floreat Etona!" hastily exclaimed the gentleman in a sharp voice, "you are setting the
       Duke to rights. I have left you a long time a prisoner; but I found them so busy here, that I
       myself made my escape with difficulty."</p>
<p>He who uttered these words was a man of middle size and age, originally in all probability
       of a spare habit, but now a little inclined to corpulency. Baldness perhaps contributed to
       the spiritual expression of a brow, which was however essentially intellectual, and gave some
       character of openness to a countenance which, though not ill-favoured, was unhappily stamped
       by a sinister character that was not to be mistaken. His manner was easy, but rather
       audacious
       <pb/> than well-bred. Indeed, while a visage which might otherwise be described as handsome
       was spoilt by a dishonest glance, so a demeanour that was by no means deficient in
       self-possession and facility, was tainted by an innate vulgarity, which in the long run,
       though seldom, yet surely, developed itself.</p>
<p>The youth had jumped off his chair on the entrance of the gentleman, and then taking up his
       hat, said:</p>
<p>"Shall we go to grand-papa now, sir?"</p>
<p>"By all means, my dear boy," said the gentleman, putting his arm within that of the youth;
       and they were just on the point of leaving the waiting-room, when the door was suddenly
       thrown open and two individuals, in a state of very great excitement, rushed into the
       apartment.</p>
<p>"Rigby—Rigby!" they both exclaimed at the same moment. "By G—they're out."</p>
<p>"Who told you?"</p>
<p>"The best authority; one of themselves."</p>
<p>"Who—who?"</p>
<pb/>
<p>"Paul Evelyn; I met him as I passed Brookes', and he told me that Lord Grey had resigned,
       and the King had accepted his resignation."</p>
<p>But Mr. Rigby, who, though very fond of news and much interested in the present, was
       extremely jealous of any one giving him information, was sceptical. He declared that Paul
       Evelyn was always wrong; that it was morally impossible that Paul Evelyn could ever be right;
       that he knew, from the highest authority, that Lord Grey had been twice yesterday with the
       King; that on the last visit nothing was settled; that if he had been at the palace again
       to-day, he could not have been there before twelve o'clock; that it was only now one quarter
       to one; that Lord Grey would have called his colleagues together on his return; that at least
       an hour must have elapsed before anything could possibly have transpired. Then he compared
       and criticised the dates of every rumoured incident of the last twenty-four hours;
       <pb/> (and nobody was stronger in dates than Mr. Rigby); counted even the number of stairs
       which the minister had to ascend and descend in his visit to the palace, and the time their
       mountings and dismountings must have absorbed, (detail was Mr. Rigby's forte); and finally,
       what with his dates, his private information, his knowledge of palace localities, his
       contempt for Paul Evelyn, and his confidence in himself, he succeeded in persuading his
       downcast and disheartened friends, that their comfortable intelligence had not the slightest
       foundation.</p>
<p>They all left the room together; they were in the hall; the gentlemen who brought the news
       looking somewhat depressed but Mr. Rigby gay even amid the prostration of his party, from the
       consciousness that he had most critically demolished a piece of political gossip, and
       conveyed a certain degree of mortification to a couple of his companions; when a travelling
       carriage and four with a ducal coronet drove up to the house. The door was thrown open, the
       <pb/> steps dashed down, and a youthful noble sprang from his chariot into the hall.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Rigby," said the Duke.</p>
<p>"I see your Grace well, I am sure," said Mr. Rigby, with a very softened manner.</p>
<p>"You have heard the news, gentlemen?" he continued.</p>
<p>"What news? Yes—no—that is to say— Mr. Rigby thinks—"</p>
<p>"You know, of course, that Lord Lyndhurst is with the King?"</p>
<p>"It is impossible," said Mr. Rigby.</p>
<p>"I don't think I can be mistaken," said the Duke smiling.</p>
<p>"I will show your Grace that it is impossible," said Mr. Rigby. "Lord Lyndhurst slept at
       Wimbledon. Lord Grey could not have seen the King until twelve o'clock; it is now five
       minutes to one. It is impossible, therefore, that any message from the King could have
       reached Lord Lyndhurst in time for his Lordship to be at the palace at this moment."</p>
<pb/>
<p>"But my authority is a very high one," said the Duke.</p>
<p>"Authority is a phrase," said Mr. Rigby; "we must look to time and place, dates and
       localities, to discover the truth."</p>
<p>"Your Grace was saying that your authority—" ventured to observe Mr. Tadpole, emboldened by
       the presence of a duke, his patron, to struggle against the despotism of a Rigby, his
       tyrant.</p>
<p>"Was the highest," rejoined the Duke smiling; "for it was Lord Lyndhurst himself. I came up
       from Nuneham this morning, passed his Lordship's house in Hyde Park Place as he was getting
       into his carriage in full dress, stopped my own, and learned in a breath, that the Whigs were
       out, and that the King had sent for the Chief Baron. So I came on here at once."</p>
<p>"I always thought the country was sound at bottom," exclaimed Mr. Taper, who, under the old
       system, had sneaked into the Treasury Board.</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<p>Tadpole and Taper were great friends. Neither of them ever despaired of the Commonwealth.
       Even if the Reform Bill were passed, Taper was convinced that the Whigs would never prove men
       of business; and when his friends confessed among themselves that a Tory Government was for
       the future impossible, Taper would remark in a confidential whisper, that for his part he
       believed before the year was over, the Whigs would be turned out by the clerks.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that there is considerable re-action," said Mr. Tadpole. "The infamous
       conduct of the Whigs in the Amersham case, has opened the public mind more than
       anything."</p>
<p>"Aldborough was worse," said Mr. Taper.</p>
<p>"Terrible!" said Tadpole. "They said there was no use discussing the Reform Bill in our
       house. I believe Rigby's great speech on Aldborough has done more towards the re-action than
       all the violence of all the political Unions together."</p>
<p>"Let us hope for the best," said the Duke
       <pb n="11"/> mildly. "'Tis a bold step on the part of the Sovereign, and I am free to say I
       could have wished it postponed; but we must support the King like men. What say you, Rigby?
       You are silent."</p>
<p>"I am thinking what an unfortunate circumstance it was for the Sovereign, the country, and
       the party, that I did not breakfast with Lord Lyndhurst this morning, as I was nearly doing,
       instead of going down to Eton."</p>
<p>"To Eton, and why to Eton?"</p>
<p>"For the sake of my young friend here; Lord Monmouth's grandson. By the bye, you are
       kinsmen. Let me present to your Grace— <hi>Mr. Coningsby</hi> ."</p>
