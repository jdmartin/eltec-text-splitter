<p>In the meantime, after dinner, Tadpole and Taper, who were among the guests of Mr.
       Ormsby, withdrew to a distant sofa, out of earshot, and indulged in confidential talk.</p>
<p>"Such a strength in debate was never before found on a Treasury bench," said Mr. Tadpole;
       "the other side will be dumfounded."</p>
<p>"And what do you put our numbers at now?" inquired Mr. Taper.</p>
<p>"Would you take fifty-five for our majority?" rejoined Mr. Tadpole.</p>
<p>"It is not so much the tail they have, as the excuse their junction will be for the
       moderate, sensible
       <pb n="215"/> men to come over," said Taper. "Our friend, Sir Everard for example, it would
       settle him."</p>
<p>"He is a solemn impostor," rejoined Mr. Tadpole; "but he is a Baronet and a county member,
       and very much looked up to by the Wesleyans. The other men, I know, have refused him a
       peerage."</p>
<p>"And we might hold out judicious hopes," said Taper.</p>
<p>"No one can do that better than you," said Tadpole. "I am apt to say too much about those
       things."</p>
<p>"I make it a rule never to open my mouth on such subjects," said Taper. "A nod or a wink
       will speak volumes. An affectionate pressure of the hand will sometimes do a great deal; and
       I have promised many a peerage without committing myself by an ingenious habit of deference
       which cannot be mistaken by the future noble."</p>
<p>"I wonder what they will do with Rigby," said Tadpole.</p>
<p>"He wants a good deal," said Taper.</p>
<p>"I tell you what, Mr. Taper; the time is
       <pb n="216"/> gone by when a Marquess of Monmouth was Letter A. No. 1."</p>
<p>"Very true, Mr. Tadpole. A wise man would do well now to look to the great middle class, as
       I said the other day to the electors of Shabbyton."</p>
<p>"I had sooner be supported by the Wesleyans," said Mr. Tadpole, "than by all the Marquesses
       in the peerage."</p>
<p>"At the same time," said Mr. Taper, "Rigby is a considerable man. If we want a slashing
       articleâ€”"</p>
<p>"Pooh!" said Mr. Tadpole. "He is quite gone by. He takes three months for his slashing
       articles. Give me a man who can write a leader. Rigby can't write a leader."</p>
<p>"Very few can," said Mr. Taper. "However, I don't think much of the Press. Its power is
       gone by. They overdid it."</p>
<p>"There is Tom Chudleigh," said Tadpole. "What is he to have?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, I hope," said Taper. "I hate him. A coxcomb! cracking his jokes and laughing at
       us."</p>
<pb n="217"/>
<p>"He has done a good deal for the party, though," said Tadpole. "That, to be sure, is only
       an additional reason for throwing him over, as he is too far committed to venture to oppose
       us. But I am afraid from something that dropped to-day, that Sir Robert thinks he has
       claims."</p>
<p>"We must stop them," said Taper, growing pale. "Fellows like Chudleigh when they once get
       in, are always in one's way. I have no objection to young noblemen being put forward, for
       they are preferred so rapidly, and then their fathers die, that in the long run they do not
       practically interfere with us."</p>
<p>"Well, his name was mentioned," said Tadpole. "There is no concealing that."</p>
<p>"I will speak to Earwig," said Taper. "He shall just drop into Sir Robert's ear by chance,
       that Chudleigh used to quiz him in the smoking room. Those little bits of information do a
       great deal of good."</p>
<p>"Well, I leave him to you," said Tadpole. "I am heartily with you in keeping out all
       <pb n="218"/> fellows like Chudleigh. They are very well for opposition; but in office we
       don't want wits."</p>
<p>"And when shall we have the answer from Knowsley?" inquired Taper. "You anticipate no
       possible difficulty?"</p>
<p>"I tell you it is 'carte blanche,' replied Tadpole. "Four places in the Cabinet. Two
       secretaryships at the least. Do you happen to know any gentlemen of your acquaintance, Mr.
       Taper, who refuse. Secretaryships of State so easily, that you can for an instant doubt of
       the present arrangement?"</p>
<p>"I know none, indeed," said Mr. Taper with a grim smile.</p>
<p>"The thing is done," said Mr. Tadpole.</p>
<p>"And now for our cry?" said Mr. Taper.</p>
<p>"It is not a Cabinet for a good cry," said Tadpole; "but then on the other hand, it is a
       Cabinet that will sow dissension in the opposite ranks, and prevent them having a good
       cry."</p>
<p>"Ancient institutions and modern improvements, I suppose, Mr. Tadpole?"</p>
<pb n="219"/>
<p>"Ameliorations is the better word; ameliorations. Nobody knows exactly what it means."</p>
<p>"We go strong on the Church?" said Mr. Taper.</p>
<p>"And no Repeal of the Malt Tax; you were right, Taper. It can't be listened to for a
       moment."</p>
<p>"Something might be done with prerogative," said Mr. Taper; "the King's constitutional
       choice."</p>
<p>"Not too much," replied Mr. Tadpole. "It is a raw time yet for prerogative."</p>
<p>"Ah! Tadpole," said Mr. Taper, getting a little maudlin; "I often think, if the time should
       ever come, when you and I should be joint Secretaries of the Treasury!"</p>
<p>"We shall see, we shall see. All we have to do is to get into Parliament, work well
       together, and keep other men down."</p>
<p>"We will do our best," said Taper. "A dissolution you hold inevitable?"</p>
<p>"How are you and I to get into Parliament, if there be not one? We must make it inevitable.
       I tell you what, Taper, the lists must
       <pb n="220"/> prove a dissolution inevitable. You understand me? If the present Parliament
       goes on, where shall we be? We shall have new men cropping up every session."</p>
<p>"True, terribly true," said Mr. Taper. "That we should ever live to see a Tory government
       again! We have reason to be very thankful."</p>
<p>"Hush!" said Mr. Tadpole. "The time has gone by for Tory governments; what the country
       requires is a sound Conservative government."</p>
<p>"A sound Conservative government," said Taper musingly. "I understand: Tory men and Whig
       measures."</p>
