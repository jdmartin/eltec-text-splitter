<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>There are few things more full of delight and splendour, than to travel during the
       heat of a refulgent summer in the green district of some ancient forest.</p>
<p>In one of our midland counties, there is a region of this character, to which during a
       season of peculiar lustre, we would introduce the reader.</p>
<p>It was a fragment of one of those vast sylvan tracts wherein Norman kings once hunted, and
       Saxon outlaws plundered; and although the plough had for centuries successfully invaded
       <pb n="235"/> brake and bower, the relics retained all their original character of wildness
       and seclusion. Sometimes the green earth was thickly studded with groves of huge and vigorous
       oaks, intersected with those smooth and sunny glades that seem as if they must be cut for
       dames and knights to saunter on. Then again the undulating ground spread on all sides, far as
       the eye could range, covered with copse and fern of immense growth. Anon, you found yourself
       in a turfy wilderness girt in apparently by dark woods. And when you had wound your way a
       little through this gloomy belt, the landscape, still strictly sylvan, would beautifully
       expand with every combination and variety of woodland; while in its centre, the wild fowl
       covered the waters of a lake, and the deer basked on the knolls that abounded on its
       banks.</p>
<p>It was in the month of August, some six or seven years ago, that a traveller on foot,
       touched as he emerged from the dark wood by the beauty of this scene, threw himself under the
       shade of a spreading tree, and stretched his limbs on the turf for enjoyment rather than
       <pb n="236"/> repose. The sky was deep coloured and without a cloud, save here and there a
       minute, sultry, burnished vapour, almost as glossy as the heavens. Everything was as still as
       it was bright. All seemed brooding and basking. The bee upon its wing was the only stirring
       sight, and its song the only sound.</p>
<p>The traveller fell into a reverie. He was young, and therefore his musings were of the
       future. He had felt the pride of learning, so ennobling to youth; he was not a stranger to
       the stirring impulses of a high ambition, though the world to him was as yet only a world of
       books, and all that he knew of the schemes of statesmen and the passions of the people, were
       to be found in their annals. Often had his fitful fancy dwelt with fascination on visions of
       personal distinction, of future celebrity, perhaps even of enduring fame. But his dreams were
       of another colour now. The surrounding scene, so fair, so still, and sweet; so abstracted
       from all the tumult of the world, its strife, its passions, and its cares; had fallen on his
       heart with its soft and subduing spirit: had fallen on a
       <pb n="237"/> heart still pure and innocent; the heart of one, who, notwithstanding all his
       high resolves and daring thoughts, was blessed with that tenderness of soul which is
       sometimes linked with an ardent imagination and a strong will. The traveller was an orphan;
       more than that—a solitary orphan. The sweet sedulousness of a mother's love, a sister's
       mystical affection, had not cultivated his early susceptibility. No soft pathos of expression
       had appealed to his childish ear. He was alone, among strangers, calmly and coldly kind. It
       must indeed have been a truly gentle disposition that could have withstood such hard neglect.
       All that he knew of the power of the softer passions might be found in the fanciful and
       romantic annals of school-boy friendship.</p>
<p>And those friends too, so fond, so sympathizing, so devoted, where were they now? Already
       they were dispersed. The first great separation of life had been experienced. The former
       school-boy had planted his foot on the threshold of manhood. True, many of them might meet
       again. Many of them the University
       <pb n="238"/> must again unite. But never with the same feelings. The space of time, passed
       in the world before they again met, would be an age of sensation, passion, experience to all
       of them. They would meet again with altered mien; with different manners, different voices.
       Their eyes would not shine with the same light; they would not speak the same words. The
       favourite phrases of their intimacy, the mystic sounds that spoke only to their initiated
       ear, they would be ashamed to use them. Yes! they might meet again; but the gushing and
       secret tenderness was gone for ever.</p>
<p>Nor could our pensive youth conceal it from himself that it was affection, and mainly
       affection, that had bound him to these dear companions. They could not be to him what he had
       been to them. His had been the inspiring mind that had guided their opinions, formed their
       tastes, directed the bent and tenor of their lives and thoughts. Often indeed had he needed,
       sometimes indeed he had sighed for the companionship of an equal, or superior mind; one who
       by the comprehension of his thought, and
       <pb n="239"/> the richness of his knowledge, and the advantage of his experience, might
       strengthen and illuminate and guide his obscure or hesitating or unpractised intelligence. He
       had scarcely been fortunate in this respect, and he deeply regretted it; for he was one of
       those who was not content with excelling in his own circle, if he thought there was one
       superior to it. Absolute, not relative distinction, was his noble aim.</p>
<p>Alone, in a lonely scene, he doubly felt the solitude of his life and mind. His heart and
       his intellect seemed both to need a companion. Books, and action, and deep thought, might in
       time supply the want of that intellectual guide; but for the heart where was he to find
       solace?</p>
<p>Ah! if she would but come forth from that shining lake like a beautiful Ondine! Ah! if she
       would but step out from the green shade of that secret grove like a Dryad of sylvan Greece!
       O! mystery of mysteries! when the youth dreams his first dream over some imaginary
       heroine!</p>
<p>Suddenly the brooding wild-fowl rose from
       <pb n="240"/> the bosom of the lake, soared in the air, and uttering mournful shrieks,
       whirled in agitated tumult. The deer started from their knolls, no longer sunny, stared
       around, and rushed into the woods. Coningsby raised his eyes from the turf on which they had
       been long fixed in abstraction, and he observed that the azure sky had vanished, a thin white
       film had suddenly spread itself over the heavens, and the wind moaned with a sad and fitful
       gust.</p>
<p>He had some reason to believe that on the other side of the opposite wood, the forest was
       intersected by a public road, and that there were some habitations. Immediately rising, he
       descended at a rapid pace into the valley, passed the lake, and then struck into the
       ascending wood of the bank opposite to that on which he had mused away some precious
       time.</p>
<p>The wind howled, the branches of the forest stirred, and sent forth sounds like an
       incantation. Soon might be distinguished the various voices of the mighty trees, as they
       expressed their terror or their agony. The oak roared,
       <pb n="241"/> the beech shrieked, the elm sent forth its deep and long-drawn groan; while
       ever and anon, amid a momentary pause, the passion of the ash was heard in moans of thrilling
       anguish.</p>
<p>Coningsby hurried on, the forest became less close. All that he aspired to was to gain more
       open country. Now he was in a rough flat land covered only here and there with some dwarf
       underwood; the horizon bounded at no great distance by a barren hill of moderate elevation.
       He gained its height with ease. He looked over a vast open country, like a wild common; in
       the extreme distance hills covered with woods; the plain intersected by two good roads; the
       sky entirely clouded, but in the distance black as ebony.</p>
<p>A place of refuge too was at hand: screened from his first glance by some elm trees, the
       ascending smoke now betrayed a roof which Coningsby reached before the tempest broke. The
       forest inn was also a farm-house. There was a comfortable-looking kitchen enough; but the
       ingle nook was full of smokers, and Coningsby was glad to avail himself of the only
       <pb n="242"/> private room for the simple meal which they offered him. Only eggs and bacon;
       but very welcome to a pedestrian and a hungry one.</p>
<p>As he stood at the window of his little apartment, watching the large drops that were the
       heralds of the coming hurricane, and waiting for his repast, a flash of lightning illumined
       the whole country, and a horseman at full speed, followed by his groom, galloped up to the
       door.</p>
<p>The remarkable beauty of the animal so attracted Coningsby's attention, that it prevented
       him catching even a glimpse of the rider, who rapidly dismounted and entered the inn. The
       host shortly after came in and asked Coningsby whether he had any objection to a gentleman,
       who was driven there by the storm, sharing his room until it subsided. The consequence of the
       immediate assent of Coningsby was, that the landlord retired and soon returned ushering in an
       individual, who though perhaps ten years older than Coningsby, was still, according to
       Hippocrates, in the period of lusty youth. He was above the middle height, and
       <pb n="243"/> of a distinguished air and figure; pale, with an impressive brow, and dark eyes
       of great intelligence.</p>
<p>"I am glad that we have both escaped the storm," said the stranger; "and I am greatly
       indebted to you for your courtesy." He slightly and graciously bowed as he spoke in a voice
       of remarkable clearness; and his manner, though easy, was touched with a degree of dignity
       that was engaging.</p>
<p>"The inn is a common home," replied Coningsby returning his salute.</p>
<p>"And free from cares," added the stranger. Then looking through the window, he said: "A
       strange storm this. I was sauntering in the sunshine, when suddenly I found I had to gallop
       for my life. 'Tis more like a white squall in the Mediterranean than anything else."</p>
<p>"I never was in the Mediterranean," said Coningsby. "There is nothing that I should like so
       much as to travel."</p>
<p>"You are travelling," rejoined his companion. "Every movement is travel, if
       understood."</p>
<p>"Ah! but the Mediterranean!" exclaimed
       <pb n="244"/> Coningsby. "What would I not give to see Athens!"</p>
<p>"I have seen it," said the stranger, slightly shrugging his shoulders; "and more wonderful
       things. Phantoms and spectres! The Age of Ruins is past. Have you seen Manchester?"</p>
<p>"I have seen nothing," said Coningsby; "this is my first wandering. I am about to visit a
       friend who lives in this county, and I have sent on my baggage as I could. For myself, I
       determined to trust to a less common place conveyance."</p>
<p>"And seek adventures," said the stranger smiling. "Well, according to Cervantes, they
       should begin in an inn."</p>
<p>"I fear that the age of adventures is past as well as that of ruins," replied
       Coningsby.</p>
<p>"Adventures are to the adventurous," said the stranger.</p>
<p>At this moment, a pretty serving maid entered the room. She laid the dapper-cloth and
       arranged the table with a self-possession quite admirable. She seemed unconscious that any
       being was in the chamber except herself, or
       <pb n="245"/> that there were any other duties to perform in life beyond filling a
       salt-cellar or folding a napkin.</p>
<p>"She does not even look at us," said Coningsby when she had quitted the room; "and I dare
       say only a prude."</p>
<p>"She is calm," said the stranger, "because she is mistress of her subject; 'tis the secret
       of self-possession. She is here, as a Duchess at court."</p>
<p>They brought in Coningsby's meal, and he invited the stranger to join him. The invitation
       was accepted with cheerfulness.</p>
<p>"'Tis but simple fare," said Coningsby as the maiden uncovered the still hissing bacon and
       the eggs that looked like tufts of primroses.</p>
<p>"Nay, a national dish," said the stranger, glancing quickly at the table, "whose fame is a
       proverb. And what more should we expect under a simple roof! How much better than an omelette
       or a greasy olla, that they would give us in a posada! 'Tis a wonderful country this England!
       What a napkin! How spotless! And so sweet, I declare 'tis a perfume.
       <pb n="246"/> There is not a princess throughout the South of Europe served with the
       cleanliness that meets us in this cottage."</p>
<p>"An inheritance from our Saxon fathers?" said Coningsby. "I apprehend the northern nations
       have a greater sense of cleanliness—of propriety—of what we call comfort?"</p>
<p>"By no means," said the stranger, "the East is the Land of the Bath. Moses and Mahomet made
       cleanliness religion."</p>
<p>"You will let me help you?" said Coningsby, offering him a plate which he had filled.</p>
<p>"I thank you," said the stranger, "but it is one of my bread days. With your permission
       this shall be my dish," and he cut from the large loaf a supply of crusts.</p>
<p>"'Tis but unsavory fare after a gallop," said Coningsby.</p>
<p>"Ah! you are proud of your bacon and your eggs," said the stranger smiling; "but I love
       corn and wine. They are our chief and our oldest luxuries. Time has brought us substitutes,
       but how inferior! Man has deified corn and wine! but not even the Chinese
       <pb n="247"/> or the Irish have raised temples to tea and potatoes."</p>
<p>"But Ceres without Bacchus," said Coningsby, "how does that do? Think you, under this roof
       we could invoke the God?"</p>
<p>"Let us swear by his body that we will try," said the stranger.</p>
<p>Alas! the landlord was not a priest of Bacchus. But then these inquiries led to the finest
       perry in the world. The young men agreed they had seldom tasted anything more delicious; they
       sent for another bottle. Coningsby, who was much interested by his new companion, enjoyed
       himself amazingly.</p>
<p>A cheese, such as Derby can alone produce, could not induce the stranger to be even
       partially inconstant to his crusts. But his talk was as vivacious, as if the talker had been
       stimulated by the juices of the finest banquet. Coningsby had never met or read of any one
       like this chance companion. His sentences were so short, his language so racy, his voice rang
       so clear, his elocution was so complete. On all subjects his mind seemed to be instructed,
       <pb n="248"/> and his opinions formed. He flung out a result in a few words; he solved with a
       phrase some deep problem that men muse over for years. He said many things that were strange,
       yet they immediately appeared to be true. Then, without the slightest air of pretension or
       parade, he seemed to know everybody as well as everything. Monarchs, statesmen, authors,
       adventurers of all descriptions and of all climes—if their names occurred in their
       conversation, he described them in an epigrammatic sentence, or revealed their precise
       position, character, calibre, by a curt dramatic trait. All this, too, without any excitement
       of manner; on the contrary with repose amounting almost to nonchalance. If his address had a
       fault in it, it was rather a deficiency of earnestness. A slight spirit of mockery played
       over his speech even when you deemed him most serious; you were startled by his sudden
       transitions from profound thought to poignant sarcasm. A very singular freedom from passion
       and prejudice on every topic on which they treated might be some compensation for this want
       of earnestness; perhaps
       <pb n="249"/> was its consequence. Certainly it was difficult to ascertain his precise
       opinions on many subjects, though his manner was frank even to abandonment. And yet
       throughout his whole conversation, not a stroke of egotism, not a word, not a circumstance,
       escaped him by which you could judge of his position or purposes in life. As little did he
       seem to care to discover those of his companion. He did not by any means monopolise the
       conversation. Far from it; he continually asked questions, and while he received answers, or
       had engaged his fellow traveller in any exposition of his opinions or feelings, he listened
       with a serious and fixed attention, looking Coningsby in the face with a steadfast
       glance.</p>
<p>"I perceive," said Coningsby, pursuing a train of thought which the other had indicated,
       "that you have great confidence in the influence of individual character. I also have some
       confused persuasions of that kind. But it is not the Spirit of the Age."</p>
<p>"The Age does not believe in great men, because it does not possess any," replied the
       <pb n="250"/> stranger. "The Spirit of the Age is the very thing that a great man
       changes."</p>
<p>"But does not he rather avail himself of it?" inquired Coningsby.</p>
<p>"Parvenus do;" rejoined his companion, "but not prophets, great legislators, great
       conquerors. They destroy and they create."</p>
<p>"But are these times for great legislators and great conquerors?" urged Coningsby.</p>
<p>"When were they more wanted?" asked the stranger. "From the throne to the hovel all call
       for a guide. You give monarchs constitutions to teach them sovereignty, and nations
       Sunday-schools to inspire them with faith."</p>
<p>"But what is an individual!" exclaimed Coningsby, "against a vast public opinion?"</p>
<p>"Divine," said the stranger. "God made Man in his own image; but the Public is made by
       Newspapers, Members of Parliament, Excise Officers, Poor Law Guardians. Would Philip have
       succeeded, if Epaminondas had not been slain? And if Philip had not succeeded? Would Prussia
       have existed had Frederick not been born? And if Frederick had not been
       <pb n="251"/> born? What would have been the fate of the Stuarts if Prince Henry had not
       died, and Charles I., as was intended, had been Archbishop of Canterbury?"</p>
<p>"But when men are young, they want experience," said Coningsby; "and when they have gained
       experience, they want energy."</p>
<p>"Great men never want experience," said the stranger.</p>
<p>"But everybody says that experience—"</p>
<p>"Is the best thing in the world—a treasure for you, for me, for millions. But for a
       creative mind, less than nothing. Almost everything that is great has been done by
       youth."</p>
<p>"It is at least a creed flattering to our years," said Coningsby with a smile.</p>
<p>"Nay," said the stranger; "for life in general there is but one decree. Youth is a blunder;
       Manhood a struggle; old Age a regret. Do not suppose," he added smiling, "that I hold that
       youth is genius; all that I say is, that genius, when young, is divine. Why the greatest
       captains of ancient and modern times both conquered Italy at five-and-twenty! Youth,
       <pb n="252"/> extreme youth, overthrew the Persian Empire. Don John of Austria won Lepanto at
       twenty-five —the greatest battle of modern time; had it not been for the jealousy of Philip,
       the next year he would have been Emperor of Mauritania. Gaston de Foix was only twenty-two
       when he stood a victor on the plain of Ravenna. Every one remembers Condé and Rocroy at the
       same age. Gustavus Adolphus died at thirty-eight. Look at his captains: that wonderful Duke
       of Weimar, only thirty-six when he died. Banier himself, after all his miracles, died at
       forty-five. Cortes was little more than thirty when he gazed upon the golden cupolas of
       Mexico. When Maurice of Saxony died at thirty-two, all Europe acknowledged the loss of the
       greatest captain and the profoundest statesman of the age. Then there is Nelson, Clive—but
       these are warriors, and perhaps you may think there are greater things than war. I do not; I
       worship the Lord of Hosts. But take the most illustrious achievements of civil prudence.
       Innocent III. the greatest of the Popes, was the despot of Christendom at thirty-seven.
       <pb n="253"/> John de Medici was a Cardinal at fifteen, and Guicciardini tells us baffled
       with his state craft Ferdinand of Arragon himself. He was Pope as Leo X. at thirty-seven.
       Luther robbed even him of his richest province at thirty-five. Take Ignatius Loyola and John
       Wesley, they worked with young brains. Ignatius was only thirty when he made his pilgrimage
       and wrote the 'Spiritual Exercises.' Pascal wrote a great work at sixteen, the greatest of
       Frenchmen and died at thirty-seven!</p>
<p>Ah! that fatal thirty-seven, which reminds me of Byron, greater even as a man than a
       writer. Was it experience that guided the pencil of Raphael when he painted the palaces of
       Rome! He died too at thirty-seven. Richelieu was Secretary of State at thirty-one. Well then,
       there are Bolingbroke and Pitt, both ministers before other men leave off cricket. Grotius
       was in great practice at seventeen, and Attorney-General at twenty-four. And
       Acquaviva—Acquaviva was General of the Jesuits, ruled every cabinet in Europe, and colonised
       America before he was thirty-seven. What
       <pb n="254"/> a career!" exclaimed the stranger, rising from his chair and walking up and
       down the room, "the secret sway of Europe! That was indeed a position! But it is needless to
       multiply instances. The history of Heroes is the history of Youth."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Coningsby, "I should like to be a great man!"</p>
<p>The stranger threw at him a scrutinizing glance. His countenance was serious. He said in a
       voice of almost solemn melody:</p>
<p>"Nurture your mind with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes."</p>
<p>"You seem to me a hero," said Coningsby in a tone of real feeling, which, half ashamed of
       his emotion, he tried to turn into playfulness.</p>
<p>"I am, and must ever be," said the stranger, "but a dreamer of dreams." Then going towards
       the window and changing into a familiar tone, as if to divert the conversation, he added;
       "What a delicious afternoon! I look forward to my ride with delight. You rest here?"</p>
<p>"No; I go on to Nottingham, where I shall sleep."</p>
<pb n="255"/>
<p>"And I in the opposite direction." And he rang the bell and ordered his horses.</p>
<p>"I long to see your mare again," said Coningsby. "She seemed to me so beautiful."</p>
<p>"She is not only of pure race," said the stranger, "but of the highest and rarest breed in
       Arabia. Her name is 'the Daughter of the Star.' She is a foal of that famous mare, which
       belonged to the Prince of the Wahabees; and to possess which, I believe was one of the
       principal causes of war between that tribe and the Egyptians. The Pacha of Egypt gave her to
       me, and I would not change her for her statue in pure gold, even carved by Lysippus. Come
       round to the stable and see her."</p>
<p>They went out together. It was a soft sunny afternoon; the air fresh from the rain, but
       mild and exhilarating.</p>
<p>The groom brought forth the mare. "The Daughter of the Star" stood before Coningsby with
       her sinewy shape of matchless symmetry; her burnished skin, black mane, legs like those of an
       antelope, her little ears, dark speaking eye, and tail worthy of a Pacha. And who was her
       <pb n="256"/> master, and whither was she about to take him?</p>
<p>Coningsby was so naturally well-bred, that we may be sure it was not curiosity; no, it was
       a finer feeling that made him hesitate and think a little, and then say:</p>
<p>"I am sorry to part."</p>
<p>"I also," said the stranger. "But life is constant separation."</p>
<p>"I hope we may meet again," said Coningsby.</p>
<p>"If our acquaintance be worth preserving," said the stranger, "you may be sure it will not
       be lost."</p>
<p>"But mine is not worth preserving," said Coningsby earnestly. "It is yours that is the
       treasure. You teach me things of which I have long mused."</p>
<p>The stranger took the bridle of the "Daughter of the Star," and turning round with a faint
       smile, extended his hand to his companion.</p>
<p>"Your mind at least is nurtured with great thoughts," said Coningsby, "your actions should
       be heroic."</p>
<p>"Action is not for me;" said the stranger,
       <pb n="257"/> "I am of that faith that the Apostles professed before they followed their
       Master."</p>
<p>He vaulted into his saddle, the "Daughter of the Star" bounded away as if she scented the
       air of the Desart from which she and her rider had alike sprung, and Coningsby remained in
       profound meditation.</p>
