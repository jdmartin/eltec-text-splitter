<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>" <hi>My</hi> fathers perilled their blood and fortunes for the cause of the Sovereignty
       and Church of England," said Lyle to Coningsby, as they were lying stretched out on the sunny
       turf in the park of Beaumanoir, "and I inherit their passionate convictions. They were
       Catholics as their descendant. No doubt they would have been glad to see their ancient faith
       predominant in their ancient land; but they bowed, as I bow, to an adverse and apparently
       irrevocable decree. But if we could not have the Church of our fathers, we honoured and
       respected the Church of their children. It was at least a
       <pb n="308"/> Church; a "Catholic and Apostolic Church," as it daily declares itself.
       Besides, it was our friend. When we were persecuted by Puritanic Parliaments, it was the
       Sovereign and the Church of England that interposed, with the certainty of creating against
       themselves odium and mistrust, to shield us from the dark and relentless bigotry of
       Calvinism."</p>
<p>"I believe," said Coningsby, "that if Charles I had hanged all the Catholic priests that
       Parliament petitioned him to execute, he would never have lost his crown."</p>
<p>"You were mentioning my father," continued Lyle. "He certainly was a Whig. Galled by
       political exclusion, he connected himself with that party in the state, which began to
       intimate emancipation. After all, they did not emancipate us. It was the fall of the Papacy
       in England that founded the Whig aristocracy; a fact that must always lie at the bottom of
       their hearts; and I assure you does of mine.</p>
<p>"I gathered at in early age," continued Lyle, "that it was expected that I was to inherit
       my
       <pb n="309"/> father's political connections with the family estates. Under ordinary
       circumstances this would probably have occurred. In times that did not force one to ponder,
       it is not likely I should have recoiled from uniting myself with a party formed of the best
       families in England, and ever famous for accomplished men and charming women. But I enter
       life in the midst of a convulsion in which the very principles of our political and social
       systems are called in question. I cannot unite myself with the party of destruction. It is an
       operative cause alien to my being. What then offers itself? The Duke talks to me of
       Conservative principles; but he does not inform me what they are. I observe indeed a party in
       the State whose rule it is to consent to no change, until it is clamorously called for, and
       then instantly to yield; but those are Concessionary, not Conservative principles. This party
       treats institutions as we do our pheasants, they preserve only to destroy them. But is there
       a statesman among these conservatives who offers us a dogma for a guide, or defines any great
       political truth which
       <pb n="310"/> we should aspire to establish? It seems to me a barren thing—this
       Conservativism—an unhappy cross-breed, the mule of politics that engenders nothing. What do
       you think of all this, Coningsby? I assure you I feel confused, perplexed, harassed. I know I
       have public duties to perform; I am in fact every day of my life solicited by all parties to
       throw the weight of my influence in one scale or another; but I am paralysed. I often wish I
       had no position in the country. The sense of its responsibility depresses me; makes me
       miserable. I speak to you without reserve; with a frankness which our short acquaintance
       scarcely authorizes; but Henry Sydney has talked of you so often to me, and I have so long
       wished to I know you, that I open my heart without restraint."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," said Coningsby, "you have but described my feelings when you depictured
       your own. My mind on these subjects has long been a chaos. I float in a sea of troubles, and
       should long ago have been wrecked had I not been sustained by a profound, however
       <pb n="311"/> vague, conviction, that there are still great truths, if we could but work them
       out; that Government for instance should be loved and not hated, and that Religion should be
       a faith and not a form."</p>
<p>The moral influence of residence furnishes some of the most interesting traits of our
       national manners. The presence of this power was very apparent throughout the district that
       surrounded Beaumanoir. The ladies of that house were deeply sensible of the responsibility of
       their position; thoroughly comprehending their duties, they fulfilled them without
       affectation, with earnestness, and with that effect which springs from a knowledge of the
       subject. The consequences were visible in the superior tone of the peasantry to that which we
       too often witness. The ancient feudal feeling that lingers in these sequestered haunts, is an
       instrument which, when skilfully wielded, may be productive of vast social benefit. The Duke
       understood this well; and his family had imbibed all his views and seconded them. Lady
       Everingham, once more in the scene of her
       <pb n="312"/> past life, resumed the exercise of gentle offices, as if she had never ceased
       to be a daughter of the house, and as if another domain had not its claims upon her
       solicitude. Coningsby was often the companion of herself and her sister in their pilgrimages
       of charity and kindness. He admired the graceful energy, and thorough acquaintance with
       details, with which Lady Everingham superintended schools, organized societies of relief, and
       the discrimination which she brought to bear upon individual cases of suffering or
       misfortune. He was deeply interested as he watched the magic of her manner, as she melted the
       obdurate, inspired the slothful, consoled the afflicted, and animated with her smiles and
       ready phrase, the energetic and the dutiful. Nor on these occasions was Lady Theresa seen
       under less favourable auspices. Without the vivacity of her sister, there was in her
       demeanour a sweet seriousness of purpose that was most winning; and sometimes a burst of
       energy, a trait of decision, which strikingly contrasted with the somewhat over-controlled
       character of her life in drawing-rooms.</p>
<pb n="313"/>
<p>In the society of these engaging companions, time for Coningsby glided away in a course
       which he sometimes wished nothing might disturb. Apart from them, he frequently felt himself
       pensive and vaguely disquieted. Even the society of Henry Sydney, or Eustace Lyle, much as
       under ordinary circumstances they would have been adapted to his mood, did not compensate for
       the absence of that indefinite, that novel, that strange, yet sweet excitement, which he
       felt, he knew not exactly how or why, stealing over his senses. Sometimes the countenance of
       Theresa Sydney flitted over his musing vision; sometimes the merry voice of Lady Everingham
       haunted his ear. But to be their companion in ride or ramble; to avoid any arrangement which
       for many hours should deprive him of their presence; was every day with Coningsby a principal
       object.</p>
<p>One day he had been out shooting rabbits with Lyle and Henry Sydney, and returned with them
       late to Beaumanoir to dinner. He had not enjoyed his sport, and he had not shot at all well.
       He had been dreamy, silent, had deeply felt the
       <pb n="314"/> want of Lady Everingham's conversation, that was ever so poignant and so
       interestingly personal to himself; one of the secrets of her sway, though Coningsby was not
       then quite conscious of it. Talk to a man about himself, and he is generally captivated. That
       is the real way to win him. The only difference between men and women in this respect is,
       that most women are vain, and some men are not. There are some men who have no self-love; but
       if they have, female vanity is but a trifling and airy passion compared with the vast
       voracity of appetite which in the sterner sex can swallow anything, and always crave for
       more.</p>
<p>When Coningsby entered the drawing-room, there seemed a somewhat unusual bustle in the
       room, but as the twilight had descended, it was at first rather difficult to distinguish who
       was present. He soon perceived that there were strangers. A gentleman of pleasing appearance
       was near a sofa on which the Duchess and Lady Everingham were seated, and discoursing with
       some volubility. His phrases seemed to command attention; his audience
       <pb n="315"/> had an animated glance, eyes sparkling with intelligence and interest; not a
       word was disregarded. Coningsby did not advance as was his custom; he had a sort of instinct,
       that the stranger was discoursing of matters of which he knew nothing. He turned to a table,
       he took up a book, which he began to read upside downwards. A hand was lightly placed on his
       shoulder. He looked round, it was another stranger; who said, however, in a tone of familiar
       friendliness:</p>
<p>"How do you do, Coningsby?"</p>
<p>It was a young man about four and twenty years of age, very tall, very good looking. Old
       recollections, his intimate greeting, a strong family likeness, helped Coningsby to
       conjecture correctly who was the person who addressed him. It was, indeed, the eldest son of
       the Duke, the Marquess of Beaumanoir, who had arrived at his father's unexpectedly with his
       friend, Mr. Melton, on their way to the north.</p>
<p>Mr. Melton was a gentleman of the highest fashion, and a very great favourite in society.
       He was about thirty, good looking, with an
       <pb n="316"/> air that commanded attention, and manners, though facile, sufficiently
       finished. He was very communicative, though calm, and without being witty, had at his service
       a turn of phrase, acquired by practice and success, which was, or which always seemed to be,
       poignant. The ladies seemed especially to be delighted at his arrival. He knew every thing of
       every body they cared about; and Coningsby listened in silence to names which for the first
       time reached his ears, but which seemed to excite great interest. Mr. Melton frequently
       addressed his most lively observations and his most sparkling anecdotes to Lady Everingham,
       who evidently relished all that he said, and returned him in kind.</p>
<p>Throughout the dinner Lady Everingham and Mr. Melton maintained what appeared a most
       entertaining conversation, principally about things and persons which did not in any way
       interest our hero; who, however, had the satisfaction of hearing Lady Everingham in the
       drawing-room say in a careless tone to the Duchess:</p>
<pb n="317"/>
<p>"I am so glad, mamma, that Mr. Melton has come; we wanted some amusement."</p>
<p>What a confession! What a revelation to Coningsby of his infinite insignificance! Coningsby
       entertained a great aversion for Mr. Melton, but felt his spirit unequal to the social
       contest. The genius of the untutored inexperienced youth quailed before that of the long
       practised, skillful, man of the world. What was the magic of this man? What was the secret of
       this ease, that nothing could disturb and yet was not deficient in deference and good taste?
       And then his dress, it seemed fashioned by some unearthly artist; yet it was impossible to
       detect the unobtrusive causes of the general effect that was irresistible. Coningsby's coat
       was made by Stultz; almost every fellow in the sixth form had his coats made by Stultz; yet
       Coningsby fancied that his own garment looked as if it had been furnished by some rustic
       slopseller. He began to wonder where Mr. Melton got his boots from, and glanced at his own,
       which though made in St. James' Street, seemed to him to have a cloddish air.</p>
<pb n="318"/>
<p>Lady Everingham was determined that Mr. Melton should see Beaumanoir to the greatest
       advantage. Mr. Melton had never been there before, except at Christmas with the house full of
       visitors and factitious gaiety. Now he was to see the country. Accordingly there were long
       rides every day, which Lady Everingham called expeditions, and which generally produced some
       slight incident which she styled an adventure. She was very kind to Coningsby, but had no
       time to indulge in the lengthened conversations which he had previously found so magical. Mr.
       Melton was always on the scene, the monopolising hero, it would seem, of every thought, and
       phrase, and plan. Coningsby began to think that Beaumanoir was not so delightful a place as
       he had imagined. He began to think that he had stayed there perhaps too long. He had received
       a letter from Mr. Rigby to inform him that he was expected at Coningsby Castle at the
       beginning of September, to meet Lord Monmouth who had returned to England, and for grave and
       special reasons was about to reside at his chief seat, which he had not visited for many
       years. Coningsby had
       <pb n="319"/> intended to have remained at Beaumanoir until that time; but suddenly it
       occurred to him, that the Age of Ruins was past, and that he ought to seize the opportunity
       of visiting Manchester, which was in the same county as the Castle of his grandfather. So
       difficult is it to speculate upon events! Muse as we may, we are the creatures of
       circumstances; and the unexpected arrival of a London dandy at the country seat of an English
       nobleman sent this representative of the New Generation, fresh from Eton, nursed in
       prejudices, yet with a mind predisposed to inquiry and prone to meditation, to a scene apt to
       stimulate both intellectual processes; which demanded investigation and induced thought—the
       great <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Labour</hi> .</p>
