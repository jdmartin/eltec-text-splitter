<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>It seemed to Coningsby in his way to his room, that the castle was in a state of
       great excitement; everywhere bustle, preparation, moving to and fro, ascending and descending
       of stairs, servants in every corner; orders boundlessly given, rapidly obeyed; many desires,
       equal gratification. All this made him rather nervous. It was quite unlike Beaumanoir. That
       also was a place, but it was a home. This, though it should be one to him, seemed to have
       nothing of that character. Of all mysteries the social mysteries are the most appalling.
       Going to an assembly for the first time is more alarming than the first battle. Coningsby had
       never before been in a great house full of company. It
       <pb n="61"/> seemed an overwhelming affair. The sight of the servants bewildered him; how
       then was he to encounter their masters?</p>
<p>That however he must do in a moment. A groom of the chambers indicates the way to him, as
       he proceeds with a hesitating yet hurried step through several ante-chambers and
       drawing-rooms; then doors are suddenly thrown open, and he is ushered into the largest and
       most sumptuous saloon that he had ever entered. It was full of ladies and gentlemen.
       Coningsby for the first time in his life was at a great party. His immediate emotion was to
       sink into the earth, but perceiving that no one even noticed him, and that not an eye had
       been attracted to his entrance, he regained his breath and in some degree his composure, and
       standing aside, endeavoured to make himself as well as he could master of the land.</p>
<p>Not a human being that he had ever seen before! The circumstance of not being noticed which
       a few minutes since he had felt as a relief, became now a cause of annoyance. It seemed that
       he was the only person standing alone
       <pb n="62"/> whom no one was addressing. He felt renewed and aggravated embarrassment, and
       fancied, perhaps was conscious, that he was blushing. At length his ear caught the voice of
       Mr. Rigby. The speaker was not visible; he was at a distance surrounded by a wondering group
       whom he was severally and collectively contradicting, but Coningsby could not mistake the
       harsh, high tones of that arrogant voice. He was not sorry indeed that Mr. Rigby did not
       observe him. Coningsby never loved him particularly, which was rather ungrateful, for he was
       a person who had been kind, and on the whole, serviceable to him, but Coningsby writhed, and
       especially as he grew older, under Mr. Rigby's patronising air and paternal tone. Even in old
       days though attentive, Coningsby had never found him affectionate. Mr. Rigby would tell him
       what to do and see, but never asked him what he wished to do and see. It seemed to Coningsby
       that it was always contrived that he should appear the "protégé" or poor relation, of a
       dependent of his family. These feelings, which the thought of Mr. Rigby had revived, caused
       <pb n="63"/> our young friend, by an inevitable association of ideas, to remember that,
       unknown and unnoticed as he might be, he was the only Coningsby in that proud Castle, except
       the Lord of the castle himself; and he began to be rather ashamed of permitting a sense of
       his inexperience in the mere forms and fashions of society so to oppress him, and deprive him
       as it were of the spirit and carriage which became alike his character and his position.
       Emboldened and greatly restored to himself, Coningsby advanced into the body of the
       saloon.</p>
<p>On his legs, wearing his blue riband and bending his head frequently to a lady who was
       seated on a sofa and continually addressed him, Coningsby recognised his grandfather. Lord
       Monmouth was somewhat balder than four years ago, when he had come down to Montem, and a
       little more portly perhaps; but otherwise unchanged. Lord Monmouth never condescended to the
       artifices of the toilet, and indeed notwithstanding his life of excess had little need of
       them. Nature had done much for him, and the slow progress of decay was carried off by his
       <pb n="64"/> consummate bearing. He looked indeed the chieftain of a house of whom a cadet
       might be proud.</p>
<p>For Coningsby, not only the chief of his house, but his host too. In either capacity he
       ought to address Lord Monmouth. To sit down to dinner without having previously paid his
       respects to his grandfather, to whom he was so much indebted, and whom he had not seen for so
       many years, struck him not only as uncourtly, but as unkind and ungrateful, and indeed in the
       highest degree absurd. But how was he to do it? Lord Monmouth seemed very deeply engaged, and
       apparently with some very great lady. And if Coningsby advanced and bowed, in all probability
       he would only get a bow in return. He remembered the bow of his first interview. It had made
       a lasting impression on his mind. For it was more than likely Lord Monmouth would not
       recognise him. Four years had not very sensibly altered Lord Monmouth, but four years had
       changed Harry Coningsby from a schoolboy into a man. Then how was he to make himself known to
       his
       <pb n="65"/> grandfather? To announce himself as Coningsby, as his Lordship's grandson,
       seemed somewhat ridiculous. To address his grandfather as Lord Monmouth would serve no
       purpose; to style Lord Monmouth "grandfather," would make every one laugh and seemed stiff
       and unnatural. What was he to do? To fall into an attitude, and exclaim, "Behold your
       grandchild!" or "Have you forgot your Harry?"</p>
<p>Even to catch Lord Monmouth's glance was not a very easy affair; he was much engaged on one
       side by the great lady; on the other were several gentlemen who occasionally joined in the
       conversation. But something must be done.</p>
<p>There ran through Coningsby's character, as we have before mentioned, a vein of simplicity
       which was not its least charm. It resulted no doubt in a great degree from the earnestness of
       his nature. There never was a boy so totally devoid of affectation, which was remarkable, for
       he had a brilliant imagination, a quality that from its fantasies and the vague and
       indefinite desires it engenders, generally makes those whose characters are not formed, very
       affected. The
       <pb n="66"/> Duchess who was a fine judge of character, and who greatly regarded Coningsby,
       often mentioned this trait as one which, combined with his great abilities and acquirements
       so unusual at his age, rendered him so very interesting. In the present instance it so
       happened, that while Coningsby was watching his grandfather, he observed a gentleman advance,
       make his bow, say and receive a few words, and retire. This little incident however made a
       momentary diversion in the immediate circle of Lord Monmouth, and before they could all
       resume their former talk and fall into their previous positions, an impulse sent forth
       Coningsby, who walked up to Lord Monmouth, and standing before him, said:</p>
<p>"How do you do, grandpapa?"</p>
<p>Lord Monmouth beheld his grandson. His comprehensive and penetrating glance took in every
       point with a flash. There stood before him one of the handsomest youths he had ever seen,
       with a mien as graceful as his countenance was captivating; and his whole air breathing that
       freshness and ingenuousness which none so much appreciates as the used man of the
       <pb n="67"/> world. And this was his child; the only one of his blood to whom he had been
       kind. It would be exaggeration to say that Lord Monmouth's heart was touched; but his
       good-nature effervesced, and his fine taste was deeply gratified. He perceived in an instant
       such a relation might be a valuable adherent; an irresistible candidate for future elections;
       a brilliant tool to work out the Dukedom. All these impressions and ideas, and many more,
       passed through the quick brain of Lord Monmouth ere the sound of Coningsby's words had seemed
       to cease, and long before the surrounding guests had recovered from the surprise which they
       had occasioned them; and which did not diminish when Lord Monmouth advancing placed his arms
       round Coningsby with a dignity of affection that would have become Louis XIV, and then in the
       high manner of the old Court kissed him on each cheek.</p>
<p>"Welcome to your home," said Lord Monmouth. "You have grown a great deal."</p>
<p>Then Lord Monmouth led the agitated Coningsby to the great Lady who was a Princess
       <pb n="68"/> and an Ambassadress, and then placing his arm gracefully in that of his grandson
       he led him across the room, and presented him in due form to some royal blood that was his
       guest in the shape of a Russian Archduke. His Imperial Highness received our hero as
       graciously as the grandson of Lord Monmouth might expect; but no greeting can be imagined
       warmer than the one he received from the lady with whom the Archduke was conversing. She was
       a dame whose beauty was mature, but still radiant. Her figure was superb; her dark hair
       crowned with a tiara of curious workmanship. Her rounded arm was covered with costly
       bracelets, but not a jewel on her finelyformed bust, and the least possible rouge on her
       still oval cheek. Madame Colonna retained her charms.</p>
<p>The party though so considerable principally consisted of the guests at the Castle. The
       suite of the Archduke included several Counts and Generals; then there was the Russian
       Ambassador and his lady; and a Russian Prince and Princess, their relations. The Prince and
       <pb n="69"/> Princess Colonna and the Princess Lucretia were also paying a visit to the
       Marquess; and the frequency of these visits made some strait-laced magnificoes mysteriously
       declare it was impossible to go to Coningsby; but as they were not asked it did not much
       signify. The Marquess knew a great many very agreeable people of the highest ton, who took a
       more liberal view of human conduct, and always made it a rule to presume the best motives
       instead of imputing the worst. There was Lady St. Julians for example, whose position was of
       the highest; no one more sought; she made it a rule to go everywhere and visit everybody,
       provided they had power, wealth, and fashion. She knew no crime except a woman not living
       with her husband; that was past pardon. As long as his presence sanctioned her conduct,
       however shameless, it did not signify; but if the husband were a brute, neglected his wife
       first, and then deserted her; then, if a breath but sullies her name she must be crushed;
       unless indeed her own family were very powerful, which makes a difference, and
       <pb n="70"/> sometimes softens immorality into indiscretion.</p>
<p>Lord and Lady Gaverstock were also there, who never said an unkind thing of anybody; her
       ladyship was pure as snow; but her mother having been divorced, she ever fancied she was
       paying a kind of homage to her parent by visiting those who might be some day in the same
       predicament. There were other lords and ladies of high degree; and some who, though neither
       lords and ladies, were charming people, which Lord Monmouth chiefly cared about; troops of
       fine gentlemen who came and went; and some who were neither fine, nor gentlemen, but who were
       very amusing or very obliging as circumstances required, and made life easy and pleasant to
       others and themselves.</p>
<p>A new scene this for Coningsby, who watched with interest all that passed before him. The
       dinner was announced as served; an affectionate arm guides him at a moment of some
       perplexity.</p>
<p>"When did you arrive, Harry? We will sit together. How is the Duchess?" inquired Mr.
       <pb n="71"/> Rigby, who spoke as if he had seen Coningsby for the first time; but who indeed
       had, with that eye which nothing could escape, observed his reception by his grandfather,
       marked it well, and inwardly digested it.</p>
