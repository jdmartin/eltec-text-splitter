<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p>Nothing could present a greater contrast than the respective interiors of
       Coningsby and Beaumanoir. That air of habitual habitation, which so pleasingly distinguished
       the Duke's family seat, was entirely wanting at Coningsby. Everything indeed was vast and
       splendid; but it seemed rather a gala-house than a dwelling; as if the grand furniture and
       the grand servants had all come down express from town with the grand company, and were to
       disappear and to be dispersed at the same time. And truly there were very manifold traces of
       hasty and temporary arrangement; new carpets and old hangings; old
       <pb n="101"/> paint, new gilding; battalions of odd French chairs, squadrons of queer English
       tables; and large tasteless lamps and tawdry chandeliers, evidently true cockneys, and only
       taking the air by way of change. There was too throughout the drawing-rooms an absence of all
       those minor articles of ornamental furniture that are the offering of taste to the home we
       love. There were no books neither; no flowers; no pet animals; no portfolios of fine drawings
       by our English artists like the album of the Duchess, full of sketches by Landseer and
       Standfield, and their gifted brethren; not a print even, except portfolios of H. B's
       caricatures. The modes and manners of the house were not rural; there was nothing of the
       sweet order of a country life. Nobody came down to breakfast; the ladies were scarcely seen
       until dinner time; they rolled about in carriages together late in the afternoon as if they
       were in London, or led a sort of factitious boudoir life in their provincial
       dressing-rooms.</p>
<p>The Marquess sent for Coningsby the morning after his arrival and asked him to breakfast
       with him in his private rooms. Nothing
       <pb n="102"/> could be more kind or more agreeable than his grandfather. He appeared to be
       very interested in his grandson's progress, was glad to find Coningsby had distinguished
       himself at Eton, solemnly adjured him not to neglect his French. A classical education, he
       said, was a very admirable thing, and one which all gentlemen should enjoy; but Coningsby
       would find some day that there were two educations, one which his position required, and
       another which was demanded by the world. "French, my dear Harry," he continued, "is the key
       to this second education. In a couple of years or so you will enter the world; it's a
       different thing to what you read about. It's a masquerade; a motley sparkling multitude, in
       which you may mark all forms and colours, and listen to all sentiments and opinions; but
       where all you see and hear has only one object—plunder. When you get into this crowd you will
       find that Greek and Latin are not so much diffused as you imagine. I was glad to hear you
       speaking French yesterday. Study your accent. There are a good many foreigners
       <pb n="103"/> here with whom you may try your wing a little; don't talk to any of them too
       much. Be very careful of intimacies. All the people here are good acquaintance; at least
       pretty well. Now, here," said the Marquess, taking up a letter and then throwing it on the
       table again, "now here is a man whom I should like you to know, Sidonia. He will be here in a
       few days. Lay yourself out for him if you have the opportunity. He is a man of rare capacity,
       and enormously rich. No one knows the world like Sidonia. I never met his equal; and 'tis so
       pleasant to talk with one that can want nothing of you."</p>
<p>Lord Monmouth had invited Coningsby to take a drive with him in the afternoon. The Marquess
       wished to show a part of his domain to the ambassadress. Only Lucretia, he said, would be
       with them, and there was a place for him. This invitation was readily accepted by Coningsby,
       who was not yet sufficiently established in the habits of the house exactly to know how to
       pass his morning. His friend and patron Mr. Rigby was
       <pb n="104"/> entirely taken up with the Archduke, whom he was accompanying all over the
       neighbourhood, in visits to manufactures, many of which Rigby himself saw for the first time,
       but all of which he fluently explained to his Imperial Highness. In return for this, he
       extracted much information from the Archduke on Russian plans and projects, materials for a
       "slashing" article against the Russophobia that he was preparing, and in which he was to
       prove that Muscovite aggression was an English interest, and entirely to be explained by the
       want of sea-coast, which drove the Czar, for the pure purposes of commerce, to the Baltic and
       the Euxine.</p>
<p>When the hour for the drive arrived, Coningsby found Lucretia, a young girl when he had
       first seen her only four years back, and still his junior, in that majestic dame who had
       conceded a superb recognition to him the preceding eve. She really looked older than Madame
       Colonna; who, very beautiful, very young looking, and mistress of the real arts of the
       toilette, those that cannot
       <pb n="105"/> be detected, was not in the least altered since she first so cordially saluted
       Coningsby, as her dear young friend at Monmouth House.</p>
<p>The day was delightful, the park extensive and picturesque, the Ambassadress sparkling with
       anecdote, and occasionally, in a low voice, breathing a diplomatic hint to Lord Monmouth, who
       bowed his graceful consciousness of her distinguished confidence. Coningsby occasionally took
       advantage of one of those moments, when the conversation ceased to be general, to address
       Lucretia, who replied in calm, fine, smiles, and in affable monosyllables. She indeed
       generally succeeded in conveying an impression to those she addressed, that she had never
       seen them before, did not care to see them now, and never wished to see them again. And all
       this too with an air of great courtesy.</p>
<p>They arrived at the brink of a wooded bank; at their feet flowed a very fine river, deep
       and rushing, though not broad; its opposite bank the boundary of a richly timbered park.</p>
<p>"Ah! this is beautiful!" exclaimed the Ambassadress.
       <pb n="106"/> "And is that yours, Lord Monmouth?"</p>
<p>"Not yet," said the Marquess. "That is Hellingsley; it is one of the finest places in the
       county, with a splendid estate; not so considerable as Coningsby, but very great. It belongs
       to an old, a very old man, without a relative in the world. It is known that the estate will
       be sold at his death, which may be almost daily expected. Then it is mine. No one can offer
       for it what I can afford. For it gives me this division of the county, Princess. To possess
       Hellingsley is one of my objects." The Marquess spoke with an animation unusual with him,
       almost with a degree of excitement.</p>
<p>The wind met them as they returned, the breeze blew rather freshly. Lucretia all of a
       sudden seemed touched with unusual emotion. She was alarmed lest Lord Monmouth should catch
       cold; she took a kerchief from her own well-turned throat to tie round his neck. He feebly
       resisted, evidently much pleased.</p>
<p>The Princess Lucretia was highly accomplished. In the evening, having refused several
       <pb n="107"/> distinguished guests, but instantly yielding to the request of Lord Monmouth,
       she sang. It was impossible to conceive a contralto of more thrilling power, or an execution
       more worthy of the voice. Coningsby, who was not experienced in fine singing, listened as if
       to a supernatural lay, but all agreed it was of the highest class of nature and of art; and
       the Archduke was in raptures. Lucretia received even his Highness's compliments with a
       graceful indifference. Indeed to those who watched her demeanour, it might be remarked that
       she seemed to yield to none, although all bowed before her.</p>
<p>Madame Colonna, who was always extremely kind to Coningsby, expressed to him her
       gratification from the party of the morning. It must have been delightful, she assured
       Coningsby, for Lord Monmouth to have had both Lucretia and his grandson with him; and
       Lucretia too, she added, must have been so pleased.</p>
<p>Coningsby could not make out why Madame Colonna was always intimating to him that the
       Princess Lucretia took such great interest in
       <pb n="108"/> his existence, looked forward with such gratification to his society,
       remembered with so much pleasure the past, anticipated so much happiness from the future. It
       appeared to him that he was to Lucretia, if not an object of repugnance, as he sometimes
       fancied, certainly one only of absolute indifference; but he said nothing. He had already
       lived long enough to know that it is unwise to wish every thing explained.</p>
<p>In the meantime, his life was agreeable. Every day he found added to his acquaintance. He
       was never without a companion to ride or to shoot with; and of riding Coningsby was very
       fond. His grandfather too was continually giving him good-natured turns, and making him of
       consequence in the castle; so that all the guests were fully impressed with the importance of
       Lord Monmouth's grandson. Lady St. Julians pronounced him distinguished; the Ambassadress
       thought diplomacy should be his part as he had a fine person and a clear brain; Madame
       Colonna spoke of him always as if she took intense interest in his career, and declared
       <pb n="109"/> that she liked him almost as much as Lucretia did; the Russians persisted in
       always styling him "the young Marquess," notwithstanding the Ambassador's explanations; Mrs.
       Guy Flouncey made a dashing attack on him; but Coningsby remembered a lesson which Lady
       Everingham had graciously bestowed on him. He was not to be caught again easily. Besides Mrs.
       Guy Flouncey laughed a little too much, and talked a little too loud.</p>
<p>As time flew on, there were changes of visitors, chiefly among the single men. At the end
       of the first week after Coningsby's arrival, Lord Eskdale appeared, bringing with him Lucian
       Gay; and soon after followed the Marquess of Beaumanoir, and Mr. Melton. These were all
       heroes who, in their way, interested the ladies, and whose advent was hailed with general
       satisfaction. Even Lucretia would relax a little to Lord Eskdale. He was one of her oldest
       friends, and with a simplicity of manner which amounted almost to plainness, and with rather
       a cynical nonchalance in his carriage towards men, Lord Eskdale was invariably a favourite
       with
       <pb n="110"/> women. To be sure his station was eminent; he was noble, and very rich, and
       very powerful, and these are qualities which tell as much with the softer as the harsher
       sex;—but there are individuals with all these qualities who are nevertheless unpopular with
       women. Lord Eskdals was easy, knew the world thoroughly, had no prejudices, and above all,
       had a reputation for success. A reputation for success has as much influence with women, as a
       reputation for wealth has with men. Both reputations may be, and often are, unjust; but we
       see persons daily make good fortunes by them all the same. Lord Eskdale was not an impostor;
       and though he might not have been so successful a man had he not been Lord Eskdale, still
       thrown over by a revolution, he would have lighted on his legs.</p>
<p>The arrival of this nobleman was the occasion of giving a good turn to poor Flora. He went
       immediately to see his friend Villebecque and his troop. Indeed it was a sort of society
       which pleased Lord Eskdale more than that which is deemed more refined. He was very sorry
       about
       <pb n="111"/> "La Petite;" but thought that everything would come right in the long run; and
       told Villebecque that he was glad to hear him well spoken of here, especially by the
       Marquess, who seemed to take to him. As for Flora, he was entirely against her attempting the
       stage again, at least for the present, but as she was a good musician, and sang a good
       second, he suggested to the Princess Lucretia one night, that the subordinate aid of Flora
       might be of service to her, and permit her to favour her friends with some pieces which
       otherwise she must deny to them. This suggestion was successful; Flora was introduced
       occasionally, soon often, to their parties in the evening, and her performances were in every
       respect satisfactory. There was nothing to excite the jealousy of Lucretia either in her
       style or her person. And yet she sang well enough, and was a quiet, refined, retiring, by no
       means disagreeable person. She was the companion of Lucretia very often in the morning as
       well as in the illumined saloon; for the Princess was very devoted to the art in which she
       excelled. This connection on the whole
       <pb n="112"/> contributed to the happiness of poor Flora. True it was, in the evening she
       often found herself sitting or standing alone and no one noticing her; she had no dazzling
       quality to attract men of fashion, who themselves love to wordship ever the fashionable. Even
       their goddesses must be "à la mode." But Coningsby never omitted an opportunity to show Flora
       some kindness under these circumstances. He always came and talked to her, and praised her
       singing, and would sometimes hand her refreshments and give her his arm if necessary. These
       slight attentions coming from the grandson of Lord Monmouth were for the world redoubled in
       their value; though Flora thought only of their essential kindness; all in character with
       that first visit which dwelt on the poor girl's memory, though it had long ago escaped that
       of her visitor. For in truth Coningsby had no other impulse for his conduct but
       kind-heartedness.</p>
<p>Thus we have attempted to give some faint idea how life glided away at the castle the first
       fortnight that Coningsby passed there. Perhaps we ought not to omit that Mrs. Guy Flouncey,
       to
       <pb n="113"/> the infinite disgust of Lady St. Julians who had a daughter with her,
       successfully entrapped the devoted attentions of the young Marquess of Beaumanoir, who was
       never very backward if a lady would take trouble enough; while his friend Mr. Melton, whose
       barren homage Lady St. Julians wished her daughter ever particularly to shun, employed all
       his gaiety, good humour, frivolity and fashion, in amusing that young lady, and with
       irresistible effect. For the rest, they continued, though they had only partridges to shoot,
       to pass the morning without weariness. The weather was fine; the stud numerous; all might be
       mounted. The Archduke and his suite, guided by Mr. Rigby, had always some objects to visit,
       and railroads returned them just in time for the banquet with an appetite which they had
       earned, and during which Rigby recounted their achievements, and his own opinions.</p>
<p>The dinner was always first rate; the evening never failed; music, dancing and the theatre,
       offered great resources independent of the soulsubduing sentiment harshly called flirtation,
       and
       <pb n="114"/> which is the spell of a country-house. Lord Monmouth was satisfied for he had
       scarcely ever felt wearied. All that he required in life was to be amused; perhaps that was
       not all he required, but it was indispensable. Nor was it wonderful that on the present
       occasion he obtained his purpose, for there were half a hundred of the brightest eyes and
       quickest brains ever on the watch or the whirl, to secure him distraction. The only
       circumstance that annoyed him was the non-arrival of Sidonia. Lord Monmouth could not bear to
       be disappinted. He could not refrain from saying notwithstanding all the resources and all
       the exertions of his guests:</p>
<p>"I cannot understand why Sidonia does not come. I wish Sidonia were here."</p>
<p>"So do I," said Lord Eskdale, "Sidonia is the only man who tells one anything new."</p>
<p>"We saw Sidonia at Lord Studcaster's," said the Marquess of Beaumanoir. "He told Melton he
       was coming here."</p>
<p>"You know he has bought all Studcaster's horses," said Mr. Melton.</p>
<pb n="115"/>
<p>"I wonder he does not buy Studcaster himself," said Lord Monmouth, "I would if I were he;
       Sidonia can buy anything," he turned to Mrs. Guy Flouncey.</p>
<p>"I wonder who Sidonia is," thought Mrs. Guy Flouncey, but she was determined no one should
       suppose she did not know.</p>
<p>At length one day Coningsby met Madame Colonna in the vestibule before dinner.</p>
<p>"Milor is in such good temper, Mr. Coningsby," she said; "Monsieur de Sidonia has
       arrived."</p>
<p>About ten minutes before dinner there was a stir in the chamber. Coningsby looked round. He
       saw the Archduke advancing, and holding out his hand in a manner the most gracious. A
       gentleman, of distiguished air, but with his back turned to Coningsby, was bowing as he
       received his Highness's greeting. There was a general pause in the room. Several came
       forward: even the Marquess seemed a little moved. Coningsby could not resist the impulse of
       curiosity to see this individual of whom he had heard so much. He glided round
       <pb n="116"/> the room, and caught the countenance of his companion in the forest inn; he who
       announced to him, that "the Age of Ruins was past."</p>
<pb n="117"/>
