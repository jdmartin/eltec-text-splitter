<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>The people of Darlford who, as long as the contest for their representation
       remained between Mr. Rigby and the abstraction called Liberal Principles, appeared to be very
       indifferent about the result, the moment they learned that for the phrase had been
       substituted a substance, and that too in the form of a gentleman, who was soon to figure as
       their resident neighbour, became excited, speedily enthusiastic. All the bells of all the
       churches rang when Mr. Millbank commenced his canvass; the Conservatives, on the alert, if
       not alarmed, insisted on their champion also showing himself in all directions; and in the
       course of four-and-twenty hours, such is
       <pb n="255"/> the contagion of popular feeling, the town was divided into two parties, the
       vast majority of which were firmly convinced that the country could only be saved by the
       return of Mr. Rigby, or preserved from inevitable destruction by the election of Mr.
       Millbank.</p>
<p>The results of the two canvasses were such as had been anticipated from the previous
       reports of the respective agents and supporters. In these days the personal canvass of a
       candidate is a mere form. The whole country that is to be invaded has been surveyed and
       mapped out before entry; every position reconnoitered; the chain of communications complete.
       In the present case as is not unusual, both candidates were really supported by numerous and
       reputable adherents; and both had very good grounds for believing that they would be
       ultimately successful. But there was a body of the electors sufficiently numerous to turn the
       election who would not promise their votes: conscientious men who felt the responsibility of
       the duty that the constitution had entrusted to their discharge, and who would not make
       <pb n="256"/> up their minds without duly weighing the respective merits of the two rivals.
       This class of deeply meditative individuals are distinguished not only by their pensive turn
       of mind; but by a charitable vein that seems to pervade their being. Not only will they think
       of your request, but for their parts they wish both sides equally well. Decision indeed, as
       it must dash the hopes of one of their solicitors, seems infinitely painful to them; they
       have always a good reason for postponing it. If you seek their suffrage during the canvass,
       they reply that the writ not having come down, the day of election is not yet fixed. If you
       call again to inform them that the writ has arrived, they rejoin that perhaps after all there
       may not be a contest. If you call a third time half dead with fatigue, to give them friendly
       notice that both you and your rival have pledged yourselves to go to the poll, they twitch
       their trowsers, rub their hands, and with a dull grin observe,</p>
<p>"Well, sir, we shall see."</p>
<p>"Come, Mr. Jobson," says one of the committee
       <pb n="257"/> with an insinuating smile, "give Mr. Millbank one."</p>
<p>"Jobson, I think you and I know each other," says a most influential supporter with a
       knowing nod.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Smith, I should think we did."</p>
<p>"Come, come, give us one."</p>
<p>"Well, I have not made up my mind yet, gentlemen."</p>
<p>"Jobson!" says a solemn voice. "Didn't you tell me the other night you wished well to this
       gentleman?"</p>
<p>"So I do; I wish well to everybody," replies the imperturbable Jobson.</p>
<p>"Well, Jobson," exclaims another member of the committee with a sigh, "who could have
       supposed that you would have been an enemy!"</p>
<p>"I don't wish to be no enemy to no man, Mr. Trip."</p>
<p>"Come, Jobson," says a jolly tanner, "if I wanted to be a Parliament man, I don't think you
       could refuse me one!"</p>
<p>"I don't think I could Mr. Oakfield."</p>
<p>"Well then give it to my friend."</p>
<pb n="258"/>
<p>"Well, sir, I'll think about it."</p>
<p>"Leave him to me," says another member of the committee with a significant look. "I know
       how to get round him. It's all right."</p>
<p>"Yes, leave him to Hayfield, Mr. Millbank, he knows how to manage him."</p>
<p>But all the same, Jobson continues to look as little tractable and lamb-like as can be well
       fancied.</p>
<p>And here in a work, which in an unpretending shape aspires to take neither an uninformed
       nor a partial view of the political history of the ten eventful years of the Reform struggle,
       we should pause for a moment to observe the strangeness, that only five years after the
       reconstruction of the electoral body by the Whig party, in a borough called into political
       existence by their policy, a manufacturing town too, their candidate comprising in his person
       every quality and circumstance which could recommend him to the constituency, and his
       opponent the worst specimen of the Old Generation, a political adventurer, who owed the least
       disreputable part of his notoriety to his opposition
       <pb n="259"/> to the Reform Bill; that in such a borough under such circumstances there
       should be a contest, and that too one of a very doubtful issue.</p>
<p>What was the cause of this? Are we to seek it in the "Re-action" of the Tadpoles and the
       Tapers? That would not be a very satisfactory solution. Re-action to a certain extent is the
       law of human existence. In the particular state of affairs before us; England after the
       Reform Act; it never could be doubtful, that Time would gradually, and in some instances,
       rapidly, counteract the national impulse of 1832. There never could have been a question, for
       example, that the English counties would have reverted to their natural allegiance to their
       proprietors; but the results of the appeals to the third Estate in 1835 and 1837 are not to
       be accounted for by a mere re-adjustment of legitimate influences.</p>
<p>The truth is, that considerable as are the abilities of the Whig leaders; highly
       accomplished as many of them unquestionably must be acknowledged in parliamentary debate;
       experienced
       <pb n="260"/> in council; sedulous in office; eminent as scholars; powerful from their
       position; the absence of individual influence, of the pervading authority of a commanding
       mind, has been the cause of the fall of the Whig party.</p>
<p>Such a supremacy was generally acknowledged in Lord Grey on the accession of this party to
       power; but it was the supremacy of a tradition rather than of a fact. Almost at the outset of
       his authority his successor was indicated. When the crisis arrived, the intended successor
       was not in the Whig ranks. It is in this virtual absence of a real and recognised leader,
       almost from the moment that they passed their great measure, that we must seek a chief cause
       of all that insubordination, all those distempered ambitions, and all those dark intrigues,
       that finally broke up not only the Whig government, but the Whig party; demoralised their
       ranks; and sent them to the country, both in 1835 and 1837 with every illusion, which had
       operated so happily in their favour in 1832, scattered to the winds. In all things
       <pb n="261"/> we trace the irresistible influence of the individual.</p>
<p>And yet the interval that elapsed between 1835 and 1837 proved, that there was all this
       time in the Whig array one entirely competent to the office of leading a great party, though
       his capacity for that fulfilment was too tardily recognised.</p>
<p><hi>Lord John Russell</hi> has that degree of imagination which though evinced rather in
       sentiment than expression, still enables him to generalize from the details of his reading
       and experience; and to take those comprehensive views, which however easily depreciated by
       ordinary men in an age of routine, are indispensable to a statesman in the conjunctures in
       which we live. He understands therefore his position; and he has the moral intrepidity which
       prompts him ever to dare that which his intellect assures him is politic. He is consequently
       at the same time, sagacious and bold, in council. As an administrator, he is prompt and
       indefatigable. He is not a natural orator; and labours under physical deficiencies which even
       a Demosthenic
       <pb n="262"/> impulse could scarcely overcome. But he is experienced in debate; quick in
       reply, fertile in resource; takes large views; and frequently compensates for a dry and
       hesitating manner by the expression of those noble truths, that flash across the fancy, and
       rise spontaneously to the lip, of men of poetic temperament when addressing popular
       assemblies. If we add to this a private life of dignified repute; the accidents of his birth
       and rank, which never can be severed from the man, the scion of a great historic family, and
       born as it were to the hereditary service of the State; it is difficult to ascertain at what
       period, or under what circumstances, the Whig party have ever possessed, or could obtain, a
       more efficient leader.</p>
<p>But we must return to the Darlford election. The class of thoughtful voters was
       sufficiently numerous in that borough to render the result of the contest doubtful to the
       last, and on the eve of the day of nomination both parties were equally sanguine.</p>
<p>Nomination day altogether is a most unsatisfactory affair. There is little to be done, and
       <pb n="263"/> that little mere form. The tedious hours remain; and no one can settle his mind
       to any thing. It is not a holiday, for every one is serious; it is not business, for no one
       can attend to it; it is not a contest, for there is no canvassing; nor an election, for there
       is no poll. It is a day of lounging without an object, and luncheons without an appetite; of
       hopes and fears; confidence and dejection; bravado bets and secret hedging; and about
       midnight, of furious suppers of grilled bones, brandy-and-water, and recklessness.</p>
<p>The president and vice-president of the Conservative Association, the secretary and the
       four solicitors who were agents, had impressed upon Mr. Rigby that it was of the utmost
       importance, and must produce a great moral effect if he obtained the show of hands. With his
       powers of eloquence and their secret organisation they flattered themselves it might be done.
       With this view Rigby inflicted a speech of more than two hours' duration on the electors, who
       bore it very kindly, as the mob likes above all things that the ceremonies of
       <pb n="264"/> nomination day should not be cut short: moreover there is nothing that the mob
       likes so much as a speech. Rigby therefore had on the whole a far from unfavourable audience,
       and he availed himself of their forbearance. He brought in his crack theme the guillotine,
       and dilated so elaborately upon its qualities, that one of the gentlemen below could not
       refrain from exclaiming: "I wish you may get it." This exclamation gave Mr. Rigby what is
       called a great opening, which, like a practised speaker, he immediately seized. He denounced
       the sentiment as "un-English," and got very much cheered. Excited by this success Rigby began
       calling everything else "un-English" with which he did not agree, until menacing murmurs
       began to rise, when he shifted the subject, and rose into a grand peroration, in which he
       assured them that the eyes of the whole empire were on this particular election, (cries of
       "that's true," from all sides) and that England expected every man to do his duty.</p>
<p>"And who do you expect to do yours?"
       <pb n="265"/> inquired a gentleman below, "about that ere pension?"</p>
<p>"Rigby," screeched a hoarse voice, "don't you mind; you guv it them well."</p>
<p>"Rigby, keep up your spirits old chap: we will have you."</p>
<p>"Now," said a stentorian voice, and a man as tall as Saul looked round him. This was the
       engaged leader of the Conservative mob; the eye of every one of his minions was instantly on
       him. "Now! Our young Queen and our old institutions; Rigby for ever!"</p>
<p>This was a signal for the instant appearance of the leader of the Liberal mob. Magog Wrath,
       not so tall as Bully Bluck his rival, had a voice almost as powerful, a back much broader,
       and a countenance far more forbidding. "Now, my boys; the Queen and Millbank for ever."</p>
<p>These rival cries were the signals for a fight between the two bands of gladiators in the
       face of the hustings; the body of the people little interfering. Bully Bluck seized Magog
       Wrath's colours; they wrestled, they seized each other; their supporters were engaged in
       mutual
       <pb n="266"/> contest; it appeared to be a most alarming and perilous fray; several ladies
       from the windows screamed, one fainted; a band of special constables pushed their way through
       the mob; you heard their staves resounding on the skulls of all who opposed them, especially
       the little boys: order was at length restored; and to tell the truth, the only hurts
       inflicted were those which came from the special constables. Bully Bluck and Magog Wrath,
       with all their fierce looks, flaunting colours, loud cheers, and desperate assaults, were
       after all only a couple of Condottieri, who were cautious never to wound each other. They
       were in fact a very peaceful police, who kept the town in awe, and prevented others from
       being mischievous who were more inclined to do harm. Their hired gangs were the safety valves
       for all the scamps of the borough, who receiving a few shillings per head for their nominal
       service, and as much drink as they liked after the contest, were bribed and organised into
       peace and sobriety on the days in which their excesses were most to be apprehended.</p>
<pb n="267"/>
<p>Now Mr. Millbank came forward: he was very brief compared with Mr. Rigby; but clear and
       terse. No one could misunderstand him. He did not favour his hearers with any history, but
       gave them his views about taxes, free trade, placemen and pensioners, whoever and wherever
       they might be.</p>
<p>"Hilloa, Rigby, about that ere pension?"</p>
<p>"Millbank for ever! We will have him."</p>
<p>"Never mind, Rigby, you'll come in next time."</p>
<p>Mr. Millbank was very energetic about resident representatives, but did not understand that
       a resident representative meant the nominee of a great lord, who lived in a great castle,
       (great cheering). There was a Lord once who declared that if he liked, he would return his
       negro valet to Parliament; but Mr. Millbank thought those days were over. It remained for the
       people of Darlford to determine whether he was mistaken.</p>
<p>"Never!" exclaimed the mob. "Millbank for ever! Rigby in the river! No niggers, no
       walets!"</p>
<p>"Three groans for Rigby."</p>
<p>"His language ain't as purty as the Lunnun
       <pb n="268"/> chaps," said a critic below; "but he speaks from his art; and give me the man
       who as got a art."</p>
<p>"That's your time of day, Mr. Robinson."</p>
<p>"Now," said Magog Wrath looking around.</p>
<p>"Now—the Queen and Millbank for ever! Hurrah!"</p>
<p>The show of hands was entirely in favour of Mr. Millbank. Scarcely a hand was held up for
       Mr. Rigby below, except by Bully Bluck and his prætorians. The Chairman and the Deputy
       Chairman of the Conservative Association, the Secretary and the four agents severally and
       respectively went up to Mr. Rigby and congratulated him on the result, as it was a known fact
       "that the show of hands never won."</p>
<p>The eve of polling day was now at hand. This is the most critical period of an election.
       All night parties in disguise were perambulating the different wards, watching each others
       tactics; masks, wigs, false noses, gentles in livery coats, men in female attire—a silent
       carnival of manoeuvre, vigilance, anxiety, and trepidation. The thoughtful voters about this
       time make up their
       <pb n="269"/> minds; the enthusiasts who have told you twenty times a day for the last
       fortnight, that they would get up in the middle of the night to serve you, require the most
       watchful cooping; all the individuals who have assured you that "their word is their bond,"
       change sides.</p>
<p>Two of the Rigbyites met in the marketplace about an hour after midnight.</p>
<p>"Well, how goes it?" said one.</p>
<p>"I have been the rounds. The blunts going like the ward-pump. I saw a man come out of
       Moffatt's house, muffled up with a mask on. I dodged him. It was Biggs."</p>
<p>"You don't mean that, do you? D—e I'll answer for Moffatt."</p>
<p>"I never thought he was a true man."</p>
<p>"Told Robins?"</p>
<p>"I could not see him; but I met young Gunning and told him."</p>
<p>"Young Gunning! That won't do."</p>
<p>"I thought he was as right as the town clock."</p>
<p>"So did I once. Hush! who comes here? The enemy, Franklin and Sampson Potts. Keep
       close."</p>
<pb n="270"/>
<p>"I'll speak to them. Good night, Potts. Up rather late to-night?"</p>
<p>"All fair election time. You ain't snoring are you?"</p>
<p>"Well, I hope the best man will win."</p>
<p>"I am sure he will."</p>
<p>"You must go for Moffatt early, to breakfast at the White Lion; that's your sort. Don't
       leave him, and poll him yourself. I am going off to Solomon Lacey's. He has got four
       Millbankites cooped up very drunk, and I want to get them quietly into the country before
       daybreak."</p>
<p>'Tis polling day! The candidates are roused from their slumbers at an early hour by the
       music of their own bands perambulating the town, and each playing the "conquering hero" to
       sustain the courage of their jaded employers by depriving them of that rest which can alone
       tranquillize the nervous system. There is something in that matin burst of music, followed by
       a shrill cheer from the boys of the borough, the only inhabitants yet up, that is very
       depressing.</p>
<pb n="271"/>
<p>The committee-rooms of each candidate are soon rife with black reports; each side has
       received fearful bulletins of the preceding night campaign; and its consequences as
       exemplified in the morning, unprecedented tergiversations, mysterious absences; men who
       breakfast with one side and vote with the other; men who won't come to breakfast; men who
       won't leave breakfast.</p>
<p>At ten o'clock Mr. Rigby was in a majority of twenty-eight.</p>
<p>The polling was brisk and very equal until the middle of the day, when it became very
       slack. Mr. Rigby kept a majority, but an inconsiderable one. Mr. Millbank's friends were not
       disheartened, as it was known that the leading members of Mr. Rigby's Committee had polled;
       whereas his opponent's were principally reserved. At a quarter past two there was great
       cheering and uproar. The four voters in favour of Millbank whom Solomon Lacey had cooped up,
       made drunk, and carried into the country, had recovered their senses, made their escape, and
       voted as they originally intended.
       <pb n="272"/> Soon after this, Mr. Millbank was declared by his Committee to be in a majority
       of one, but the Committee of Mr. Rigby instantly posted a placard in large letters to
       announce that on the contrary their man was in a majority of nine.</p>
<p>"If we could only have got another registration," whispered the principal agent to Mr.
       Rigby at a quarter past four.</p>
<p>"You think it's all over then?"</p>
<p>"Why I do not see now how we can win. We have polled all our dead men, and Millbank is
       seven a head."</p>
<p>"I have no doubt we shall be able to have a good petition," said the consoling chairman of
       the Conservative Association.</p>
<pb n="273"/>
