<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p>Sidonia lived in the Faubourg St. Germain in a large hotel, that, in old days, had
       belonged to the Crillons; but it had received at his hands such extensive alterations, that
       nothing of the original decoration, and little of its arrangement, remained.</p>
<p>A flight of marble steps, ascending from a vast court, led into a hall of great dimensions,
       which was at the same time an orangery, and a gallery of sculpture. It was illumined by a
       distinct, yet soft and subdued, light, which harmonised with the beautiful repose of the
       surrounding forms, and with the exotic perfume
       <pb n="67"/> that was wafted about. A gallery led from this hall to an inner hall of quite a
       different character; fantastic, glittering, variegated; full of strange shapes and dazzling
       objects.</p>
<p>The roof was carved and gilt in that honeycomb style prevalent in the Saracenic buildings;
       the walls were hung with leather stamped in rich and vivid patterns; the floor was a flood of
       mosaic; about were statues of negroes of human size with faces of wild expression, and
       holding in their outstretched hands silver torches that blazed with an almost painful
       brilliancy.</p>
<p>From this inner hall, a double staircase of white marble, led to the grand suite of
       apartments.</p>
<p>These saloons, lofty, spacious, and numerous, had been decorated principally in encaustic
       by the most celebrated artists of Munich. The three principal rooms were only separated from
       each other by columns, covered with rich hangings, on this night drawn aside. The decoration
       of each chamber was appropriate to its purpose. On the walls of the ball-room, nymphs and
       heroes moved in measure in Sicilian
       <pb n="68"/> landscapes, or on the azure shores of Ægean waters. From the ceiling beautiful
       divinities threw garlands on the guests, who seemed surprised that the roses, unwilling to
       quit Olympus, would not descend on earth. The general effect of this fair chamber was
       heightened too by that regulation of the house which did not permit any benches in the
       ball-room. That dignified assemblage who are always found ranged in precise discipline
       against the wall, did not here mar the flowing grace of the festivity. The chaperons had no
       cause to complain. A large saloon abounded in ottomans and easy chairs at their service,
       where their delicate charges might rest when weary, or find distraction when not engaged.</p>
<p>All the world were at this fête of Sidonia. It exceeded in splendour and luxury every
       entertainment that had yet been given. The highest rank, even Princes of the blood, beauty,
       fashion, fame—all assembled in a magnificent and illuminated palace, resounding with
       exquisite melody.</p>
<pb n="69"/>
<p>Coningsby though somewhat depressed, was not insensible to the magic of the scene. Since
       the passage in the gardens of the Luxembourg —that tone—that glance—he had certainly felt
       much relieved, happier. And yet if all were, with regard to Sidonia, as unfounded as he could
       possibly desire, where was he then? Had he forgotten his grandfather—that fell look, that
       voice of intense detestation? What was Millbank to him? Where, what was the mystery, for of
       some he could not doubt. The Spanish parentage of Edith had only more perplexed Coningsby. It
       offered no solution. There could be no connection between a Catalan family and his mother,
       the daughter of a clergyman in a midland county. That there was any relationship between the
       Millbank family and his mother was contradicted by the conviction in which he had been
       brought up that his mother had no relations; that she returned to England utterly friendless;
       without a relative, a connection, an acquaintance to whom she could appeal. Her complete
       forlornness was
       <pb n="70"/> stamped upon his brain. Tender as were his years, when he was separated from
       her, he could yet recal the very phrases in which she deplored her isolation; and there were
       numerous passages in her letters which alluded to it. Coningsby had taken occasion to sound
       the Wallingers on this subject; but he felt assured from the manner in which his advances
       were met, that they knew nothing of his mother, and attributed the hostility of Mr. Millbank
       to his grandfather solely to political emulation and local rivalries. Still there was the
       portrait and the miniature. That was a fact; a clue which ultimately, he was persuaded, must
       lead to some solution.</p>
<p>Coningsby had met with great social success at Paris. He was at once a favourite. The
       Parisian dames decided in his favour. He was a specimen of the highest style of English
       beauty which is very popular in France. His air was acknowledged as distinguished. The men
       also liked him; he had not quite arrived at that age, when you make enemies. The
       <pb n="71"/> moment therefore that he found himself in the saloons of Sidonia, he was
       accosted by many whose notice was flattering; but his eye wandered, while he tried to be
       courteous and attempted to be sprightly. Where was she? He had nearly reached the ball-room
       when he met her. She was on the arm of Lord Beaumanoir, who had made her acquaintance at
       Rome, and originally claimed it as the member of a family who, as the reader may perhaps not
       forget, had experienced some kindnesses from the Millbanks.</p>
<p>There were mutual and hearty recognitions between the young men; great explanations where
       they had been, what they were doing, where they were going. Lord Beaumanoir told Coningsby he
       had introduced steeple-chaces at Rome, and had parted with Sunbeam to the nephew of a
       Cardinal. Coningsby securing Edith's hand for the next dance, they all moved on together to
       her aunt.</p>
<p>Lady Wallinger was indulging in some Roman reminiscences with the Marquess.</p>
<pb n="72"/>
<p>"And you are not going to Astrachan to-morrow?" said Edith.</p>
<p>"Not to-morrow," said Coningsby.</p>
<p>"You know that you said once that life was too stirring in these days to permit travel to a
       man?"</p>
<p>"I wish nothing was stirring," said Coningsby. "I wish nothing to change. All that I wish
       is, that this fête should never end"</p>
<p>"Is it possible, that you can be capricious! You perplex me very much."</p>
<p>"Am I capricious, because I dislike change?"</p>
<p>"But Astrachan?"</p>
<p>"It was the air of the Luxembourg that reminded me of the desart," said Coningsby.</p>
<p>Soon after this Coningsby led Edith to the dance. It was at a ball that he had first met
       her at Paris, and this led to other reminiscences; all most interesting. Coningsby was
       perfectly happy. All mysteries, all difficulties, were driven from his recollection; he lived
       only in the exciting and enjoyable present. Twenty-one and in love!</p>
<pb n="73"/>
<p>Some time after this, Coningsby who was inevitably separated from Edith, met his host.</p>
<p>"Where have you been, child," said Sidonia, "that I have not seen you for some days? I am
       going to Madrid to-morrow."</p>
<p>"And I must think, I suppose, of Cambridge."</p>
<p>"Well, you have seen something; you will find it more profitable when you have digested it;
       and you will have opportunity. That's the true spring of wisdom: meditate over the past.
       Adventure and Contemplation share our being like day and night."</p>
<p>The resolute departure for England on the morrow, had already changed into a supposed
       necessity of thinking of returning to Cambridge. In fact, Coningsby felt that to quit Paris
       and Edith was an impossibility. He silenced the remonstrance of his conscience by the
       expedient of keeping a half-term; and had no difficulty in persuading himself that a short
       delay in taking his degree could not really be of the slightest consequence.</p>
<p>It was the hour of supper. The guests at a
       <pb n="74"/> French ball are not seen to advantage at this period. The custom of separating
       the sexes for this refreshment, and arranging that the ladies should partake of it by
       themselves, though originally founded in a feeling of consideration and gallantry, and with
       the determination to secure under all circumstances the convenience and comfort of the fair
       sex, is really, in its appearance and its consequences, anything but European, and produces a
       scene which rather reminds one of the harem of a sultaun, than a hall of chivalry. To judge
       from the countenances of the favoured fair, they are not themselves particularly pleased; and
       when their repast is over, they necessarily return to empty halls, and are deprived of the
       dance at the very moment when they may feel most inclined to participate in its graceful
       excitement.</p>
<p>These somewhat ungracious circumstances however were not attendant on the festival of this
       night. There was opened in the Hotel of Sidonia for the first time a banquetting room which
       could contain with convenience all the guests. It was a vast chamber of white marble,
       <pb n="75"/> the golden pannels of the walls containing festive sculptures by Schwanthaler,
       relieved by encaustic tinting. In its centre was a fountain, a group of Bacchantes encircling
       Dionysos; and from this fountain, as from a star, diverged the various tables from which
       sprang orange trees in fruit and flower.</p>
<p>The banquet had but one fault; Coningsby was separated from Edith. The Duchess of Grand
       Cairo, the beautiful wife of the heir of one of the Imperial illustrations, had determined to
       appropriate Coningsby as her cavalier for the moment. Distracted, he made his escape; but his
       wandering eye could not find the object of its search; and he fell prisoner to the charming
       Princess De Petitpoix, a Carlist chieftain, whose witty words avenged the cause of fallen
       dynasties and a cashiered nobility.</p>
<p>Behold a scene brilliant in fancy, magnificent in splendour! All the circumstances of his
       life at this moment were such as acted forcibly on the imagination of Coningsby. Separated
       from Edith, he had still the delight of seeing her, the paragon of that bright company, the
       consummate
       <pb n="76"/> being whom he adored! And who had spoken to him in a voice sweeter than a
       serenade, and had bestowed on him a glance softer than moonlight. The lord of the palace,
       more distinguished even for his capacity than his boundless treasure, was his chosen friend;
       gained under circumstances of romantic interest, when the reciprocal influence of their
       personal qualities was affected by no accessory knowledge of their worldly positions. He
       himself was in the very bloom of youth and health; the child of a noble house, rich for his
       present wants, and with a future of considerable fortunes. Entrancing love and dazzling
       friendship, a high ambition and the pride of knowledge, the consciousness of a great
       prosperity, the vague, daring energies of the high pulse of twenty-one, all combined to
       stimulate his sense of existence, which, as he looked around him at the beautiful objects and
       listened to the delicious sounds, seemed to him a dispensation of almost supernatural
       ecstacy.</p>
<p>About an hour after this, the ball-room still full, but the other saloons gradually
       emptying,
       <pb n="77"/> Coningsby entered a chamber which seemed deserted. Yet he heard sounds as it
       were of earnest conversation. It was a voice that invited his progress; he advanced another
       step, then suddenly stopped. There were two individuals in the room, by whom he was
       unnoticed. They were Sidonia and Miss Millbank. They were sitting on a sofa, Sidonia holding
       her hand and endeavouring, as it seemed, to soothe her. Her tones were tremulous; but the
       expression of her face was fond and confiding. It was all the work of a moment. Coningsby
       instantly withdrew, yet could not escape hearing an earnest request from Edith to her
       companion that he would write to her.</p>
<p>In a few seconds Coningsby had quitted the hotel of Sidonia, and the next day found him on
       his road to England.</p>
