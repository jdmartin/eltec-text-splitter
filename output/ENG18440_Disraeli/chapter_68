<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>Lady Monmouth was reclining on a sofa in that beautiful boudoir which had been
       fitted up under the superintendance of Mr. Rigby, but as he then believed for the Princess
       Colonna. The walls were hung with amber satin, painted by Laroche with such subjects as might
       be expected from his brilliant and picturesque pencil. Fair forms, heroes and heroines in
       dazzling costume, the offspring of chivalry merging into what is commonly styled
       civilisation, moved in graceful or fantastic groups amid palaces and gardens. The ceiling
       carved in the deep honeycomb fashion of the Saracens was richly glit and picked out in
       violet. Upon a violet
       <pb n="230"/> carpet of velvet was represented the marriage of Cupid and Psyche.</p>
<p>It was about two hours after Coningsby had quitted Monmouth House, and Flora came in, sent
       for by Lady Monmouth, as was her custom to read to her as she was employed with some light
       work.</p>
<p>"'Tis a new book of Sue," said Lucretia. "they say it is good."</p>
<p>Flora seated by her side read for about a quarter of an hour. Reading was an accomplishment
       which distinguished Flora; but today her voice faultered, her expression was uncertain; she
       seemed but very imperfectly to comprehend her page. More than once Lady Monmouth looked round
       at her with an inquisitive glance. Suddenly Flora stopped and burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Oh! madam," she at last exclaimed, "if you would but speak to Mr. Coningsby all might be
       right!"</p>
<p>"What is this?" said Lady Monmouth, turning quickly on the sofa, then collecting herself in
       an instant she continued with less abruptness and with more suavity than usual, "tell me,
       Flora, what is it; what is the matter?"</p>
<pb n="231"/>
<p>"My Lord," sobbed Flora, "has quarrelled with Mr. Coningsby."</p>
<p>An expression of eager interest came over the countenance of Lucretia.</p>
<p>"Why have they quarrelled?"</p>
<p>"I do not know they have quarrelled; it is not perhaps a right term; but my Lord is very
       angry with Mr. Coningsby."</p>
<p>"Not very angry I should think, Flora; and about what?"</p>
<p>"Oh! very angry, madam," said Flora, shaking her head mournfully, "my Lord told M.
       Villebecque that perhaps Mr. Coningsby would never enter the house again."</p>
<p>"Was it to-day!" asked Lucretia.</p>
<p>"This morning; Mr. Coningsby has only left this hour or two. He will not do what my Lord
       wishesâ€”about some seat in the Chamber. I do not know exactly what it is; but my Lord is in
       one of his moods of terror; my father is frightened even to go into his room, when he is
       so."</p>
<p>"Has Mr. Rigby been here to-day?" asked Lucretia.</p>
<p>"Mr. Rigby is not in town. My father went
       <pb n="232"/> for Mr. Rigby this morning before Mr. Coningsby came, and he found that Mr.
       Rigby was not in town. That is why I know it."</p>
<p>Lady Monmouth rose from her sofa and walked once or twice up and down the room. Then
       turning to Flora, she said, "Go away now; the book is stupid; it does not amuse me. Stop:
       find out all you can for me about the quarrel, before I speak to Mr. Coningsby."</p>
<p>Flora quitted the room. Lucretia remained for some time in meditation: then she wrote a few
       lines which she despatched at once to Mr. Rigby.</p>
