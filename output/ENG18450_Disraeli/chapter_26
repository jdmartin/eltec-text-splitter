<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p> Wodgate, or Wogate, as it was called on the map, was a district that in old days had been
       consecrated to Woden, and which appeared destined through successive ages to retain its
       heathen character. At the beginning of the revolutionary war, Wodgate was a sort of squatting
       district of the great mining region to which it was contiguous, a place where adventurers in
       the industry which was rapidly developing, settled themselves; for though the great veins of
       coal and ironstone cropped up, as they phrase it, before they reached this bare and barren
       land, and it was thus deficient in those mineral and metallic treasures which had <pb n="53"/>enriched its neighbourhood, Wodgate had advantages of its own, and of a kind which touch
       the fancy of the lawless. It was land without an owner; no one claimed any manorial right
       over it; they could build cottages without paying rent. It was a district recognized by no
       parish; so there were no tithes, and no meddlesome supervision. It abounded in fuel which
       cost nothing, for though the veins were not worth working as a source of mining profit, the
       soil of Wodgate was similar in its superficial character to that of the country around. So a
       population gathered, and rapidly increased, in the ugliest spot in England, to which neither
       Nature nor art had contributed a single charm; where a tree could not be seen, a flower was
       unknown, where there was neither belfry nor steeple, nor a single sight or sound that could
       soften the heart or humanise the mind.</p>
<p> Whatever may have been the cause, whether, as not unlikely, the original squatters brought
       with them some traditionary skill, or whether their isolated and unchequered existence
       concentrated their energies on their craft, the fact <pb n="54"/>is certain, that the
       inhabitants of Wodgate early acquired a celebrity as skilful workmen. This reputation so much
       increased, and in time spread so far, that for more than a quarter of a century, both in
       their skill and the economy of their labour, they have been unmatched throughout the country.
       As manufacturers of ironmongery, they carry the palm from the whole district; as founders of
       brass and workers of steel, they fear none; while as nailers and locksmiths, their fame has
       spread even to the European markets, whither their most skilful workmen have frequently been
       invited.</p>
<p> Invited in vain! No wages can tempt the Wodgate man from his native home, that squatters’
       seat which soon assumed the form of a large village, and then in turn soon expanded into a
       town, and at the present moment numbers its population by swarming thousands, lodged in the
       most miserable tenements in the most hideous burgh in the ugliest country in the world.</p>
<p> But it has its enduring spell. Notwithstanding <pb n="55"/>the spread of its civic
       prosperity, it has lost none of the characteristics of its original society; on the contrary
       it has zealously preserved them. There are no landlords, head-lessees, main-masters, or
       butties in Wodgate. No church there has yet raised its spire; and as if the jealous spirit of
       Woden still haunted his ancient temple, even the conventicle scarcely dares show its humble
       front in some obscure corner. There is no municipality, no magistrate, no local acts, no
       vestries, no schools of any kind. The streets are never cleaned; every man lights his own
       house; nor does any one know anything except his business.</p>
<p> More than this, at Wodgate a factory or large establishment of any kind is unknown. Here
       Labour reigns supreme. Its division indeed is favoured by their manners, but the interference
       or influence of mere capital is instantly resisted. The business of Wodgate is carried on by
       master workmen in their own houses, each of whom possesses an unlimited number of what they
       call apprentices, by whom their affairs are principally conducted, and <pb n="56"/>whom they
       treat as the Mamlouks treated the Egyptians.</p>
<p> These master workmen indeed form a powerful aristocracy, nor is it possible to conceive
       one apparently more oppressive. They are ruthless tyrants; they habitually inflict upon their
       subjects punishments more grievous than the slave population of our colonies were ever
       visited with; not content with beating them with sticks or flogging them with knotted ropes,
       they are in the habit of felling them with hammers, or cutting their heads open with a file
       or lock. The most usual punishment however, or rather stimulus to increase exertion, is to
       pull an apprentice’s ears till they run with blood. These youths too are worked for sixteen
       and even twenty hours a day; they are often sold by one master to another; they are fed on
       carrion, and they sleep in lofts or cellars: yet whether it be that they are hardened by
       brutality, and really unconscious of their degradation and unusual sufferings, or whether
       they are supported by the belief that their day to be masters and oppressors will surely
       arrive, the <pb n="57"/>aristocracy of Wodgate is by no means so unpopular as the aristocracy
       of most other places.</p>
<p> In the first place it is a real aristocracy; it is privileged, but it does something for
       its privileges. It is distinguished from the main body not merely by name. It is the most
       knowing class at Wodgate; it possesses indeed in its way complete knowledge; and it imparts
       in its manner a certain quantity of it to those whom it guides. Thus it is an aristocracy
       that leads, and therefore a fact. Moreover the social system of Wodgate is not an unvarying
       course of infinite toil. Their plan is to work hard, but not always. They seldom exceed four
       days of labour in the week. On Sunday the masters begin to drink; for the apprentices there
       is dog-fighting without any stint. On Monday and Tuesday the whole population of Wodgate is
       drunk; of all stations, ages, and sexes; even babes, who should be at the breast; for they
       are drammed with Godfrey’s cordial. Here is relaxation, excitement; if less vice otherwise
       than might be at first anticipated, we must remember that excesses are checked by poverty of
       blood and constant exhaustion. <pb n="58"/>Scanty food and hard labour are in their way, if
       not exactly moralists, a tolerably good police.</p>
<p> There are no others at Wodgate to preach or to control. It is not that the people are
       immoral, for immorality implies some forethought; or ignorant, for ignorance is relative; but
       they are animals; unconscious; their minds a blank; and their worst actions only the impulse
       of a gross or savage instinct. There are many in this town who are ignorant of their very
       names; very few who can spell them. It is rare that you meet with a young person who knows
       his own age; rarer to find the boy who has seen a book, or the girl who has seen a flower.
       Ask them the name of their sovereign, and they will give you an unmeaning stare; ask them the
       name of their religion, and they will laugh: who rules them on earth, or who can save them in
       heaven, are alike mysteries to them.</p>
<p> Such was the population with whom Morley was about to mingle. Wodgate had the appearance
       of a vast squalid suburb. As you advanced, leaving behind you long lines of little <pb n="59"/>dingy tenements, with infants lying about the road, you expected every moment to emerge
       into some streets and encounter buildings bearing some correspondence in their size and
       comfort to the considerable population swarming and busied around you. Nothing of the kind.
       There were no public buildings of any sort; no churches, chapels, town-hall, institute,
       theatre; and the principal streets in the heart of the town in which were situate the coarse
       and grimy shops, though formed by houses of a greater elevation than the preceding, were
       equally narrow and if possible more dirty. At every fourth or fifth house, alleys seldom
       above a yard wide and streaming with filth, opened out of the street. These were crowded with
       dwellings of various size, while from the principal court often branched out a number of
       smaller alleys or rather narrow passages, than which nothing can be conceived more close and
       squalid and obscure. Here during the days of business, the sound of the hammer and the file
       never ceased, amid gutters of abomination and piles of foulness and stagnant pools of filth;
        <pb n="60"/>reservoirs of leprosy and plague, whose exhalations were sufficient to taint the
       atmosphere of the whole kingdom and fill the country with fever and pestilence.</p>
<p> A lank and haggard youth, ricketty and smoke-dried, and black with his craft, was sitting
       on the threshold of a miserable hovel and working at the file. Behind him stood a stunted and
       meagre girl, with a back like a grasshopper; a deformity occasioned by the displacement of
       the bladebone, and prevalent among the girls of Wodgate from the cramping posture of their
       usual toil. Her long melancholy visage and vacant stare at Morley as he passed, attracted his
       notice, and it occurring to him that the opportunity was convenient to enquire something of
       the individual of whom he was in search, he stopped and addressed the workman:</p>
<p> “Do you happen to know friend a person here or hereabouts by name Hatton?”</p>
<p> “Hatton!” said the youth looking up with a grin, yet still continuing his labour, “I
       should think I did!”</p>
<p> “Well, that’s fortunate; you can tell me something about him?”</p>
<p> “Do you see this here?” said the youth still grinning, and letting the file drop from his
       distorted and knotty hand, he pointed to a deep scar that crossed his forehead, “he did
       that.”</p>
<p> “An accident?”</p>
<p> “Very like. An accident that often happened. I should like to have a crown for every time
       he has cut my head open. He cut it open once with a key and twice with a lock; he knocked the
       corner of a lock into my head twice, once with a bolt and once with a shut; you know what
       that is; the thing what runs into the staple. He hit me on the head with a hammer once. That
       was a blow! I fell away that time. When I came to, master had stopped the blood with some fur
       off his hat. I had to go on with my work immediately; master said I should do my stint if I
       worked till twelve o’clock at night. Many’s the ash stick he has broken on my body; sometimes
       the weals remained on me for a-week; he cut my eyelid open once with a nutstick; cut a
       regular hole in it, and it bled all over the files I was working at. He has pulled my ears
       sometimes that I thought they must come off in his hand. But all this was a mere nothin to
       this here cut; that was serous; and if I hadn’t got thro’ that they do say there must have
       been a crowner’s quest; though I think that gammon, tor old Tugsford did for one of his
       prentices, and the body was never found. And now you ask me if I know Hatton? I should think
       I did!” And the lank, haggard youth laughed merrily, as if he had been recounting a series of
       the happiest adventures.</p>
<p> “But is there no redress for such iniquitous oppression,” said Morley, who had listened
       with astonishment to this complacent statement. “Is there no magistrate to apply to?”</p>
<p> “No no,” said the filer with an air of obvious pride, “we don’t have no magistrates at
       Wodgate. We’ve got a constable, and there was a prentice who coz his master laid it on, only
       with a seat rod, went over to Ramborough and got a warrant. He fetched the summons himself
       and giv it to the constable, but he never served it. That’s why they has a constable
       here.”</p>
<p> “I am sorry,” said Morley, “that I have affairs with such a wretch as this Hatton.”</p>
<p> “You’ll find him a wery hearty sort of man,” said the filer, “if he don’t hap to be in
       drink. He’s a little robustious then, but take him all in all for a master, you may go
       further and fare worse.</p>
<p> “What! this monster!”</p>
<p> “Lord bless you, it’s his way, that’s all, we be a queer set here; but he has his pints.
       Give him a lock to make, and you won’t have your box picked; he’s wery lib’ral too in the
       wittals. Never had horse-flesh the whole time I was with him; they has nothin’ else at
       Tugsford’s; never had no sick cow except when meat was very dear. He always put his face agin
       still-born calves; he used to say he liked his boys to have meat what was born alive and
       killed alive. By which token there never was any sheep what had bust in the head sold in our
       court. And then sometimes he would give us a treat of fish, when it had been four or five <pb n="64"/>days in town and not sold. No, give the devil his due, say I. There never was no
       want for anything at meals with the Bishop, except time to eat them in.”</p>
<p> “And why do you call him the Bishop?”</p>
<p> “That’s his name and authority; for he’s the governor here over all of us. And it has
       always been so that Wodgate has been governed by a bishop; because as we have no church, we
       will have as good. And by this token that this day sen’night, the day my time was up, he
       married me to this here young lady. She is of the Baptist school religion, and wanted us to
       be tied by her clergyman, but all the lads that served their time with me were married by the
       Bishop, and many a more, and I saw no call to do no otherwise. So he sprinkled some salt over
       a gridiron, read ‘Our Father’ backwards, and wrote our name in a book: and we were spliced;
       but I didn’t do it rashly, did I, Suky, by the token that we had kept company for two years,
       and there isn’t a gal in all Wodgate what handles a file, like Sue.”</p>
<p> “And what is your name, my good fellow?”</p>
<p> “They call me Tummas, but I ayn’t got no second name; but now I am married I mean to take
       my wife’s, for she has been baptised, and so has got two.”</p>
<p> “Yes sir,” said the girl with the vacant face and the back like a grasshopper; “I be a
       reg’lar born Christian and my mother afore me, and that’s what few gals in the Yard can say.
       Thomas will take to it himself when work is slack; and he believes now in our Lord and
       Saviour Pontius Pilate who was crucified to save our sins; and in Moses, Goliath, and the
       rest of the Apostles.”</p>
<p> “Ah! me,” thought Morley, “and could not they spare one Missionary from Tahiti for their
       fellow countrymen at Wodgate!”</p>
