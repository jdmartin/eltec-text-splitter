<head>CHAPTER I. THE OLD HOUSE IN SMITHFIELD.</head>
<p>OUR narrative opens at the commencement of July, 1831.</p>
<p>The night was dark and stormy. The sun had set behind huge piles of dingy purple clouds,
      which, after losing the golden hue with which
      <pb n="003"/> they were for awhile tinged, became sombre and menacing. The blue portions of
      the sky that here and there had appeared before the sunset, were now rapidly covered over with
      those murky clouds which are the hiding-places of the storm, and which seemed to roll
      themselves together in dense and compact masses, ere they commenced the elemental war.</p>
<p>In the same manner do the earthly squadrons of cavalry and mighty columns of infantry form
      themselves into one collected armament, that the power of their onslaught may be the more
      terrific and irresistible.</p>
<p>That canopy of dark and threatening clouds was formed over London; and a stifling heat,
      which there was not a breath of wind to allay or mitigate, pervaded the streets of the great
      metropolis.</p>
<p>Everything portended an awful storm.</p>
<p>In the palace of the peer and the hovel of the artisan the windows were thrown up; and at
      many, both men and women stood to contemplate the scene—timid children crowding behind
      them.</p>
<p>The heat became more and more oppressive.</p>
<p>At length large drops of rain fell, at intervals of two or three inches apart, upon the
      pavement.</p>
<p>And then a flash of lightning, like the forked tongue of one of those fiery serpents of
      which we read in oriental tales of magic and enchantment, darted forth from the black clouds
      overhead.</p>
<p>At an interval of a few seconds the roar of the thunder, reverberating through the arches of
      heaven—now sinking, now exalting its fearful tone, like the iron wheels of a chariot rolled
      over a road with patches of uneven pavement here and there—stunned every ear, and struck
      terror into many a heart—the innocent as well as the guilty.</p>
<p>It died away, like the chariot, in the distance; and then all was solemnly still.</p>
<p>The interval of silence which succeeds the protracted thunder-clap is appalling in the
      extreme.</p>
<p>A little while—and again the lightning illuminated the entire vault above: and again the
      thunder, in unequal tones,—amongst which was one resembling the rattling of many vast iron
      bars together,—awoke every echo of the metropolis from north to south, and from east to
      west.</p>
<p>This time the dread interval of silence was suddenly interrupted by the torrents of rain
      that now deluged the streets.</p>
<p>There was not a breath of air; and the rain fell as perpendicularly straight as a line. But
      with it came a sense of freshness and of a pure atmosphere, which formed an agreeable and
      cheering contrast to the previously suffocating heat. It was like the spring of the oasis to
      the wanderer in the burning desert.</p>
<p>But still the lightning played, and the thunder rolled, above.</p>
<p>At the first explosion of the storm, amidst the thousands of men and women and children, who
      were seen hastening hither and thither, in all directions, as if they were flying from the
      plague, was one person on whose exterior none could gaze without being inspired with a mingled
      sentiment of admiration and interest.</p>
<p>He was a youth, apparently not more than sixteen years of age, although taller than boys
      usually are at that period of life. But the tenderness of his years was divined by the extreme
      effeminacy and juvenile loveliness of his countenance, which was as fair and delicate as that
      of a young girl. His long luxuriant hair, of a beautiful light chestnut colour, and here and
      there borrowing dark shades from the frequent undulations in which it rolled, flowed not only
      over the collar of his closely-buttoned blue frock coat, but also upon his shoulders. Its
      extreme profusion, and the singular manner in which he wore it, were, however, partially
      concealed by the breadth of the brim of his hat, that was placed as it were entirely upon the
      back of his head, and, being thus thrown off his countenance, revealed the high, intelligent,
      and polished forehead above which that rich hair was carefully parted.</p>
<p>His frock coat, which was single-breasted, and buttoned up to the throat, set off his
      symmetrical and elegant figure to the greatest advantage. His shoulders were broad, but were
      characterised by that fine fall or slope which is so much admired in the opposite sex. He wore
      spurs upon the heels of his diminutive polished boots; and in his hand he carried a light
      riding-whip. But he was upon foot and alone; and, when the first flash of lightning dazzled
      his expressive hazel eyes, he was hastily traversing the foul and filthy arena of
      Smithfield-market.</p>
<p>An imagination poetically inspired would suppose a similitude of a beautiful flower upon a
      fetid manure heap.</p>
<p>He cast a glance, which may almost be termed one of affright, around; and his cheek became
      flushed. He had evidently lost his way, and was uncertain where to obtain an asylum against
      the coming storm.</p>
<p>The thunder burst above his head; and a momentary shudder passed over his frame. He accosted
      a man to inquire his way; but the answer he received was rude, and associated with a ribald
      joke.</p>
<p>He had not courage to demand a second time the information he sought; but, with a species of
      haughty disdain at the threatening storm, and a proud reliance upon himself, proceeded onwards
      at random.</p>
<p>He even slackened his pace: a contemptuous smile curled his lips, and the glittering white
      teeth appeared as it were between two rose-leaves.</p>
<p>His chest, which was very prominent, rose up and down almost convulsively; for it was
      evident that he endeavoured to master conflicting feelings of vexation, alarm, and disgust—all
      produced by the position in which he found himself.</p>
<p>To one so young, so delicate, and so frank in appearance, the mere fact of losing his way by
      night in a disgusting neighbourhood, during an impending storm, and insulted by a low-life
      ruffian, was not the mere trifle which it would have been considered by the hardy and
      experienced man of the world.</p>
<p>Not a public conveyance was to be seen; and the doors of all the houses around appeared
      inhospitably closed: and every moment it seemed to grow darker.</p>
<p>Accident conducted the interesting young stranger into that labyrinth of narrow and dirty
      streets which lies in the immediate vicinity of the north-western angle of
      Smithfield-market.</p>
<p>It was in this horrible neighbourhood that the youth was now wandering. He was evidently
      shocked at the idea that human beings could dwell in such fetid and unwholesome dens; for he
      gazed with wonder, disgust, and alarm upon the houses on either side. It seemed as if he
      <pb n="004"/> had never beheld till now a labyrinth of dwellings whose very aspect appeared to
      speak of hideous poverty and fearful crime.</p>
<p>Meantime the lightning flashed, and the thunder rolled; and at length the rain poured down
      in torrents. Obeying a mechanical impulse, the youth rushed up the steps of a house at the end
      of one of those dark, narrow, and dirty streets the ominous appearance of which was every now
      and then revealed to him by a light streaming from a narrow window, or the glare of the
      lightning. The framework of the door projected somewhat, and appeared to offer a partial
      protection from the rain. The youth drew as closely up to it as possible; but to his surprise
      it yielded behind him, and burst open. With difficulty he saved himself from falling backwards
      into the passage with which the door communicated.</p>
<p>Having recovered from the sudden alarm with which this incident had inspired him, his next
      sentiment was one of pleasure to think that he had thus found a more secure asylum against the
      tempest. He, however, felt wearied—desperately wearied; and his was not a frame calculated to
      bear up against the oppressive and crushing feeling of fatigue. He determined to penetrate,
      amidst the profound darkness by which he was surrounded, into the dwelling; thinking that if
      there were any inmates they would not refuse him the accommodation of a chair; and if there
      were none, he might find a seat upon the staircase.</p>
<p>He advanced along the passage, and groped about. His hand encountered the lock of a door: he
      opened it, and entered a room. All was dark as pitch. At that moment a flash of lightning,
      more than usually vivid and prolonged, illuminated the entire scene. The glance which he cast
      around was as rapid as the glare which made objects visible to him for a few moments. He was
      in a room entirely empty; but in the middle of the floor—only three feet from the spot where
      he stood—there was a large square of jet blackness.</p>
<p>The lightning passed away: utter darkness again surrounded him; and he was unable to
      ascertain what that black square, so well defined and apparent upon the dirty floor, could
      be.</p>
<p>An indescribable sensation of fear crept over him; and the perspiration broke out upon his
      forehead in large drops. His knees bent beneath him; and, retreating a few steps, he leaned
      against the door-posts for support.</p>
<p>He was alone—in an uninhabited house, in the midst of a horrible neighbourhood; and all the
      fearful tales of midnight murders which he had ever heard or read, rushed to his memory: then,
      by a strange but natural freak of the fancy, those appalling deeds of blood and crime were
      suddenly associated with that incomprehensible but ominous black square upon the floor.</p>
<p>He was in the midst of this terrible waking dream—this more than ideal nightmare—when hasty
      steps approached the front door from the street; and, without stopping, entered the passage.
      The youth crept silently towards the farther end, the perspiration oozing from every pore. He
      felt the staircase with his hands; the footsteps advanced; and, light as the fawn, he hurried
      up the stairs. So noiseless were his motions, that his presence was not noticed by the
      new-comers, who in their turns also ascended the staircase.</p>
<p>The youth reached a landing, and hastily felt for the doors of the rooms with which it
      communicated. In another moment he was in a chamber, at the back part of the house. He closed
      the door, and placed himself against it with all his strength—forgetful, poor youth! that his
      fragile form was unavailing, with all its power, against even the single arm of a man of only
      ordinary strength.</p>
<p>Meantime the new-comers ascended the stairs.</p>
