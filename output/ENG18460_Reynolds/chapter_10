<head>CHAPTER X. THE FRAIL ONE'S NARRATIVE.</head>
<p>WE must now return to Richard Markham.</p>
<p>Sir Rupert Harborough and the Honourable Arthur Chichester apparently took a very great
      fancy to him, for they were constantly making appointments to meet him in town, and hastening
      to his own house to ferret him out when he did not appear at their usual places of rendezvous.
      He dined at least three times a week at Mrs. Arlington's, and, to confess the truth, his
      morning calls were repeated at intervals which gradually grew shorter and shorter.</p>
<p>Richard thus frequently passed hours together alone with Diana. In spite of himself he now
      and then suffered his eyes to rest tenderly upon her countenance; and by degrees her glances
      encountered his and were not immediately withdrawn. Those glances were so languishing, and
      withal so melancholy, that they inspired Richard with a passion amounting almost to a
      delirium; and he felt at times as if he could have caught that beauteous creature in his arms
      and clasped her rapturously to his bosom.</p>
<p>One morning, as he took leave of her, he fancied that her hand gently pressed his own. The
      idea filled him with a joy till then unknown, and which he could not describe even to
      himself.</p>
<p>On the following morning he called a little earlier than usual. Diana was in a delicious
       <hi>déshabillé</hi>, which set off her voluptuous person
      <pb n="025"/> to its very greatest advantage. Richard was more tender than usual—the
      Enchantress more enchanting.</p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>They were seated upon the sofa together; and a pause in their conversation ensued. Richard
      heaved a deep sigh, and suddenly exclaimed, "I am always thinking of the period when I must
      bid adieu to your charming society."</p>
<p>"Bid adieu!" cried Diana; "and wherefore?"</p>
<p>"It must happen, sooner or later, that our ways in the world will be different."</p>
<p>"Then you are not your own master?" said Diana, enquiringly.</p>
<p>"Certainly I am. But all friends must part some time or another."</p>
<p>"True," said Diana; then, in a subdued tone, she added, "There are certain persons who are
      attracted towards each other by kindred feelings and emotions, and it is painful—very painful,
      for them to part!"</p>
<p>"Heavens, Diana!" ejaculated Richard; "you feel as I do!"</p>
<p>She turned her face towards him; her cheeks were suffused in blushes, and her eyes were
      filled with tears. But through those tears she cast upon him a glance which ravished his
      inmost soul. It seemed fraught with love and tenderness, and inspired him with emotions which
      he had never known before. The words "You feel as I do," contained the ingenuous and
      unsophisticated avowal of a new passion on the part of a mind that was as yet as unskilled in
      the ways of this world as the unfledged bird in the nest of its mother is ignorant of the
      green woods. But those tears which stood in the lady's eyes, and the blushes which dyed her
      checks, and the glance which, like a sunbeam in the midst of an April shower, she darted upon
      the youth at her side, inspired him with courage, awakened undefined hopes, and filled him
      with an ecstacy of joy.</p>
<p>"Why do you weep, Diana? why do you weep?"</p>
<p>"You love me, Richard," she replied, turning her melting blue eyes fully upon him, and
      retaining them for some moments fixed upon his countenance: "you love me; and I feel—I know
      that I am not worthy of your affection!"</p>
<p>Richard started as if he were suddenly aroused
      <pb n="026"/> from a dream—as if he had abruptly awoke to a stern truth from a pleasing
      vision. He suffered her hand, which he had taken in his, to fall from his grasp; and for some
      moments he remained buried in a profound reverie.</p>
<p>"Ah! I knew that I should remind you of your duty towards yourself," said Diana, bitterly.
      "No—I am not worthy of you. But that you may hereafter give me credit for frankness and
      candour,—that you may be actually warned by myself <hi>against</hi> myself,—that you may learn
      to esteem me as a friend, if you will, I shall in a few words relate to you the incidents that
      made me what I am!"</p>
<p>"Proceed," said Richard, "proceed! Believe me I shall listen with attention,—with the
      greatest attention!"</p>
<p>"My father was a retired tradesman," began Mrs. Arlington; "and as I was his only child and
      he enjoyed a competency, he gave me the best education that money could procure. Probably the
      good old man made up his mind that I should one day espouse a nobleman; and, as my mother had
      died when I was very young, there was no one near me to correct the vanity with which my
      father's adulation and ambitious pretensions inspired me. About three years ago I met at the
      theatre—whither I went with some friends—a young gentleman—tall, handsome, and fascinating
      like yourself. He contrived to obtain a formal introduction to my father, and was invited to
      our house, at which he speedily became a constant visitor. He had a happy tact in suiting his
      humours or tastes to those with whom he came in contact; and he quite won my father's heart by
      playing chess with him, telling him the news of the City, and reading the evening paper to
      him. George Montague soon became an established favourite; and my father could do nothing
      without him. At length Montague proposed to him certain speculations in the funds: my father
      was allured by the prospect of quadrupling his capital, and consented. I must confess that the
      young man's handsome person had produced a certain effect upon me—a giddy young girl as I was
      at that time; and I rather encouraged my father in these schemes than otherwise. At first the
      speculations were eminently successful; but in a short time they took a turn. Day after day
      did Montague come to the house to announce fresh losses and the necessity of farther advances.
      He declared that he should now speculate for a grand stake, which could not fail shortly to
      turn to his advantage. A species of infatuation seized upon my father; and I was not aware of
      the ruinous course he was pursuing until it was too late. At length my father was totally
      ruined; and George come to announce to us the failure of our last chance. My father now
      repented when it was too late. Eight short months had sufficed to dissipate his whole fortune;
      he had not even enough left to pay the few debts which he had contracted, and which he had
      neglected to liquidate, trusting each day to the arrival of the lucky moment when he should
      find himself the master of millions!"</p>
<p>"Oh! the absurd hope!" exclaimed Richard, deeply interested in this narrative.</p>
<p>"Alas! this event was a fatal blow to my father's health, at the same time that it wrecked
      his happiness," continued Diana. "He implored Montague not to desert 'his darling child'—for
      so he called me—in case anything should happen to himself; and that same day—the day on which
      he saw all his prospects and hopes in this life blasted—he put a period to his existence by
      means of poison!"</p>
<p>"This was horrible!" cried Markham. "Oh! that villain Montague!"</p>
<p>"My father's creditors came to seize the few effects which remained," said Diana, after a
      pause; "and I was about to be turned houseless and unprotected into the streets, when Montague
      arrived. He took gold from his pocket, and satisfied the demands of the creditors. He moreover
      supplied me with money for my immediate wants. I was totally dependent upon him;—I had no
      relations—no friends to whom I could apply for succour or comfort. He seemed to commiserate my
      position——"</p>
<p>"Perhaps," observed Richard, "he was not so very guilty, after all, relative to the loss of
      your father's property?"</p>
<p>"Judge by the sequel," answered Diana bitterly. "He was as base as he was in reality
      unfeeling. The transition from that state of dependence upon a young man to a more degraded
      one still, was to be expected. He no longer talked to me of marriage, as he once had done; but
      he took advantage of my forlorn situation. I became his mistress."</p>
<p>"Ah! it was base—it was ungenerous—it was unmanly!" ejaculated Richard.</p>
<p>"He seemed to be possessed of ample resources; but he accounted for this circumstance by
      assuring me that he had found another friend who was backing him in the same speculations in
      which my poor father had failed. We lived together for four months; and he then coolly
      informed me that we must part. I found that I had never really entertained any very sincere
      affection for him; and the little love which I experienced at first, had been quenched in my
      bosom by his cold cruelty. He seemed unfeeling to a degree. Observations, calculated to wound
      most acutely, fell from his lips upon all occasions——"</p>
<p>"The dastard!" exclaimed Richard, profoundly touched by this recital.</p>
<p>"If I wept at this cruelty, he treated me with increased brutality. You may, therefore,
      suppose that I was not deeply distressed to part with him. He gave me twenty guineas, and bade
      me a chilling farewell. From that moment I have neither seen nor heard of him. A few weeks
      after our separation my money was exhausted. I resolved to lead a virtuous and honourable
      life, and atone for my first fault. O God! I did not then know that society will not receive
      the penitent frail one;—that society excludes poor deceived woman from all hopes of
      reparation, all chances of repentance! I endeavoured to obtain a situation as a governess;—I
      might as well have attempted to make myself queen of England. Character—references! I had
      neither. Vainly did I implore one lady to whom I applied to give me a month's trial. She
      insulted me grossly. To another I candidly confessed my entire history: she patiently heard me
      to the end, and then ordered her lacquey to turn me out of the house. Oh! society does more
      than punish: it pursues the unfortunate female who has made one false step, with the most
      avenging and malignant cruelty;—it hunts her to suicide or to new ways of crime. These are the
      dread alternatives. At that moment, had some friendly hand been stretched out to aid me,—had I
      met with one kind heart that would have believed in the possibility of repentance,—had I only
      been blest with the chance of entering upon a career of virtue, I should have been saved!
      Yes—I should have redeemed my first fault, as far as redemption was possible;—and to
      accomplish that aim, I would have worked my nails down to the very quick,—I would have
      accepted
      <pb n="027"/> any position, however menial,—I would have made any sacrifice, enjoyed any lot,
      so long as I was assured of earning my bread in a manner which need not make me blush. But
      society treated me with contempt. Why, in this Christian country, do they preach the Christian
      maxim, that '<hi>there is more joy over one sinner who repenteth, than over ninety-and-nine
       just persons who need no repentance</hi>?' Why is this maxim preached, when the entire
      conduct of society expresses in terms which cannot be misunderstood, a bold denial of its
      truth?"</p>
<p>"Merciful heavens," ejaculated Richard, "can this be true? are you drawing a correct
      picture, Diana, or inventing a hideous fiction?"</p>
<p>"God knows how true is all I say!" returned Mrs. Arlington, with profound sincerity of tone
      and manner. "Want soon stared me in the face: what could I do? Chance threw me in the way of
      Sir Rupert Harborough:—compelled by an imperious necessity, I became his mistress. This is my
      history."</p>
<p>"And the baronet treats you kindly?" said Richard, inquiringly.</p>
<p>"The terms upon which our connexion is based do not permit him an opportunity of being
      either very kind or very cruel."</p>
<p>"I must now say farewell for the present," exclaimed Markham, afraid of trusting himself
      longer with the Syren who had fascinated him with her misfortunes as well as by her charms.
      "In a day or two I will see you again. Oh! I cannot blame you for what you have done:—I
      commiserate—I pity you! Could any sacrifice that I am capable of making, restore you to
      happiness and—and—"</p>
<p>"Honour, you would say," exclaimed Diana, firmly.</p>
<p>"I would gladly make that sacrifice," added Richard. "From this moment we will be
      friends—very sincere friends. I will be your brother, dearest Diana—and you shall be my
      sister!"</p>
<p>The young man rose from the sofa, as he uttered these disjointed sentences in a singularly
      wild and rapid manner; and Diana, without making any reply, but apparently deeply touched,
      pressed his hand for some moments between both her own.</p>
<p>Richard then hastily escaped from the presence of that charming and fascinating
      creature.</p>
