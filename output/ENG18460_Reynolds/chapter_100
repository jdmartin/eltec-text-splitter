<head>CHAPTER C. THE MYSTERIES OF THE GROUND-FLOOR ROOMS.</head>
<p>THE Buffer was interrupted at this point by the return of his wife, who in spite of the
      protection of the Resurrection Man's umbrella, was dripping wet.</p>
<p>We must observe that we have taken the liberty of altering and improving the language, in
      which the Buffer delivered his autobiography, to the utmost of our power: we have moreover
      embodied his crude ideas and reduced his random observations into a tangible shape. We should
      add that the man was not deficient in intellectual sharpness, in spite of the stolid
      expression of his countenance; and thus the observations which he made relative to prison
      discipline and the neglect of government to adopt means of <hi>preventing</hi> crime in
      preference to <hi>punishing</hi> it when committed, need excite no astonishment in those who
      peruse them.</p>
<p>But to return to the thread of our narrative.</p>
<p>When the Buffer's wife had taken a warm seat by the fire, and comforted herself with a
      tolerably profound libation of steaming gin-and-water, she proceeded to give an account of her
      mission.</p>
<p>"I went down to Globe Lane," she said; "and a miserable walk it was, I can assure you. The
      rain falls in torrents, and the wind blows enough to carry the Monument into the Thames. By
      the time I got down to the undertaker's house I was drenched. Then Banks wasn't at home; but
      his wife asked me to stop till he came in; and as I thought that the business was pressing, I
      agreed. I waited—and waited till I was tired; one hour passed—then half an hour more; and I
      was just coming back when Banks walks in."</p>
<p>"And so you gave him the note," said the Resurrection Man, who had listened somewhat
      impatiently to this prelude.</p>
<p>"Yes—I gave him the note," continued Moll Wicks; "and he put on a pair of spectacles with
      round glasses as big as the bottoms of wine-glasses. When he had read it, he said he would
      attend to it, and should call his-self on you to-morrow morning by nine o'clock."</p>
<p>"Well and good," exclaimed the Resurrection Man.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do, Tony?" demanded the Rattlesnake.</p>
<p>"Never do you mind now," answered the Resurrection Man. "I will tell you all to-morrow."</p>
<p>"But I haven't quite done yet," cried the Buffer's wife. "Just as I came out of the
      undertaker's shop I met the surgeon that attended upon the old gentleman at Mrs. Smith's. He
      beckoned me under an archway, and asked when the old gentleman was going to be buried? I told
      him that I knew nothing about it. He hesitated, and was going away; and then he turned round
      suddenly, and said, 'Do you think your husband would mind a job that would put ten pounds into
      his pocket?' I don't know whether he had ever seen Jack, or not——"</p>
<p>"To be sure he has," interrupted the Buffer. "Didn't I go to him when I cut my hand with the
      hatchet, chopping wood one day?"</p>
<p>"Ah! I forgot that," said Moll. "Well, so I told him that my husband wasn't at all the man
      to refuse a ten pun' note; and even then he didn't seem to like to trust me. But after a
      little more hesitation, he says, says he, 'I should like to know what that old gentleman died
      of; I can't make out at all. I wonder whether his friends would have any objection to my
      opening the body; for I spoke to Mrs. Smith, and she won't hear of it.' I told him that the
      poor old feller had no friends; but I saw very well what the sawbones wanted; and so I says,
      'Why don't you have him up again if so be you want so partickler to know what he died
      of?'—'That's just the very thing,' he says. 'Do you think your husband would do the job? I
      once
      <pb n="311"/> knew a famous feller,' he says, 'one Anthony Tidkins'——"</p>
<p>"And so do I know him," interrupted the Resurrection Man. "Doesn't he live in the Cambridge
      Road, not far from the corner of Bethnal Green Road?"</p>
<p>"The same," answered the Buffer's wife.</p>
<p>"Well—what took place then?"</p>
<p>"He only told me to tell my husband to call upon him—and that was all."</p>
<p>"Here's more work, you see, Jack," said the Resurrection Man. "Leave this business to me.
      I'll take care and manage it. When we meet to-morrow night, I'll explain all my plans about
      the money this old fellow has left behind him; and then I'll tell you what arrangement I've
      made with this surgeon. You must mind and be with me at nine to-morrow night, Jack; because we
      won't keep young Markham waiting for us."</p>
<p>These last words were uttered with a low chuckle and an expression of countenance that
      indicated but too well the diabolical hopes and intentions of the Resurrection Man.</p>
<p>The Buffer and his wife then took leave of their friends, and departed to their own
      abode.</p>
<p>"Now, Meg," said the Resurrection Man, "it is nearly twelve o'clock; and you may get ready
      to go to bed. I am just going out for a few minutes—"</p>
<p>"As usual, Tony," cried the Rattlesnake, impatiently. "Why do you always go out now—every
      night?"</p>
<p>"I have told you over and over again not to pry into my secrets," returned the Resurrection
      Man, furiously. "You mind your own business, and only meddle in what I tell you to take a
      part; or else—"</p>
<p>"Well, well, Tony—don't be angry now," said the Rattlesnake, in her most wheedling tone. "I
      will never ask you any more questions. Only I thought it strange that you should have gone out
      every night for the last three weeks—no matter what weather—"</p>
<p>"And you may think it strange a little longer if you like," once more interrupted the
      terrible Resurrection Man, with a sinister lowering of his countenance which checked the reply
      that was rising to the lips of his companion.</p>
<p>The Rattlesnake lighted a candle, and passed into the adjoining apartment.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man poured some raw spirits into a wine glass, tossed it off, and putting
      on his hat, left the room.</p>
<p>He descended the precipitate staircase leading to the front door of the house, and in
      another moment reached the street.</p>
<p>Simply closing, without locking, the door behind him, he turned sharply round into the dark
      alley which ran beneath a sombre and narrow arch, along one side of the house.</p>
<p>But his footsteps, on this occasion, were closely followed by the Rattlesnake.</p>
<p>Unable to restrain her curiosity any longer—and, <hi>perhaps</hi>, influenced by other
      motives of a less superficial nature,—Margaret Flathers had determined to follow her paramour
      this night; and, scarcely had he closed the street door, when she was already at the bottom of
      the staircase.</p>
<p>The moment she stepped into the street, she saw the dark form of the Resurrection Man turn
      down the alley above mentioned; and she muttered to herself, "I thought so! and now perhaps I
      shall find out why he never would allow me to set foot in the rooms of the lower storey."</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man passed half-way up the alley, and taking a key from his pocket,
      proceeded to open a door that communicated with the ground-floor of his singularly-built
      house.</p>
<p>He entered, and the Rattlesnake hurried up to the door. She applied her ear to the
      key-hole—listened—and heard his footsteps echoing upon the boarded floor of the back-room. In
      a few moments the grating of a lucifer-match upon the wall met her ear; and applying her eye
      for a moment to the key-hole, she saw that there was now a light within.</p>
<p>Impelled by an invincible curiosity, or other motives of a powerful nature,—if not both,—the
      Rattlesnake cautiously raised the latch, and opened the door to the distance of nearly a
      foot.</p>
<p>With the utmost care, she now ventured to look into the interior of that part of the house,
      in respect to which a species of Blue-beard restriction had existed for her ever since she
      first became the companion of the Resurrection Man in that mysterious abode.</p>
<p>Glancing cautiously in, we say, she saw a small passage communicating with two rooms—one at
      each end, front and back. The door of the front room was closed: that of the back one was
      open. She accordingly directed all her attention to the back-room.</p>
<p>Against the wall facing the door was a candle, burning in a bright tin shade or reflector;
      and in the middle of the room, between the door and the light, stood the Resurrection Man. He
      had his back towards the Rattlesnake; but she could watch all his proceedings with the
      greatest facility.</p>
<p>And how strange were those proceedings!—The Resurrection Man enveloped himself in a large
      dark cloak, and fixed a black cloth mask over his countenance. He then advanced towards a
      cupboard, which he opened, and whence he took several articles, the precise nature of which
      the Rattlesnake could not ascertain, in consequence of the position in which her paramour was
      then standing. She however observed that he placed those articles in a basket at his feet; and
      when this task was accomplished, he lifted the basket in his hand, and turned so abruptly
      round to leave the room, that the Rattlesnake trembled from head to foot lest he should have
      caught a glimpse of her head protruded through the opening of the door.</p>
<p>She drew herself back and pulled the door towards her. For a moment she felt inclined to
      beat a precipitate retreat to her own quarters; but curiosity compelled her to remain.</p>
<p>What could mean that strange disguise?—Why that cloak?—Wherefore that mask?—And what were
      the objects which the Resurrection Man had consigned to his basket?—Lastly, whither was he
      going?</p>
<p>With the most extreme caution she again pushed the door partly open, and again did she
      glance into the interior of that mysterious division of the house.</p>
<p>But all was now dark; the light had disappeared, or was extinguished, and the place was
      involved in total obscurity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all was not silent. The measured tread of receding footsteps fell upon the
      woman's ear: those sounds seemed to come from heavy feet descending stone stairs.</p>
<p>Fainter and fainter became the sounds, until at length they merged into the low wind, which
      whistled gloomily and monotonously through the lower part of the house.</p>
<p>Margaret Flathers felt alarmed: she scarcely knew why.
      <pb n="312"/></p>
<p>Was it that being aware of the diabolical character of the Resurrection Man, she naturally
      associated his present strange proceedings with some deed of darkness whose very mystery made
      her shudder?</p>
<p>Was it that she trembled at the idea of being in the power of a miscreant whose ability to
      work evil seemed as unbounded as his inclination?</p>
<p>Suddenly her thoughts received an interruption which was by no means calculated to
      tranquillize her mind.</p>
<p>A scream, apparently coming from the very bowels of the earth, echoed through the lower part
      of that house—a scream expressive of an agony so intense, an anguish so acute, that it smote
      even her hardened and ruthless heart!</p>
<p>That scream was not repeated; but its echoes rang long throughout the place, and vibrated in
      a strange and terrible manner on the ears of the Rattlesnake.</p>
<p>Then followed low mutterings, in a hoarse and subdued tone; but as they gradually grew
      louder, she could recognise the menacing voice of the Resurrection Man.</p>
<p>Fear now completely triumphed over the motives which had induced the woman to seek to
      penetrate into the secrets of her paramour. The dark cloak—the black mask—the basket—the
      piercing scream—and the threatening voice, all combined to bewilder her imagination, and fill
      her with vague but not less terrible alarms.</p>
<p>Hastily closing the door, she retreated with precipitate speed from the dark alley, and
      ascended the steep staircase leading to the upper rooms of the house.</p>
<p>To throw off her clothes and betake herself to rest was the occupation of but a few minutes:
      nevertheless, as she laid aside her garments, she cast timid and furtive glances behind her—as
      if she were afraid that her eyes would encounter some horrible spectre—or some masked figure
      of appalling aspect.</p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour after she had returned from the contemplation of those mysterious
      proceedings that had filled her mind with such ineffable horror, the Resurrection Man entered
      the bed-room.</p>
<p>A light was burning upon the table, and when the door opened the Rattlesnake glanced with
      profound terror in that direction—for she feared lest he should appear in his long dark cloak
      and black mask. She was inured to crime;—but it was that crime which she could contemplate
      face to face; and thus the idea that she was in a house where deeds of unknown horror and
      machinations of an undefined degree of blackness were the business of the terrible man with
      whom her fortunes were now linked, prostrated all her courage, and filled her with alarms the
      more profound, because so ominously vague.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the risk of betraying her trepidation to the Resurrection Man, she soon
      affected to fall asleep; and, when at length slumber really overtook her, her dreams were
      filled with gaunt forms clad in long black cloaks, and wearing upon their countenances dark
      masks, through the holes of which their eyes glared with fearful brightness.</p>
