<head>CHAPTER CVIII. THE EXHUMATION.</head>
<p>THE night was fine—frosty—and bright with the lustre of a lovely moon.</p>
<p>Even the chimneys and gables of the squalid
      <pb n="329"/> houses of Globe Town appeared to bathe their heads in that flood of silver
      light.</p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>The Resurrection Man and the Buffer pursued their way towards the cemetery.</p>
<p>For some minutes they preserved a profound silence: at length the Buffer exclaimed, "I only
      hope, Tony, that this business won't turn out as bad as the job with young Markham three
      nights ago."</p>
<p>"Why should it?" demanded the Resurrection Man, in a gruff tone.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know why," answered the Buffer. "P'rhaps, after all, it was just as well that
      feller escaped as he did. We might have swung for it."</p>
<p>"Escape!" muttered the Resurrection Man, grinding his teeth savagely. "Yes—he did escape
       <hi>then</hi>; but I haven't done with him yet. He shall not get off so easy another
      time."</p>
<p>"I wonder who those chaps was that come up so sudden?" observed the Buffer, after a
      pause.</p>
<p>"Friends of his, no doubt," answered Tidkins. "Most likely he suspected a trap, or thought
      he would be on the right side. But the night was so plaguy dark, and the whole thing was so
      sudden, it was impossible to form an idea of who the two strangers might be."</p>
<p>"One on 'em was precious strong, I know," said the Buffer. "But, for my part, I think you'd
      better leave the young feller alone in future. It's no good standing the chance of getting
      scragged for mere wengeance. I can't understand that sort of thing. If you like to crack his
      crib for him and hive the swag, I'm your man; but I'll have no more of a business that's all
      danger and no profit."</p>
<p>"Well, well, as you like," said the Resurrection Man, impatiently. "Here we are; so look
      alive."</p>
<p>They were now under the wall of the cemetery.</p>
<p>The Buffer clambered to the top of the wall, which was not very high; and the Resurrection
      Man handed him the implements and tools, which he dropped cautiously upon the ground inside
      the enclosure.</p>
<p>He then helped his companion upon the wall; and in another moment they stood together within
      the cemetery.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you can find the way to the right grave?" demanded the Buffer in a
      whisper.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid," was the reply: "I could go straight up to it blindfold."
      <pb n="330"/></p>
<p>They then shouldered their implements, and the Resurrection Man led the way to the spot
      where Mrs. Smith's anonymous lodger had been buried.</p>
<p>"I'm afeard the ground's precious hard," observed the Buffer, when he and his companion had
      satisfied themselves by a cautious glance around that no one was watching their movements.</p>
<p>The eyes of these men had become so habituated to the obscurity of night, in consequence of
      the frequency with which they pursued their avocations during the darkness which cradled
      others to rest, that they were possessed of the visual acuteness generally ascribed to the
      cat.</p>
<p>"We'll soon turn it up, let it be as hard as it will," said the Resurrection Man, in answer
      to his comrade's remark.</p>
<p>Then, suiting the action to the word, he began his operations in the following manner.</p>
<p>He measured a distance of five paces from the head of the grave. At the point thus marked he
      took a long iron rod and drove it in an oblique direction through the ground towards one end
      of the coffin. So accurate were his calculations relative to the precise spot in which the
      coffin was embedded in the earth, that the iron rod struck against it the very first time he
      thus sounded the soil.</p>
<p>"All right," he whispered to the Buffer.</p>
<p>He then took a spade and began to break up the earth just at that spot where the end of the
      iron rod peeped out of the ground.</p>
<p>"Not so hard as you thought," he observed. "The fact is, the whole burial-place is so mixed
      up with human remains, that the clay is too greasy to freeze very easy."</p>
<p>"I s'pose that's it," said the Buffer.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man worked for about ten minutes with a skill and an effect that would have
      astonished even Jones the grave-digger himself, had he been there to see. He then resigned the
      spade to the Buffer, who took his turn with equal ardour and ability.</p>
<p>When <hi>his</hi> ten minutes elapsed, the resurrectionists regaled themselves each with a
      dram from Tidkins' flask; and this individual then applied himself once more to the work in
      hand. When he was wearied, the Buffer relieved him; and thus did they fairly divide the toil
      until the excavation of the ground was completed.</p>
<p>This portion of the task was finished in about forty minutes. An oblique channel, about ten
      feet long, and three feet square at the mouth, and decreasing only in length, as it verged
      towards the head of the coffin at the bottom, was now formed.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man provided himself with a stout chisel, the handle of which was covered
      with leather, and with a mallet, the ends of which were also protected with pieces of the same
      material. Thus the former instrument when struck by the latter emitted but little noise.</p>
<p>He then descended into the channel which terminated at the very head of the coffin.</p>
<p>Breaking away the soil that lay upon that end of the coffin, he inserted the chisel into the
      joints of the wood, and in a very few moments knocked off the board that closed the coffin at
      that extremity.</p>
<p>The wood-work of the head of the shell was also removed with ease—for Banks had purposely
      nailed those parts of the two cases very slightly together.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man next handed up the tools to his companion, who threw him down a strong
      cord.</p>
<p>The end of this rope was then fastened under the armpits of the corpse as it lay in its
      coffin.</p>
<p>This being done, the Buffer helped the Resurrection Man out of the hole.</p>
<p>"So far, so good," said Tidkins: "it must be close upon one o'clock. We have got a quarter
      of an hour left—and that's plenty of time to do all that's yet to be done."</p>
<p>The two men then took the rope between them, and drew the corpse gently out of its coffin—up
      the slope of the channel—and landed it safely on the ground at a little distance from the
      mouth of the excavation.</p>
<p>The moon fell upon the pale features of the dead—those features which were still as
      unchanged, save in colour, as if they had never come in contact with a shroud—nor belonged to
      a body that had been swathed in a winding-sheet!</p>
<p>The contrast formed by the white figure and the black soil on which it was stretched, would
      have struck terror to the heart of any one save a resurrectionist.</p>
<p>Indeed, the moment the corpse was thus dragged forth from its grave, the Resurrection Man
      thrust his hand into its breast, and felt for the gold.</p>
<p>It was there—wrapped up as the undertaker had described.</p>
<p>"The blunt is all safe, Jack," said the Resurrection Man; and he secured the coin about his
      person.</p>
<p>They then applied themselves vigorously to shovel back the earth; but, when they had filled
      up the excavation, a considerable quantity of the soil still remained to dispose of, it being
      impossible, in spite of stamping down, to condense the earth into the same space from which it
      was originally taken.</p>
<p>They therefore filled two sacks with the surplus soil, and proceeded to empty them in
      different parts of the ground.</p>
<p>Their task was so far accomplished, when they heard the low rumble of wheels in the lane
      outside the cemetery.</p>
<p>To bundle the corpse neck and heels into a sack, and gather up their implements, was the
      work of only a few moments. They then conveyed their burdens between them to the wall
      overlooking the lane, where the well-known voice of Mr. Banks greeted their ears, as he stood
      upright in his cart peering over the barrier into the cemetery.</p>
<p>"Got the blessed defunct?" said the undertaker, interrogatively.</p>
<p>"Right and tight," answered the Buffer; "and the tin too. Now, then, look sharp—here's the
      tools."</p>
<p>"I've got 'em," returned Banks.</p>
<p>"Look out for the stiff 'un, then," added the Buffer; and, aided by the Resurrection Man, he
      shoved the body up to the undertaker, who deposited it in the bottom of his cart.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man and the Buffer then mounted the wall, and got into the vehicle, in
      which they laid themselves down, so that any person whom they might meet in the streets
      through which they were to pass would only see one individual in the cart—namely, the driver.
      Otherwise, the appearance of three men at that time of night, or rather at that hour in the
      morning, might have excited suspicion.</p>
<p>Banks lashed the sides of his horse; and the animal started off at a round pace.</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken during the short drive to the surgeon's residence in the Cambridge
      Road.</p>
<p>When they reached his house the road was quiet
      <pb n="331"/> and deserted. A light glimmered through the fan-light over the door; and the
      door itself was opened the moment the cart stopped.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man and the Buffer sprang up; and, seeing that the coast was clear, bundled
      the corpse out of the vehicle in an instant; then in less than half a minute the "blessed
      defunct," as the undertaker called it, was safely lodged in the passage of the surgeon's
      house.</p>
<p>Mr. Banks, as soon as the body was removed from his vehicle, drove rapidly away. His portion
      of the night's work was done; and he knew that his accomplices would give him his "reg'lars"
      when they should meet again.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man and the Buffer conveyed the body into a species of out-house, which the
      surgeon, who was passionately attached to anatomical studies, devoted to purposes of
      dissection and physiological experiment.</p>
<p>In the middle of this room, which was about ten feet long and six broad, stood a strong deal
      table, forming a slightly inclined plane. The stone pavement of the out-house was perforated
      with holes in the immediate vicinity of the table, so that the fluid which poured from
      subjects for dissection might escape into a drain communicating with the common sewer. To the
      ceiling, immediately above the head of the table, was attached a pulley with a strong cord, by
      means of which a body might be supported in any position that was most convenient to the
      anatomist.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man and his companion carried the corpse into this dissecting-room, and
      placed it upon the table, the surgeon holding a candle to light their movements.</p>
<p>"Now, Jack," said Tidkins to the Buffer, "do you take the stiff 'un out of the sack, and lay
      him along decently on the table ready for business, while I retire a moment to this
      gentleman's study and settle accounts with him."</p>
<p>"Well and good," returned the Buffer. "I'll stay here till you come back."</p>
<p>The surgeon lighted another candle, which he placed on the window-sill, and then withdrew,
      accompanied by the Resurrection Man.</p>
<p>The Buffer shut the door of the dissecting-room, because the draught caused the candle to
      flicker, and menaced the light with extinction. He then proceeded to obey the directions which
      he had received from his accomplice.</p>
<p>The Buffer removed the sack from the body, which he then stretched out at length upon the
      inclined table, taking care to place its head on the higher extremity and immediately beneath
      the pulley.</p>
<p>"There, old feller," he said, "you're comfortable, at any rate. What a blessin' it would be
      to your friends, if they was ever to find out that you'd been had up again, to know into what
      skilful hands you'd happened to fall!"</p>
<p>Thus musing, the Buffer turned his back listlessly towards the corpse, and leant against the
      table on which it was lying.</p>
<p>"Let me see," he said to himself, "there's thirty-one pounds that was buried along with
       <hi>him</hi>, and then there's ten pounds that the sawbones is a paying now to Tony for the
       <hi>snatch</hi>; that makes forty-one pounds, and there's three to go shares. What does that
      make? Threes into four goes once—threes into eleven goes three and two over—that's thirteen
      pounds a-piece, and two pound to split—"</p>
<p>The Buffer started abruptly round, and became deadly pale. He thought he heard a slight
      movement of the corpse, and his whole frame trembled.</p>
<p>Almost at the same moment some object was hurled violently against the window; the glass was
      shivered to atoms; the candle was thrown down and extinguished; and total darkness reigned in
      the dissecting-room.</p>
<p>"Holloa!" cried the Buffer, turning sick at heart; "what's that?"</p>
<p>Scarcely had these words escaped his lips when he felt his hand suddenly grasped by the cold
      fingers of the corpse.</p>
<p>"O God!" cried the miscreant; and he fell insensible across the body on the table.</p>
