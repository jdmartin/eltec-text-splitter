<head>CHAPTER CXLIII.   MORBID FEELINGS.—KATHERINE.</head>
<p>"Holloa, Banks!" exclaimed the executioner. "Got scent of the morning's work—eh, old
      feller?"</p>
<p>"Alas! my dear Mr. Smithers," returned the undertaker, shaking his head in a lachrymose
      manner, "if men will perpetrate such enormities, they must expect to go to their last home by
      means of a dance upon nothing."</p>
<p>And, according to a custom which years had rendered a part of Mr. Banks's nature, he wiped
      his eyes with a dingy white pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>"There he is again, the old fool!" ejaculated Smithers, with a coarse guffaw; "always
      a-whimpering! Why, you don't mean to say, Banks, that you care two straws about the feller
      that's going to be tucked up this morning?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Smithers, you don't know my heart: I weeps for frail human natur', and not only for the
      unhappy being that's so soon to be a blessed defunct carkiss. But, Smithers—my boy——"</p>
<p>"Well?" cried the executioner.</p>
<p>"How much is it to be this time for the rope?" asked Mr. Banks, in a tremulous tone and with
      another solemn shake of the head.</p>
<p>"Five shillings—not a mag under," was the prompt reply.</p>
<p>"That's too much, Mr. Smithers—too much," observed the undertaker of Globe Lane. "The last
      one I bought I lost by: times is changed, Mr. Smithers—sadly changed."</p>
<p>"Ain't the <hi>morbid feelings</hi>, as the press calls 'em, as powerful as ever?" demanded
      the executioner savagely.</p>
<p>"The morbid feelings, thank God, is right as a trivet," answered Banks; "but it's the blunt
      that falls off, Smithers—the blunt! And what's the use of the morbid feelings if there's no
      blunt to gratify 'em?"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Banks," cried the executioner, "that you can't get as ready a
      sale for the halters as you used to do?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that such is the actiwal case, my dear friend," responded Mr. Banks, turning up
      his eyes in a melancholy manner. "The last blessed wictim that you operated on, Mr. Smithers,
      you remember, I gived you five shillings for the rope; and I will say, in justice to him as
      spun it and them as bought it, that a nicer, stronger, or compacter bit of cord never
      supported carkiss to cross-beam. But wain was it that I coiled it neat up in my winder;—wain
      was it that I wrote on a half sheet of foolscap, '<hi>This is the halter that hung poor
       William Lees</hi>;'—the morbid feelings was strong, 'cos the crowd collected opposite my
      house; but the filthy lucre, Smithers, was wanting. Well—there the damned—I beg its pardon—the
      blessed cord stayed for a matter of three weeks; and I do believe it never would have gone at
      all, if some swell that was passing quite promiscuously one day didn't take a fancy to
      it——"</p>
<p>"Well, and what did he give you?" demanded the executioner impatiently.</p>
<p>"Only twelve shillings, as true as I'm a woful sinner that hopes to be saved!" answered the
      undertaker.</p>
<p>"Twelve shillings—eh? And how much would you have had for the rope?"</p>
<p>"When the blunt doesn't fall short of the morbid feelings, I calkilates upon a guinea,"
      answered Mr. Banks.</p>
<p>"Why, you old rogue," shouted the executioner, "you know that you sold William Lees's rope a
      dozen times over. The moment the real one was disposed of, you shoved a counterfeit into your
      winder; and that went off so well, that you kept on till you'd sold a dozen."</p>
<p>"No, Smithers—never no such luck as that since Greenacre's business," said the undertaker,
      with a solemn shake of his head; "and then I believe I really did sell nineteen ropes in less
      than a week."</p>
<p>"I only wonder people is such fools as to be gulled so," observed Smithers.</p>
<p>"What can they say, when they see your certifikit that the rope's the true one?" demanded
      Banks. "There was one old gen'leman that dealt with me for a many—many years; and he bought
      the rope of every blessed defunct that had danced on nothing at Newgate for upwards of twenty
      year! I quite entered into his feeling, I did—I admired that man; and so I always sold him the
      real ropes. But time's passing, while I'm chattering here. Come, my dear Smithers—shall we say
      three shillings for the rope and certifikit this morning?"</p>
<p>"Not a mag less than five," was the dogged answer.</p>
<p>"Four, my dear friend Smithers?" said the undertaker, with a whining, coaxing tone and
      manner.</p>
<p>"No—five, I tell you."</p>
<p>"Well—five then," said Banks. "I'll be there at a few minits 'afore nine: I s'pose you'll
      cut the carkiss down at the usual hour?"</p>
<p>"Yes—yes," answered Smithers. "I'm always punctiwal with the dead as well as the
      living."</p>
<p>The undertaker muttered something about "blessed defuncts," smoothed down the limp ends of
      his dirty cravat, and slowly withdrew, shaking his head more solemnly than ever.</p>
<p>"See what it is to be a Public Executioner!" cried
      <pb n="19"/>Smithers, turning with an air of triumph towards his son: "look at the
      perk-visits—look at the priweleges! And yet you go snivelling about like a young gal, 'cos I
      want to make you fit to succeed me in my honourable profession."</p>
<p>"O father!" cried the lad, unable to restrain his feelings any longer: "instead of being
      respected, we are abhorred—instead of being honoured, our very touch is contamination! You
      yourself know, dear father, that you scarcely or never go abroad; if you enter the
      public-house tap-room, even in a neighbourhood so low as this, the people get up and walk away
      on different excuses. When I step out for an errand, the boys in the streets point at me; and
      those who are well-behaved, pass me with stealthy looks of horror and dread. Even that canting
      hypocrite who has just left us—even <hi>he</hi> never crosses your threshold except when his
      interest is concerned;—and yet he, they say, is connected with body-snatchers, and does not
      bear an over-excellent character in his neighbourhood. Yet such a sneaking old wretch as that
      approaches our door with loathing—Oh! I know that he does! You see, father—dear father, that
      it is a horrible employment; then pray don't make me embrace it—Oh! don't—pray don't,
      father—dear father: say you won't—and I'll do any thing else you tell me! I'll pick up rags
      and bones from the gutters—I'll sweep chimnies—I'll break stones from dawn to darkness;—but do
      not—do not make me an executioner!"</p>
<p>Smithers was so astounded at this appeal that he had allowed it to proceed without
      interruption. He was accustomed to be addressed on the same subject, but never to such a
      length, nor with such arguments; so that the manner and matter of that prayer produced a
      strange impression on the man who constantly sought, by means of rude sophistries, to veil
      from himself and his family the true estimation in which his calling was held.</p>
<p>Gibbet, mistaking his father's astonishment for a more favourable impression, threw himself
      at his feet, clasped his hands, and exclaimed, "Oh! do not turn a deaf ear to my prayer! And
      think not, dear father, that I confound <hi>you</hi> with that pursuit which I abhor;—think
      not that I see other in you than my parent—a parent whom——"</p>
<p>"Whom you shall obey!" cried the executioner, now recovering the use of his tongue: "or, by
      God!" he added, pointing with terrible ferocity towards the model-gallows, "I'll serve you as
      I did that puppet just now—and as I shall do the man down in the Old Bailey presently."</p>
<p>Gibbet rose—disappointed, dispirited, and with a heart agitated by the most painful
      emotions.</p>
<p>But why had not Smithers recourse to the leathern weapon as usual? why had he spared the
      poor hump-back on this occasion?</p>
<p>Gibbet himself marvelled that such forbearance should have been shown towards him, since he
      now comprehended but too well that his father was inexorable in his determination with regard
      to him.</p>
<p>The truth was that Smithers was so far struck by his son's appeal as to deem it of more
      serious import than any previously manifested aversion to his horrible calling; and he
      accordingly met it with a menace which he deemed to be more efficacious than the old
      discipline of the thong.</p>
<p>"Now, mind me," said the executioner, after a few moments' pause, "you needn't try any more
      of these snivelling antics: they won't succeed with me, I tell you before-hand. If you don't
      do as I order you, I'll hang you up to that beam as soon as yonder mouse in the noose on the
      mantel. So let one word be enough. Hark! there's seven o'clock: we've only just time to get a
      mouthful before we must be off."</p>
<p>Smithers proceeded down stairs, followed by Gibbet.</p>
<p>They entered a little parlour, where Katherine was preparing breakfast.</p>
<p>It being still dark, a candle stood on the table; and its light was reflected in the
      polished metal tea-pot, milk-jug, and sugar-basin. The table napkin was of dazzling whiteness:
      the knives and forks were bright as steel could be;—in a word, an air of exquisite neatness
      and cleanliness pervaded the board on which the morning's repast was spread.</p>
<p>Nor was this appearance confined to the table. The little room itself was a model of
      domestic propriety. Not a speck of dust was to be seen on the simple furniture, which was also
      disposed with taste: the windows were set off with a clean muslin curtain; and the mantel was
      covered with fancy ornaments all indicative of female industry.</p>
<p>Then Kate herself!—her appearance was in perfect keeping with that of the room which owed
      its cleanliness and air of simple comfort to her. A neat cap set off her chesnut hair, which
      was arranged in plain bands: her dark stuff gown was made high in the body and long in the
      skirt, but did not conceal the gracefulness of her slender form, nor altogether prevent a
      little foot in a neat shoe and a well-turned ankle in a lily-white cotton stocking from
      occasionally revealing themselves. Then her hands were so slightly brown, her fingers so
      taper, and her nails so carefully kept, that no one, to look at them, would conceive how much
      hard work Katherine was compelled to do.</p>
<p>Though so rigidly neat and clean, Kate had nothing of the coquette about her. She was as
      bashful and artless as a child; and, besides—whom had she, the executioner's acknowledged
      niece, to captivate?</p>
<p>Although she endeavoured to greet Smithers and the hump-back with a smile, a profound
      melancholy in reality oppressed her.</p>
<p>It was one of those mornings when her uncle was to exercise his horrible calling:—this
      circumstance would alone have deeply affected her spirits, which were never too light nor
      buoyant. But on the present occasion, another cause of sorrow weighed on her soul—and that was
      the knowledge that her wretched cousin was that morning to enter on his fearful noviciate!</p>
<p>She entertained a boundless compassion for that unfortunate being. His physical deformities,
      and the treatment which he experienced from his father, called forth the kindest sympathies of
      her naturally tender heart. Moreover, he had received instruction and was in the habit of
      seeking consolation from her: she was the only friend of that suffering creature who was
      persecuted alike by nature and by man; and she perhaps felt the more acutely on his account,
      because she was so utterly powerless in protecting him from the parental ferocity which drove
      him to her for comfort.</p>
<p>She knew that a good—a generous—a kind—and a deeply sensitive soul was enclosed within that
      revolting form; and she experienced acute anguish
      <pb n="20"/>when a brutal hand could wantonly torture so susceptible a spirit.</p>
<p>And to that wounded, smarting spirit she herself was all kindness—all softness—all
      conciliation—all encouragement.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, if the miserable son of the public executioner was devoted to her: no
      wonder if she were a goddess of light, and hope, and consolation, and bliss to him! To do her
      the slightest service was a source of the purest joy which that poor being could know: to be
      able to convince her by a deed,—even so slight as picking up her thread when it fell, or
      placing her chair for her in its wonted situation,—this, this was sublime happiness to the
      hump-back!</p>
<p>He could sit for hours near her, without uttering a word—but watching her like a faithful
      dog. And when her musical voice, fraught with some expression of kindness, fell upon his ear,
      how that hideous countenance would brighten up—how those coarse lips would form a smile—how
      those large dull orbs would glow with ineffable bliss!</p>
<p>But when his father was unkind to her,—unkind to Katherine, his only friend,—unkind to the
      sole being that ever had looked not only without abhorrence, but with unadulterated gentleness
      on him,—then a new spirit seemed to animate him; and the faithful creature, who received his
      own stripes with spaniel-like irresistance, burst forth in indignant remonstrance when a blow
      was levelled at her. Then his rage grew terrible; and the resigned, docile, retiring hump-back
      became transformed into a perfect demon.</p>
<p>How offensive to the delicate admirer of a maudlin romance, in which only handsome boys and
      pretty girls are supposed to be capable of playing at the game of Love, must be the statement
      which we are now about to make. But the reader who truly knows the world,—not the world of the
      sentimental novel, but the world as it really is,—will not start when we inform him that this
      being whom nature had formed in her most uncouth mould,—this creature whose deformities seemed
      to render him a connecting link between man and monkey,—this living thing that appeared to be
      but one remove above a monster, cherished a profound love for that young girl whom he esteemed
      as his guardian angel.</p>
<p>But this passion was unsuspected by her, as its nature was unknown to himself. Of course it
      was not reciprocated:—how could it be? Nevertheless, every proof of friendship—every
      testimonial of kind feeling—every evidence of compassion on her part, only tended to augment
      that attachment which the hump-back experienced for Katherine.</p>
<p>"Well, Kate," said the executioner, as he took his seat at the breakfast-table, "I've
      drilled Gibbet into the art of pinioning at last."</p>
<p>The girl made no answer; but she cast a rapid glance at the hump-back, and two tears
      trickled down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Come, Gibbet," added Smithers; "we've no time to lose. Don't be afraid of your
      bread-and-butter: you'll get nothing to eat till you come home again to dinner."</p>
<p>"Is John going with you this morning, uncle?" inquired Katherine timidly.</p>
<p>"Why, you know he is. You only ask the question to get up a discussion once more about it,
      as you did last night."</p>
<p>This was more or less true: the generous-hearted girl hoped yet to be able to avert her
      uncle from his intention in respect to the hump-back.</p>
<p>"But I won't hear any more about it," continued the executioner, as he ate his breakfast.
      "And, then, why do you call him John?"</p>
<p>"Did you not give him that name at his baptism?" said Kate.</p>
<p>"And if I did, I've also the right to change it," returned the executioner; "and I choose
      him to be called <hi>Gibbet</hi>. It's more professional."</p>
<p>"I think the grocer in High Street wants an errand boy, uncle," observed Katherine, with her
      eyes fixed upon her cup—she dared not raise them to Smithers' face as she spoke: "perhaps he
      would take John—I mean my cousin—and that would be better than making him follow a calling
      which he does not fancy."</p>
<p>"Mind your own business, Miss Imperence!" ejaculated the executioner; "and let me mind mine.
      Now, then—who knocks at the front door?"</p>
<p>Gibbet rose and hastened from the room.</p>
<p>In a few moments he returned, holding in his hand a paper, which he gave to his father.</p>
<p>"Ah! I thought so," said Smithers, as he glanced his eye over the paper: "my friend Dognatch
      is always in time. Here's the <hi>last dying speech, confession, and a true account of the
       execution</hi> of the man that I'm to tuck up presently—all cut and dry, you see. Well—it's
      very kind of Dognatch always to send me a copy: but I suppose he thinks it's a compliment due
      to my sitiwation."</p>
<p>With these words Smithers tossed off his tea, rose, and exclaimed, "Now, Gibbet, my boy, we
      must be off."</p>
<p>"Father, I don't feel equal to it," murmured the hump-back, who seemed fixed to his
      chair.</p>
<p>"Come—without another word!" cried the executioner, in so terrible a tone that Gibbet
      started from his seat as if suddenly moved by electricity.</p>
<p>"Uncle—uncle, you will not—you cannot force this poor lad—" began Katherine, venturing upon
      a last appeal in favour of the hump-back.</p>
<p>"Kate," said the executioner, turning abruptly upon her, while his countenance wore so
      ferocious an expression of mingled determination and rage, that the young girl uttered an
      ejaculation of alarm,—"Kate, do not provoke me; or——"</p>
<p>He said no more, but darted on her a look of such dark, diabolical menace, that she sank
      back, annihilated as it were, into her seat.</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands, and burst into an agony of tears.</p>
<p>For some moments she remained absorbed in profound grief: the fate of the wretched
      hump-back, and the idea that she herself was doomed to exist beneath the same roof with the
      horrible man whom she called her uncle, were causes of bitter anguish to her tender and
      sensitive soul.</p>
<p>When she raised her head, and glanced timidly around, she found herself alone.</p>
