<head>CHAPTER CCVI.   THE PATRICIAN LADY AND THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN.</head>
<p>Lady Ravensworth retired to her boudoir; and, throwing herself upon a voluptuous ottoman,
      she burst into a flood of tears.</p>
<p>The wife of one of England's wealthiest nobles,—mistress of a splendid mansion and numerous
      household,—young, beautiful, and admired,—with a coronet upon her brow, and all the luxuries
      and pleasures of the world at her command,—this haughty and high-born lady now trembled at the
      idea—now shrunk from the thought—of meeting an obscure young woman who was forced to accept a
      menial place in order to earn her daily bread!</p>
<p>It was a strange coincidence that thus brought Lydia Hutchinson beneath the roof of Lady
      Ravensworth, whom the young woman was very far from suspecting to be that same Adeline Enfield
      who had been her companion—nay, her tutoress—in the initiative of wantonness and
      dishonour.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chichester had manifested a sisterly kindness towards the unfortunate Lydia; and,
      instead of shrinking in disgust, as so many others would have done, from the young woman who
      had been urged by stern necessity to ply a loathsome trade, she had endeavoured, by the most
      delicate attentions, to reclaim the mind of society's outcast from the dark ocean of despair
      in which it was so profoundly plunged.</p>
<p>The reader has doubtless seen that Lydia Hutchinson had never courted vice for vice's sake.
      She was not naturally of a depraved nor lascivious disposition. Circumstances—amongst which
      must be reckoned the treachery exercised by Lord Dunstable to accomplish her seduction, and
      the accident which threw the poor creature upon the tender mercies of Mrs. Harpy,—had
      conspired,—fearfully conspired, to brand her with infamy, and to drag her through the filth
      and mire of the various phases which characterise the downward path of a career of
      prostitution. Necessity had made her what she was!</p>
<p>Mrs. Chichester comprehended all this; and she was not one of those who believe that there
      is no sincere penitence—no reformation for the lost one. She longed to afford Lydia an
      opportunity of entering on a course of virtue and propriety. She would have willingly afforded
      the poor creature a permanent asylum, as a matter of charity, and even to insure a companion
      to cheer her own species of semi-widowed loneliness; but she was well aware that eleemosynary
      aid of such a kind, by retaining its object in a condition of idleness and of dependence, was
      of a most demoralising nature. She wished to give Lydia an opportunity of retrieving her
      character in her own estimation, and of regaining a proper confidence in herself; and she
      resolved that no excess of indulgence, nor extreme of charity, on her part, should permit the
      young woman to live in an indolence that might unfit her for any occupation in case of
      ultimate necessity, and that would thus fling her back upon the last and only resource—a
      recurrence to the walks of ignominy
      <pb n="232"/>and crime. To reclaim and reinstate, as it were the unfortunate Lydia Hutchinson,
      was Viola Chichester's aim; and the object of this humane solicitude was deeply anxious to
      second, by her own conduct, the intentions of her generous benefactress.</p>
<p>As time wore on, Lydia improved greatly in mental condition and personal appearance: her
      thoughts became settled and composed, and her form resumed much of the freshness which had
      characterised her youth. She speedily began to express a desire to exert herself in some
      honest employment to gain her livelihood;—she also felt that indolence and dependence, even in
      the presence of the best moral examples, produce a vitiated frame of mind;—and she revolted
      from the mere idea of a relapse into the horrible path from which a friendly hand had redeemed
      her, as the most appalling catastrophe that her imagination could conceive.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chichester felt so persuaded of Lydia's firmness of purpose in pursuing a career of
      rectitude, that she resolved to take a step which only the extreme urgency of the case and a
      settled conviction of the young woman's inclination to do well, could justify. This was to
      obtain her a situation in some family. Lydia was overjoyed at the proposal. An advertisement
      was accordingly inserted in a newspaper; and a few days brought many written answers. Miss
      Villiers—now Lady Bounce—called personally, and was so pleased with Lydia's manner that she
      put no special questions to Mrs. Chichester.</p>
<p>Viola, however, addressed Miss Villiers thus:—"The young woman who now stands before you has
      been unfortunate—very unfortunate; and hers has been the fate of the unfortunate. She is most
      anxious to eat the bread of industry and honesty. I am persuaded that a kind hand stretched
      out to aid her in this desire, will raise her to happiness, and ensure her lasting
      gratitude."</p>
<p>Miss Villiers was a young lady of an excellent heart: she did not completely understand all
      that Mrs. Chichester meant; but she comprehended enough to render her willing to assist a
      fellow-creature who sought to earn her livelihood honourably, and who seemed to possess the
      necessary qualifications for the employment desired. Thus the bargain was hastily concluded;
      and when Miss Villiers desired Lydia to join her on a certain day at Ravensworth Hall, the
      young woman entertained not the least idea that her school friend Adeline Enfield was Lady
      Ravensworth, the mistress of that lordly habitation.</p>
<p>We will now return to Adeline, whom we left weeping in her boudoir.</p>
<p>The presence of Lydia in that house was indeed enough to alarm and embarrass her. Not that
      she precisely feared exposure at Lydia's hands in respect to the past—especially as it would
      be so easy to deny any derogatory statement of the kind. But Adeline felt that she should now
      possess a dependant before whom her dignity and self-confidence would ever be overwhelmed by
      the weight of that dread secret of which Lydia's bosom was the depository. Such a prospect was
      most galling—most humiliating—most degrading to the mind of the haughty peeress.</p>
<p>"But of what avail are tears?" said Adeline, suddenly. "The danger is here—the evil is
      before me. We must meet:—it were better that I should see her at once! Doubtless she is
      unaware in whose abode she is now a menial!"</p>
<p>Adeline wiped her eyes, rang the bell, and reseating herself, assumed as composed a manner
      as possible under the circumstances.</p>
<p>In a few moments she heard footsteps approaching.</p>
<p>"This is my lady's apartment," said the housekeeper in the passage.</p>
<p>"Thank you," replied another voice.</p>
<p>Oh! how Adeline's heart beat,—the well-remembered tones of Lydia Hutchinson had just met her
      ears.</p>
<p>Then she heard the retreating sounds of the housekeeper's footsteps; and there was a gentle
      knock at the door of their boudoir.</p>
<p>"Come in," said Adeline, in a half-stifling voice.</p>
<p>The door opened, and Lydia Hutchinson entered the room.</p>
<p>Lady Ravensworth's countenance was averted towards the fire; and it was not until she heard
      the door close that she turned towards Lydia, who was in a state of trembling anxiety, mingled
      with curiosity, as to what might be the disposition of her mistress.</p>
<p>But no pen can describe the astonishment of the young woman, when by that pale but beautiful
      countenance, which was now suddenly turned towards her, she recognised her whom she had so
      much reason never to forget.</p>
<p>Staggering towards the mantel for support, and with her eyes fixed almost wildly upon her
      mistress, she exclaimed, "Miss Enfield! Is it indeed you?"</p>
<p>"I am Lady Ravensworth," was the somewhat haughty answer.</p>
<p>"Oh! now I understand it all!" cried Lydia, an expression of sincere gratitude animating her
      countenance, while she clasped her hands fervently together: "you have taken compassion on me
      at length,—you discovered where I was residing,—you sent some friend to engage me as if for
      herself,—and you were determined to surprise me by this proof of your goodness—this token of
      your kind remembrance of me!"</p>
<p>"No," returned Adeline: "accident alone has brought you into my service: and you must well
      understand that I am not over well pleased with the coincidence. In a word, name the sum that
      will satisfy you for the loss of a good place—and take your departure. You can leave to me the
      invention of some proper excuse——"</p>
<p>"Is it possible?" ejaculated Lydia; "this cold—heartless—ungrateful reception——"</p>
<p>"Do you recollect to whom you are speaking?" demanded Adeline, the colour mounting to her
      cheeks.</p>
<p>"Oh! yes,—I know that full well—too well," said Lydia, again clasping her hands, and casting
      her eyes upwards, as if in appeal to heaven against the ingratitude of the world. "I stand in
      the presence of one to save whose good fame I sacrificed my own—to shield whom from the finger
      of scorn and reproach, I allowed myself to be made a victim! Yes, proud lady of Ravensworth—so
      many years have not elapsed since, in my cold and cheerless garret, in the depth of a winter
      night, you gave birth——"</p>
<p>"Silence, Lydia!" ejaculated Adeline, her lips quivering, and the colour coming and going on
      her cheeks with rapid alternations. "Let us not refer to the past. The present——"</p>
<p>"No," interrupted Lydia, in a solemn tone: "you <hi>can</hi> not—you <hi>shall</hi> not
      deter me from talking of the past. For you, lady, are so highly exalted above
      <pb n="233"/>myself, that it is almost impossible for you to shape the least—the faintest—the
      most remote idea of the depth of misery into which I have been plunged. And yet I pant—I
      long—I feel a burning desire to make you comprehend all I have suffered;—because to my
      acquaintance with you—to my fatal connexion with you at the seminary—may be traced all the
      sorrows—the profound, ineffable woes—the degradations—the terrible afflictions that have since
      marked my career!"</p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>"I will not hear more;—I cannot permit you thus to insult—to upbraid me," faltered Lady
      Ravensworth, her bosom agitated with the most cruel emotions.</p>
<p>"Oh! I have longed for this opportunity to meet you face to face, and tell you all I have
      suffered, and all I now feel!" exclaimed Lydia; "and it is not likely that I will abandon so
      favourable an occasion. No—you have triumphed over me long enough: you have used me as a tool
      when it suited your convenience—and you spurned me when I had ceased to be useful. Though
      maintaining your own outward respectability, honour, and good name upon the wreck of mine, you
      dare to treat me with the blackest ingratitude! Lady Ravensworth, I said that all I have
      endured was traceable to you! When I first met you at the Kensington seminary, I was pure,
      artless, innocent:—you were already initiated in the secrets of intrigue—you were even then,
      at that tender age, a wanton in your heart."</p>
<p>"Lydia—Miss Hutchinson! Oh! my God!" exclaimed Adeline, covering her face with her
      hands.</p>
<p>"Yes—you were already trembling on the verge of dishonour—you were courting seduction and
      all its consequences!" continued the unfortunate woman, upbraiding that proud peeress with a
      remorselessness, a bitterness, and a feeling of delighted vengeance that made her language the
      more terrible and its effect more overwhelming. "I even remember still—oh! how well I
      remember—that you were the first who opened my eyes to the existence of female frailty. Yes—I,
      who went to that school as a teacher, was taught by a pupil! And merciful heavens! what did
      you teach me? You led me on step by step in the path of duplicity and dishonour: you made me
      the companion of your own amours; and we became victims to our seducers on the same day!"</p>
<p>
<pb n="234"/>"Oh! spare me—spare me!" moaned Adeline. "My God! if we were overheard! I should
      be lost—ruined—undone!"</p>
<p>"Rest tranquil on that head:—it does not suit my present purposes to betray you—and I will
      explain my reason shortly. In the meantime," continued Lydia Hutchinson, "I must recall to
      your recollection all those circumstances which led me to sacrifice myself to save you."</p>
<p>"No—no: I remember everything. Say no more, Lydia," cried Lady Ravensworth. "Tell me what
      you require—what I can do for you! Will you have money? or——"</p>
<p>"Peace!—silence!" said Lydia, eyeing the patrician lady with a glance of ineffable scorn.
      "Oh!" she added, almost wildly, "I <hi>have</hi> sold myself for gold;—but never—never may
      that occur again; either bodily or morally! Your ladyship declares you remember all that has
      ever passed between us? Then does your ingratitude become infinitely the more vile and
      contemptible. For when you lay writhing in the agonies of maternity, I was there,—there in
      that cold and cheerless garret,—to minister unto you! And when the lifeless form of your babe
      was discovered concealed amongst my clothes—in my room—and in my box,—I did not turn to the
      school-mistress and say, '<hi>It is not mine: it is Miss Adeline Enfield's!</hi>'—When, too, I
      saw that you were so weak, so feeble, and so suffering that the cold night air would kill you,
      I took your child, and, like a thief, I stole away from the house to sink the corpse in a
      distant pool. For you had said to me, '<hi>Keep my secret, dearest Lydia: the honour of a
       noble family depends upon your prudence!</hi>'—My prudence! Oh! no:—the honour of your family
      depended on the sacrifice of <hi>mine</hi>! And I <hi>did</hi> sacrifice my family to save
      you;—for to all that I did for you may be traced the broken heart of my poor father and the
      assassination of my brother by the hand of the duellist!"</p>
<p>"Oh! spare me—spare me!" again exclaimed Lady Ravensworth. "I have been very ungrateful—very
      unkind; but now, Lydia, I will endeavour to compensate you for all that has passed."</p>
<p>"One being alone can so compensate me, lady," said Miss Hutchinson in a solemn tone; "and
      that being is God! No human power can give me back my poor father or my much-loved brother: no
      human agency can obliterate from my mind those infamies and degradations to which I have been
      subject. What amount of gold can reward me for days of starvation and nights of painful
      wanderings amidst the creatures of crime, without a place to repose my aching, shivering
      limbs? And sometimes, amidst the overwhelming crowd of sorrows that so often drove me to the
      river's bank, or made me pause on the threshold of the chemist's-shop where poison was to be
      procured,—I saw, from time to time, your name mentioned in the newspapers. Oh! what memories
      did those occasions recall! On the very day that you were presented at Court, I had not a
      crust to eat! And twice on that day did I seek the river's brink, whence I turned away
      again—afraid of changing even the horrible certainties of this life's sufferings for the more
      appalling uncertainties of another world."</p>
<p>"Lydia—Lydia, you are killing me!" exclaimed Lady Ravensworth. "Pity me—if not for myself,
      for the sake of the innocent child which I bear in my bosom. Tell me what I can do for
      you—what you require——"</p>
<p>"My views are soon explained," interrupted Lydia. "I demand permission to remain in the
      service of your ladyship."</p>
<p>"Oh! no—no: impossible!" said Adeline, in an imploring tone.</p>
<p>"It must be as I say," observed Lydia, coolly.</p>
<p>"Insolent menial!" ejaculated Lady Ravensworth, losing all command over herself. "Leave
      me—quit this house—go——"</p>
<p>"Do you dare me?" said Miss Hutchinson. "I assured your ladyship ere now that it did not
      suit my present plans to expose you; because I seek to remain in your service. But, if you
      essay again to triumph over me—to spurn me from your presence—I will, remorselessly and
      fearlessly, proclaim the past."</p>
<p>"And who will believe you?" cried Adeline, trembling with mingled alarm and rage: "who will
      believe you? The whole world will denounce you as an impostress. Nay—more: I will punish
      you—yes, I will punish you for your insolence! I will declare that you have attempted to
      extort money from me by means of the most diabolical threats——"</p>
<p>"Think not that I am to be intimidated by your ladyship's miserable subterfuges,"
      interrupted Lydia, who grew if possible more cold and contemptuous in her manner in proportion
      as the proud patrician became excited and indignant. "Are there no witnesses to speak to
      collateral faces? Could Cholmondeley and Dunstable prove nothing against you?"</p>
<p>"They would not raise their voices against a noble lady's fame," said Adeline,
      impatiently.</p>
<p>"They would speak the truth when placed on their oaths in a court of justice," exclaimed
      Lydia, confidently; "for it is to a court of justice that your ladyship threatens to drag me.
      And now, proud peeress, I dare you to the public investigation! Throw open the door—summon
      your domestics—send me to a gaol!—but the day of fair and searching scrutiny must come—and I
      should await in confidence the reply that a British judge and a British jury would give to the
      vile calumny of even a lady so highly exalted as yourself!"</p>
<p>"Enough!" cried Adeline, now almost purple with rage, and every vein on her forehead swollen
      almost to bursting. "I accept your challenge—for I well know that I can rely upon the honour
      of Lord Dunstable and Colonel Cholmondeley. Yes—yes: they would sooner perjure themselves than
      attaint the honour of a peeress!"</p>
<p>"There is one other consideration, then," said Lydia, still completely unruffled: "and
      perhaps the ingenuity of your ladyship will devise a means of frustrating that test also."</p>
<p>"To what do you allude?" demanded Adeline.</p>
<p>"I mean that when you summon your domestics to drag me to a gaol on a charge of extortion,"
      replied Lydia, contemptuously, "that moment do I proclaim the history of the past! Then will
      medical experience speedily prove whether Lady Ravensworth now bears <hi>her first child</hi>
      in her bosom!"</p>
<p>Adeline uttered a faint shriek, and fell back upon the sofa, overwhelmed by this dread
      menace.</p>
<p>That shriek was accompanied by a low moan that seemed to come from the passage outside.</p>
<p>Lydia hastened towards the door; but ere she had half crossed the room, it was thrown
      violently open, and Lord Ravensworth entered the boudoir.</p>
<p>
<pb n="235"/>"My husband!" screamed Adeline, in a frantic tone: then, flinging herself on her
      knees before him, she cried, "Mercy! mercy!"</p>
