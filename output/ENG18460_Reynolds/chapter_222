<head>CHAPTER CCXXI.   THE RETURN TO ENGLAND.</head>
<p>It was on a beautiful morning, in the first week of March, that a large war-steamer passed
      Gravesend, and pursued its rapid way towards Woolwich.</p>
<p>She was a splendid vessel, rigged as a frigate, and carrying twelve carronades. Her hull was
      entirely black, save in respect to the gilding of her figurehead and of her stern-windows; but
      her interior was fitted up in a style of costly magnificence. Large mirrors, chaste carving,
      rich carpets, and soft ottomans gave to the chief cabin the air of a princely
      drawing-room.</p>
<p>On the deck every thing denoted the nicest order and discipline. The sailors performed their
      duties with that alacrity and skill which ever characterise men-of-war's men who are commanded
      by experienced officers; and two marines, with shouldered firelocks, paced the quarter-deck
      with measured steps.</p>
<p>The white sails were all neatly furled; for the gallant vessel was now progressing by the
      aid of that grand power which has achieved such marvellous changes on the face of the earth.
      The tall chimney sent forth a volume of black smoke; and the bosom of the mighty river was
      agitated into high and foam-crested billows by the play of the vast paddle-wheels.</p>
<p>From the summit of the main-mast floated the royal standard of Castelcicala.</p>
<p>And on the deck, in the uniform of a general officer, and with a star upon his breast, stood
      the Marquis of Estella, conversing with his <foreign>aides-de-camp</foreign>.</p>
<p>
<pb n="278"/>At a short distance was Morcar—in plain, private clothes.</p>
<p>Richard was now returning to his native shore—occupying in the world a far more exalted
      position than, in his wildest imaginings, he could ever have hoped to attain. He had left
      England as an obscure individual—a subordinate in a chivalrous expedition—under the authority
      of others:—he came back with a star upon his breast—having achieved for himself a renown which
      placed him amongst the greatest warriors of the age! Unmarked by title, unknown to fame, was
      he when he had bade adieu to the white cliffs of Albion a few months previously:—as the Regent
      of a country liberated by himself—as a Marquis who had acquired nobility by his own great
      deeds, did he now welcome his native clime once more.</p>
<p>Tears of joy stood in his eyes—emotions of ineffable bliss arose in his bosom, as he thought
      of what he had been, and what he now was.</p>
<p>But vanity was not the feeling thus gratified: at the same time, to assert that our hero was
      not proud of the glorious elevation which he had reached by his own merits, would be to deny
      him the possession of that laudable ambition which is an honour to those who entertain it.
      There is, however, a vast distinction between vanity and a proper pride: the former is a
      weakness—the latter the element of moral strength.</p>
<p>Yes: Richard <hi>was</hi> proud—but not unduly so—of the honours which were now associated
      with his name;—proud, because he had dashed aside every barrier that had once seemed
      insuperable between the Princess and himself.</p>
<p>And, oh! he was happy, too—supremely happy; for he knew that when he landed at Woolwich he
      should behold her whom we have before declared to be the only joy of his heart—the charming
      and well-beloved Isabella!</p>
<p>The gallant steamer pursued its way: Erith is passed;—and soon Woolwich is in sight.</p>
<p>And now the cannon roars from the English arsenal: the volumes of white smoke sweep over the
      bosom of the Thames;—the artillery salutes the royal standard of Castelcicala.</p>
<p>The troops are drawn up in front of the barracks to do honour to their heroic
      fellow-countryman, who retains his almost sovereign rank until the moment when he shall resign
      it into the hands of that Prince on whose brow he has come to place a diadem.</p>
<p>It is low water; and the Castelcicalan steamer drops her anchor at some little distance from
      the wharf. Then, under a salute from the cannon of the gallant vessel, the Marquis of Estella
      descends into a barge which has been sent from the arsenal to waft him ashore.</p>
<p>But while he is still at a distance from the wharf his quick eye discerns well-known forms
      standing near the spot where he is to land. There are the Grand-Duke Alberto and the
      Grand-Duchess, attended by the commandant of Woolwich and his staff; and leaning on her
      father's arm, is also the Princess Isabella.</p>
<p>The Grand-Duke is in plain clothes: he has come as it were incognito, and as a friend, to
      receive him to whom he is indebted for that throne which awaits him; and he is moreover
      anxious that all the honours proffered on this occasion shall be acknowledged by him who still
      bears the rank of Regent of Castelcicala.</p>
<p>The barge touches the steps: Richard leaps ashore. He hurries up the stairs—he stands upon
      the wharf; and, while the guard of honour of British soldiers presents arms, he is
      affectionately embraced by the Grand-Duke.</p>
<p>"Welcome—welcome, noble youth!" exclaimed Alberto, straining him to his breast, as if he
      were a dearly beloved son.</p>
<p>"I thank heaven, that you, most gracious sovereign, are pleased with my humble exertions in
      favour of Castelcicalan freedom," replied Markham, whose heart was so full that he could with
      difficulty give utterance to those words.</p>
<p>"Humble exertions do you call them!" cried the Grand-Duke. "At all events they have deserved
      the highest reward which it is in my power to offer."</p>
<p>And, as he thus spoke, Alberto placed the hand of our hero in that of the beauteous
      Isabella, while the Grand-Duchess said in a voice tremulous with joyful emotion, "Yes, dear
      Richard—you are now our son!"</p>
<p>Markham thanked the parents of his beloved with a rapid but expressive glance of the deepest
      gratitude; and he and Isabella exchanged looks of ineffable tenderness, as they pressed each
      other's hand in deep silence—for their hearts were too full to allow their lips to utter a
      syllable.</p>
<p>But those looks—how eloquent were they! They spoke of hopes long entertained—often dim and
      overclouded—but never completely abandoned—and now realized at last!</p>
<p>To appreciate duly the sweets of life, we should have frequently tasted its bitters; for it
      is by the influence of contrast, that the extent of either can be fully understood. Those who
      have been prosperous in their loves,—who have met with no objections at the hands of parents,
      and who have not been compelled to wrestle against adverse circumstances,—are incapable of
      understanding the amount of that bliss which was now experienced by Richard and Isabella. It
      was indeed a reward—an adequate recompense for all the fears they had entertained, the sighs
      they had heaved, and the tears they had shed on account of each other!</p>
<p>And we ourselves, reader, pen these lines with heart-felt pleasure; for there are times—and
      the present occasion is one—when we have almost fancied that our hero and heroine were real,
      living characters, whom we had seen often and known well;—and we are vain enough to hope that
      this feeling has not been confined to our own breast. Yes—we can picture to ourselves, with
      all its enthusiasm, that delightful scene when the handsome young man,—handsomer than ever in
      the uniform which denoted his high rank,—exchanged those glances of ineffable tenderness and
      devoted love with the charming Italian maiden,—more charming than ever with the light of bliss
      that shone in her eyes, made her sweet bosom heave, and brought to her cheeks a carnation glow
      beneath the faint tint of <hi>bistre</hi> which denoted her southern origin without marring
      the transparency of her pure complexion.</p>
<p>And now, the first delights of this meeting over, Richard presented his
       <foreign>aides-de-camp</foreign> to the illustrious family; then, beckoning Morcar towards
      him, he took the gipsy by the hand, saying, "It is to this faithful friend that Castelcicala
      is indebted for the first step in that glorious career which was finally crowned with triumph
      beneath the walls of Montoni."</p>
<p>
<pb n="279"/>"And I, as the sovereign of Castelcicala," returned the Grand-Duke, shaking
      Morcar warmly by the hand, "shall find means to testify my gratitude."</p>
<p>"Your Serene Highness will pardon me," said Morcar, in a firm but deferential manner, "if I
      decline any reward for the humble share I enjoyed in those successes of which his lordship ere
      now spoke. No:—the poor Zingaree has only done his duty towards a master whom he loved—and
      loves," continued Morcar, looking at Richard and dashing away a tear at the same time; "and it
      only remains for him to return to his family—and to his roving life. The sole favour I have to
      ask at the hands of these whom I have now the honour to address, is that when they hear—as
      they often may—the name of <hi>Gipsy</hi> vilified and abused, they will declare their belief
      that there are a few favourable exceptions."</p>
<p>"But is it possible that I can do nothing to serve you?" exclaimed the Duke, struck by the
      extreme modesty and propriety of the Zingaree's words and manner. "Consider how I may
      ameliorate your condition."</p>
<p>"I require nothing, your Highness," answered Morcar, in the same respectful but firm tone as
      before,—"nothing save the favour which I have demanded at your hands. No recompense could
      outweigh with me the advantage which I have received from the contemplation of a character as
      good as he is great—as noble by nature as he now is by name," continued the gipsy, once more
      looking affectionately towards Markham;—"and, from the moral influence of his society and
      example, I shall return to my people a new man—a better man!"</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, Morcar wrung the hand of our hero with a fraternal warmth, and was about
      to hurry away,—leaving all his hearers deeply affected at the words which he had uttered,—when
      Isabella stepped forward, caught him gently by the arm, and said in her sweet musical voice,
      now so tremulously clear,—"But you have a wife, Morcar; and you must tell her that the
      Princess Isabella is her friend! Nor will you refuse to present her with this small token of
      that regard which I proffer her."</p>
<p>Thus speaking, the Princess unfastened a gold chain from her neck, and forced it upon
      Morcar.</p>
<p>"Yes, lady," said the gipsy, "Eva shall accept that gift from you; and she shall pray
      morning and night for your happiness. Nay, more," he added, sinking his voice almost to a
      whisper, "she shall hold up to her son the example of him who is destined, lady, to make you
      the happiest woman upon earth."</p>
<p>With these words, Morcar hurried away—hastened down the steps, leapt into a wherry, and
      directed the rowers to push the boat instantly from the wharf.</p>
<p>When it was some yards distant, Morcar turned his head towards the group upon the quay, and
      waved his hand in token of adieu;—and every member of that group returned his salutation with
      gestures that expressed the kindest feelings towards him.</p>
<p>The party now proceeded to the residence of the commandant, where a splendid
       <foreign>déjeuner</foreign> was served up. Richard sate next to his Isabella, and was
      supremely happy.</p>
<p>"Oh! how rejoiced shall I feel," he whispered to her, "when we can escape from all the
      ceremony which accompanies rank and power, and indulge uninterruptedly in that discourse which
      is so dear to hearts that love like ours! For I have so much to tell you, beloved one; and now
      that all the perils of war and strife are past, I can look with calmness upon that series of
      events of which I was only enabled to send you such slight and rapid accounts. But, believe
      me, Isabella—I would much rather have come back to my native shores unattended by all that
      ostentation and formal observance which have accompanied my return: nevertheless, the high
      office with which I was invested, and the respect due to your father by the one who came to
      announce with befitting ceremony that a throne awaited him, demanded the presence of that
      state and required that public demonstration. You must not, however, imagine, dearest one,
      that a sudden elevation has made me vain."</p>
<p>"I have too high an opinion of your character, Richard," answered Isabella, "to entertain
      such an idea for a single moment. I know that you are not unduly proud; but I, Richard, am
      proud—proud of you!"</p>
<p>"And yet, dear girl," whispered our hero, "all I have done has been but through the
      prompting of your image; and so did I write to you in the evening after that dreadful battle
      which decided the fate of Castelcicala."</p>
<p>"Ah! Richard, you know not the deep suspense which we experienced, and the moments of
      indescribable alarm which <hi>I</hi> felt, during the intervals between the letters announcing
      your several successes," said the Princess. "But all fear has now vanished—and happiness has
      taken its place. When we glance at the past, it will only be to rejoice at those events which
      have prepared so much joy for the future. Do you not remember how often I bade you hope, when
      you were desponding? Oh! heaven has indeed rewarded you, by placing you in so proud a
      position, for all the misfortunes which you have endured."</p>
<p>"Rank and honours were nothing in my estimation," answered Richard, "had they not removed
      the obstacles which separated me from you!"</p>
<p>A domestic now entered and stated that the carriages were in readiness; and the illustrious
      party, having taken leave of the commandant and officers of the garrison, proceeded to the
      mansion at Richmond.</p>
<p>Alberto and Richard Markham were then closeted for some time together. Our hero presented
      his Highness with the official despatches from the Ministers announcing his proclamation as
      Grand-Duke, and inviting him to return to Castelcicala to take possession of the throne.</p>
<p>"Your Serene Highness will not deem me presumptuous," said Richard, when these documents had
      been perused, "in accepting the executive sway immediately after the battle of Montoni. My
      object was to ensure the tranquillity of the country, and to lay the foundation of that
      liberal system of government which I knew to be congenial to the sentiments of your Highness.
      I appointed a Ministry formed of men who had shown their devotion to the Constitutional cause,
      and who were worthy of the confidence thus reposed in them. With respect to the late
      sovereign, Angelo III., I learnt a few hours ere my departure, that he had taken refuge in
      Austria; but in reference to the Grand-Duchess Eliza I have obtained no tidings."</p>
<p>
<pb n="280"/>"I cordially approve of every step you have taken, my dear Richard," replied the
      Grand-Duke: "your conduct has been beyond all praise. I expressed that opinion in the letter
      which I wrote to you, and wherein I informed you that I should wait in England until you came
      in person to announce to me the desire of the Castelcicalans that I should become their
      sovereign. I have, as I told you in my communication, only just recovered from a severe
      illness; but my duty to my country requires that I should return thither as soon as possible.
      In four days I shall embark on board the ship that brought you to England."</p>
<p>"So soon, my lord?" cried Markham, somewhat uneasily.</p>
<p>"I should leave England to-morrow, had I not one solemn but joyful task to accomplish,"
      answered the Duke with a smile. "Fear not, dear Richard, that I shall delay your happiness any
      longer; for if you yourself do not consider the haste indelicate, I purpose to bestow Isabella
      upon you the day after to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Oh! my lord—what happiness!—and what deep gratitude do I owe you!" exclaimed Richard,
      falling upon his knees, and pressing the sovereign's hand to his lips.</p>
<p>"Rise, Richard—rise," said the Grand-Duke: "you owe me no gratitude—for you forget how
      deeply I am your debtor! You have delivered my native land from an odious tyranny—although it
      be of my own relative of whom I am compelled to speak thus severely; and you have given me a
      throne. In return I bestow upon you the dearest of all my earthly treasures—my daughter!"</p>
<p>"And the study of my life shall be her happiness," replied our hero. "But I have one great
      and signal favour to implore of your Highness; and I tremble to ask it—lest you should receive
      my prayer coldly."</p>
<p>"What is there that you should hesitate to ask or that I could refuse to grant?" exclaimed
      the Grand-Duke. "Speak, Richard:—the favour—if favour it be—is already accorded."</p>
<p>"Your Highness must be informed," continued Richard, thus encouraged, "that I have various
      duties to accomplish, which demand my presence for some time in England. I have an old friend
      and his daughter dependant upon me: I must settle them in a comfortable manner, to ensure
      their happiness. There is also a young female named Katherine Wilmot,—whose history I will
      relate to your Highness at a more convenient period,—but to whom I have been in some measure
      left guardian. By letters which I received a few days before my departure, I learnt that she
      is residing at my house, with my old friend and his daughter. It will be my duty to arrange
      plans for the welfare of Katherine. This I should wish to do in concert with Isabella. Lastly,
      my lord, I have the hope of meeting my brother—should he be still alive," added Richard, with
      a sigh. "Your Highness is aware of our singular appointment for the 10th of July, 1843."</p>
<p>The Grand-Duke reflected profoundly for some minutes; and Richard awaited his answer with
      intense anxiety.</p>
<p>"You shall have your will, noble-hearted young man!" at length cried Alberto: "I was wrong
      to hesitate even for a moment; but you will pardon me when you remember that in granting your
      request, I consent to a long—long separation from my daughter."</p>
<p>"But when the time for the appointment with my brother shall have passed," said Richard
      "Isabella and myself will hasten to Montoni; and then, God grant that you may be parted from
      your daughter no more in this life."</p>
<p>"Would it be impossible for you to effect a species of compromise with me in this way?"
      returned Alberto, with a smile. "Provide for those who are dependant on you; and when that
      duty is accomplished, pass at Montoni the interval until the period of the appointment with
      your brother shall demand your return to London."</p>
<p>"I would submit to your Highness this fact," answered Richard,—"that I live in constant hope
      of the reappearance of my brother ere the stated time; and should he seek me in the
      interval—should he be poor or unhappy—should he require my aid or consolation—if I were far
      away——"</p>
<p>"I understand you," interrupted the Grand-Duke. "Be it as you say. Provided Isabella will
      consent," he added, smiling, "you shall remain in England until the autumn of 1843."</p>
<p>"Much as the Princess will grieve to separate from her parents——"</p>
<p>"You think she will be content to stay in this country with you," again interrupted the
      Duke, laughing. "I see that you have already planned every thing in your own way; and both the
      Grand-Duchess and myself are too much pleased with you—too willing to testify our regard for
      you—and too anxious to make reparation for the past," added his Serene Highness significantly,
      "to oppose your projects in the slightest degree. It shall be all as you desire."</p>
<p>"Your Highnesses will then render me completely happy," exclaimed Richard, again pressing
      the Duke's hand to his lips.</p>
<p>Alberto then rang the bell, and commanded the domestic who answered the summons to request
      the presence of the Grand-Duchess and the Princess.</p>
<p>Those illustrious ladies soon made their appearance—Isabella's heart fluttering with a kind
      of joyful suspense, for she full well divined at least <hi>one topic</hi> that had been
      discussed during the private interview of her father and her lover.</p>
<p>The two latter rose as the ladies entered the room.</p>
<p>Then the Grand-Duke took his daughter's hand, and said, "Isabella, our duty towards our
      native land requires that your mother and myself should return thither with the least possible
      delay. But before we depart, we must ensure the happiness of you, beloved child, and of him
      who is in every way worthy of your affections. Thus an imperious necessity demands that the
      ceremony of your union should be speedily accomplished. I have fixed the day after to-morrow
      for your bridal:—but you, dearest Isabel, will remain in England with your noble husband. He
      himself will explain to you—even if he has not already done so—the motives of this
      arrangement. May God bless you, my beloved children! And, oh!" continued the Grand-Duke,
      drawing himself up to his full height, while a glow of honourable pride animated his
      countenance, "if there be one cause rather than another which makes me rejoice in my sovereign
      rank, it is that I am enabled to place this excellent young man in a position so exalted—on an
      eminence so lofty—that none acquainted with his former history shall ever think of associating
      his name with the misfortunes that
      <pb n="281"/>are past! And that he may give even a title to his bride and accompany her to the
      altar with that proper independence which should belong to the character of the husband, it is
      my will to create him <hi>Prince of Montoni</hi>; and here is the decree which I have already
      prepared to that effect, and to which I have affixed my royal seal."</p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>With these words the Grand-Duke took from the table a paper which he presented to our hero,
      who received it on his bended knee.</p>
<p>He then rose: Alberto placed the hand of Isabella in his; and the young lovers flew into
      each other's arms.</p>
<p>The parents exchanged glances of unfeigned satisfaction as they witnessed the happiness of
      their charming daughter and of him whom she loved so faithfully and so well.</p>
<p>Dinner was shortly announced; and around the table were smiling faces gathered that
      evening.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock Richard took his departure alone in the Grand-Duke's carriage; for he had
      transferred his own <foreign>aides-de-camp</foreign> to the service of their sovereign.</p>
<p>But when he bade farewell to Isabella on this occasion, it was with the certainty of seeing
      each other again in a short time; and they inwardly thanked heaven that their meeting was no
      longer clandestine, and that their attachment was at length sanctioned by the parents of the
      charming maiden.</p>
