<head>CHAPTER CCXXVII.   COLDBATH FIELD'S PRISON.</head>
<p>Return we now to the Resurrection Man,—that incarnate fiend whose crimes were so numerous,
      and all of so black a dye.</p>
<p>Firmly bound, and guarded by three officers, who kept their bludgeons in their hands, the
      miscreant saw that all resistance was vain: he accordingly threw himself back in the cab that
      was bearing him to prison, and gave way to his saturnine reflections.</p>
<p>"If I had only thought that Richard Markham would have accompanied that young girl
      Katharine,"—it was thus he mused,—"a very different song would have been sung. But I knew that
      he was married only a week ago, and never dreamt that <hi>he</hi> would leave his pretty wife
      to poke his nose into Banks's crib. What an infernal oversight on my part! And now—here I am,
      regularly lumbered; and all the swag arising from Kate Wilmot's business is in the hands of
      that canting sneak Banks! Damnation to Richard Markham! I shall swing for this if I don't take
      precious good care. He'll swear to two different attempts on his life—one at the old house
      near Bird-cage Walk, and t'other at Twig Folly. What a cursed—ten times cursed fool I was to
      let myself tumble into a snare in this way! Some one else will find the gold that I have saved
      up; and when I shall be cold and stiff under the pavement of Newgate, others will riot on my
      treasure! But, no—it can't happen in that way: it's impossible that my time is come
      yet—impossible! I shall escape somehow or another;—I <hi>must</hi> escape—I <hi>will</hi>
      escape! But how? That question is the devil of the difficulty. Never mind—escape I will;—so I
      mustn't be down-hearted!"</p>
<p>These and numberless other reflections, in which despondency and hope alternately asserted a
      predominant influence, occupied the mind of Anthony Tidkins as the cab proceeded rapidly
      through Bethnal-Green and Shoreditch,—then along Old Street—up the Goswell Road—through
      Northampton Square—and lastly along Exmouth Street, in its way to Coldbath Fields' Prison.</p>
<p>At length the cab turned into the short road which forms the approach, within the wooden
      railings in front of the governor's dwelling, to the great gates of the gaol,—those gates over
      which may be read in large letters, "<hi>Middlesex House of Correction</hi>."</p>
<p>A shudder crept over even the iron frame of Anthony Tidkins, as those huge portals, towering
      high above the cab which now drew up close to them, seemed to frown upon him like a colossal
      genius of evil amidst the obscurity of night.</p>
<p>Benstead leapt from the cab, and knocked loudly at the gate.</p>
<p>The iron din was responded to by gloomy echoes from the courts inside.</p>
<p>In a few minutes heavy chains fell, and the wicket was opened by a man bearing a
      lantern.</p>
<p>Benstead whispered to him for a few moments; and Tidkins was conducted into a little lobby
      on the left hand.</p>
<p>The turnkey, who had opened the gate, then proceeded to the governor's house, which was
      close by within the walls; and, after an absence of ten minutes, he returned with an
      affirmative answer to Benstead's request that the prisoner might be retained in custody in
      that gaol until a magistrate should otherwise dispose of him.</p>
<p>The turnkey accordingly led the way through the wicket of a strong iron grating, across a
      yard where a watchman armed with a loaded blunderbuss was stationed, and thence into a
      building, up the narrow stone staircase of which the party proceeded, until they reached a
      cell, where the Resurrection Man, who was now released from his bonds, was left.</p>
<p>Tidkins threw himself upon the bed and soon fell asleep. He was not an individual to whom
      danger or even the prospect of death could bring remorse: darkness and solitude had no alarms
      for him;—and, thus, in spite of the profound vexation he experienced at his present
      predicament, he yielded to the influence of fatigue and slept soundly.</p>
<p>On the following morning a bowl of gruel and a piece of bread were supplied for his
      breakfast; and he washed at the common sink belonging to that department of the gaol.</p>
<p>At ten o'clock Benstead and two other officers arrived, placed manacles upon him, and
      conveyed him to a cab, in which they seated themselves with him.</p>
<p>In about half an hour the Resurrection Man was
      <pb n="304"/>placed in the dock at the Lambeth Street Police Office.</p>
<p>The Prince of Montoni, attended by his solicitor, Mr. Dyson, had entered the court a few
      moments before; and the magistrate, upon being made acquainted with his name and rank,
      immediately threw down the newspaper, saying, "It is by no means necessary that your Highness
      should enter the witness-box: your Highness will do me the honour to accept a seat on the
      bench; and the clerk will take down your Highness's evidence at your Highness's leisure. Make
      room there, for his Highness: usher, clear the way for his Highness."</p>
<p>Scarcely able to conceal his disgust at this fulsome behaviour of the magistrate, the Prince
      coldly said, "I thank you, sir, for your politeness: but I cannot consent to receive a favour
      which would not be shown to a poor and obscure individual."</p>
<p>The magistrate turned very red, and bowed meekly, but without repeating his offer.</p>
<p>The case was then entered upon.</p>
<p>The Prince detailed the particulars of that adventure at the Resurrection Man's house in the
      neighbourhood of the Bird-cage Walk, with which the reader is already acquainted: and he also
      related the subsequent circumstances connected with the blowing up of the den—a deed which had
      cost several persons their lives, and which (added Markham) was no doubt perpetrated by
      Tidkins himself.</p>
<p>When these depositions were taken down, the Prince was about to enter upon his second
      charge—namely, the attack made upon him at Twig Folly: but the magistrate thought the first
      case had better be previously completed, and resolved upon remanding the prisoner for three
      days, in order to allow time to procure the evidence of those surviving policemen who had
      witnessed the fate of their brother-officers on the occasion of the blowing up of the
      house.</p>
<p>Tidkins was accordingly remanded to Coldbath Fields' Prison; and the Prince of Montoni
      immediately repaired in his carriage to Holmesford House—the particulars of which visit have
      been detailed in the preceding chapter.</p>
<p>On his return to the gaol, Tidkins was allowed to walk for an hour in the tread-wheel yard
      nearest to the entrance of the prison. There are several tread-mill yards in Coldbath Fields'
      gaol, alike for males and females; but we specify the particular yard in which the
      Resurrection Man was permitted to take exercise, because it has relation to a certain event
      which is to follow. It is also of the wheel in this yard that the fan, or balance, is seen
      above the wall near the south-western angle of the prison, by persons passing through Coldbath
      Square.</p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>The tread-wheel is an enormous drum, or cylinder, with ranges of steps all round it, at a
      distance of about a foot and a half from each other. Between forty and fifty persons can work
      on the wheel at one time. It moves slowly round towards the prisoners placed upon it; and thus
      the step on which the foot stands descends, while the next step presents itself. A platform is
      built to half the height of the wheel; and from this platform the prisoners step upon the
      wheel itself. They support themselves by a railing, and their weight keeps the wheel in
      motion. Thus they <hi>must</hi> sink <hi>with all their weight</hi>, as they work on that
      rotatory engine of diabolical torture. The action is that of going up stairs, without,
      however, actually rising higher; for every step so reached sinks beneath the feet, and the
      prisoner is compelled to get upon the next one in its descent. Those prisoners who wait their
      turns to go on, sit upon the platform; and the task-master in the yard directs the intervals
      of labour and those of rest.</p>
<p>And upon this engine of torture, as we ere now denominated the tread-mill, not only boys of
      twelve years of age are placed, but even women!</p>
<p>Yes:—in this civilised country,—in this land where novelists and poets celebrate the
      chivalrous devotion which should be paid to the softer sex,—in this great city, where the
      pseudo-saints blurt
      <pb n="305"/>forth their nauseating hypocrisy at Exeter Hall, and swindle the charitable of
      alms for the purpose of improving the condition of savages thousands of miles off, while there
      is such an awful want of instruction and moralising elements at home,—in the very centre of
      the English capital are women subjected to the ferocious torture of the tread-mill!</p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>The food is scanty;—and yet the labour thus forced upon the poor sickly, half-starved
      wretches, is horribly severe.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of the crimes which send prisoners to Coldbath Fields, are larcenies and
      robberies caused by dire penury and pinching want: the miserable beings are half-famished
      already when they enter that gaol; but they are nevertheless retained in something closely
      bordering on that state of constant hunger, while the hardest possible labour is required from
      them!</p>
<p>Remember, reader, that we do not wish idleness to prevail in a prison. It is just the place
      where habits of industry should be inculcated. We therefore approve of the system of workshops
      established in Coldbath Fields: we admire the oakum-room—the room, too, where shoe-making is
      taught—and that department of the prison in which rugs are manufactured for a wholesale
      warehouse that contracts for the purchase of the same.</p>
<p>But we abhor torture—we detest cruelty; and the tread-wheel is alike a torture and a
      cruelty!</p>
<p>It makes the heart bleed in the breast of the visitor to the female-division of Coldbath
      Fields, to behold women nursing their babes at one moment, and then compelled to deliver their
      sucklings to the care of their fellow-prisoners, while they themselves repair to take their
      turn upon the tread-mill!</p>
<p>Talk of the despotism of Turkey, Russia, Austria, or Prussia,—talk of the tyranny of those
      countries where the will of one man is a law, be it for good or evil,—we solemnly and
      emphatically cry, "<hi>Look at home</hi>!"</p>
<p>Flogging in the Army and Navy, private whipping in prisons, semi-starvation in workhouses
      and gaols, and the tread-wheel,—these are the tortures which exist in this land of boasted
      civilisation—these are the instances in which our rulers seek to emulate the barbarism of past
      ages and the wanton inhumanity of foreign autocrats!</p>
<p>We must in justice observe that Coldbath Fields'
      <pb n="306"/>Prison is kept in a most cleanly state. Perhaps the ventilation is not as perfect
      as it might be; and certainly the stone cells must be awfully cold in winter, for there are no
      means of imparting to them any artificial warmth. But as far as wholesome cleanliness is
      concerned, there is not the slightest ground whereon to raise a cavil against the
      establishment.</p>
<p>The discipline maintained in that gaol is on the Silent System. There it no separation—no
      classification—during the day; but the plan of silence prevents the corruption of the only
      moderately bad by the inveterately wicked. At night each individual sleeps apart in a
      cell.</p>
<p>Anthony Tidkins walked about the yard, affecting a moody and sullen air of indifference, but
      in reality catching with rapid glance every point of the buildings around him—every object
      within the range of his vision; so that he committed to memory a complete map of that division
      of the prison where he was now taking exercise.</p>
<p>Having walked an hour, he was re-conducted to his room where a bowl of pease-soup with a
      slice of bread was given to him for his dinner. In the evening he was supplied with a basin of
      gruel and another piece of bread, and was then locked in for the night.</p>
