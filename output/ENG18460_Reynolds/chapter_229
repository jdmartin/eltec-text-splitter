<head>CHAPTER CCXXVIII.   A DESPERATE ACHIEVEMENT.</head>
<p>It was, as the readers must remember, in the middle of the month of March when these events
      occurred. At that season of the year the sun sets at about six o'clock; and it is consequently
      dark at seven.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man was no sooner left undisturbed for the night, when he commenced the
      arduous and almost desperate attempt of an escape from the prison.</p>
<p>Taking off his coat, he tore open the lining of the collar, and drew forth two files
      scarcely larger than watch-springs, and made of steel of an equally fine temper.</p>
<p>"Thanks to my precaution in never moving away from home without such tools as these about
      me!" he exclaimed, as he bent the files almost double to try their elasticity, and then drew
      them over one of his nails to test the keenness of their teeth.</p>
<p>It is not an uncommon circumstance for the police-magistrates at the offices not within the
      City of London to remand prisoners accused of heinous crimes to Coldbath Fields' gaol; and as
      such persons cannot, according to the law, be deemed guilty until they be declared so by a
      jury, they are not lodged in the common dark cells allotted to misdemeanants or criminals
      sentenced to imprisonment within those walls. There is a room specially appropriated to the
      use of untried individuals who are sent to Coldbath Fields. That chamber is capable of holding
      four or five beds, and has two windows looking upon the prison-grounds.</p>
<p>Those windows are, however, secured by strong iron bars outside the casements, which are
      made to open for the purpose of airing the room in the day-time.</p>
<p>Tidkins had already carefully examined these bars, and had calculated to a nicety the exact
      time which it would occupy him to remove two of them by means of his files.</p>
<p>It was seven o'clock when he commenced his labour; and as the clock of the church on
      Clerkenwell Green struck eleven, that portion of his task was accomplished.</p>
<p>"True to a minute!" muttered the Resurrection Man to himself, with a low chuckle of triumph:
      "I reckoned on four hours to do it in!"</p>
<p>But his fingers were cut and lacerated with the process: he, however, assuaged the pain by
      greasing the flesh with the remainder of the gruel left in his bowl.</p>
<p>The next proceeding was to tear his bedding into slips, wherewith to form a rope; and this
      was accomplished in about half an hour.</p>
<p>The window was not very high from the ground; and he did not dread the descent:—but the moon
      was shining brightly—and he knew that watchmen, carrying fire-arms, kept guard in the
      prison-grounds.</p>
<p>He looked up at the lovely planet of the night, whose chaste splendour was at that moment
      blessed by so many travellers alike upon the land and on the ocean; and he uttered a fearful
      imprecation against its pure silvery lustre.</p>
<p>But he did not hesitate many minutes: his case was desperate—so was his character.</p>
<p>"Better receive an ounce of lead in the heart than dance on nothing in six weeks or so," he
      said to himself, as he fastened the rope to the bar which stood next to the place of the two
      that he had removed.</p>
<p>Then he passed his legs through the window; and clinging by his hands and feet, slid slowly
      and safely down the rope.</p>
<p>He was now in the grounds belonging to the prison; but the high wall, that bounded the
      enclosure, separated him from the street.</p>
<p>Cautiously and noiselessly did he creep along, beneath the shade of the building—directing
      his steps towards the tread-wheel yard in which he had been permitted to take exercise, as
      above stated.</p>
<p>Suddenly the noise of footsteps and of voices fell upon his ears; and those ominous sounds
      were approaching.</p>
<p>"Perdition!" thought the Resurrection Man, as he crouched up close beneath the building: "I
      could have managed one—I could have sprung upon him—strangled him in a moment. But
       two—<hi>two</hi>——"</p>
<p>And he ground his teeth with rage.</p>
<p>"And so you was at the Old Bailey to-day?" said one of the watchmen to his companion, as
      they advanced round that part of the prison.</p>
<p>"Yes: it was my half-holiday," was the reply; "and so I thought I might as well go and hear
      the trial of that young Holford, you know, who shot at the Queen. The jury had a good deal of
      trouble at coming to a verdict; but at last they acquitted him on the ground of insanity."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the first speaker: "then he's let out again?"</p>
<p>"Deuce a bit of that!" exclaimed his companion. "The judge ordered him to be detained till
      the royal pleasure should be known; and so he'll get sent to Bedlam for the rest of his
      life."</p>
<p>"And d'ye think he's mad? did he look mad?"</p>
<p>"Not he! He's no more mad than me. He seemed a little gloomy and sulky—but not mad. The only
      time he showed any interest in the proceedings, was when a witness called Jem Cuffin was
      examined; and this chap said all he could in
      <pb n="307"/>favour of the youngster, although he wasn't able to deny that he saw him fire at
      the Queen and Prince Albert. But the best of it was, this Jem Cuffin proved that the pistols
      wasn't loaded at all. Holford did not, however, know <hi>that</hi> when he fired them. So the
      young feller has managed to get board and lodging for life; and Jem Cuffin, who is a returned
      transport, it seems, and had been in custody for some time, was discharged on a full pardon
      granted by the Home Secretary."</p>
<p>"It must have been an interesting trial," observed the first speaker.</p>
<p>"Yes," said his companion; "but I'll tell you what will be more interesting still—and that
      is the trial of Tony Tidkins, whenever it comes on. Lord! what things that feller <hi>has</hi>
      done in his time! Talk of Jack Sheppard, or Dick Turpin, or any of the old criminals—why,
      they're nothing at all compared with this Tidkins. Ah! some rum things will come out when he
      goes up afore the nobs at the Old Bailey!"</p>
<p>The two men had stopped within half a dozen yards of the place where the Resurrection Man
      was crouched up in the deep shade of the building; and every word of the above conversation
      met his ears. In spite of the peril of discovery which now seemed inevitable, the miscreant
      experienced a momentary feeling of pride and triumph as he listened to the observations which
      were made concerning himself.</p>
<p>"Well, I must go round t'other way," said one of the watchmen, after a short pause: "we
      should get blowed up if we was found together—'specially talking in a prison on the <hi>silent
       system</hi>."</p>
<p>This was meant as a joke; and so the two men chuckled at it.</p>
<p>Tidkins also chuckled within himself; because he had just learnt that the watchmen intended
      to separate, and that consequently only one would pass him. He was still menaced with a
      fearful peril; but he considered it to be only one half so great as it had seemed a few
      moments previously.</p>
<p>Midnight was now proclaimed by the iron tongue of Clerkenwell Church; and the two watchmen
      parted—one retracing his steps round the building; and the other slowly advancing towards
      Tidkins.</p>
<p>"I must spring upon him and throttle him in a moment," thought the Resurrection Man,
      clenching his fingers as if they already held the intended victim's neck in their iron
      grasp.</p>
<p>But Providence saved the miscreant from that additional crime:—the watchman struck abruptly
      away from the neighbourhood of the building, and walked towards the boundary wall.</p>
<p>His back was now turned upon Tidkins, who lost no time in availing himself of this
      unexpected relief from the danger which had threatened him. In fact, the very circumstance of
      the two watchmen having advanced so close to him in each other's company,—which circumstance
      had menaced him with a detection that seemed unavoidable,—now proved most advantageous to his
      scheme; for as he hurried rapidly on towards the first tread-wheel yard, he passed between the
      two watchmen, each of whom was retreating farther from him, the one by retracing his steps
      round the building, and the other by lounging towards the wall.</p>
<p>Thus, while their backs were turned upon him, he gained in safety the tread-wheel yard where
      he had taken exercise, and every point of which he had accurately committed to memory.</p>
<p>His movements were now executed with the rapidity of one who had well weighed and
      pre-considered them.</p>
<p>Taking from a corner a gardener's basket, which he had previously noticed there, and which
      was used to convey the potatoes that were dug up in the prison-grounds, he turned it bottom
      upwards against a low building, or out-house, which abutted with a shelving slate roof against
      the high wall. By means of the basket, he raised himself upon this roof—crept up on it—and
      with one nimble spring upwards was enabled to catch at the
      <foreign>chevaux-de-frise</foreign>, or revolving iron spikes, which were fixed near the top
      of the wall, and which thus hung over the out-house.</p>
<p>Careless of the wounds which he received from the <foreign>chevaux-de-frise</foreign>, he
      scrambled over them, and gained the top of the wall.</p>
<p>The wall was much too high to permit him to drop into the street with any chance of escaping
      a broken limb. This he had previously reflected upon; and he now commenced the desperate feat
      of walking along the summit of that lofty wall—with a bright moon shining above, and the
      almost positive certainty of being observed by the watchmen inside the prison.</p>
<p>To increase the personal danger incurred by this extraordinary undertaking, the wall is
      irregular on the top, breaking into sudden and abrupt falls towards the south-western angle,
      and then rising with elevations equally abrupt from that point to the north-western angle.</p>
<p>This peculiarity of structure is caused by the unevenness of the ground on which the entire
      establishment with all its enclosures stands.</p>
<p>The journey along the top of the walls was not even a short one. The object of the
      Resurrection Man was to reach the houses in Guildford Place, which join the prison-wall on the
      eastern side. The point where he ascended was nearly at the middle of the southern wall; but
      between him and the south-eastern angle stood the gates and the governor's house, which he
      could not pass. He therefore had to make a circuit comprising nearly half the southern
      wall—all the western wall—all the northern wall—and then a part of the eastern wall;—and this
      in the largest prison in England!</p>
<p>It was a desperate venture: but—as we have before said—Tidkins was a desperate man—and his
      case was also desperate!</p>
<p>Fortune often aids the unworthy; and she did so upon this occasion.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the Resurrection Man proceeded twenty yards along the wall, when the
      moon—hitherto so lovely—became suddenly obscured; and a huge black cloud swept over its
      face.</p>
<p>Tidkins cast one rapid glance upwards; and his heart leapt within him, as he said to
      himself, "It will be dark like this long enough for my purpose."</p>
<p>On he went—walking upright, and rapidly—with scarcely an unusual effort to balance himself
      upon that giddy height,—and stooping only when he reached any of those abrupt descents or
      ascents in the structure of the wall which we have ere now noticed.</p>
<p>And now he has gained—safely gained—the north-western angle: he is pursuing his way along
      the wall which looks upon Calthorpe Street.</p>
<p>At the slightest signal of alarm he is prepared to risk his life by leaping from the
      wall.</p>
<p>
<pb n="308"/>But no one observes him: it is now quite dark;—he is far away from that part of
      the prison where the watchmen walk;—and the street beneath is empty.</p>
<p>Here and there are lights in the upper windows of the adjacent houses: he can almost see
      into those rooms, above the level of which he is placed.</p>
<p>Looking to his right, he perceives the dark outlines of the prison-buildings, between which
      and the northern wall, whereon he is now walking, there is a considerable interval, the
      intermediate space being occupied by the gaol-gardens.</p>
<p>His heart beats joyfully—triumphantly: he has gained the north-eastern angle!</p>
<p>A glance to the left shows him the lights of Bagnigge Wells: before him are those of
      Wilmington Square; and to his right is Guildford Place.</p>
<p>He felt that he was beyond the reach of danger; and so exhilarating was his joy, that a
      momentary dizziness seized upon him—and he nearly fell over within the precincts of the
      gaol.</p>
<p>But recovering his balance by an extraordinary exertion, he planted his feet more firmly
      than ever on the wall, and continued his walk along the dizzy height.</p>
<p>He was now again in danger of discovery; for he had reached that part of the eastern wall
      against which the buildings and tread-wheel yards of the females' department stood, and in the
      immediate vicinity of which a watchman was stationed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the houses in Guildford Place were near; and their back premises abutted
      against the outer side of the wall along which he was now proceeding.</p>
<p>"One minute more of that dark cloud upon the moon—and I am safe!" he said to himself, as he
      cast a rapid glance upwards.</p>
<p>But, no—the cloud passes!</p>
<p>It has passed;—and the bright moon suddenly bursts forth with a flood of silver light.</p>
<p>Almost at the same instant, a loud voice raises an alarm within the precincts of the gaol:
      the sharp crack of a blunderbuss is heard—and a bullet whistles past the Resurrection Man,
      whose dark form, as seen by the watchman near the females' department, stands out in strong
      relief against the moon-lit sky.</p>
<p>The cry of the watchman is echoed by other voices on the prison side of the wall; and
      Tidkins mutters a terrible curse as he hurries forward.</p>
<p>But his courage does not fail him:—no—he is determined to sell his life as dearly as
      possible!</p>
<p>In less than a minute after the watchman within the enclosure had raised the alarm, the
      Resurrection Man reached the backs of the houses in Guildford Place;—and now the clear
      moonlight was of the utmost service to him, in enabling him to execute his movements with
      security and caution.</p>
<p>He lowered himself from the prison-wall to the roof of an out-house, and thence alighted in
      a yard attached to a dwelling.</p>
<p>The back-door of the house was locked and bolted inside: but this was a small obstacle in
      the way of one who had just escaped from the Middlesex House of Correction.</p>
<p>Unable to waste time by proceeding with caution, and compelled to risk the chance of
      alarming the inhabitants of the dwelling, the desperate man threw himself with all his
      strength against the door, which broke inwards with a loud crash.</p>
<p>The noise was followed by ejaculations of alarm in the house; footsteps were heard overhead;
      windows were thrown open—and the cry of "Thieves!" echoed along the street.</p>
<p>Tidkins paused not to reflect:—he dashed through the house—along the passage to the front
      door, the bolts of which he drew back in a moment. The key was in the lock:—every thing now
      appeared to favour the escape of the Resurrection Man!</p>
<p>The front-door was opened in a few moments, just as the inmates of the dwelling were rushing
      down the stairs.</p>
<p>But when they reached the passage, the door closed violently behind the intruder who had
      caused their alarm.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man was safe in the open street; and he knew that he had a good start of
      the prison watchmen, who would have to make a considerable circuit from the vicinity of the
      females' department to the gates, and from the gates round the south-eastern angle, ere they
      could reach the point from which he was now departing.</p>
<p>Swift as an arrow he scud up Guildford Place—turned to the right—and slackened his pace only
      when he had passed through Wilmington Square. He gained the City Road, along which he walked
      somewhat leisurely towards Finsbury—well aware that his pursuers would not think of looking
      for him in a wide and open thoroughfare, but would rather prosecute their searches in the
      narrow lanes and low districts in the immediate neighbourhood of the gaol.</p>
<p>His object was to gain his den in Globe Town; for not a word had transpired during his
      examination before the magistrate at Lambeth Street, to show that the police had any clue to
      his place of abode; and he felt certain that Banks would not have betrayed him. The
      undertaker, he knew, was too deeply concerned in many of his plots and schemes to risk a
      general smash of the whole gang, by making any unpleasant revelations.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man struck from the City Road into Old Street, and speedily reached
      Shoreditch.</p>
<p>As he passed down one of the horrible lanes which lie behind Shoreditch Church, he observed
      the door of a public-house to be open. He was well aware of the flash character of the place,
      but did not happen to be known by the people who kept it.</p>
<p>He entered this low boozing-ken, ordered a glass of something at the bar, and inquired for
      the evening paper. It was immediately handed to him; for all flash houses of that description
      take an evening as well as a morning journal, that their customers may receive the earliest
      intelligence of each day's Police or Old Bailey proceedings—matters in which the generality of
      them are very frequently interested.</p>
<p>Tidkins turned to the most recent Police Intelligence, and found his own case duly reported.
      Nothing, however, was said in that or any other department of the paper, which tended to
      excite an alarm lest his house in Globe Town had been discovered or any of his accomplices in
      his various crimes had been traced.</p>
<p>Thus reassured, he drank off the contents of his glass, and then recollected that he had no
      money in his pocket to pay for it. All he had about him when he was arrested, had been taken
      from him, according to custom, on his removal to Coldbath Fields.</p>
<p>
<pb n="309"/>Scarcely had this new embarrassment presented itself to his mind, when the door
      of the tap-room opened, and a man came forth. To Tidkins's infinite relief it proved to be the
      Buffer, who started when he saw his old friend at liberty.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Man placed his finger upon his lip; and the Buffer instantly checked the
      ejaculation of astonishment which had risen to his tongue.</p>
<p>The trifling debt incurred for the liquor was immediately settled by the Resurrection Man's
      friend; and the precious pair left the boozing-ken together.</p>
<p>As they walked along towards Globe Town, Anthony Tidkins related the particulars of his
      escape, at which the Buffer was monstrously delighted. Then, in reply to the Resurrection
      Man's questions, the other stated that he had seen Banks on the previous afternoon, and that
      no inquiries of a suspicious nature had been made at that individual's abode.</p>
<p>When they reached the door of the Resurrection Man's house in Globe Town, the Buffer took
      leave of his friend, with a promise to call in the course of the day and bring the morning's
      newspapers.</p>
<p>Tidkins was overjoyed when he again set foot in his back room on the first floor: and
      finding some gin in the cupboard, he celebrated his escape and return with a copious dram.</p>
<p>He did not immediately retire to bed, although he was sadly fatigued and bruised by the
      achievements of the night; but, taking down a bundle of keys from a shelf, he paid a visit to
      the subterranean department of his establishment.</p>
<p>The moment he placed the key in the lock of the private door up the narrow alley, he uttered
      a curse, adding, "This lock has been tried—tampered with! I know it—I could swear to it: I can
      tell by the way that the key turns!"</p>
<p>And the perspiration ran down his countenance:—for he trembled for the safety of his
      treasure!</p>
<p>With feverish impatience he opened the door, and entered that part of his strangely-built
      house.</p>
<p>Having obtained a light, a new circumstance of alarm struck him: the door of the back room
      was standing wide open!</p>
<p>"And I can swear that I closed it the last time I ever came here!" he cried aloud. "Some one
      has been to this place;—and that some one must be Banks! The sneaking scoundrel! But he shall
      suffer for it."</p>
<p>With a perception as keen as that of the North American Indian following the trail of a
      fugitive foe, did the Resurrection Man examine the floor of the room; and his suspicions that
      some one had been thither were confirmed by the appearance of several particles of damp dirt,
      which had evidently been left by the feet of an intruder within the last few hours.</p>
<p>"Worse and worse!" thought the Resurrection Man. "And, by Satan! the trap has been
      raised!"</p>
<p>This was evident; for the brick which covered the iron ring in the masonry of the chimney,
      had not been restored to its place.</p>
<p>"I could not have left it so!" cried Tidkins, aloud: "no—it is impossible! Some one
       <hi>has</hi> been here!"</p>
<p>With almost frantic impatience he raised the trap, and descended into the subterranean.</p>
<p>Entering one of the cells,—not the same whence the Rattlesnake had stolen his treasure,—he
      raised a stone, and then almost shrank from glancing into the hollow thus laid open.</p>
<p>But mastering his fears,—those fears which owned the influence of avarice far more than that
      of danger or of crime,—he held the lantern over the hole, and plunged his eyes into its
      depth.</p>
<p>"Safe!—all safe—by God!" he exclaimed, as four or five canvass bags met his view.</p>
<p>Then, in order to convince himself of the reality of the presence of his treasure, he opened
      the bags one after the other, and feasted his sight upon their glittering contents.</p>
<p>"It can hardly be Banks who has been here," he mused to himself, as he restored the bags to
      their place of concealment, and then rolled the stone back into its setting: "nothing could
      escape the keenness of his scent! He would have pulled up all the pavement sooner than have
      missed what he came to look for. And then, too, he is not the man to leave the brick out of
      its place, so as to show the secret of the stone-trap to any other curious intruder that might
      find his way here. No—no: Master Banks would pay a second and a third visit to this place, if
      he felt sure of finding any thing concealed here; and he would leave every thing close and
      snug after each search. But some one <hi>has</hi> been here! Unless—and I might have done such
      a thing as to forget to replace the brick,—I <hi>might</hi> have done so;—and yet it is barely
      possible!" continued Tidkins, in deep perplexity, and almost as much alarmed as Robinson
      Crusoe was upon discovering the print of the human foot upon the sand of his island. "Then
      there is that damp mud, too—and the door that was open—and the lock that has been tampered
      with! But suppose the mud came from my own shoes the last time I was here? the place is very
      damp—and it mayn't have got dry. It might also have been myself that left the door open;—and
      as for the lock—it is an old one, and may begin to work badly. Besides—I remember—the last
      time I was here, I was in a deuce of a hurry: it was just before I went down to Banks's to see
      him settle that job with Kate Wilmot. So, after all—my fears may be all idle and vain!
      However, I shall send for Banks presently, when the Buffer comes again; and I'll precious soon
      tell by his sneaking old face whether he has been here, or not, during my absence!"</p>
<p>Thus reasoning against the feasibility of his fears,—as men often do in cases of doubt and
      uncertainty, and when they are anxious to persuade themselves of the groundlessness of their
      alarms,—Tidkins left the subterranean, and returned to his chamber, where he immediately went
      to bed.</p>
<p>But his fears <hi>were</hi> well founded: some one <hi>had</hi> visited the subterranean
      during the hours while he himself was occupied in escaping from Coldbath Fields' Prison.</p>
<p>That intruder was not, however, Banks—nor any one of the Resurrection Man's accomplices in
      crime.</p>
