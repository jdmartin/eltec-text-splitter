<head>CHAPTER CCLVI.   ELIZA SYDNEY AND ELLEN.—THE HOSPITAL.</head>
<p>Eliza Sydney had just sate down to breakfast, when a cab drove hastily up to the door of the
      villa, and Ellen alighted from the vehicle.</p>
<p>The moment she entered the parlour, Eliza advanced to meet her, saying, "My dearest friend,
      I can divine the cause of this early visit;—and, indeed, had you not come to me, it was my
      intention to have called upon you without delay."</p>
<p>Ellen heard these remarks with unfeigned surprise.</p>
<p>"Sit down, and compose yourself," continued Eliza, "while I explain to you certain matters
      which it is now proper that you should know."</p>
<p>"Heaven grant that you have no evil tidings to communicate!" exclaimed Ellen, taking a chair
      near her friend, upon whose countenance she turned a look of mingled curiosity and
      suspense.</p>
<p>"Be not alarmed, dear Ellen," answered Eliza: "my object is to serve and befriend you—for I
      know that at this moment you require a friend!"</p>
<p>"Oh! indeed I do," cried Ellen, bursting into tears. "But is it possible that you are
      acquainted with——"</p>
<p>"With all your history, my dear friend," interrupted Eliza.</p>
<p>"<hi>All</hi> my history!" ejaculated Ellen.</p>
<p>"Yes—all. But let me not keep you in suspense. In a few words let me assure you that there
      is no important event of your life unknown to me."</p>
<p>"Then, my dearest friend," cried Ellen, throwing herself into Eliza's arms, "you are aware
      that my husband is lying in a common hospital—and that it breaks my heart to think of the
      depth into which he has fallen from a position once elevated and proud!"</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Eliza, returning the embrace of friendship; "I learnt that sad event last
      evening—a few hours after it occurred; and hence my intention to visit you this morning. But I
      am better pleased that you should have come hither—because we can converse at our ease. You
      must know, my dear friend, that a few years ago I received some wrong at the hands of him who
      has now every claim upon the sympathy of the charitable heart."</p>
<p>"You speak of my husband, Eliza?" cried Ellen. "Were <hi>you</hi> also wronged by him? Oh!
      how many, alas! can tell the same tale!"</p>
<p>"He attempted to wrong me, Ellen—but did not succeed," answered Eliza, emphatically: "twice
      he sought to ruin me—and twice Providence interposed to save me. Pardon me, if I mention these
      facts; but they are necessary to justify my subsequent conduct in respect to him."</p>
<p>"Oh! ask me not to pardon aught that you may do or may have done!" ejaculated Ellen: "for
      your goodness of heart is an unquestionable guarantee for the propriety of your actions."</p>
<p>"You flatter me, my dear friend," said Eliza; "and yet God knows how pure have been my
      intentions through life! Let us not, however, waste time by unnecessary comment: listen rather
      while I state a few facts which need be concealed from you no longer. Aware, then, that he who
      has so long passed by the name of George Montague Greenwood——"</p>
<p>"Ah!" cried Ellen, with a start: "you know <hi>that</hi> also?"</p>
<p>"Have patience—and you shall soon learn the extent of my information upon this subject,"
      said Eliza. "I was about to inform you that a knowledge of the character of him whom we must
      still call George Greenwood, gave me the idea of adopting some means to check, if not
      altogether to counteract, those schemes by which he sought alike to enrich himself
      dishonourably and to gratify his thirst after illicit pleasure. During the first year of my
      residence in Castelcicala I sent over a faithful agent to enter, if possible, the service of
      Mr. Greenwood. He succeeded, and——"</p>
<p>"Filippo Dorsenni!" exclaimed Ellen, a light breaking in upon her mind: "Oh now I comprehend
      it all!"</p>
<p>"And are you angry with me for having thus placed a spy upon the actions of your husband?"
      inquired Eliza, in a sweet tone of conciliation.</p>
<p>"Oh! no—no," cried Ellen: "on the contrary, I rejoice! For doubtless you have saved him from
      the commission of many misdeeds!"</p>
<p>"I have indeed, Ellen," was the reply; "and amongst them may be reckoned your escape from
      his snares, when he had you carried away to his house in the country."</p>
<p>
<pb n="413"/>"Yes—that escape was effected by the aid of Filippo," said Ellen; "and the same
      generous man also assisted me to save the life of Richard on that terrible night when his
      enemies sought to murder him near Globe Town."</p>
<p>"Well, then, my dear friend," observed Eliza, "you see that the presence of Filippo in
      England effected much good. I may also mention to you the fact that when Richard accompanied
      General Grachia's expeditionary force to Castelcicala, I was forewarned of the intended
      invasion by means of a letter from Filippo: and that letter enjoined me to save the life of
      him who has since obtained so distinguished a renown. Filippo had heard you speak in such
      glowing colours of Richard's generous nature and noble disposition, that he was induced to
      implore me to adopt measures so that not a hair of his head might be injured. And, oh! when I
      consider all that has occurred, I cannot for one moment regret that intervention on my part
      which saved our friend in order to fulfil such glorious destinies!"</p>
<p>"But how was it, my dearest Eliza," asked Ellen, "that you discovered those secrets which so
      especially regard <hi>me</hi>?"</p>
<p>"In one word," replied the royal widow, "Filippo overheard that scene which occurred between
      yourself and Greenwood when you restored him the pocket-book that you had found; and on that
      occasion you called him by a name which was not <hi>George</hi>!"</p>
<p>"Ah! I remember—yes, I remember!" cried Ellen, recalling to mind the details of that
      memorable meeting to which Eliza Sydney alluded.</p>
<p>"Thus Filippo learnt a great secret," continued the royal widow; "and in due time it was
      communicated to me, by whom it has been retained inviolate until now. Nor should I have ever
      touched upon the topic with you, had not this accident which has occurred to your husband
      rendered it necessary for me to show you that while I am prepared to assist you in aught that
      may concern his welfare, I am only aiding the virtuous intentions of a wife towards him whom
      she has sworn at the altar to love and reverence."</p>
<p>Ellen again threw herself into the arms of the generous-hearted widow, upon whose bosom she
      poured forth tears of the most profound gratitude.</p>
<p>"And now," said Eliza, "can you tell me in which manner I can serve you—or rather your
      husband?"</p>
<p>"My first and most anxious wish," returned Ellen, "is that he should be removed, as soon as
      possible, to some place where tranquillity and ease may await him. Sincerely—sincerely do I
      hope that his heart may have been touched by recent misfortunes——"</p>
<p>"Yes—and by the contemplation, even from a distance, of that excellent example which the
      character of Richard affords," added Eliza, emphatically.</p>
<p>"And yet," continued Ellen, mournfully, "I know his proud disposition so well, that he will
      not permit his secret to be revealed one minute before the appointed time: he will not allow
      himself to be conveyed to that place where he would be received with so much heart-felt
      joy!"</p>
<p>"This is your conviction?" said Eliza, interrogatively.</p>
<p>"My firm conviction," answered Ellen.</p>
<p>"Then listen to my proposal," exclaimed the widow, after a brief pause. "Filippo shall be
      instructed to hire some neatly furnished house in the neighbourhood of Islington; and thither
      may your husband be removed so soon as the medical attendants at the hospital will permit. It
      is not necessary for him to know that any living soul save yourself, Ellen, has interfered to
      procure him those comforts which he shall enjoy, and to furnish which my purse shall supply
      you with ample means."</p>
<p>"Dearest friend," exclaimed Ellen, "it was your kind counsel that I came to solicit—and you
      have afforded me the advice most suitable to my own wishes. But, thanks to the generosity of
      Richard towards my father and myself, I possess sufficient resources to ensure every comfort
      to my husband. And, oh! if he will but consent to this project, I can see him often—yes,
      daily—and under my care he will speedily recover!"</p>
<p>"Then delay not in repairing to the hospital to visit and console him," said Eliza, "and
      Filippo, whom I expect to call presently, shall this very day seek a comfortable abode to
      receive your husband when his removal may be effected with safety."</p>
<p>Ellen expressed the deepest gratitude to her friend for the kind interest thus manifested in
      behalf of herself and her husband; and, having taken an affectionate leave of the royal widow,
      she repaired to Saint Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>
<p>The clock of the establishment was striking eleven when Ellen alighted from the cab at the
      entrance in Duke Street; and, having inquired her way to the Casualty Ward, she crossed the
      courtyard towards the department of the building where her husband lay.</p>
<p>Ascending a wide staircase, she reached a landing, where she accosted a nurse who was
      passing from one room to another at the moment.</p>
<p>Ellen intimated her request to see the gentleman who was brought in with a broken leg on the
      preceding afternoon.</p>
<p>"Well, ma'am," answered the nurse, "you couldn't possibly have applied to a better person;
      for I'm at the head of that ward, and I shall be most happy to obleege you. But surely a
      charming young lady like you will be afeard to go into a place where there's a many male
      inwalids all in bed?"</p>
<p>"The gentleman to whom the accident has happened, is very dear to me," said Ellen, in a low
      tone, and with tears trickling down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Ah! poor dear thing—his sister, may be?" observed Mrs. Jubkins.</p>
<p>"Yes—I am his sister," replied Ellen, eagerly catching at the hint with which the curiosity
      of the woman furnished her.</p>
<p>"Then I'm sure, my pretty dear," said the nurse, "there's no harm in seeing your brother.
      But stay—just step into this room for a moment—there's only one old woman in it,—while I go
      into the male Casualty and see that every thing's proper and decent to receive such a sweet
      creatur' as you are."</p>
<p>Thus speaking, Mrs. Jubkins threw open the door of a small room, into which she showed
      Ellen, who availed herself of that opportunity to slip a guinea into her hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jubkins expressed her thanks by a nod, and hurried away with the assurance that she
      should not be many minutes absent.</p>
<p>When the door had closed behind the nurse, Ellen
      <pb n="414"/>surveyed, with a rapid glance, the room in which she now found herself.</p>
<p>It was small, but exquisitely clean and well ventilated. There were four beds in the place,
      only one of which was occupied.</p>
<p>Obeying a mechanical impulse, rather than any sentiment of curiosity, Ellen glanced towards
      that couch which was tenanted by an invalid; but she started with mingled surprise and horror
      as her own bright eyes encountered the glassy ones that stared at her from the pillow.</p>
<p>For a moment she averted her head as if from some loathsome spectacle; but again she looked
      towards the bed, to satisfy herself whether the suspicion which had struck her were correct or
      not.</p>
<p>Yes—that idea was indeed well-founded; for there—in a dying state, with her hideous
      countenance rendered ghastly by disease—lay the old hag of Golden Lane!</p>
<p>A faint attempt at a smile relaxed the rigid expression of the harridan's death-like face,
      as she recognised Ellen; and her toothless jaws moved for a moment as if she were endeavouring
      to speak:—but she evidently had not strength to utter a word.</p>
<p>All on a sudden the boundless aversion which the young lady entertained towards the wretch,
      became changed into a sentiment of deep commiseration; and Ellen exclaimed involuntarily, "Oh!
      it is terrible to die thus—in a hospital—and without a friend!"</p>
<p>The bed shook as if with a convulsive shudder on the part of the hag, whose countenance,
      upturned towards Ellen, wore an expression which—intelligible amidst all the ghastly ugliness
      of that face—seemed to say, "Is it possible that <hi>you</hi> can feel pity for
      <hi>me</hi>?"</p>
<p>Ellen understood what was passing in the old woman's mind at the moment; and, advancing
      nearer to the couch, she said in a tone tremulous with emotions, "If you seek forgiveness at
      my hands for any injury which your pernicious counsels and your fatal aid ever did me, I
      accord it—Oh! God knows how willingly I accord it! For, though after my fall I long remained
      callous to a sense of virtue, and acknowledged only the fear of shame as the motive for
      avoiding farther frailty, yet since I became a wife—for I <hi>am</hi> a wife," she added
      proudly,—"holier and better thoughts have taken up their abode in my soul; and good examples
      have restored my mind to its former purity! Thus, then, I can forgive thee with sincerity—for
      the injuries and wrongs I have endured through thy counsels, are past and gone!"</p>
<p>At that moment the door opened, and Mrs. Jubkins returned to the room.</p>
<p>Ellen cast another glance of forgiveness upon the hag and hurried into the passage.</p>
<p>"What ails that old woman?" she asked, in a low tone, when the door had closed behind
      herself and the nurse.</p>
<p>"It seems, by all I can hear, Miss," replied the hospital nurse, "that the old woman had
      saved up a little money; and as she lived in a low neighbourhood, I 'spose it got wind amongst
      the thieves and housebreakers. At all events a burglar broke into her place one night, about a
      week ago; and because she resisted, he beat her in such a cruel way that all her ribs was
      broke and one of her thighs fractured—so I 'spose he must have thrown her down and jumped on
      her. The rascal got clean off with all the money she had; and a policeman going his rounds,
      saw that the house where she lived had been broken open. He went in, and found the old
      creatur' nearly dead. She was brought here; and when she had recovered a little, she mumbled a
      few words, telling just what I've now told you. Oh! yes," added the nurse, recollecting
      herself, "and she also said who the thief was; for when questioned about that point, she was
      just able to whisper a dreadful name—so dreadful that it haunts me in my dreams."</p>
<p>"What was that name which sounded so terrible?" asked Ellen, with some degree of
      curiosity.</p>
<p>"<hi>The Resurrection Man</hi>," replied the nurse, shuddering visibly. "And no sooner had
      the old woman said those shocking words, than she lost her voice altogether, and has never had
      the use of it since. We put her into that room to keep her quiet; but she can't live out the
      week—and her sufferings at times are quite horrible."</p>
<p>As she uttered these words Mrs. Jubkins opened a door at the end of the passage, and
      conducted Ellen into the room where her husband was lying.</p>
<p>For a moment the young lady recoiled from the appearance of that large apartment, filled
      with beds in which there lay pillowed so many ghastly faces; but this emotion was as
      evanescent as the most rapid flash of lightning.</p>
<p>And now, firm in her purpose to console and solace him whom she had taught herself to love,
      she followed the nurse towards the bed where the patient lay,—looking neither to the right nor
      to the left as she proceeded thither.</p>
<p>Greenwood's countenance was very pale; but the instant the lovely features of his wife burst
      upon his view, his eyes were lighted up with an expression of joy such as she had never seen
      them wear before, and the glow of which appeared to penetrate with a sensation of ineffable
      bliss into the very profundities of her soul.</p>
<p>"Ellen, this is very kind of you," said Greenwood, tears starting on his long silken lashes,
      as he pressed her hand warmly in his own.</p>
<p>"Do not use the word <hi>kind</hi>, my dearest husband," whispered Ellen: "in coming hither
      I not only perform a duty—but should also fulfil it cheerfully, were it not for the sad
      occurrence which caused the visit."</p>
<p>"Be not alarmed, Ellen," murmured Greenwood: "there is no danger—a temporary inconvenience
      only! And yet," he added, after a brief pause, "to me it is particularly galling just at the
      very time when I was struggling so hard—so very hard—to build up my fallen fortunes, and
      prepare——"</p>
<p>"Oh! do not grieve on that head!" whispered Ellen: "abandon, I implore you, those ambitious
      dreams—those lofty aspirations which have only led you astray! Do you suppose that, were you
      to acquire an amount of wealth far greater than that which blesses <hi>him</hi>, he would
      welcome you with one single smile the more joyous—with one single emotion the more blissful?
      Oh! no—far from it! And believe me when I assert my conviction that it would be his pride to
      place you with his own hand, and by means of his own resources, in a position to enable you to
      retrieve the past——"</p>
<p>"Ellen, speak not thus!" said Greenwood, impatiently.</p>
<p>
<pb n="415"/>"Well, my dearest husband, I will not urge the topic," answered the beautiful
      young woman, smiling with a plaintive and melancholy sweetness as she leant over his couch.
      "But you will permit me to implore that when you are enabled to leave this place, you will
      suffer yourself to be conveyed to a dwelling which I—your own wife—will provide for you, and
      where I shall be enabled to visit you every day—as often, indeed, as will give you pleasure?
      And then—oh! then we shall be happy together—and you can prepare your mind to encounter that
      day which, I fear, you now look upon to be one of trial, but which I must tutor you to
      anticipate as one of joy and pleasure as yet unknown."</p>
<p>Greenwood made no answer; but he meditated profoundly upon those loving words and touching
      assurances that his beauteous wife breathed in his ear.</p>
<p>"Yes," continued Ellen, "you will not refuse my prayer! This very day will I seek a
      comfortable abode—in the northern part of Islington, if possible—so that I may soon be with
      you every day. For I am possessed of ample resources to accomplish all that I propose; and you
      know, dearest husband, that every thing which I can call my own is lawfully yours. You
      smile—oh! now I thank you, because you listen to me with attention; and I thank God also,
      because he has at length directed your heart towards me, who am your wife, and who will ever,
      ever love you—dearly love you!"</p>
<p>"Ellen," murmured Greenwood, pressing her hand to his lips, "I should be a monster were I to
      refuse you any thing which you now demand of me; and, oh! believe me—I am not so bad as
       <hi>that</hi>!"</p>
<p>Sweet Ellen, thou hast conquered the obduracy of that heart which was so long the abode of
      selfishness and pride;—thou hast subdued the stubborn soul of that haughty and ambitious
      man:—thine amiability has triumphed over his worldliness;—and thou hast thy crowning reward in
      the tears which now moisten his pillow, and in the affectionate glances which are upturned
      towards thee!</p>
<p>And Ellen departed from the hospital where her angelic influence had wrought so marvellous a
      change,—departed with a bosom cherishing fond hopes and delicious reveries of happiness to
      come.</p>
<p>In the course of that very day Filippo engaged a house in the northern part of Islington;
      and Ellen superintended, with a joyful heart, the preparations that were made during the
      ensuing week to render the dwelling as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p>At length she had the pleasure,—nay, more than pleasure—the ineffable satisfaction of
      welcoming her husband to that abode which, if not so splendid nor so spacious as the mansion
      he had once occupied in Spring Gardens, was at least a most grateful change after the cold and
      cheerless aspect of a hospital.</p>
