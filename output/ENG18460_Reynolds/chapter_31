<head>CHAPTER XXXI. EXPLANATIONS.</head>
<p>WITH the greatest forethought and the best taste, Louisa had forwarded to her mistress the
      most simple and unassuming garb which the boudoir contained, amongst its miscellaneous
      articles of female attire.</p>
<p>Dressed in the garments which suited her sex, Eliza was a fine and elegant woman—above the
      common female height, yet graceful in her deportment, and charming in all her movements. Her
      shoulders possessed that beautiful slope, and the contours of her bust were modelled in that
      ample and voluptuous mould, which form such essential elements of superb and majestic
      loveliness.</p>
<p>Although so long accustomed to masculine attire, there was nothing awkward—nothing
      constrained in her gait; her step was free and light, and her pace short, as if that
      exquisitely turned ankle, and long narrow foot had never known aught save the softest silken
      hose, and the most delicate prunella shoes.</p>
<p>In a word, the beauty of Eliza Sydney was of a lofty and imposing order;—a pale high brow,
      melting hazel eyes, a delicately-chiselled mouth and nose, and a form whose matured expansion
      and height were rendered more commanding by its exquisite symmetry of proportions.</p>
<p>The morning journals published an account of the extraordinary attempt at fraud detected at
      the Bank on the previous day; and the utmost curiosity was evinced by an immense crowd that
      had collected to obtain a view of the prisoners, especially the female one, as they alighted
      from the separate cabs in which they were conveyed to the Mansion House for re-examination.
      Eliza's countenance was flushed and animated, and the expression of her eyes denoted profound
      mental excitement: Stephens was ghastly pale:—the lawyer maintained a species of sullen and
      reserved composure.</p>
<p>The police-office at the Mansion House was crowded to excess. Sir Peter Laurie presided; and
      on his right hand was seated the Earl of Warrington. Mr. Pakenham was also present, in company
      with the solicitor of the Bank of England.</p>
<p>The moment the prisoners appeared in the dock, Eliza in a firm tone addressed the
      magistrate, and intimated her intention of making the most ample confession, in accordance
      with her promise of the preceding day. She was accommodated with a chair, and the chief clerk
      proceeded to take down the narrative which detailed the origin and progress of this most
      extraordinary conspiracy.</p>
<p>Alas! that so criminal a tale should have been accompanied by the music of that flute-like
      voice; and that so foul a history should have emanated from so sweet a mouth. Those words of
      guilt which trembled upon her lips, resembled the slime of the snail upon the leaf of the
      rose.</p>
<p>When the confession of Eliza Sydney was fully taken down, and signed by her, the Earl of
      Warrington's solicitor entered into a statement which placed the magistrate in full possession
      of the facts of the case.</p>
<p>We shall now proceed to acquaint our readers with the complete history formed by these
      revelations.</p>
<p>"The late Earl of Warrington was a man of eccentric and peculiar habits. An accident in his
      infancy had rendered his person deformed and stunted his growth; and, being endowed with
      tender feelings and acute susceptibilities, he could not bear to mingle in that society where
      his own physical defects were placed in strong contrast with the fine figures, handsome
      countenances, and manly forms of many of his aristocratic acquaintances. He possessed a
      magnificent estate in Cambridgeshire; and in the country seat attached to that domain did he
      pass the greater portion of his time in solitude.</p>
<p>"The bailiff of the Warrington estate was a widower, and possessed an only child—a daughter.
      Letitia Hardinge was about sixteen years of age when the Earl first took up his abode in
      Cambridgeshire, in the year 1790. She was not good looking; but she possessed a mild and
      melancholy expression of countenance, and an amiability of disposition, which rendered her an
      object of interest to all who knew her. She was fond of reading; and the library at the
      neighbouring mansion was always open to her inspection.</p>
<p>"The reserved and world-shunning Earl soon became attracted towards Letitia Hardinge. He
      found that she possessed a high order of intellect; and he delighted to converse with her. By
      degrees he experienced a deep attachment towards a being whose society often relieved the
      monotonous routine of his life; and the gratitude which Letitia entertained towards the Earl
      for his kindness to her, soon partook of a more tender feeling. She found herself interested
      in a nobleman of high rank and boundless wealth, who was compelled to avoid the great world
      where the homage shown to his proud name appeared to him to be a mockery of his physical
      deformity; she ministered to him with all a woman's devotedness, during a tedious and painful
      malady which seized upon him shortly after his arrival in Cambridgeshire; and at length her
      presence became as it were necessary to him.</p>
<p>"They loved: and although no priest blessed their union, they entertained unalterable
      respect and affection for each other. That dread of ridicule which had driven the Earl from
      society, and which with him was a weakness amounting almost to folly, prevented the
      solemnization of his nuptials with the woman he loved. She became pregnant:
      <pb n="085"/> and the day that made the Earl the father of a daughter, robbed him of the
      mother of that innocent child who was thus born in sin!</p>
<p>"Letitia Hardinge, the Earl's natural child, grew up in health and beauty. The father was
      dotingly attached to her, and watched her growth with pride and adoration. She was sixteen
      years of age, when Frederick, the Earl's nephew and heir presumptive to the title and vast
      estates of the family, arrived in Cambridgeshire to pay his respects to his uncle, on his
      emancipation from college. The young man's parents had both died in his infancy, and he was
      entirely dependant upon the Earl.</p>
<p>"Letitia Hardinge passed as the niece of the Earl of Warrington. Frederick was acquainted
      with the real history of the young lady; and, previous to his arrival at the mansion of his
      uncle, he was not prepared to treat her with any excess of civility. He was brought up in that
      aristocratic school which looks upon pure blood as a necessary element of existence, and as
      alone entitled to respect. But he had not been many days in the society of Miss Hardinge,
      before his ideas upon this subject underwent a complete change, and he could not help admiring
      her. Admiration soon led to love:—he became deeply enamoured of her!</p>
<p>"The Earl beheld this attachment on his part, and was rejoiced. An union between the two
      cousins would secure to his adored daughter that rank and social position, which he was most
      anxious for her to occupy. As the wife of the heir presumptive to the richest Earldom in the
      realm, her origin would never be canvassed nor thought of. But Letitia herself returned not
      the young man's love. By one of those extraordinary caprices, which so often characterise even
      the strongest female minds, she had taken a profound aversion to her suitor; and being of a
      high and independent disposition, not even the dazzling prospect of wealth and title could
      move her heart in his favour.</p>
<p>"There was a farmer upon the Earl's estate, of the name of Sydney. He had a son whose
      Christian name was Stanford—a handsome but sickly youth, and by no means comparable to the
      polished and intellectual Frederick. Nevertheless, Letitia entertained for this young man an
      affection bordering upon madness. The Earl discovered her secret, and was deeply afflicted at
      his daughter's predilection. He remonstrated with her, and urged the necessity of conquering
      her inclinations in this respect. It was then that she showed the temper and the spirit of
       <hi>a spoiled child</hi>, and declared that she would follow the dictates of her own mind in
      preference to every other consideration. The Earl swore a most solemn oath, <hi>that if she
       dared marry Stanford Sydney, neither she nor her husband should ever receive one single
       shilling from him</hi>!</p>
<p>"Reckless of this threat—indifferent to the feelings of that father who had cherished her so
      fondly, the perverse girl one morning abandoned the paternal home, and fled with Stanford
      Sydney, on whom she bestowed her hand. The blow came like a thunderbolt upon the head of the
      old Earl. He was naturally of a delicate and infirm constitution; and this sudden misfortune
      proved too much for his debilitated frame. He took to his bed; and a few hours before his
      death he made a will consistent with his oath. He left all his property to his nephew, with
      the exception of forty-one thousand pounds—the amount of his savings since he had inherited
      the title. This will ordained that his nephew should enjoy the interest of this sum; but that,
      should Letitia bear a male child to Stanford Sydney, such issue should, upon attaining the age
      of twenty-one years, receive as his portion the above sum of forty-one thousand pounds. Such
      was the confidence which the old Earl possessed in his nephew, that he left the execution of
      this provision to him. It was also enacted by that will, that should the said Letitia die
      without bearing a son to the said Stanford Sydney; or should a son born of her die previously
      to attaining his twenty-first year, then the sum alluded to should become the property of
      Frederick.</p>
<p>"The old man died, a prey to the deepest mental affliction—indeed, literally
      heart-broken—shortly after making this will. Frederick, who was honour and integrity
      personified, determined upon fulfilling all the instructions of his uncle to the very
      letter.</p>
<p>"The fruits of the union of Stanford Sydney and Letitia Hardinge were a daughter and a son.
      The name of the former was Eliza: that of the latter was Walter. Eliza was a strong and
      healthy child; Walter was sickly and ailing from his birth. Shortly after the birth of Walter,
      the father, who had long been in a deep decline, paid the debt of nature. Letitia was then
      left a widow, with two young children, and nothing but a small farm for her support. Her high
      spirit prevented her from applying to the Earl of Warrington—the man whose love she had
      slighted and scorned; and thus she had to struggle with poverty and misfortune in rearing and
      educating her fatherless progeny. The farm which she tenanted was situated in Berkshire,
      whither she and her husband had removed immediately after the death of the father of Stanford.
      This farm belonged to a gentleman of the name of Stephens—a merchant of respectability and
      property, in the City of London.</p>
<p>"It was in the year 1829 that Robert Stephens appeared at the farm-house, to announce the
      death of his father and his inheritance of all the landed property which had belonged to the
      deceased. The widow was considerably in arrears of rent: Stephens inquired into her condition
      and prospects, and learnt from her lips her entire history—that history which, from motives of
      disappointed pride, she had religiously concealed from her children. She was well aware of the
      provisions of the late Earl's will; but she had determined not to acquaint either Eliza or
      Walter with the clause relative to the fortune, until the majority of the latter. Towards
      Stephens she did not manifest the same reserve, the revelation of that fact being necessary to
      convince him that she possessed good perspective chances of settling those long arrears, which
      she was in the meantime totally unable to liquidate.</p>
<p>"Robert Stephens was immediately attracted towards that family. It was not the beauty of
      Eliza which struck him:—he was a cold, calculating man of the world, and considered female
      loveliness as mere dross compared to sterling gold. He found that Walter was an amiable and
      simple-hearted youth, and he hoped to turn to his own advantage the immense inheritance which
      awaited the lad at his majority. He accordingly treated Mrs. Sydney with every indulgence,
      forgiving her the arrears already accumulated, and lowering her rent in future. He thus gained
      an immense influence over the family; and when a sudden malady threw the widow upon her
      death-bed, it was to Stephens that she recommended her children.</p>
<p>"Stephens manifested the most paternal attention towards the orphans, and secured their
      unbounded
      <pb n="086"/> gratitude, attachment, and confidence. But his designs were abruptly menaced in
      an alarming manner. The seeds of consumption, which had been sown by paternal tradition in the
      constitution of Walter, germinated with fatal effect; and on the 14th of February, 1831, he
      surrendered up his spirit.</p>
<p>"Scarcely had the breath left the body of the youth, when Stephens, by that species of magic
      influence which he had already begun to exercise over Eliza, induced her to assume her
      brother's garb; and she was taught to believe, even by the very side of his corpse, that
      immense interests were connected with her compliance with his wish. An old woman was the only
      female attendant at the farm-house; and she was easily persuaded to spread a report amongst
      the neighbours that it was the daughter who was dead. Eliza did not stir abroad: Stephens
      managed the funeral, and gave instructions for the entry in the parish register of the burial
      of Eliza Sidney; and, as Eliza immediately afterwards repaired to the Villa at Clapton, the
      fraud was not suspected in the neighbourhood of the Berkshire farm.</p>
<p>"Stephens duly communicated the deaths of Mrs. Sydney and Eliza to the Earl of Warrington,
      and obtained an introduction to this nobleman. He called occasionally in Grosvenor Square,
      during this interval of four years and nine months which occurred between the reported death
      of Eliza and the 26th of November, 1835; and invariably took care to mention not only that
      Walter was in good health, but that he was residing at the Villa. His lordship, however, on no
      occasion expressed a wish to see the young man; for years had failed to wipe away the
      impression made upon Frederick's mind by the deceased Letitia Hardinge!</p>
<p>"When Stephens introduced the disguised Eliza to the nobleman, as Walter Sydney, upon the
      morning of the 26th of November, the Earl entertained not the least suspicion of fraud. He
      knew that Stephens was the son of an eminent merchant, and that he was well spoken of in
      society; and he was moreover anxious to complete a ceremony which only recalled painful
      reminiscences to his mind. Thus, so far as his lordship was concerned, the deceit was managed
      with the most complete success; and there is no doubt that the entire scheme might have been
      carried out, and the secret have remained for ever undiscovered, had not a private warning
      been communicated in time to the Bank of England."</p>
<p>Such was the complete narrative formed by the statement of the Earl of Warrington, through
      his solicitor, and the confession of Eliza Sydney. The history excited the most extraordinary
      interest in all who heard it; and there was a powerful feeling of sympathy and commiseration
      in favour of Eliza. Even Lord Warrington himself looked once or twice kindly upon her.</p>
<p>The examination which elicited all the facts detailed in the narrative, and the evidence
      gone into to prove the attempt to obtain possession of the money at the Bank of England,
      occupied until four o'clock in the afternoon; when the magistrate committed Robert Stephens,
      Hugh Mac Chizzle, and Eliza Sydney to Newgate, to take their trials at the approaching session
      of the Central Criminal Court.</p>
