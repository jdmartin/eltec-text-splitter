<head>CHAPTER IV. THE TWO TREES.</head>
<p>IT was between eight and nine o'clock, on a delicious evening, about a week after the events
      related in the preceding chapters, that two youths issued from Mr. Markham's handsome, but
      somewhat secluded dwelling, in the northern part of the environs of London, and slowly
      ascended the adjacent hill. There was an interval of four years between the ages of these
      youths, the elder being upwards of nineteen, and the younger about fifteen; but it was easy to
      perceive by the resemblance which existed between them that they were brothers. They walked at
      a short distance from each other, and exchanged not a word as they ascended the somewhat steep
      path which conducted them to the summit of the eminence that overlooked the mansion they had
      just left. The elder proceeded first; and from time to time he clenched his fists, and knit
      his brows, and gave other silent but expressive indications of the angry passions which were
      concentrated in his breast. His brother followed him with downcast eyes, and with a
      countenance denoting the deep anguish that oppressed him. In this manner they arrived at the
      top of the hill, where they seated themselves upon a bench, which stood between two young ash
      saplings.</p>
<p>For a long time the brothers remained silent; but at length the younger of the two suddenly
      burst into tears, and exclaimed, "Oh! why, dearest Eugene, did we choose this spot to say
      farewell—perhaps for ever?"</p>
<p>"We could not select a more appropriate one, Richard," returned the elder brother. "Four
      years ago those trees were planted by our hands; and we have ever since called them by our own
      names. When we were wont to separate, to repair to our respective schools, we came hither to
      talk over our plans, to arrange the periods of our correspondence, and to anticipate the
      pursuits that should engage us during the vacations. And when we returned from our seminaries,
      we hastened hither, hand-in-hand, to see how our trees flourished; and he was most joyous and
      proud whose sapling appeared to expand the more luxuriantly. If ever we quarrelled, Richard,
      it was here that we made our peace again; and, seated upon this bench, we have concocted plans
      for the future; which, haply, will never now be realised!"</p>
<p>"You are right, my dear brother," said Richard, after a pause, during which he appeared to
      reflect profoundly upon Eugene's words; "we could not have selected a better spot. Still it is
      <pb n="008"/> all those happy days to which you allude that now render this moment the more
      bitter. Tell me, must you depart? Is there no alternative? Can I not intercede with our
      father? Surely, surely, he will not discard one so young as you, and whom he has loved—must
      still love—so tenderly?"</p>
<p>"Intercede with my father!" repeated Eugene, with an irony which seemed extraordinary in one
      of his tender age; "no, never! He has signified his desire, he has commanded me no longer
       <hi>to pollute his dwelling</hi>—those were his very words, and he shall be obeyed."</p>
<p>"Our father was incensed, deeply incensed, when he spoke," urged Richard, whose voice was
      rendered almost inaudible by his sobs; "and to-morrow he will repent of his harshness towards
      you."</p>
<p>"Our father had no right to blame me," said Eugene violently; "all that has occurred
      originated in his own conduct towards me. The behaviour of a parent to his son is the element
      of that son's ruin or success in after life."</p>
<p>"I know not how you can reproach our father, Eugene," said Richard, somewhat reproachfully,
      "for he has ever conducted himself with tenderness towards us; and since the death of our dear
      mother——"</p>
<p>"You are yet too young, Richard," interrupted Eugene impatiently, "to comprehend the nature
      of the accusation which I bring against my father. I will, however, attempt to enable you to
      understand my meaning, so that you may not imagine that I am acting with duplicity when I
      endeavour to find a means of extenuation, if not of justification, for my own conduct. My
      father lavished his gold upon my education, as he also did upon yours; and he taught us from
      childhood to consider ourselves the sons of wealthy parents who would enable their children to
      move with éclat in an elevated sphere of life. It was just this day year that I joined my
      regiment at Knightsbridge. I suddenly found myself thrown amongst gay, dissipated, and wealthy
      young men—my brother officers. Many of them were old acquaintances, and had been my companions
      at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. They speedily enlisted me in all their pleasures
      and debaucheries, and my expenditure soon exceeded my pay and my allowance. I became involved
      in debts, and was compelled to apply to my father to relieve me from my embarrassments. I
      wrote a humble and submissive letter, expressing contrition for my faults, and promising to
      avoid similar pursuits in future. Indeed, I was wearied of the dissipation into which I had
      plunged, and should have profited well by the experience my short career of pleasure and folly
      had enabled me to acquire. I trembled upon that verge when my father could either ruin or save
      me. He did not reply to my letter, and I had not courage to seek an interview with him. Again
      did I write to him: no answer. I had lost money at private play, and had contracted debts in
      the same manner. Those, Richard, are called <hi>debts of honour</hi>, and must be paid in full
      to your creditor, however wealthy he may be, even though your servants and tradesmen should be
      cheated out of their hard-earned and perhaps much-needed money altogether. I wrote a third
      time to our father, and still no notice was taken of my appeal. The officers to whom I owed
      the money lost at play began to look coldly upon me, and I was reduced to a state of
      desperation. Still I waited for a few days, and for a fourth time wrote to my father. It
      appears that he was resolved to make me feel the inconvenience of the position in which I had
      placed myself by my follies; and he sent me no answer. I then called at the house, and he
      refused to see me. This you know, Richard. What could I do? Driven mad by constant demands for
      money which I could not pay, and smarting under the chilling glances and taunting allusions of
      my brother officers, I sold my commission. You are acquainted with the rest. I came home,
      threw myself at my father's feet, and he spurned me away from him! Richard, was my crime so
      very great? and has not the unjust, the extreme severity of my father been the cause of all my
      afflictions?"</p>
<p>"I dare not judge between you," said Richard mildly.</p>
<p>"But what does common sense suggest?" demanded Eugene.</p>
<p>"Doubtless our father knows best," returned the younger brother.</p>
<p>"Old men are often wrong, in spite of their experience—in spite of their years," persisted
      Eugene.</p>
<p>"My dear brother," said Richard, "I am afraid to exercise my judgment in a case where I
      stand a chance of rebelling against my father, or questioning his wisdom; and, at the same
      time, I am anxious to believe everything in your justification."</p>
<p>"I knew that you would not comprehend me," exclaimed Eugene, impatiently. "It is ridiculous
      not to dare to have an opinion of one's own! My dear brother," he added, turning suddenly
      round, "you have been to Eton to little purpose: I thought that nearly as much of the world
      was to be seen there as at Sandhurst. I find that I was mistaken."</p>
<p>And Eugene felt and looked annoyed at the turn which the conversation had taken.</p>
<p>Richard was unhappy, and remained silent.</p>
<p>In the meantime the sun had set; and the darkness was gradually becoming more intense.</p>
<p>Suddenly Eugene grasped his brother's hand, and exclaimed, "Richard, I shall now
      depart!"</p>
<p>"Impossible!" cried the warm-hearted youth: "you will not leave me thus—you will not abandon
      your father also, for a hasty word that he has spoken, and which he will gladly recal
      to-morrow? Oh! no—Eugene, you will not leave the dwelling in which you were born, and where
      you have passed so many happy hours! What will become of you? What do you purpose? What plan
      have you in view?"</p>
<p>"I have a few guineas in my pocket," returned Eugene; "and many a princely fortune has been
      based upon a more slender foundation."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Richard hastily; "you read of fortunes being easily acquired in novels and
      romances; and in past times persons may have enriched themselves suddenly; but in the great
      world of the present day, Eugene, I am afraid that such occurrences are rare and seldom
      seen."</p>
<p>"You know nothing of the world, Richard," said Eugene, almost contemptuously. "There are
      thousands of persons in London who live well, and keep up splendid establishments, without any
      apparent resources; and I am man of the world enough to be well aware that those always thrive
      the best in the long run who have the least to lose at starting. At all events I shall try my
      fortune. I will not, cannot succumb to a parent
      <pb n="009"/> who has caused my ruin at my very first entrance into life."</p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>"May God prosper your pursuits, and lend you the fortune which you appear to aim at!"
      ejaculated Richard fervently. "But once again—and for the last time, let me implore you—let me
      entreat you not to put this rash and hasty resolve into execution. Do stay—do not leave me, my
      dearest, dearest brother!"</p>
<p>"Richard, not all the powers of human persuasion shall induce me to abandon my present
      determination," cried Eugene emphatically, and rising from the bench as he spoke. "It is
      growing late, and I must depart. Now listen, my dear boy, to what I have to say to you."</p>
<p>"Speak, speak!" murmured Richard, sobbing as if his heart would break.</p>
<p>"All will be yet well," said Eugene, slightly touched by his brother's profound affliction.
      "I am resolved not to set foot in my father's house again; you must return thither and pack me
      up my papers and a few necessaries."</p>
<p>"And you will not leave this spot until my return?" said Richard.</p>
<p>"Solemnly I promise <hi>that</hi>," answered Eugene. "But stay; on your part you must
      faithfully pledge yourself not to seek my father, nor in any way interfere between him and me.
      Nay, do not remonstrate; you must promise."</p>
<p>"I promise you all—anything you require," said Richard mournfully; and, after affectionately
      embracing his brother, he hurried down the hill towards the mansion, turning back from time to
      time to catch a glimpse of Eugene's figure through the increasing gloom, to satisfy himself
      that he was still there between the two saplings.</p>
<p>Richard entered the house, and stole softly up to the bed-room which his brother usually
      occupied when at home. He began his mournful task of putting together the few things which
      Eugene had desired him to select; and while he was thus employed the tears rolled down his
      cheeks in torrents. At one moment he was inclined to hurry to his father, and implore him to
      interfere in
      <pb n="010"/> time to prevent Eugene's departure; but he remembered his solemn promise, and he
      would not break it. Assuredly this was a sense of honour so extreme, that it might be
      denominated <hi>false</hi>; but it was, nevertheless, the sentiment which controlled all the
      actions of him who cherished it. Tenderly, dearly as he loved his brother—bitterly as he
      deplored his intended departure, he still would not forfeit his word and take the simple step
      which would probably have averted the much-dreaded evil. Richard's sense of honour and
      inflexible integrity triumphed, on all occasions, over every other consideration, feeling, and
      desire; and of this characteristic of his brother's nature Eugene was well aware.</p>
<p>Richard had made a small package of the articles which he had selected, and was about to
      leave the room to return to his brother, when the sound of a footstep in the passage
      communicating with the chamber, suddenly fell upon his ear.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he time to recover from the alarm into which this circumstance had thrown him,
      when the door slowly opened, and the butler entered the apartment.</p>
<p>He was a man of about fifty years of age, with a jolly red face, a somewhat bulbous nose,
      small laughing eyes, short grey hair standing upright in front, whiskers terminating an inch
      above his white cravat, and in person considerably inclined to corpulency. In height he was
      about five feet seven inches, and had a peculiar shuffling rapid walk, which he had learnt by
      some twenty-five years' practice in little journeys from the sideboard in the dining-room to
      his own pantry, and back again. He was possessed of an excellent heart, and was a
      good-humoured companion; but pompous, and swelling with importance in the presence of those
      whom he considered his inferiors. He was particularly addicted to hard words; and as, to use
      his own expression, he was "self-taught," it is not to be wondered if he occasionally gave
      those aforesaid hard words a pronunciation and a meaning which militated a little against
      received rules. In attire, he was unequalled for the whiteness of his cravat, the exuberance
      of his shirt-frill, the elegance of his waistcoat, the set of his kerseymere tights, and the
      punctilious neatness of his black silk stockings, and his well-polished shoes.</p>
<p>"Well, Master Richard," said the butler, as he shuffled into the room, with a white napkin
      under his left arm, "what in the name of everythink indiwisible is the matter now?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, nothing, Whittingham," replied the youth. "You had better go down stairs—my father
      may want you."</p>
<p>"If so be your father wants anythink, Tom will despond to the summins as usual," said the
      butler, leisurely seating himself upon a chair close by the table whereon Richard had placed
      his package. "But might I be so formiliar as to inquire into the insignification of that
      bundle of shirts and ankerchers."</p>
<p>"Whittingham, I implore you to ask me no questions: I am in a hurry—and——"</p>
<p>"Master Richard, Master Richard," cried the butler, shaking his head gravely, "I'm very much
      afeerd that somethink preposterious is going to incur. I could not remain a entire stranger to
      all that has transpirated this day; and now I know what it is," he added, slapping his right
      hand smartly upon his thigh; "your brother's a-going to amputate it!"</p>
<p>"To what?"</p>
<p>"To cut it, then, if you reprehend that better. But it shan't be done, Master Richard—it
      shan't be done!'</p>
<p>"Whittingham——"</p>
<p>"That's my nomenklitter, Master Richard," said the old man, doggedly; "and it was one of the
      fust you ever learned to pernounce. Behold ye, Master Richard, I have a right to speak—for I
      have knowed you both from your cradles—and loved you too! Who was it, when you come into this
      subluminary spear—who was it as nussed you—and——"</p>
<p>"Good Whittingham, I know all that, and——"</p>
<p>"I have no overdue curiosity to satisfy, Master Richard," observed the butler; "but my
      soul's inflicted to think that you and Master Eugene couldn't make a friend of old
      Whittingham. I feel it here, Master Richard—here, in my buzzim!"—and the worthy old domestic
      dealt himself a tremendous blow upon the chest as he uttered these words.</p>
<p>"I must leave you now, Whittingham; and I desire you to remain here until my return," said
      Richard. "Do you hear, Whittingham?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Richard; but I don't choose to do as you would wish in this here instance. I
      shall foller you."</p>
<p>"What, Whittingham?"</p>
<p>"I shall foller you, sir."</p>
<p>"Well—you can do that," said Richard, suddenly remembering that his brother had in nowise
      cautioned him against such an intervention as this; "and pray God it may lead to some
      good."</p>
<p>"Ah! now I see that I am raly wanted," said the butler, a smile of satisfaction playing upon
      his rubicund countenance.</p>
<p>Richard now led the way from the apartment, the butler following him in a stately manner.
      They descended the stairs, crossed the garden, and entered the path which led to the top of
      the hill.</p>
<p>"Two trees, I suppose?" said the old domestic inquiringly.</p>
<p>"Yes—he is there!" answered Richard; "but the reminiscence of the times when we planted
      those saplings has failed to induce him to abandon a desperate resolution."</p>
<p>"Ah! he ain't got Master Richard's heart—I always knowed that," mused the old man half
      audibly as he trudged along. "There are them two lads—fine tall youths—both black hair, and
      intelligible black eyes—admirably formed—straight as arrows—and yet so diversified in
      disposition!"</p>
<p>Richard and the butler now reached the top of the hill. Eugene was seated upon the bench in
      a deep reverie; and it was not until his brother and the faithful old domestic stood before
      him, that he awoke from that fit of abstraction.</p>
<p>"What! Is that you, Whittingham?" he exclaimed, the moment he recognised the butler.
      "Richard, I did not think you would have done this."</p>
<p>"It wasn't Master Richard's fault, sir," said Whittingham; "I was rayther too wide awake not
      to smell what was a-going on by virtue of my factory nerves; and so——"</p>
<p>"My dear Whittingham," hastily interrupted Eugene, "I know that you are a faithful servant
      to my father, and very much attached to us: on that very account, pray do not interfere!"</p>
<p>"Interfere!" ejaculated Whittingham, thoroughly
      <pb n="011"/> amazed at being thus addressed, while a tear started into his eye: "not
      interfere Master Eugene? Well, I'm—I'm—I'm—regularly flabbergasted!"</p>
<p>"My mind is made up," said Eugene, "and no persuasion shall alter its decision. I am my own
      master—my father's conduct has emancipated me from all deference to parental authority.
      Richard, you have brought my things? We must now say adieu."</p>
<p>"My dearest brother——"</p>
<p>"Master Eugene——"</p>
<p>"Whither are you going?"</p>
<p>"I am on the road to fame and fortune!"</p>
<p>"Alas!" said Richard mournfully, "you may perhaps find that this world is not so fruitful in
      resources as you now imagine."</p>
<p>"All remonstrances—all objections are vain," interrupted Eugene impatiently. "We must say
      adieu! But one word more," he added, after an instant's pause, as a sudden thought seemed to
      strike him; "<hi>you</hi> doubt the possibility of my success in life, and I feel confident of
      it. Do <hi>you</hi> pursue your career under the auspices of that parent in whose wisdom you
      so blindly repose: I will follow <hi>mine</hi>, dependent only on mine own resources. This is
      the 10th of July, 1831; twelve years hence, on the 10th of July, 1843, we will meet again upon
      this very spot, between the two trees, if they be still standing. Remember the appointment: we
      will <hi>then</hi> compare notes relative to our success in life!"</p>
<p>The moment he had uttered these words, Eugene hastily embraced his brother, who struggled in
      vain to retain him; and, having wrung the hand of the old butler, who was now sobbing like a
      child, the discarded son threw his little bundle over his shoulder, and hurried away from the
      spot.</p>
<p>So precipitately did he descend the hill in the direction leading away from the mansion, and
      towards the multitudinous metropolis at a little distance, that he was out of sight before his
      brother or Whittingham even thought of pursuing him.</p>
<p>They lingered for some time upon the summit of the hill, without exchanging a word; and
      then, maintaining the same silence, slowly retraced their steps towards the mansion.</p>
