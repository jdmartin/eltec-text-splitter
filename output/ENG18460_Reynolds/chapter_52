<head>CHAPTER LII. THE BED OF SICKNESS.</head>
<p>RETURN we to the dwelling of Richard Markham on the same day that Eliza Sydney sought her
      friend Mrs. Arlington, as related in the preceding chapter.</p>
<p>Richard awoke as from a long and painful dream.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes, and gazed vacantly around him. He was in his own bed, and Whittingham
      was seated by his side.</p>
<p>"The Lord be praised!" ejaculated the faithful old domestic;—and conceiving it necessary to
      quote Scripture upon the occasion of this happy recovery, he uttered, in a loud and solemn
      voice, the first sentence which presented itself to his memory,—"My tongue is the pen of a
      ready writer!"</p>
<p>"How long have I been ill, Whittingham?" demanded our hero, in a faint tone.</p>
<p>"Four blessed days have you been devoided of your sensations, Master Richard," was the
      reply; "and most disastrous was my fears that you would never be evanescent no more. I have
      sustained my vigils by day and my diaries by night at your bed-side, Master Richard; and I may
      say, without mitigating against truth, that I haven't had my garments off my back since you
      was first brought home."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Whittingham, I am deeply indebted to you, my good friend," said Richard, pressing
      the faithful old domestic's hand. "But have I really been so very ill?"</p>
<p>"Ill!" exclaimed Whittingham; "for these four days you have never opened your eyes, save in
      delirium, until this moment. But you have been a ravaging in your dreams—and sobbing—and
      moaning so! I suppose, Master Richard, you haven't the most remotest idea of how you come home
      again?"</p>
<p>"Not in the least, Whittingham. All I recollect was, running along the Richmond Road, in the
      middle of the night—with a whirlwind in my brain—"</p>
<p>"And you must have fallen down from sheer fatigue," interrupted the butler; "for two drovers
      picked you up, and took you to a cottage close by. The people at the cottage searched your
      pockets and found your card, so they sent off a messenger to your own house, and I went in a
      po-shay, and fetched you home."</p>
<p>"And I have been ill four whole days!" cried Markham.</p>
<p>"Yes, but you don't know yet what has happened during that period," said the butler, with a
      solemn shake of the head.</p>
<p>"Tell me all the news, Whittingham: let me know what has passed during my illness."
      <pb n="157"/></p>
<p>"I'll repeat to you allegorically all that's incurred," resumed Whittingham, preparing to
      enumerate the various incidents upon his fingers. "In the first place—let me see—yes, it
       <hi>was</hi> the first incurrence of any consequence—the old sow littered. That's annygoat
      the first. Then come a terrible buffoon—a tifoon, I mean—and down tumbled the eastern stack of
      chimbleys. That's annygoat the second. Third, the young water-cress gal was confined with a
      unlegitimated child; and so I told her mother never to let her call here again, as we didn't
      encourage immoral karikters. That's annygoat the third. Next, there's poor Ben Halliday, who
      wouldn't pay the pavement rate at Holloway, 'cause he hasn't got any pavement before his
      house, sold up, stick and stock; and so I gave him a couple of guineas. Annygoat the fourth.
      And last of all, a gentleman's livery servant—not that villain Yorkminster's, or whatever his
      name was—come with a horse and shay and left your pokmanty, without saying a word. That's
      anny—"</p>
<p>"My portmanteau!" exclaimed Richard, whose countenance was now suddenly animated with a ray
      of hope: "and have you unpacked it?"</p>
<p>"Not yet: I haven't had no time."</p>
<p>"Bring it to the bed-side, place it upon a couple of chairs, and open it at once," said
      Markham hastily. "Bestir yourself, good Whittingham: I am anxious to see if there be any
      note—any letter—any—"</p>
<p>While Richard uttered these words with a considerable degree of impatience, the butler
      dragged the portmanteau from beneath the bed, where he had deposited it, and placed it close
      to his master's right hand. It was speedily opened, unpacked, and examined throughout; the
      clothes and linen were unfolded; and Richard's eyes followed the investigation with the most
      painful curiosity. But there was no letter—no note from any inmate of the count's abode.</p>
<p>A sudden reminiscence entered his mind. Was the document signed at the <hi>Dark House</hi>
      amongst his papers? He recollected having handed it to the count; but he could not call to
      mind what had afterwards become of it. A moment's examination convinced him that it had not
      been returned to him. At first he was grievously annoyed by this circumstance;—in another
      minute he was pleased, for it struck him that, after all, its contents might have been perused
      by the count and his family when the excitement of that fatal night had worn off. But how to
      wipe away the dread suspicion raised by the Resurrection Man, relative to the burglary—oh!
      that was the most painful, and yet the most necessary task of all!</p>
<p>Markham sank back upon his pillow, and was lost in thought, when a low knock was heard at
      the door of his chamber. Whittingham answered it, and introduced Mr. Monroe.</p>
<p>The old man was the very picture of care and wretchedness:—the mark of famine was, moreover,
      upon his sunken cheeks. His eyes were dead and lustreless;—his neck, his wrists, and his hands
      seemed nothing but skin and bone. In spite of the cleanliness of his person, the thread-bare
      shabbiness of his clothes could not escape the eye of even the most superficial observer.</p>
<p>Markham had not seen him for some months; and now, forgetting his own malady and his own
      cares, he felt shocked at the dreadful alteration wrought upon the old man's person during
      that interval. On his part, Mr. Monroe was not less surprised to find Richard upon a bed of
      sickness.</p>
<p>"My dear sir," said Markham, "you are ill—you are suffering—and you do not come to me
      to—"</p>
<p>"What! you have penetrated my secret, Richard!" exclaimed the old man bitterly. "Well—I will
      conceal the truth no longer: yes—myself and my poor daughter—we are dying by inches!"</p>
<p>"My God! and you were too proud to come to me! Oh! how sincerely—how eagerly would I have
      offered you the half of all I possess—"</p>
<p>"How could I come to you, Richard," interrupted the old man, bursting into tears, "when I
      had already ruined you?"</p>
<p>"No—not you—not you," said Markham: "you were the victim of a scoundrel; and, in acting for
      the best, you lost all!"</p>
<p>"God knows how truly you speak!" cried the old man fervently. "But tell me—what ails you?
      and how long have you been upon a bed of sickness?"</p>
<p>"A day or two;—it is nothing! Never mind me—I am now well—at all events, much better:—let us
      talk of yourself and your own affairs."</p>
<p>"My fate, Richard, is a melancholy one—my destiny is sad, indeed! From the pinnacle of
      wealth and prosperity I have been dashed down to the lowest abyss of destitution and misery!
      But it is not for myself that I complain—it is not for myself that I suffer! I am by this time
      inured to every kind of disappointment and privation:—but my daughter—my poor Ellen! Oh! my
      God—it was for her sake that I came to you this morning to implore the wherewith to purchase a
      loaf of bread!"</p>
<p>"Merciful heavens, Mr. Monroe! are you reduced to this?" cried Richard, horror-struck at the
      piteous tale thus conveyed to him in a few words.</p>
<p>"It is true:—we are starving!" answered the old man, sinking into a chair, and sobbing
      bitterly.</p>
<p>Whittingham walked towards the window, and wiped his eyes more than once.</p>
<p>"Ah! I am glad you have come to me at last," said Markham. "I will assist you to the utmost
      of my power—I will never let you want again! Oh! that villain Montague! how many hearts has he
      already broken—how many more will he yet break!"</p>
<p>"He is the cause of all this deep—deep misery," observed Monroe. "But not alone by me is his
      name mentioned with loathing and horror: others have doubtless been, and will yet be, his
      victims. I have learnt—by the merest accident—that he has changed his name, and is now
      pursuing at the West End, the same course he so successfully practised in the City."</p>
<p>"Changed his name!" ejaculated Markham. "And what does he call himself now?"</p>
<p>"Greenwood," answered Mr. Monroe.</p>
<p>"Greenwood! George Montague and Greenwood one and the same person!" cried Richard, suddenly
      recalling to mind the name of the individual to whom the count had entrusted his capital. "Ah!
      you talk of new victims—I know one, whose ruin is perhaps by this time consummated.
      Quick—quick, Whittingham, give me writing materials: I will send a warning—although I am
      afraid it is already too late!"</p>
<p>While Whittingham was arranging his master's portfolio upon the coverlid of the bed, Markham
      reflected upon the best means of communicating to Count Alteroni the character of the man to
      whom he had confided his fortune, and whom he thought of favourably as a suitor for his
      daughter's hand. Anonymous letters were detestable to the honourable and open disposition of
      Richard, and he hesitated
      <pb n="158"/> at the idea of sending a note direct from himself, fearing that it might be
      thrown into the fire the moment its signature should be perceived, and thus fail in its
      proposed aim. To call upon the count was impossible: to send Mr. Monroe was disagreeable. To
      communicate the important intelligence was imperiously necessary. But how was it to be
      conveyed? An idea struck across his brain in this perplexity:—he would write to the countess,
      and trust to the natural curiosity of the female disposition to ensure the perusal of his
      letter. He accordingly penned the ensuing epistle:—</p>
<quote>
<p>"<hi>Madam</hi>,</p>
<p>"Although calumniated in the presence of Count Alteroni, without being permitted to justify
       myself; and although ruined in your estimation, without the freedom of explanation,—believe
       me, I have still the welfare of your family most sincerely at heart. As a proof of this
       assertion, allow me to inform you that the Mr. Greenwood, to whom Count Alteroni has
       entrusted his capital, is an adventurer and a villain. I on several occasions casually
       mentioned to you that I was plundered of all my property, before I became of an age entitled
       to enjoy it. My guardian Mr. Monroe, employed a certain Mr. Allen to speculate for him; and
       this Mr. Allen was mercilessly robbed of all he possessed, and all he could raise, and all
       his friends who backed him could provide him with, by a miscreant of the name of Montague.
       These particulars, which I never mentioned to you before, I now deem it requisite to acquaint
       you with. Madam, that same George Montague is your Mr. Greenwood!</p>
<p>"I remain, Madam, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>
<label>"RICHARD MARKHAM.</label>"</p>
