<head>CHAPTER LIII. ACCUSATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS.</head>
<p>It was seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p>Count Alteroni was sipping his claret; the countess was reading a new German novel; and the
      Signora Isabella was sitting in a pensive and melancholy mood, apparently occupied with some
      embroidery or other fancy-work, but in reality bent only upon her own painful reflections.</p>
<p>The air of this charming girl was languishing and sorrowful; and from time to time a tear
      started into her large black eye. That crystal drop upon the jet fringe of her eye-lid, seemed
      like the dew hanging on the ebony frame of a window.</p>
<p>The delicate hue of the rose which usually coloured her cheeks, and appeared as it were
      beneath the complexion of faint bistre which denoted her Italian origin, had fled; and her
      sweet vermilion lips were no longer wreathed in smiles.</p>
<p>"Isabel, my love," said the count, "you are thoughtful this evening. What a silly girl you
      are to oppose that tyrannical little will of your own to my anxious hopes and wishes for your
      welfare—especially as I must know so much better than you what is for your good and what is
      not."</p>
<p>"I think," answered Isabella, with a deep sigh, "that I oppose no tyrannical will to your
      lordship's commands."</p>
<p>"Lordship's commands!" repeated the count, somewhat angrily. "Have I not ordered our rank
      and station to be forgotten here—in England? And as for commands, Bella," added the nobleman,
      softening, "I have merely expressed my wish that you should give Mr. Greenwood an opportunity
      of proving his disinterested affection and securing your esteem—especially on the occasion of
      our approaching visit to our friends the Tremordyns."</p>
<p>"My dear papa," answered the signora, "I have faithfully promised you that if Mr. Greenwood
      should gain my affections, he shall not sue in vain for my hand."</p>
<p>"That is a species of compromise which I do not understand," exclaimed the count. "Have you
      any particular aversion to him?"</p>
<p>"I have no aversion—but I certainly have no love," replied Isabella firmly; "and where there
      is not love, dear father, you would not have me wed?"</p>
<p>"Oh! as for love," said the count, evading a direct reply to this query, "time invariably
      thaws away those stern resolves and objections which young ladies sometimes choose to
      entertain, in opposition to the wishes of their parents."</p>
<p>"My lord, I have no power over volition," exclaimed Isabella, with difficulty restraining
      her tears.</p>
<p>"This is very provoking, Isabella—very!" said the count, drinking his claret with rapidity.
      "This man is in every way worthy of you—rich, genteel, and good-looking. As for his rank—it is
      true that he has no title: but of what avail to us are rank and title—exiled as we are from
      our native land—"</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear father!" cried Isabella, wiping her eyes; "do not fancy so ill of me as to
      suppose that I languish for rank, or care for honour! No—let me either possess that title
      which is a reflection of your own when in Castelcicala;—or let me be plain Signora Isabella in
      a foreign land. Pomp and banishment—pride and exile, are monstrous incongruities!"</p>
<p>"That is spoken like my own dear daughter," exclaimed the count. "The sorrows of my own lot
      are mitigated by the philosophy and firmness with which you and your dear mother support our
      change of fortunes;—and, alas! I see but little chance of another re-action in our favour. O
      my dear country! shall I ever see thee more? Wilt thou one day recognise those who really love
      thee?"</p>
<p>A profound silence ensued: neither of the ladies chose to interrupt the meditations of the
      patriot; and he himself rose and paced the room with agitated steps.</p>
<p>"And it is this despair when I contemplate my future prospects," continued the nobleman,
      after a long pause, "that induces me to wish to see you speedily settled and provided for, my
      dearest Isabella. What other motive can I have but your good?"</p>
<p>"Oh! I know it—I know it, my dear father," cried the charming girl; "and it is that
      conviction which makes me wretched when I think how reluctant I am to obey you in this
      instance. But do not grieve yourself, my dear father—and do not be angry with me! I will be as
      civil and friendly as I can to this Mr. Greenwood; and if—and if——"</p>
<p>The beautiful Italian could say no more: her heart was full—almost to bursting; and throwing
      herself into her mother's arms, she wept bitterly.</p>
<p>The count, who was passionately attached to his daughter, was deeply affected and greatly
      shocked by this demonstration of her feelings. He had flattered himself that her repugnance to
      Mr. Greenwood was far from being deeply rooted, and was merely the result of a young girl's
      fears and anxieties when she found that she was not romantically attached to her suitor. But
      he little suspected that she cherished a sincere and tender passion for another—a passion
      which she might essay in vain to conquer.
      <pb n="159"/></p>
<p>"Bella, my darling," he exclaimed, "do not give way to grief: you cannot think that I would
      sacrifice you to gold—mere gold? No—never, never! Console yourself—you shall never be dragged
      a victim to the altar!"</p>
<p>"My dearest father," cried Isabella, turning towards the count and embracing him
      fondly,—"God, who reads all my actions, knows that I would make any sacrifice to please you—to
      spare you one pang—to forward your views! Oh! believe me, I am too well aware of the deep
      responsibility under which I exist towards my parents—too deeply imbued with gratitude for all
      your kindness towards me, not to be prepared to obey your wishes!"</p>
<p>"I will exact no sacrifice, dearest girl," said the count. "Compose yourself—and do not
      weep!"</p>
<p>At that moment a loud double knock at the front door resounded through the house; and
      scarcely had Isabella, recovered her self-possession, when Mr. Greenwood was announced.</p>
<p>"Ladies, excuse this late visit," said the financier, sailing into the room with his
      countenance wreathed into the blandest smiles; "but the truth is, I had business in the
      neighbourhood, and I could not possibly pass without stopping for a few moments at a mansion
      where there are such attractions."</p>
<p>These last words were addressed pointedly to Isabella, who only replied to the compliment by
      a cold bow.</p>
<p>"Count," said Mr. Greenwood, now turning towards the nobleman, "I have not seen you since
      your adventure upon the highway! But I was delighted to learn that you had received no
      injury."</p>
<p>"My only regret is that I did not shoot the villains," answered the count. "Have you had
      another deed prepared, to replace the one stolen from me on that occasion?"</p>
<p>"I have given my solicitors the necessary instructions," answered Greenwood. "In a few
      days——"</p>
<p>"Every thing with you is in a few days, Greenwood," interrupted the count, somewhat
      pointedly. "That deed would not occupy one day to engross, now that the copy is at your
      attorney's office; and it would have been a mark of goodwill on your part—"</p>
<p>"Pray do not blame me!" exclaimed the financier, smiling so as to display his very white
      teeth, of which he seemed not a little proud. "I believe that for a man who has so much
      business upon his hands, and the interests of so many to watch and care for, I am as punctual
      to my appointments as most people."</p>
<p>"I do not speak of want of punctuality in keeping appointments," said the nobleman: "but I
      allude to the neglect of a matter which to you may appear trivial, but which to me is of
      importance."</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear count—we will repair this little error the day after to-morrow—or the next
      day," answered Mr. Greenwood: "I wish that every body was as regular and as punctual with me,
      as I endeavour to be with others; and that punctuality on my part, my dear sir, has been the
      origin of my fortune. I do not like to speak of myself, ladies—I hate egotism—but really," he
      added with another smile, "when one is attacked, you know——"</p>
<p>At that moment a domestic entered the room, and handed a letter to the countess, who
      immediately opened it, glanced towards the signature, and exclaimed almost involuntarily,
      "From Richard Markham!"</p>
<p>"Richard Markham!" cried Mr. Greenwood: "I thought I understood you that that gentleman had
      ceased to visit or correspond with you?"</p>
<p>"So I said—and so I shall maintain!" exclaimed the count. "My dear, we will return that
      letter without reading it."</p>
<p>"But I have already commenced the perusal of it," said the countess, without taking her eyes
      off the paper: "and——"</p>
<p>"Then read no more," cried the count, angrily.</p>
<p>"Excuse me—I shall read it all," answered the countess significantly: "and so will you."</p>
<p>"What means this?" ejaculated the count. "Have I lost all authority in my own house? Madam,
      I command you——"</p>
<p>"There—I have finished it, and I implore you to read it yourself. Its contents are highly
      important, and do not in any way relate to certain recent events. Indeed he has purposely
      avoided any thing which may appear obtrusive, either in the shape of explanation or
      apology."</p>
<p>The count took the letter with a very ill grace, and requested Mr. Greenwood's permission to
      read it. This was of course awarded; and the nobleman commenced the perusal. He had not,
      however, read many lines, before he gave a convulsive start, and looked mistrustfully upon Mr.
      Greenwood (who noticed his emotion), and hastily ran his eye over the remainder of the
      letter's contents.</p>
<p>He then folded up the letter, and appeared to be absorbed in deep thought for several
      moments. Mr. Greenwood saw that the note bore some allusion to himself, and prepared his mind
      for any explanation, or any storm.</p>
<p>The countess sate, pale and unhappy, in deep meditation; and the eyes of Isabella wandered
      anxiously from one to the other.</p>
<p>At length the count, in a tone which showed with how much difficulty he suppressed an
      outbreak of his irritated feelings, turned abruptly towards Mr. Greenwood, exclaiming, "Pray,
      sir, how long is it since you were acquainted with one George Montague?"</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood was not taken at all aback. This was a question to which he was always liable,
      and for which he was constantly prepared. He accordingly answered, with his usual smile of
      complaisance, in the following manner:—</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear sir, I presume you are acquainted with the fact that my name was once Montague,
      since you ask me that question. I may also suppose that some one has communicated that
      circumstance to you with a desire to prejudice me in your opinion; but I can assure you that I
      have not changed my name for any sinister purpose. My only motive was the request of an old
      lady, who left me a considerable property some time ago, upon that condition."</p>
<p>"And you can also explain, perhaps, the nature of your dealings with a certain Mr. Allen?"
      demanded the count, staggered at the assurance with which Mr. Greenwood met an accusation that
      the nobleman imagined would have overwhelmed him with confusion.</p>
<p>"My dear sir," replied the financier, very far from betraying any embarrassment, whatever he
      might have felt, "I can explain that and every other action of my life. I was myself misled—I
      was duped—I was involved in an enterprise which entailed ruin upon myself and all connected
      with me. I suffered along with the others, and gave up all to the creditors. I have, however,
      been enabled to build up my fortunes again by means of the property left to me, and a series
      of successful operations. All people in commercial and financial affairs are liable to
      disappointment and embarrassment: the most
      <pb n="160"/> cautious may over-speculate or miscalculate; and how can I be blamed more than
      another?"</p>
<p>"I will admit that a particular enterprise may fail," said the count: "but the writer of
      this letter explained to me on one or two occasions, enough to enable me to comprehend the
      whole machinery of fraud which you put into motion to obtain money from the public; and though
      he never mentioned any names until to-day, in his letter, I might——"</p>
<p>"Every man has his enemies," said Mr. Greenwood, calmly: "I cannot hope to be without mine.
      They may assert what they choose: upright and impartial men never listen to one-sided
      statements. But perhaps the writer of that letter——"</p>
<p>"He is the Mr. Markham of whom I have often spoken to you, and concerning whom you were
      always asking me questions. I could not conceive," proceeded the count, "why you were so
      curious to pry into his affairs, especially as when I mentioned you to him by the name of
      Greenwood, he did not seem to know any thing about you. But I can now well understand why
       <hi>you</hi> should wish to know something of a man whom you ruined!"</p>
<p>"I ruined!" cried Mr. Greenwood, now excited for the first time since the commencement of
      this dialogue, and speaking with an air of unfeigned astonishment. "There must be some mistake
      in this! I never had any dealings with him in my life, which could either cause his ruin or
      establish his prosperity."</p>
<p>"You took very good care, it would appear, not to do the latter," said the count. "But
      probably Mr. Markham's letter will explain to you that which you appear to have
      forgotten."</p>
<p>Count Alteroni handed the letter to Mr. Greenwood, who perused its contents with intense
      interest and anxiety.</p>
<p>The count, the countess, and the signora watched his countenance as he read it. Proficient
      in the art of duplicity as he was,—skilled in all the wiles of hypocrisy and deceit, he could
      not conceal his emotions now. There was something in that letter which chased the colour from
      his cheeks, and convulsed his whole frame with extreme agony.</p>
<p>"This is indeed singular!" he murmured, turning the letter over and over in his hand. "Who
      would have suspected that Allen was merely an agent? who could have foreseen <hi>where that
       blow was to strike</hi>? Strange—unaccountable concatenation of unfortunate
      circumstances!"</p>
<p>"Is the writer of that letter correct in his statement?" demanded the count imperiously.</p>
<p>"The information given to you by Mr. Markham, relative to the losses experienced by a
      certain Mr. Allen, is correct," returned Mr. Greenwood, apparently labouring under
      considerable excitement. "But, I take my God to witness, that, until this moment, I was
      unaware that either Mr. Monroe or Mr. Markham were in the remotest way connected with that
      affair; and I also solemnly protest that I would have given worlds sooner than have been the
      means of injuring either of them!"</p>
<p>"You admit, then, that you defrauded the people who at that time placed their funds in your
      hands?" said the count.</p>
<p>"I admit nothing of the kind," returned the financier, now recovering his presence of mind:
      "I admit nothing so base as your insinuation implies."</p>
<p>"Then wherefore were you so agitated when you perused that letter from Mr. Richard
      Markham?"</p>
<p>"Count Alteroni, I am not aware that I owe you any explanation of my own private feelings.
      It is true, I <hi>was</hi> agitated—and I am still deeply grieved, to think that my want of
      judgment and foresight in a certain speculation should have involved in ruin those whom I wish
      well! But I suffered as well as they—I lost as many thousands as they did," continued Mr.
      Greenwood, passing once more into that system of plausible, specious, and deceptive reasoning,
      which lulled so many suspicions, and closed the eyes of so many persons with regard to his
      real character: "and although I have done nothing for which I can be blamed by the world, I
      may still reproach myself when I find that others whom I care for have suffered by my
      speculations."</p>
<p>The count was staggered at this expression and honourable manifestation of feeling on the
      part of one whom he had a few minutes ago begun to look upon as a selfish adventurer, callous
      to all humane emotions and philanthropic sentiments.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood continued:—</p>
<p>"When that unfortunate speculation of mine took place, I was not so experienced in the
      sinuosities of the commercial and financial worlds as I am now.—I lost my all, and poverty
      stared me in the face."</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood's voice faltered, although he was now once more uttering a tissue of
      falsehoods.</p>
<p>"But by dint of some good fortune and much hard toil and unwearied application to business,
      I retrieved my circumstances. Now, answer me candidly, Count Alteroni; is there any thing
      dishonourable in my career? Will you judge a man upon an <hi>ex-parte</hi> statement? Is not
      one story very good until another be told? Why, if all persons viewed their affairs constantly
      in the same light, would there be any business for the civil tribunals? Do not plaintiff and
      defendant invariably survey the point at issue between them under discrepant aspects? If they
      did not, wherefore do they go to law? You may allow Mr. Markham and Mr. Monroe to entertain
      their views; you will also permit me to enjoy mine?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Greenwood," said the count, "I am afraid I have been too severe—nay, even rude in my
      observations. You will forgive me?"</p>
<p>"My dear sir, say not another word," ejaculated the financier, chuckling inwardly at the
      triumphant victory which he had thus gained over the suspicions of the Italian nobleman.</p>
<p>At that moment a servant entered the room, and informed Count Alteroni "that the Earl of
      Warrington was in the drawing-room, and requested an interview, at which his lordship would
      not detain the count above ten minutes."</p>
<p>The count, having desired Mr. Greenwood not to depart until his return, and apologising for
      his temporary absence, proceeded to the drawing-room, where the Earl of Warrington awaited
      him.</p>
<p>The earl rose when the count entered the apartment; and that proud, wealthy, and high-born
      English peer wore an air of profound respect and deference, as he returned the salutation of
      the Italian exile.</p>
<p>"Your lordship," said the earl, "will, I hope, pardon this intrusion at so unseemly an
      hour——"</p>
<p>"The Earl of Warrington is always welcome," interrupted Count Alteroni; "and if I cannot
      give him so princely a reception in England as I was proud to do in Italy, it is my means and
      not my will, which is the cause."</p>
<p>"My lord, I beseech you not to allude to any discrepancy in that respect—a discrepancy which
      I can regret for your lordship only, and not for myself," said the earl. "Indeed, I am so far
      selfish on the present occasion, that I am come to ask a favour."
      <pb n="161"/></p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>"Name the matter in which my poor services can avail your lordship," returned the count,
      "and I pledge myself in advance to meet your wishes."</p>
<p>"My lord," said the Earl of Warrington, "I must inform your lordship that I am somewhat
      interested in a cousin of mine of the name of Eliza Sydney. This lady loved a man who was
      unworthy of her—a wretch whose pursuits are villany, and who enriches himself at the expense
      of the unwary and confiding. The heartless scoundrel to whom I allude, and the full measure of
      whose infamy was only exposed to me this day, has endeavoured to possess himself of the person
      of Eliza in a manner the most atrocious and cowardly. My lord, he employed a confederate to
      administer soporific drugs to her; but Providence moved that confederate's heart, and
      frustrated the damnable scheme."</p>
<p>"And can such conduct go unpunished in this land of excellent laws and unerring justice?"
      inquired the count.</p>
<p>"Ah! my lord," replied the earl, "this man is possessed of great wealth, and consequently of
      great influence; for, in England, <hi>money</hi> is <hi>power</hi>! Moreover, the complete
      chain of evidence is wanting; and then exposure to the female in such a case is almost equal
      to a stigma and to shame! To continue my brief tale, my lord—this man, with a demon heart, is
      one who will persecute my cousin Eliza to the very death. A lady of my acquaintance, who can
      also tell a tale of the unequalled villany of this George Montague Greenwood——"</p>
<p>"What!" ejaculated the count; "do I hear aright? or do my ears deceive me? What name did you
      give the miscreant who administered opiate drugs to a woman with the foulest of motives?"</p>
<p>"George Montague Greenwood," repeated the earl.</p>
<p>"O God!" ejaculated the count, sinking back in his chair, and covering his face with his
      hands; "I thank thee that thou hast intervened, ere it was too late, to prevent that fearful
      sacrifice of my daughter!"</p>
<p>"Pardon me, my lord," exclaimed the earl, "if I have awakened any disagreeable
      reminiscences, or produced impressions——"</p>
<p>"Your lordship has done me an infinite service, in fully opening my eyes to the villany of a
      man whose damnable sophistry glosses over his crimes with so deceptive a varnish, that the
      sight is dazzled when contemplating his conduct."</p>
<p>As the count uttered these words he wrung the
      <pb n="162"/> hands of the English peer with the most friendly and grateful warmth.</p>
<p>"Another time, my lord," continued the Italian noble, "I will explain to you the cause of my
      present emotions. You will then perceive how confirmed a miscreant is this Greenwood. In the
      meantime tell me how I can aid your lordship?"</p>
<p>"I was about to inform you, my lord," continued the Earl of Warrington, "that Miss Sydney,
      alarmed and appalled at the persecution of this man, who seems to spare neither expense nor
      crime to accomplish any purpose upon which he has once set his mind, has determined to sojourn
      for a time upon the Continent. Your lordship is aware that I possess a humble villa in the
      suburbs of Montoni——"</p>
<p>"A beautiful residence, on the contrary," said the count; "and where," he added with a sigh,
      "in happier times I have partaken of your hospitality."</p>
<p>"Yes, your lordship has honoured me with your society at that retreat," said the earl, with
      a low and deferential bow. "It is to that villa that I now propose to despatch my cousin, in
      order that she may escape the persecutions and the plots of this vile Greenwood. The object of
      my present visit is to solicit your lordship for a few letters of introduction for Miss Sydney
      to some of those families in Montoni with whom she may experience the charms of profitable and
      intellectual society."</p>
<p>"With much pleasure," answered the count. "When does Miss Sydney propose to leave
      England?"</p>
<p>"The day after to-morrow, my lord."</p>
<p>"To-morrow evening your lordship shall receive the letters which Miss Sydney requires. They
      will of course be unsealed—both in observance of the rules of etiquette, and on account of the
      custom-house officers in the continental states; but your lordship will take care that they be
      not opened in England."</p>
<p>"I comprehend you, my lord. The incognito which your lordship chooses to preserve in this
      country shall not be disturbed by any indiscretion on the part of myself or of those connected
      with me."</p>
<p>The Earl of Warrington then took his leave.</p>
<p>The moment he had departed, the count rang the bell, and said to the servant who answered
      the summons, "Request Mr. Greenwood to favour me with his company in this
      room—<hi>here</hi>!"</p>
<p>In another minute the financier was introduced into the saloon which the count was pacing
      with uneven and agitated steps.</p>
<p>"Mr. Greenwood," said the Italian nobleman, "I think you recollect the subject of our
      conversation when I was called away by the visit of the Earl of Warrington?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly," answered the financier, who perceived that there was again something wrong. "I
      remember that you made many accusations against me, all of which I most satisfactorily
      explained—insomuch that you very handsomely apologised for the severity of your language."</p>
<p>"Then, sir," continued the count, with difficulty restraining his impatience while Mr.
      Greenwood thus delivered himself, "if you be really such an honourable and such an injured man
      as you would represent, and if you be really grieved when you hear that a fellow-creature has
      been ruined by the failure of your speculations, have the kindness to return me the money
      which I have confided to you, and I shall be inclined to think of you as you choose to think
      of yourself. To tell the truth, I am already sick of the uncertainty of speculation; and would
      rather withdraw from the enterprise altogether."</p>
<p>"Really, my dear sir," said Mr. Greenwood, "this demand is so very irregular—so exceedingly
      unbusiness-like——"</p>
<p>"We will not place it upon the footing of <hi>business</hi>, sir," interrupted the count
      emphatically; "we will place it upon the basis of <hi>honour</hi>."</p>
<p>"Honour and business with me, my dear sir, are synonymous," said the financier with a
      smile.</p>
<p>"So much the better!" ejaculated the count: "I see that we shall not dispute over this
      matter. The whole is summed up in a few words: return me the money I have placed in your
      hands."</p>
<p>"These things cannot be done in a hurry, my dear sir," said Mr. Greenwood, playing with a
      very handsome gold guard-chain which festooned over his waistcoat.</p>
<p>"Either you have made away with my money, or you have it in your possession still,"
      exclaimed the count. "If you have it, give me a cheque upon your banker for the amount: if you
      have placed it out at interest, give me security.</p>
<p>"I must observe to you that the whole proceeding is most irregular," said Mr. Greenwood:
      "and the business requires mature reflection. Moreover, all my funds are locked up for the
      moment."</p>
<p>"Then how would you carry out the enterprise for which I embarked my capital?" demanded the
      count.</p>
<p>"You must be aware," replied the financier, "that capitalists—like me—always lay out their
      cash to the greatest advantage, and make use of bills and negotiable paper of various
      descriptions. Thus, I could build a dozen steam-packets in a few weeks, and pay for them all
      without actually encroaching upon my capital!"</p>
<p>"I understand you, sir," said the count: "and in order to meet your convenience, I am ready
      to receive the securities you mention, payable at early dates, instead of specie."</p>
<p>"Oh! well—that alters the question," cried Mr. Greenwood, an idea apparently striking him at
      that moment. "I am acquainted with one of the richest bankers in London—intimately acquainted
      with him: would you have any objection for him to take my place in respect to you, and become
      the holder of your capital—say for a period of six months?"</p>
<p>"Who is the banker?" asked the count.</p>
<p>"James Tomlinson," answered the financier.</p>
<p>"I know the name well. Are you serious in your proposal?"</p>
<p>"Call upon me to-morrow at twelve o'clock, and we will proceed together to Mr. Tomlinson's
      banking house in the City. I will have the whole affair arranged for you in the course of an
      hour after our arrival at his establishment."</p>
<p>"I rely upon your word, Mr. Greenwood," returned the count.</p>
<p>The financier then took his departure.</p>
