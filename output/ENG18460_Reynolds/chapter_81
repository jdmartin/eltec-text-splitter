<head>CHAPTER LXXXI. THE MYSTERIOUS INSTRUCTIONS.</head>
<p>AT the expiration of ten days from the mysterious accouchement of Ellen Monroe, Richard
      Markham returned home.</p>
<p>It was late at night when he alighted at his dwelling; but, as he had written two days
      previously to say when his arrival might be expected, Mr. Monroe and Whittingham were sitting
      up to receive him.</p>
<p>Richard's countenance was mournful; and he wore a black crape round his hat.</p>
<p>"You have lost a kind friend, Richard," said Mr. Monroe. "Your hasty letter acquainted us
      with the fact of Mr. Armstrong's death; but you gave us no details connected with that
      event."</p>
<p>"I will now tell you all that has occurred," said Richard. "You need not leave the room,
      Whittingham: you knew Mr. Armstrong, and will be, no doubt, interested in the particulars of
      his last moments."</p>
<p>"I knowed him for a staunched and consisting man in his demmycratical opinions," answered
      Whittingham; "and what's more comportant, he thought well of you, Master Richard."</p>
<p>"He was an excellent man!" observed Markham, wiping away a tear.</p>
<p>"Worth a thousand Ilchesters, and ten thousand wulgarians which calls butlers
       <hi>tulips</hi>," added Whittingham, dogmatically.</p>
<p>"I will tell you the particulars of his death," continued Richard, after a pause. "You
      remember that I received a letter from Mr. Armstrong, written in a hurried manner, and
      desiring me to repair to him in Boulogne, where he was detained by an accident which, he
      feared, might proved fatal. I posted to Dover, which town I reached at about five in the
      evening; and I found that no packet would leave for France until the following morning. The
      condition of my friend, as I judged of it by his note, seemed too serious to allow me to
      delay: I accordingly hired a vessel, and proceeded without loss of time to Boulogne, where I
      arrived at eleven that same night, after a tolerably rough passage. I hurried to the hotel at
      which my friend was staying, and the card of which he had enclosed in his letter. I found him
      in bed, suffering from a fearful accident caused by the overturning of the chaise in which he
      had arrived at Boulogne from Paris, on his way to England. No limbs were broken: but he had
      sustained internal injuries of a most serious nature. A nurse was seated at his bed-side; and
      his medical attendant visited him every two or three hours. He was delighted to see
      me—wept—and said frequently, even up to the moment of his decease, 'Richard, this is very—very
      kind of you.' I sate up with him all that night, in spite of his entreaties that I would
      retire to rest; and from the first moment that I set my eyes upon him in that room, I felt
      convinced he would never leave it alive. I need not tell you that I did all I could to solace
      and render comfortable the man who had selected me, of all his acquaintances, to receive his
      last breath. I considered myself honoured by that mark of friendship; and I moreover
      remembered that he had believed in my innocence when I first told him my sad tale within the
      walls of Newgate. I never left him, save for one hour, from the instant I arrived in Boulogne
      until that of his death."</p>
<p>"Poor Master Richard," said Whittingham, surveying the young man with affectionate
      admiration.</p>
<p>"I said that I left him for one hour," continued Markham: "that was the evening before his
      death. Five days after my arrival, he called me to his bed-side, and said, 'Richard, I feel
      that my hours are numbered. You heard what my physician observed ere now; and I am not the man
      to delude myself with vain and futile hope. I repeat—my moments are now numbered. Leave me
      alone, Richard, for one hour; that I may commune with myself.' This desire was sacred; and I
      immediately obeyed it. But I remained away only just one hour, and then hastened back to him.
      He was very faint and languid; and I saw, with much surprise, that he had been writing. I sate
      down by his bed-side, and took his emaciated hand. He pressed mine, and said in a slow and
      calm tone,—'Richard, I need not recall to your mind under what circumstances we first met. I
      heard your tale; I knew that you were innocent. I could read your heart. In an hour I
      understood all your good qualities. I formed a friendship for you; and in the name of that
      friendship, listen to the last words of a dying man.' He paused for a few moments, and then
      continued thus:—'When I am no more, you will take possession of the few effects that I have
      with me here. In my desk you will find a sum sufficient to pay all the expenses incurred by my
      illness and to meet the cost of my interment. I desire to be buried in the Protestant cemetery
      in the neighbourhood of Boulogne: you and the physician will attend me to my grave. The
      funeral must be of the most humble description. Do not neglect this desire on my part. I have
      been all my life opposed to pomp and ostentation, and shall scarcely wish any display to mark
      my death.' He paused again; and I gave him some refreshing beverage. He then
      proceeded:—'Beneath my pillow, Richard, there is a paper in a sealed envelope. After my death
      you will open that envelope and read what is written within it. And now I must exact from you
      a solemn promise—a promise made to a dying man—a promise which I am not ashamed to ask, and
      which you need not fear to give, especially as it relates eventually to yourself. I require
      you to pledge yourself most sacredly that you will obey to the very letter the directions
      which are written within that envelope, and which relate to the papers that the envelope
      contains.' I readily gave the promise required. He then directed me to take the sealed packet
      from beneath his pillow, and retain it safely about my person. He shortly after sank into a
      deep slumber—from which he never awoke. His spirit glided imperceptibly away!"
      <pb n="246"/></p>
<p>"Good old man!" exclaimed Whittingham, applying his snow-white handkerchief to his eyes.</p>
<p>"According to the French laws," continued Richard, "interments must take place within
      forty-eight hours after death. The funeral of Thomas Armstrong was humble and unostentatious
      as he desired. The physician and myself alone followed him to the tomb. I then inspected his
      papers; but found no will—no instructions how his property was to be disposed of; and yet I
      knew that he was possessed of ample means. Having liquidated his debts with a portion of the
      money I found in his desk, and which amounted to about a hundred pounds, I gave the remainder
      to an English charity at Boulogne. And now you are no doubt anxious to know the contents of
      that packet so mysteriously delivered to me. When I broke the seal of the envelope, I found a
      letter addressed thus:—'<hi>To my dear friend Richard Markham</hi>.' This letter was sealed. I
      then examined the envelope. You shall yourselves see what was written within it."</p>
<p>Markham took a paper from his pocket, and handed it to Monroe, who read its contents aloud
      as follows:—</p>
<quote>
<p><hi>"Richard, remember your solemn promise to a dying man; for when I write this, I know
        you will not refuse to give me that sacred pledge which I shall ask of you.</hi></p>
<p><hi>"When you are destitute of all resources—when adversity or a too generous heart shall
        have deprived you of all means of subsistence—and when your own exertions fail to supply
        your wants, open the enclosed letter.</hi></p>
<p><hi>"But should no circumstances of any kind deprive you of the little property which you
        now possess,—and should you not be plunged into a state of need from which your own talents
        or exertions cannot relieve you,—then shall you open this letter upon the morning of the
        10th, of July, 1843, on which day you have told me that you are to meet your
       brother.</hi></p>
<p><hi>"These directions I charge you to observe faithfully and solemnly.</hi></p>
<p><label>"THOMAS ARMSTRONG."</label></p>

<p>"How very extraordinary!" ejaculated Monroe. "Nevertheless, I have a presentiment that these
      mysterious instructions intend some eventual good to you, Richard."</p>
<p>"It's a fortin! a fortin! depend upon it," said the old butler.</p>
<p>"Upon that head it is useless to speculate," observed Richard. "I shall obey to the very
      letter the directions of my late friend, be their tendency what it may. And now that I have
      told you all that concerns myself, allow me to ask how fares it with you here. Does Ellen's
      health improve?"</p>
<p>"For the last ten days she has been confined to her bed," answered Monroe, tears starting to
      his eyes.</p>
<p>"Confined to her bed!" cried Markham. "I hope you have had proper medical advice?"</p>
<p>"I wished to call in the aid of a physician," said Monroe, "but Ellen would not permit me.
      She declared that she should soon be better; she assured me that her illness was produced only
      by the privations and mental tortures which she had undergone, poor creature! previous to our
      taking up our abode in your hospitable dwelling; and then Marian was so kind and attentive,
      and echoed every thing which Ellen advanced, so readily, that I suffered myself to be
      over-persuaded."</p>
<p>"You did wrong—you did wrong, Mr. Monroe," exclaimed Markham. "Your daughter should have had
      medical advice; and she shall have it to-morrow."</p>
<p>"She appears to be mending in health, though not in spirits," observed Monroe. "But my dear
      young friend, you shall have your own way; and I thank you sincerely for the interest you show
      in behalf of one who is dear—very dear to me."</p>
<p>Richard pressed the hand of the old man, and retired to his chamber, to seek that repose of
      which he stood so much in need after his journey. But ere he sought his couch, he sate down
      and wrote the following note to Count Alteroni, that it might be despatched to Richmond
      without delay in the morning:—</p>
<quote>
<p>"Mr. Markham regrets to be the means of communicating news of an afflicting nature to Count
       Alteroni; nor should he intrude himself again upon Count Alteroni's notice, did he not feel
       himself urged by a solemn duty to do so in the present instance. Count Alteroni's old and
       esteemed friend, Thomas Armstrong, is no more. He departed this life four days ago, at
       Boulogne-sur-Mer. Mr. Markham had the melancholy honour of closing the eyes of a good man and
       true patriot, and of following his remains to the tomb."</p>
