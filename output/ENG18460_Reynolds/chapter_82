<head>CHAPTER LXXXII. THE MEDICAL MAN.</head>
<p>IN the morning, when Ellen awoke at about eight o'clock, the first news she heard from
      Marian's lips was the return of Richard Markham.</p>
<p>The first sentiment which this announcement excited in the mind of the young lady, was one
      of extreme joy and thankfulness that her accouchement should have occurred so prematurely, and
      thus have happened during his absence; but this feeling was succeeded by one of vague alarm
      and undefined dread, lest by some means or other her secret should transpire.</p>
<p>This fear she expressed to Marian.</p>
<p>"No, Miss—that is impossible," said the faithful attendant. "The child is provided for; and
      the surgeon is totally ignorant of the house to which he was brought the night the poor infant
      was born. How could Mr. Markham discover your secret?"</p>
<p>"It is perhaps my conscience, Marian, that alarms me," returned Ellen; "but I confess that I
      tremble. Do you think that Mr. Wentworth is to be relied upon, even if he should suspect or
      should ever discover—"</p>
<p>"Mr. Greenwood has purchased his silence, Miss. Do not be down-hearted. I declare you are
      quite white in the face—and you seem to tremble so, the bed shakes. Pray—dear Miss—don't give
      way to these idle alarms!"</p>
<p>"I shall be more composed presently, Marian."</p>
<p>"And I will just step down stairs and get up your breakfast."</p>
<p>When Ellen was alone, she buried her face in the pillow and wept bitterly; and from time to
      time her voice, almost choked with sobs, gave utterance to the words—"My child! my child!"</p>
<p>Oh! how happy would she have been, could she have proclaimed herself a mother without shame,
      and have spoken of her child to her father and her friend without a blush.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Marian returned to the room; and Ellen hastened to assume an air of
      composure. She wiped away her tears, and sate up in the bed, supported by pillows—for she was
      yet very weak and sickly—to partake of some refreshment.</p>
<p>"Mr. Markham is up and has already gone out," said Marian, as she attended upon her lovely
      young patient. "He left word with Whittingham to tell me that he should come up, and see you
      on his return in half an hour."</p>
<p>"I would that this first interview were over, Marian," exclaimed Ellen.
      <pb n="247"/></p>
<p>"So you said, Miss, in the morning after your accouchement, when your father was coming up
      to see you; and yet all passed off well enough."</p>
<p>"Yes—but I felt that I blushed, and then grew deadly pale again, at least ten times in a
      minute," observed Ellen.</p>
<p>Marian said all she could to re-assure the young mother; and when the invalid had partaken
      of some tea, the kind-hearted servant left her, in order to attend to her own domestic duties
      down stairs.</p>
<p>Ellen than fell into a mournful reverie, during which she reviewed all the events of the
      last two years and a half of her life. She pondered upon the hideous poverty in which she and
      her father had been plunged in the court leading out of Golden Lane; she retrospected upon the
      strange services she had rendered the statuary, the artist, the sculptor, and the
      photographer; she thought of the old hag who had induced her to enter upon that career;—and
      then she fixed her thoughts upon Greenwood and her child.</p>
<p>She was thus mentally occupied when she heard footsteps ascending the staircase; and
      immediately afterwards some one knocked at her door.</p>
<p>In a faint voice she said, "Come in."</p>
<p>The door opened, and Richard Markham entered the apartment; but, as he crossed the
      threshold, he turned and said to some one who remained upon the landing, "Have the kindness to
      wait here one moment."</p>
<p>He then advanced towards the bed, and took the young lady's thin white hand.</p>
<p>"Ellen," he exclaimed, "you have been very ill."</p>
<p>"Yes—very ill, Richard," returned the invalid, casting down her eyes; "but I am better—oh!
      much, very much better now; and, in a day or two, shall be quite well."</p>
<p>"And yet you are very pale, and sadly altered," said Markham.</p>
<p>"I can assure you that I am recovering fast. Indeed, I should have risen to-day; but Marian
      persuaded me to keep my bed a short time longer."</p>
<p>"And you have had no medical advice, Ellen. I told your father that he had done wrong—"</p>
<p>"Oh! no, Richard," interrupted Ellen eagerly; "he was anxious to call in the aid of a
      physician; but I was not so ill as he thought."</p>
<p>"Not ill!" ejaculated Markham. "You must have been very—very ill."</p>
<p>"But Marian was so kind to me."</p>
<p>"No doubt! Nevertheless I have no confidence in the nostrums and prescriptions of old
      servants and nurses; and human existence is too serious a thing to be tampered with."</p>
<p>"I assure you, Richard, that Marian has treated me most judiciously; and I am now very
      nearly quite well."</p>
<p>"Ah! Ellen," cried Markham, "I can read your heart!"</p>
<p>"You, Richard!" exclaimed the young lady, with a cold shudder that seemed to terminate in a
      death-chill at the heart.</p>
<p>"Yes," continued Markham, his voice assuming a tone of melancholy interest; "I can well
      appreciate your motives in combating the desire of your father to procure medical aid. You
      were afraid of burdening me with an expense which you feared my restricted means would not
      permit me to afford;—Oh! I understand your good feeling! But this was wrong, Ellen; for I did
      not invite you to my house to deny to either yourself or father the common attentions which I
      would bestow upon a stranger who fell sick under my roof. No—thank God! I have yet enough left
      to meet casualties like these."</p>
<p>"Ah! Richard, how kind—how generous you are," said Ellen; "but I am now really much
      better;—and to-morrow—to-morrow I shall be quite well."</p>
<p>"No—Ellen, you are very far from well," returned Markham; "but you shall be well soon. I
      have been myself this morning to procure you proper advice."</p>
<p>"Advice?" repeated Ellen, mechanically.</p>
<p>"Yes: there is a medical gentleman now waiting to see you."</p>
<p>With these words Richard hastened to the door, and said, "Miss Monroe, sir, is now ready to
      receive you. I will leave you with her."</p>
<p>The medical man then entered the chamber; and Markham immediately retired.</p>
<p>The votary of Æsculapius was a man of apparently five-and-twenty years of age—pale, but
      good-looking, with light hair, and a somewhat melancholy expression of countenance. He was
      attired in deep black. His manners were soft and pleasing; but his voice was mournful; and his
      utterance slow, precise, and solemn.</p>
<p>Approaching the couch, he took the hand of the invalid, and, placing his fingers upon the
      pulse, said, "How long have you been ill, Miss?"</p>
<p>"Oh! sir—I am not ill now—I am nearly well—I shall rise presently—the fresh air will do me
      good," exclaimed Ellen, speaking with a rapidity, and almost an incoherence, which somewhat
      surprised the medical man.</p>
<p>"No, Miss," he said calmly, after a pause, "you cannot leave your bed yet: you are in a
      state of fever. How long have you been confined to your couch?"</p>
<p>"How long? Oh! only a few days—but, I repeat, I am better now."</p>
<p>"How many days, Miss?" asked the medical man.</p>
<p>"Ten or twelve, sir; and, therefore, you see that I have kept my bed long enough."</p>
<p>"What do you feel?" demanded the surgeon, seating himself by the side of the invalid with
      the air of a man who is determined to obtain answers to his questions.</p>
<p>"I did feel unwell a few days ago, sir," said Ellen; "but now—oh! now I am quite
      recovered."</p>
<p>"Perhaps, miss, you will allow me to be the judge of that. You are very feverish—your pulse
      is rapid. Have you been taking any medicine?"</p>
<p>"No—that is, a little cooling medicine which the servant who attends upon me purchased. But
      why all these questions, since I shall soon be well?"</p>
<p>"Pardon me, Miss: you must have the kindness to answer all my queries. If, however, you
      would prefer any other medical adviser, I will at once acquaint Mr. Markham with your desire,
      and will relieve you of my presence."</p>
<p>"No, sir—as well you as another," cried Ellen, scarcely knowing what she said, and shrinking
      beneath the glance of mingled curiosity and surprise which the surgeon cast upon her.</p>
<p>"During your illness were you at all delirious?" inquired the medical adviser.</p>
<p>"Oh! no—I have not been so ill as you are led to suppose. All I require is
      repose—rest—tranquillity——"</p>
<p>"And professional aid," added the surgeon. "Now, I beg of you, Miss Monroe, to tell me
      without reserve what you feel. How did your illness commence?"</p>
<p>"Ah! sir, I scarcely know," replied Ellen. "I have experienced great mental affliction; and
      that operated upon my constitution, I suppose."
      <pb n="248"/></p>
<p>"And you say that you have been confined to your bed nearly a fortnight?"</p>
<p>"Oh! no—not so long as that," said Ellen fearful of confirming the surgeon's impression that
      she had been very ill, and consequently stood greatly in need of professional assistance: "not
      so long as that! Ten days exactly."</p>
<p>"Ten days!" repeated the medical man, as if struck by the coincidence of this statement with
      something which at that moment occurred to his memory; then glancing rapidly round the room,
      he started from his chair, and said, "Ten days ago, Miss Monroe! And at what hour were you
      taken ill?"</p>
<p>"At what hour?" repeated the unhappy young lady, who trembled for her secret.</p>
<p>"Yes—at what hour?" demanded the surgeon, the slow solemnity of his tone changing to a
      strange rapidity of utterance: "was it not a little before midnight?"</p>
<p>"Sir—what do you mean? why do you question me thus?"</p>
<p>"On that night," continued the surgeon, gazing fixedly upon Ellen's countenance, "a man with
      his eyes blind-folded—"</p>
<p>"His eyes blindfolded?" repeated Ellen mechanically, while a fearful shudder passed through
      her frame.</p>
<p>"Led by a servant wearing a black veil—"</p>
<p>"A black veil?"</p>
<p>"Entered this room—"</p>
<p>"Ah! my God—spare me!"</p>
<p>"And delivered a lady of a male child."</p>
<p>"How do you know it, sir? who told you?"</p>
<p>"That man was myself!" cried the surgeon emphatically.</p>
<p>"Oh! kill me—kill me!" exclaimed Ellen; and covering her face with her hands, she burst into
      an agony of tears and heart-wrung sobs.</p>
<p>"Yes," continued the surgeon, pacing the room, and glancing rapidly on all sides: "there is
      the chest of drawers against which I dashed my foot—here stood the bed—here the table—I sate
      down in this chair—Oh! now I remember all!"</p>
<p>And for some moments he walked up and down the room in profound silence.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ellen started up to a sitting posture in the bed, and exclaimed, "My child, sir?
      Tell me—have you taken care of my child?"</p>
<p>"Yes—Miss—Madam," replied Mr. Wentworth; "the little boy thrives well, although deprived of
      his natural nourishment."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir—thank you at least for that assurance," said Ellen. "Oh! sir—you cannot
      understand how deeply a mother feels to be separated from her child!"</p>
<p>"Poor girl," said the surgeon, in a compassionate tone; "you have then suffered very
      much?"</p>
<p>"God alone knows what I have endured for months past, mentally and bodily!" cried Ellen,
      clasping her hands together. "And now you know all, sir—will you betray me? say, sir—will you
      betray me?"</p>
<p>Mr. Wentworth appeared to reflect deeply for some moments.</p>
<p>Ellen awaited his reply in a state of the most agonising suspense.</p>
<p>"Miss Monroe," at length said Mr. Wentworth, speaking in his usual solemn and grave tone,
      "you know your own affairs better than I; but would it not be well to confide in those friends
      by whom you are surrounded?"</p>
<p>"I would die first—die by my own hand!" answered Ellen emphatically. "If you tell me that
      you will betray me—if you leave this room to communicate my secret to Mr. Markham, who brought
      you hither, or to my father—I will not hesitate a moment—I will throw myself from the
      window—"</p>
<p>"Calm yourself, Miss Monroe. Your secret is safe in my hands."</p>
<p>"Oh! thank you, sir—a thousand times I thank you," exclaimed Ellen. "There are circumstances
      which render it necessary that this secret should not transpire—circumstances, not altogether
      connected with my own shame, which I cannot, dare not reveal to you."</p>
<p>"Enough, Miss Monroe—I do not seek to penetrate into those mysteries. Your child is with
      me—I will be a father to him!"</p>
<p>"And heaven will bless you!" said Ellen pressing the surgeon's hand with the warmth of the
      most fervent gratitude.</p>
<p>"In time you will be able to call at my house," observed Mr. Wentworth; "and you can see
      your son—you can watch his growth—mark his progress—"</p>
<p>"How kind you are! Oh! now I am rejoiced that you know all!"</p>
<p>"And no one will ever suspect the real motive of your visits," continued the surgeon. "Mrs.
      Wentworth shall call upon you in a few days; and thus an acquaintance may be commenced. With
      reference to my visit of this morning, I shall inform Mr. Markham that you will be
      convalescent in a few days."</p>
<p>Ellen once more expressed her sincere and heartfelt thanks to the surgeon, who shortly took
      his leave of her, after strictly recommending her to take the medicaments which he should send
      in the course of the day.</p>
<p>And now the recovery of the young invalid progressed rapidly; and her own mind, relieved of
      many sources of anxiety and alarm, aided nature in conducting her to convalescence; for she
      longed to behold and caress her child!</p>
