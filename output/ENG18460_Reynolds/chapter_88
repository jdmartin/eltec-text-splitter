<head>CHAPTER LXXXVIII. THE FIGURANTE.</head>
<p>THE wonders performed by the Professor of Mesmerism produced an immense sensation. The
      persons who had been admitted to the "private exhibition," did not fail to proclaim far and
      wide the particulars of all that they had witnessed; and, as a tale never loses by repetition,
      the narrative of those marvels became in a very few days a perfect romance. The reporters of
      the press, who had attended the exhibition, dressed up a magnificent account of the entire
      proceedings, for the journals with which they were connected; and the fame of the Professor,
      like that of one of the knights of the olden time, was soon "bruited abroad through the length
      and breadth of the land."</p>
<p>At length a public lecture was given, and attended with the most complete success. Ellen had
      an excellent memory; and her part was enacted to admiration. She recollected the most minute
      particulars detailed to her by the Mesmerist, relative to the interior of the houses of his
      friends, the contents of letters to be read through envelopes, the subjects of prints, and the
      lines of poetry or passages of prose in the books to be read when placed behind her. Never was
      a deception better contrived: the most
      <pb n="263"/> wary were deluded by it; and the purse of the Professor was well filled with the
      gold of his dupes.</p>
<p>But all things have an end: and the deceit of the Mesmerist was not an exception to the
      rule.</p>
<p>One evening, a gentleman—a friend of the Professor—was examining Ellen, who of course was in
      a perfect state of <hi>coma</hi>, respecting the interior of his library. The patient had gone
      through the process of questioning uncommonly well, until at length the gentleman said to her,
      "Whereabouts does the stuffed owl stand in the room you are describing?"</p>
<p>In the abstract there was nothing ludicrous in this query: but, when associated with the
      absurdity of the part which Ellen was playing, and entering as a link into the chain of
      curious ideas that occupied her mind at the moment, it assumed a shape so truly ridiculous
      that her gravity was completely overcome. She burst into an immoderate fit of laughter: her
      eyes opened wide—the perfect state of coma vanished in a moment—the <hi>clairvoyance</hi> was
      forgotten—the catalepsy disappeared—and the patient became unmesmerised in a moment, in total
      defiance of all the prescribed rules and regulations of Animal Magnetism!</p>
<p>Laughter is catching. The audience began to titter—then to indulge in a half-suppressed
      cachinnation;—and at length a chorus of hilarity succeeded the congenial symphony which
      emanated from the lips of the patient.</p>
<p>The Professor was astounded.</p>
<p>He was, however, a man of great presence of mind: and he instantaneously pronounced Ellen's
      conduct to be a phenomenon in Mesmerism, which was certainly rarely illustrated, but for which
      he was by no means unprepared.</p>
<p>But all his eloquence was useless. The risible inclination which now animated the great
      majority of his audience, triumphed over the previous prejudice in favour of Mesmerism; the
      charm was dissolved—the spell was annihilated—"the pitcher had gone so often to the well that
      it got broken at last"—the voice of the Professor had lost its power.</p>
<p>No sooner did the hilarity subside a little, when it was renewed again; and even the friends
      and most staunch adherents of the Professor looked at each other with suspicion depicted upon
      their countenances.</p>
<p>What reason could not do, was effected by ridicule: Mesmerism, like the heathen mythology,
      ceased to be a worship.</p>
<p>The Professor grew distracted. Confusion ensued; the audience rose from their seats; groups
      were formed; and the proceedings of the evening were freely discussed by the various different
      parties into which the company thus split.</p>
<p>Ellen took advantage of the confusion to slip out of the room; and in a few moments she left
      the house.</p>
<p>Her occupation was now once more gone; and she resolved to pay another visit to the old
      hag.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in a few days she again sought the miserable court in Golden Lane.</p>
<p>It was about three o'clock in the afternoon, when the young lady entered the apartment in
      which the old hag dwelt. The wrinkled wretch was seated at the table, working. She had bought
      herself a new gown with a portion of the money which she had received from Ellen on the
      occasion of recommending the latter to the Mesmerist; and the old woman's looks were joyful—as
      joyful as so hideous an expression of countenance would allow them to be—for she thought of
      being smart once more, even in her old age. Vanity only ceases with the extinction of life
      itself.</p>
<p>"Well, my child," said the old woman, gaily; "you have come back to me again. Surely you
      have not already finished with your Mesmerist?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Ellen. "The bubble has burst; and I am once more in search of
      employment."</p>
<p>"And in such search, miss, will you ever be, until you choose to settle yourself in a manner
      suitable to your beauty, your accomplishments, and your merits," said the old woman.</p>
<p>"In what way could I thus settle myself?"</p>
<p>"Do you ask me so simple a question? May you not have a handsome house, a carriage,
      servants, money, rich garments, jewels, and a box at the Opera, for the mere asking?"</p>
<p>"I do not require so much," answered Ellen, with a smile. "If I can earn a guinea or two a
      week, I shall be contented."</p>
<p>"And do you not feel anxious to set off your charms to the greatest advantage?" demanded the
      old woman. "How well would pearls become your soft and shining hair! how dazzling would your
      polished arms appear when clasped by costly bracelets! how lovely would be your little ears
      with brilliant pendants! how elegant would be your figure when clad in rustling silk or rich
      satin! how the whiteness of your bosom would eclipse that of the finest lace! Ah! miss, you
      are your own enemy—you are your own enemy!"</p>
<p>"You forget that I have a father," said Ellen,—"a father who loves me, and whom I love,—a
      father who would die if he knew of his daughter's disgrace."</p>
<p>"Fathers do not die so easily," cried the old hag. "They habituate themselves to every
      thing, as well as other people. And then—think of the luxuries and comforts with which you
      could surround the old man."</p>
<p>"We will not talk any more upon that subject," said Ellen firmly. "I well understand your
      meaning; and I am not prudish nor false enough to affect a virtue which I do not possess. But
      I have my interests to consult; and it does not suit my ideas of happiness to accept the
      proposal implied by your language. In a word, can you find me any more employment?"</p>
<p>"I know no more Mesmerists," answered the old hag, in a surly tone.</p>
<p>"Then you can do nothing for me?"</p>
<p>"I did not say that—I did not say that," cried the hag. "It is true I can get you upon the
      stage; but perhaps that pursuit will not please you."</p>
<p>"Upon the stage!" ejaculated Ellen. "In what capacity?"</p>
<p>"As a <hi>figurante</hi>, or dancer in the ballet, at a great theatre," replied the old
      woman.</p>
<p>"But I should be known—I should be recognised," said Ellen.</p>
<p>"There is no chance of that," returned the hag. "Dressed like a sylph, with rouge upon your
      cheeks, and surrounded by a blaze of light, you would be altogether a different being. Ah! it
      seems that I already behold you upon the stage—the point of admiration for a thousand
      looks—the object of envy and desire, and of every passion which can possibly gratify female
      vanity."</p>
<p>For some moments Ellen remained lost in thought. The old woman's offer pleased her: she was
      vain of her beauty and she contemplated with delight the opportunity thus presented to her of
      displaying it with brilliant effect. She already dreamt of success, applause, and showers of
      nosegays; and her countenance gradually expended into a smile of pleasure.</p>
<p>"I accept your proposal," she said; "but—"
      <pb n="264"/></p>
<p>"Why do you hesitate?" demanded the old woman.</p>
<p>"Oh! I was only thinking that the introduction would be better——"</p>
<p>"If it did not come from me?" added the old woman, her wrinkled face becoming more wrinkled
      still with a sardonic grin. "Well, make yourself easy upon that score. I am only aware that a
      celebrated manager has a vacancy in his establishment for a figurante, and you may apply for
      it."</p>
<p>"But I am ignorant of the modes of dancing practised upon the stage," said Ellen.</p>
<p>"You will soon learn," answered the old woman. "Your beauty will prove your principal
      recommendation."</p>
<p>"And what shall I give you for your suggestion?" asked Ellen, taking out her purse.</p>
<p>When a bailiff makes a seizure in a house, he assures himself with a glance around, whether
      there be sufficient property to pay at least <hi>his</hi> expenses;—when a debtor calls upon
      his creditor to ask for time, the latter surveys the former for a moment, to ascertain by his
      countenance if he can be trusted;—the wholesale dealer always "takes stock," as it were, of
      the petty detailer who applies to him for credit;—and thus was it that the old woman
      scrutinized with a single look the capacity of Ellen's purse, so that she might thereby
      regulate her demand. And all the while she appeared intent only on her work.</p>
<p>"You can give me a couple of guineas now," the old woman at length said; "and if your
      engagement proves a good one, you can bring or send me three more in the course of the
      month."</p>
<p>This arrangement was immediately complied with, and Ellen took leave of the old hag, with
      the fervent hope that she should never require her aid any more.</p>
<p>On the following day Miss Monroe called upon the manager of the great national theatre where
      a figurante was required.</p>
<p>She was ushered into the presence of the theatrical monarch, who received her with much
      urbanity and kindness; and he was evidently pleased with her address, appearance, and manners,
      as she explained to him the nature of her business.</p>
<p>"Dancing in a ball-room, and dancing upon the stage, are two very different things," said
      the manager. "You will have to undergo a course of training, the length of which will depend
      upon your skill and your application. I have known young ladies become proficient in a
      month—others in a year—many never, in spite of all their exertions. Most of the figurantes
      have been brought up to their avocation from childhood; but I see no reason why you should not
      learn to acquit yourself well in a very short time."</p>
<p>"I shall exert myself to the utmost, at all events," observed Ellen.</p>
<p>"How are you circumstanced?" inquired the manager. "Excuse the question; but my object is to
      ascertain if you can support yourself during your apprenticeship, as we may term the process
      of study and initiation?"</p>
<p>"I have a comfortable home, and am not without resources for my present wants," answered
      Ellen.</p>
<p>"So far, so good," said the manager. "I do not seek to pry into your secrets. You know best
      what motives induce you to adopt the stage: my business is to secure the services of young,
      handsome, and elegant ladies, to form my <hi>corps de ballet</hi>. It is no compliment to you
      to say that you will answer my purpose, provided your studies are successful."</p>
<p>"With whom am I to study, sir?"</p>
<p>"My ballet-master will instruct you," replied the manager. "You can attend his class. If you
      will come to the theatre to-morrow morning at ten o'clock, you can take your first
      lesson."</p>
<p>Ellen assented to the proposal, and took leave of the manager. They were mutually satisfied
      with this interview: the manager was pleased with the idea of securing the services of a young
      lady of great beauty, perfect figure, and exquisite grace;—and, on her side, Ellen was cheered
      with the prospect of embracing an avocation which, she hoped, would render her independent of
      the bounty of others.</p>
<p>And now her training commenced. In the first place her feet were placed in a groove-box,
      heel to heel, so that they formed only one straight line, and with the knees turned outwards.
      This process is called "<hi>se tourner</hi>." At first the pain was excruciating—it was a
      perfect martyrdom; but the fair student supported it without a murmur; and in a very few days
      her feet accustomed themselves, as it were, to fall in dancing parallel to each other.</p>
<p>The second lesson in the course of training consisted of resting the right foot on a bar,
      which Ellen was compelled to hold in a horizontal line with her left hand. Then the left foot
      was placed upon the bar, which was in this case held up by the right hand. By these means the
      stiffness of the feet was destroyed, and they were rendered as pliant and elastic as if they
      had steel springs instead of bones. This process is denominated "<hi>se casser</hi>."</p>
<p>Next, the student had to practise walking upon the extreme points of the toes, so that the
      foot and the leg formed one straight line. Then Ellen had to practise the flings, capers,
      caprioles, turns, whirls, leaps, balances, borees, and all the various cuts, steps, positions,
      attitudes, and movements of the dance. During the caprioles the student had to train herself
      to perform four, six, and even eight steps in the air; and the fatigue produced by these
      lessons was at times of the most oppressive nature.<ref target="#ENG18460_N078">[78]</ref></p>
<p>When Ellen was perfected in these portions of her training, she had to practise the tricks
      of the stage. At one time the was suspended to lines of wires; at another she was seated on
      paste-board clouds; then she learned to disappear through traps, or to make her exit by a
      window. Some of these manœuvres were of a very dangerous nature; indeed, in some, the
       <hi>danseuse</hi> actually risked her life—and all her limbs. The awkwardness of an underling
      in shifting a trap-door at the precise moment would have led her to dash her head against a
      plank with fearful violence.</p>
<p>The art of theatrical dancing is divided into two schools, called <hi>Ballonné</hi> and
       <hi>Tacqueté</hi>. The former is the branch in which Taglioni shines; the latter is that in
      which Fanny Ellsler excels. The style of the <hi>Ballonné</hi>, takes its name from the
      airiness of the balloon; it combines lightness with grace, and is principally characterized by
      a breezy and floating appearance of the figure. The <hi>Tacqueté</hi> is all vivacity and
      rapidity, distinguished by sparkling steps and twinkling measures, executed with wonderful
      quickness upon the point of the feet. In both these schools was Ellen instructed.</p>
<p>So intense was the application of Miss Monroe—so unwearied was she in her practice, so quick
      in comprehending the instructions of the master—so
      <pb n="265"/> resolute in surmounting all obstacles, that in the short space of two months she
      was a beautiful dancer. The manager was perfectly astonished at her progress; and he
      pronounced a most favourable opinion upon her chance of achieving a grand triumph.</p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>Her form became all suppleness and lightness; her powers of relaxation and abandonment of
      limb were prodigious. When attired in the delicate drapery of the ballet, nothing could be
      more beautiful—nothing more sylph-like, than the elastic airiness of her rich and rounded
      figure. The grace of her attitudes—the charm of her dance—the arrangement of that drapery,
      which revealed or exhibited the exquisite contours of her form—the classic loveliness of her
      countenance—the admirable symmetry of her limbs—and the brilliant whiteness of her skin,
      formed a whole so attractive, so ravishing, that even the envy of her sister-figurantes was
      subdued by a sentiment of uncontrollable admiration.</p>
<p>In obedience to a suggestion from the manager, Ellen agreed to adopt a well-sounding name.
      She accordingly styled herself Miss Selina Fitzherbert. She then learned that at least
      two-thirds of the gentlemen and ladies constituting the theatrical company, had changed their
      original patronymics into convenient pseudonyms. Thus Timothy Jones had become Gerald
      Montgomery; William Wilkins was announced as William Plantagenet; Simon Snuffles adopted the
      more aristocratic nomenclature of Emeric Gordon; Benjamin Glasscock was changed into Horatio
      Mortimer; Betsy Podkins was distinguished as Lucinda Hartington; Mary Smicks was displaced by
      Clara Maberly; Jane Storks was commuted into Jacintha Runnymede; and so on.</p>
<p>In her relations with the gentlemen and ladies of the corps, Ellen (for we shall continue to
      call her by her real name) found herself in a new world. Every thing with her present
      associates might be summed up in the word—<hi>egotism</hi>. To hear them talk, one would have
      imagined that they were so many princes and princesses in disguise, who had graciously
      condescended to honour the public by appearing upon the stage. The gentlemen were all
      descended (according to their own accounts) from the best and most ancient families in the
      country; the ladies had all brothers, or cousins, or uncles highly placed in the army or
      navy;—and if any one ventured to express surprise that so many well-connected individuals
      should be compelled to adopt the
      <pb n="266"/> stage as a profession, the answer was invariably the same—</p>
<p>"I entered on this career through preference, and have quarrelled with all my friends in
      consequence. Oh! if I chose," would be added, with a toss of the head, "I might have any thing
      done for me; I might ride in my carriage; but I am determined to stick to the stage."</p>
<p>Poor creatures! this innocent little vanity was a species of reward, a sort of set-off, for
      long hours of toil, the miseries of a precarious existence, the moments of bitter anguish
      produced by the coldness of an audience, and all the thousand causes of sorrow, vexation, and
      distress which embitter the lives of the actor and actress.</p>
<p>With all their little faults, Ellen found the members of the theatrical company good-natured
      creatures, ever ready to assist each other, hospitable and generous to a fault. In their gay
      moments, they were sprightly, full of anecdote, and remarkably entertaining. Many of them were
      clever, and exhibited much sound judgment in their remarks and critical observations upon new
      dramas and popular works.</p>
<p>At length the evening arrived when Ellen was to make her first appearance upon the stage in
      public. The house was well attended; and the audience was thrown into a remarkably good humour
      by the various performances which preceded the ballet. Ellen was in excellent spirits, and
      full of confidence. As she surveyed herself in the glass in her little dressing-room a few
      moments before she appeared, a smile of triumph played upon her lips, and lent fire to her
      eyes. She was indeed ravishingly beautiful.</p>
<p>Her success was complete. The loveliness of her person at once produced an impression in her
      favour; and when she executed some of the most difficult measures of the Ballonné school, the
      enthusiasm of the audience knew no bounds. The eyes of the ancient libertines, aided by
      opera-glasses and <hi>lorgnettes</hi>, devoured the charms of that beautiful girl;—the young
      men followed every motion, every gesture, with rapturous attention;—the triumph of the
       <hi>debutante</hi> was complete.</p>
<p>There was something so graceful and yet so voluptuous in her style of dancing,—something so
      bewitching in her attitudes and so captivating in her manner, that she could not have failed
      to please. And then she had so well studied all those positions which set off her symmetrical
      form to its best advantage,—she had paid such unwearied attention to those measures that were
      chiefly calculated to invoke attention to her well-rounded, and yet light and elastic
      limbs,—she had so particularly practised those pauses which afforded her an opportunity of
      making the most of her fine person, that her dancing excited pleasure in every
      sense—delighting the eye, producing an effect as of a musical and harmonious feeling in the
      mind, and exciting in the breasts of the male portion of the spectators passions of rapture
      and desire.</p>
<p>She literally wantoned in the gay and voluptuous dance; at one moment all rapidity, grace,
      and airiness; at another suddenly falling into a pause expressive of a soft and languishing
      fatigue;—then again becoming all energy, activity, and animation,—representing, in all its
      phases, the soul—the spirit—the very poetry of the dance!</p>
<p>At length the toils of her first performance ended. There was not a dissenting voice, when
      she was called for before the curtain. And then, as she came forward, led by the manager,
      flowers fell around her—and handkerchiefs were waved by fair hands—and a thousand enthusiastic
      voices proclaimed her success. Her hopes were gratified—her aspirations were fulfilled:—she
      had achieved a brilliant triumph!</p>
