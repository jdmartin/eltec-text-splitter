<head>CHAPTER XCVII. ANOTHER NEW YEAR'S DAY.</head>
<p>IT was the 1st of January, 1840.</p>
<p>The tide of Time rolls on with the same unvarying steadiness of motion, wearing off the
      asperities of barbarism, as the great flood of ocean smooths the sharp edges of rugged
      rocks.</p>
<p>But as the seasons glide away, vainly may we endeavour to throw a veil upon the past;—vainly
      do we lament, when Winter comes, that our Spring-dreams should be faded and gone, too
      beautiful to endure;—vainly, vainly do we pray that the waves of a Lethean sea may overwhelm
      the memories of those years when Time cast flowers from his brow, and diamonds from his
      wing!</p>
<p>Time looks down upon the world from the heights of the Pyramids of Egypt; and, as he surveys
      the myriad cities of the universe swarming with life,—marks the mighty armies of all states,
      ready to exterminate and kill,—views the navies of great powers riding over every sea,—as he
      beholds all these. Time chuckles, for he knows that they are his own!</p>
<p>For the day must come when the Pyramids themselves, the all but immortal children of
      antiquity, shall totter and fall; and Time shall triumph over even these.</p>
<p>The strongest edifices crumble into dust, and the power of the mightiest nations fritters
      into shreds, beneath the hand of Time.</p>
<p>The glories of Sesostris are now a vague dream—the domination of Greece and Rome has become
      an uncertain vision: the heroes of the Crusades have long since mouldered in the earth;—the
      crescent of the Ottomans menaces Christendom no more: the armadas of Spain are extinct;—the
      thrones that Napoleon raised are cast down: of the millions that he led to conquest, during
      his meteor-like career, what numbers have left this busy scene for ever
      <pb n="297"/> and how varied are the climes in which they have found their graves!</p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>Oh, Time! what is there that can strive with thee—thou that art the expression of the
      infinite existence of God himself!</p>
<p>Alas! if Time were a spirit endowed with intellect to comprehend, and feelings to
      sympathise, how would he sorrow over the woes of that human existence, which has now occupied
      nearly sixty centuries!</p>
<p>Year after year rolls away; and yet how slowly does civilization accomplish its task of
      improving the condition of the sons and daughters of toil.</p>
<p>For in the present day, as it was in the olden time, the millions labour to support the few;
      and the few continue to monopolize the choicest fruits of the earth.</p>
<p>The rights of labour are denied; and the privileges of birth and wealth are dominant.</p>
<p>And ever, when the millions, bowed down by cares, and crushed with incessant hardships,
      raise the voice of anguish to their taskmasters, the cry is, "<hi>Toil</hi>!
      <hi>toil</hi>"</p>
<p>And when the poor labourer, with the sweat standing in large drops upon his brow, points to
      his half-starved wife and little ones, and demands the increase of his wages which will enable
      him to feed them adequately, and clothe them comfortably, the only response that meets his
      ears is still, "<hi>Toil! toil!</hi>"</p>
<p>And when the mechanic, pale and emaciated, droops over his loom, and in a faint tone
      beseeches that his miserable pittance may be turned into a fair remuneration for that hard and
      unceasing work which builds up the fortunes of his employer, the answer to his pathetic prayer
      is, "<hi>Toil! toil!</hi>"</p>
<p>And when the miner, who spends his best days in the bowels of the earth, hewing the hard
      mineral in dark subterranean caves at the peril of his life, and in positions which cramp his
      limbs, contract his chest, and early prostrate his energies beyond relief,—when <hi>he</hi>
      exalts his voice from those hideous depths, and demands the settlement of labour's rights upon
      a just basis, the only echo to his petition is, "<hi>Toil! toil!</hi>"</p>
<p>Yes—it is ever "<hi>Toil! toil!</hi>" for the millions, while the few repose on downy
      couches, feed upon the luxuries of the land and water, and move from place to place in
      sumptuous equipages!</p>
<p>It was the 1st of January, 1840.
      <pb n="298"/></p>
<p>Another New Year's Day—commemorated with feasting by those who had no reason to repine, but
      marked as the opening of another weary epoch of care and sorrow by those who had nothing for
      which to be grateful, either to heaven or to man!</p>
<p>The first day of January, 1840, was inclement and severe. The air was piercing cold, and the
      rain fell in torrents. The streets of the great metropolis were swept by a wintery wind that
      chased the poor houseless wanderers beneath the coverings of arches and doorways, and sent the
      shivering mendicants to implore an asylum at the workhouse.</p>
<p>It was evening; and the lamps diffused but an uncertain light in the great thoroughfares.
      The courts and alleys of the poor neighbourhoods were enveloped in almost total darkness; for
      every shutter was closed, and where there were no shutters, blinds were drawn down, or rags
      were stretched across the windows, to expel the bitter cold.</p>
<p>We must now request our readers to accompany us to a district of London, which is most
      probably altogether unknown to the aristocrat, even by name, and with which many of that class
      whose occupations lead them into an intimate acquaintance with the metropolis, are by no means
      familiar.</p>
<p>Situate to the east of Bethnal Green,—bounded on the north by Bonner's Fields, on the south
      by the Mile End Road, and on the east by the Regent's Canal,—and intersected by the line of
      the Eastern Counties Railway, is an assemblage of narrow streets and filthy lanes, bearing the
      denomination of Globe Town.</p>
<p>When compared with even the worst districts of the metropolis,—when placed in contrast with
      Saint Giles's or Saffron Hill,—Globe Town still appears a sink of human misery which
      civilisation, in its progress, has forgotten to visit.</p>
<p>The majority of the streets are unpaved, rugged, and broken. The individual who traverses
      them in the summer is blinded by the dust, or disgusted by heaps of putrescent offal, the
      rotting remains of vegetables, and filth of every description, which meet the eye at short
      intervals; and, in winter, he wallows, knee-deep, in black mud and stagnant water. But even in
      the summer itself, and in the very midst of the dog-days, there are swamps of mire in many of
      the streets of Globe Town, which exhale a nauseating and sickly odour, like that of
      decomposing dead bodies.</p>
<p>In the winter time Globe Town is a complete marsh. Lying low, in the vicinity of the canal,
      and on a naturally swampy soil, the district is unhealthy in the extreme. Nor do its
      inhabitants endeavour, by any efforts of their own, to mitigate the consequences of these
      local disadvantages. They seem, for the most part, to cling with a sort of natural tenacity,
      to their rags and filth. Perhaps it is the bitterness of their poverty which makes them thus
      neglectful of the first duties of cleanliness: perhaps their pinching indigence reduces them
      to a state of despair that allows them no spirit and no heart to do any thing that may conduce
      to their comfort. Whatever be the cause, it is nevertheless a fact that, with the exception of
      one or two streets, Globe Town is a district which necessity alone could compel a person of
      cleanly habits and domestic propriety to reside in.</p>
<p>And yet Globe Town contains streets delighting in aristocratic names. There is Grosvenor
      Place in which a carriage and pair would have some trouble to turn; there is Parade Street,
      where a corporal's guard could not find space to manœuvre; there is Park Street, whose most
      gorgeous embellishment is the sign of a mangle; there is Chester Place, formed by two rows of
      miserable shops; and there are Essex Street and Digby Street, where single men may obtain
      lodgings at the rate of threepence a night.</p>
<p>How strange is this affection for fine names to distinguish horrible neighbourhoods! In the
      lowest parts of Whitechapel we find Pleasant Row, Queen Street, Flower Street, Duke Street,
      and Rose Lane. In Bethnal Green, a place inhabited by the poorest of the poor is denominated
      Silver Street; and, in the same district, a filthy thoroughfare is christened Pleasant
      Street.</p>
<p>Globe Town and its immediate vicinity abound in cemeteries. To the north there is the
      Eastern London Cemetery; and to the south there are two Jews' burial grounds, and two other
      places of sepulture. With the exception of the first-mentioned one, which has only been
      recently opened, and is a large airy space neatly planted with shrubs, those cemeteries are so
      crowded with the remains of mortality, that it is impossible to drive a spade into the ground
      without striking against human bones.</p>
<p>When you once merge from the Cambridge Road, pass the new church in Bethnal Green, and
      plunge into Globe Town, it seems as if you had left London altogether,—as if you were no
      longer within the limits of the metropolis, but had suddenly dropped from the clouds into a
      strange village strangely peopled. You encounter but few persons in the streets; and those
      whom you do meet are, for the most part, squalid, emaciated, pale, and drooping. The only
      sounds of mirth which meet your ear, emanate from the casements of the public-houses, or from
      the urchins that play half-naked in the mud. With these exceptions, Globe Town is silent,
      gloomy, and sombre.</p>
<p>The shop-windows are indicative of the poverty of the inhabitants. The butcher's shed
      displays but a few slices of liver stretched upon a board, sheep's heads of no very inviting
      appearance, and hearts, lungs, and lights, all hanging together, like a Dutch clock with its
      weights against a wall. The poor make stews of this offal. The fish-stalls present "for public
      competition," as George Robins would say, nothing but the most coarse and the cheapest
      articles—such as huge Dutch plaice, haddocks, etc. In the season the itinerant venders of
      fresh-herrings and sprats drive a good trade in Globe Town. In a word, every thing in that
      district denotes poverty—poverty—nothing but pinching poverty.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Globe Town are of two kinds; being weavers, and persons who earn their
      livelihood by working at the docks or on the canal, on the one hand; and thieves, prostitutes,
      and vagrants, on the other. When a burglar or a pickpocket finds St. Giles's, Clerkenwell, the
      Mint, or Bethnal Green too hot to hold him, he betakes himself to Globe Town, where he buries
      himself in some obscure garret until the storms that menaced him be blown over. Globe Town has
      thus acquired amongst the fraternity of rogues of all classes, the expressive denomination of
      the "Happy Valley."</p>
<p>In one of the narrowest, dirtiest, and most lonely streets at the eastern extremity of Globe
      Town, there was a house of an appearance more dilapidated than the rest. It was only two
      storeys high, and was built in a very singular manner. From the very threshold of the front
      door a precipitate staircase, more nearly resembling a ladder, led to the upper apartments; so
      that when any one entered that house from the street, he had to thread no passage nor
      corridor,
      <pb n="299"/> but immediately began to ascend those steep steps. The staircase led to a
      landing, from which two doors opened into small, dirty, and dark chambers. These rooms had a
      door of communication pierced in the wall that separated them: but there were no stairs
      leading down into the lower apartments of the house. The only way of obtaining access to the
      rooms on the ground-floor, was by means of a door up an alley leading from the street, and
      running along one side of the house into a court formed by other dwellings. Thus the upper and
      lower parts of this strange building might be said to constitute two distinct tenements. The
      windows of the ground-floor rooms were darkened with shutters, at the upper part of which
      holes in the shape of hearts had been cut to admit a few straggling rays of light.</p>
<p>The rooms on the upper floor were furnished in a tolerably comfortable manner; but every
      article was wretchedly begrimed with dirt. The front apartment served as a sitting-room for
      the inmates of this strangely-built house; and the back chamber was fitted up as a
      bed-room.</p>
<p>It was evening, as we before said; and thick curtains were drawn over the two windows of the
      front room to which we have alluded. A candle with a long flaring wick, stood upon the table.
      On a good fire a kettle was just beginning to boil. The table was set out with glasses,
      bottles, sugar, lemons, pipes, and tobacco. The inmates of that room were evidently preparing
      for a carouse, while the rain beat in torrents against the windows, and the wind swept down
      the street like a hurricane.</p>
<p>But who <hi>were</hi> the inmates of that room?</p>
<p>We will proceed to inform our readers.</p>
<p>Lolling in an arm-chair, the covering of which was torn in many places, and spotted all over
      with grease, was a female, who in reality had scarcely numbered five-and-twenty years, but to
      whom the ravages of dissipation and evil passions gave the appearance of five-and-thirty. She
      had once been good-looking; and her features still retained the traces of beauty: but there
      was a deep blue tint beneath the eyes, which joined the dark thick brows, and thus seemed to
      inclose the orbs themselves in a dingy circle. The faded cheeks were coloured with rouge; but
      the dye had been so clumsily plastered on, that the effect could not deceive the most ignorant
      in such matters. This woman wore a faded light silk gown, cut very low in front, and
      disclosing a considerable portion of a thin and shrivelled neck. In a word, she had the air of
      being what she really was—a faded courtesan of a low order. Her proper name was Margaret
      Flathers; but her acquaintance, for brevity's sake, called her Meg; and, in addition to these
      appellations, the name of <hi>The Rattlesnake</hi> had been conferred upon her, from the
      circumstance that she was fond of dressing in silks or satins, which she had a habit of
      rustling as much as possible when she walked.</p>
<p>On the other side of the fire-place was seated a man of cadaverous countenance, which was
      overshadowed by a quantity of tangled black hair, and whose expression was vile and sinister
      to a degree.</p>
<p>"Half-past eight," said the woman, glancing towards a huge silver-watch which hung by a
      faded blue riband to a nail over the mantel.</p>
<p>"Yes—they can't be long now," returned her companion, who was no other than the Resurrection
      Man. "But because they're late, Meg, it's no reason why we shouldn't have a drop of blue ruin.
      The night's precious cold; and the kettle's just on the boil. Pour out the daffy, Meg."</p>
<p>The woman drew two tumblers towards her, and half filled each with gin. She then added sugar
      and lemon; and in a few moments the Resurrection Man poured the boiling element upon the
      liquor.</p>
<p>"Good, isn't it, Tony?" said the Rattlesnake.</p>
<p>"Capital, Meg. You're an excellent girl to judge of the proportions in a glass of lush."</p>
<p>"And I think, Tony," said the woman coaxingly, "that you have had no reason to complain of
      me in other respects. Twelve months all but a few days that we've been together, and I have
      done all I could to make you comfortable."</p>
<p>"And so you ought," answered the Resurrection Man. "Didn't I take you out of the street and
      make an independent lady of you? Ain't you the mistress of this crib of mine? and don't you
      live upon the fat of the land?"</p>
<p>"Very true, Tony," said the Rattlesnake. "But what would you have done without me? When that
      business took place down by the Bird-cage Walk, and you was obliged to come and hide yourself
      in the Happy Valley, you wanted some one you could rely upon to go out and buy your things,
      take care of the place, and get information whether the blue-bottles had fallen on any
      scent."</p>
<p>"All right, my girl," cried the Resurrection Man. "I <hi>did</hi> want such a person, and
      the moment after I escaped that night when I blew the old crib up, I went to you and told you
      just what I required. You agreed to come and live with me and I agreed to treat you well. We
      have both kept our bargain; and I am satisfied if you are."</p>
<p>"Oh! you know I am, Tony dear," exclaimed the Rattlesnake. "But sometimes you have been so
      cross and quarrelsome, that I didn't know what to make of it."</p>
<p>"And was there no excuse, Meg?" cried the Resurrection Man. "Did I not see my old mother and
      the Cracksman perish before my very eyes—and by my own hand too? But I do not accuse myself of
      having wilfully caused their death. There was no help for it. We should have all three been
      taken to Newgate, and never have come out of the jug again but twice—once to be tried, and the
      second time to be hung."</p>
<p>"Could they have proved any thing against you?" demanded the Rattlesnake.</p>
<p>"Yes, Meg," answered the Resurrection Man; "there was a stiff'un in the front room at the
      very moment when the police broke into the house. We had burked him on the preceding evening;
      and he was still hanging head downwards to the ceiling."</p>
<p>"It was much better, then, to blow the place up, as you did," observed the Rattlesnake.</p>
<p>"Of course it was, Meg. Don't you see," continued the Resurrection Man, after a pause,
      during which he imbibed a considerable quantity of the exhilarating fluid in his glass,—"don't
      you see that I was too old a bird not to be always prepared for such an event as that which
      happened at last? I had got together a great quantity of gunpowder in the back-room of the
      crib, and had stowed it away in brown paper parcels in a cupboard. This cupboard stood between
      the fire-place and the back wall of the house. So I had made a hole through the wall, and had
      introduced a long iron pipe into the cupboard. This pipe was ten or twelve feet in length, and
      ran all along the wall that divided my yard from the next. The pipe, so placed, was protected
      by a wooden cover or case; and any one who saw it, must have thought it was only a water-pipe.
      It was, however, filled with excellent gunpowder, and
      <pb n="300"/> there was nothing to do but to put a match to the farthest end of the pipe to
      blow up the whole place."</p>
<p>"Capital contrivance!" exclaimed the Rattlesnake. "Had you put up that pipe long before the
      police broke into the house?"</p>
<p>"Oh! yes—some months," answered the Resurrection Man; "and very lucky it was, too, that the
      pipe was water-tight, so that the rain had never moistened the powder in the least. Well, when
      the blue-bottles broke in, I rushed into the back-room, locked the door, leapt through the
      window, flew to the end of the pipe, tore out the plug, applied the match, and in a moment all
      was over."</p>
<p>"And for a long time even your old pals at the Boozing-ken on Saffron Hill, fancied you had
      been blown up with the rest," said the Rattlesnake.</p>
<p>"Of course they did, because the newspapers, which you always used to go and fetch me to
      read, said there was no doubt that every one of the gang in the house at the time had
      perished."</p>
<p>"And they also spoke of the way in which the police had followed you and the Cracksman to
      the house," said the Rattlesnake.</p>
<p>"Yes—and that was how I came to learn that the man who had hunted me almost to death, was
      Richard Markham," exclaimed the Resurrection Man, his countenance suddenly wearing an
      expression of such concentrated—vile—malignant rage, as to render him perfectly hideous.</p>
<p>"Now don't begin to brood over that," cried the Rattlesnake hastily; "for I am almost afraid
      of you when you get into one of those humours, dear Tony."</p>
<p>"No—I shan't give way now," said the villain: "I have prepared the means for revenge; and
      then I shall be happy. Ah! Meg, you cannot conceive how I gloated over the wretch the other
      night when I denounced him in the theatre! That man has been the means of making me stay in
      this infernal prison—for it has been nothing better—for weeks and months; he was the cause of
      the loss of my best friend, the Cracksman, and of my old mother, who was very useful in her
      way: and he prevented me from getting that young fellow into my power, who went and explored
      the Palace. When I think of all that I have suffered through this infernal Richard Markham, I
      am ready to go mad;—and I should have gone mad, too, if it hadn't been that I always thought
      the day of vengeance would come!"</p>
<p>"And my little attentions helped to console you Tony," said the Rattlesnake, in a wheedling
      manner that seemed peculiar to her.</p>
<p>"Oh! as for that, Meg, a man like me can be consoled by nothing short of revenge in such a
      case. I have told you the history of my life over and over again; and I think you must have
      learnt from it, that I am not a person to put up with an injury. I have often thought of doing
      to Markham as I did to the justice of the peace and the baronet—setting his house on fire; but
      then he might not learn who was the incendiary, or he might even think that it was an
      accident. My object is for him to know who strikes him, that he may writhe the more."</p>
<p>"And do you think that the Buffer and Moll are to be depended upon?" asked Margaret
      Flathers.</p>
<p>"To the back-bone," replied the Resurrection Man. "How could the Buffer possibly betray
       <hi>me</hi>, when <hi>he</hi> was one of the gang, as the newspapers called it? Besides,
      wasn't he laid by the heels in Clerkenwell Gaol for making away with the bantling to cheat the
      Burying Society? and didn't he escape? How could he go and place himself in contact with the
      police by giving information against me? And what good would it be to him to deceive me? He
      knows that I have got plenty of tin, and can pay him well. Indeed, how has he lived in the
      Happy Valley for the last eleven months and more, since he escaped out of Clerkenwell? Haven't
      I been as good as a brother to him, and lent him money over and over again?"</p>
<p>"Very true," said the Rattlesnake. "I only spoke on your account."</p>
<p>"I shall be able to let the Buffer in for several good things, now that I am determined to
      commence an active life again," continued the Resurrection Man. "I have been idle quite long
      enough; and I am not going to remain so any more. Why, Greenwood alone ought to be as good as
      an annuity to me. He can always find employment for a skilful and daring fellow like me."</p>
<p>"And he pays like a prince, doesn't he?" demanded the Rattlesnake.</p>
<p>"Like a prince," repeated the Resurrection Man. "Five guineas the other night for just
      attending the carrying off of the young actress. That is the way to make money, Meg."</p>
<p>"And you have got plenty, Tony, I know?" said the woman, in a tone more than half
      interrogatively, and only partially expressing a conviction.</p>
<p>"What's that to you?" cried the Resurrection Man, brutally; at the same time eyeing his
      mistress in a somewhat suspicious manner.</p>
<p>"Oh! only because you needn't have any secrets from me, Tony," returned the Rattlesnake,
      affecting a tone of indifference. "You have been out every night lately—and only for a short
      time—"</p>
<p>"Now I tell you what it is, Meg," exclaimed Tidkins, striking his fist upon the table, "you
      have asked me about my money a great many times lately; and I tell you very candidly, I don't
      like it. It looks suspicious; but, by heavens! if you attempt to play me false—"</p>
<p>"Why should you say that, Tony? Have I not given you every proof of fidelity?"</p>
<p>"Yes—you have; or else I should have known what to do in a very few moments. But why do you
      bother yourself about the money that I have got? It is very little, I can tell you; but where
      it is, it's safe enough; and if I ever catch you attempting to follow me or spy upon me when I
      go into the rooms down stairs, I'll make you repent it."</p>
<p>"Now, Tony dear, don't put yourself into a passion," said the Rattlesnake, turning pale, and
      assuming her usual wheedling tone: "I didn't mean to annoy you. All that I wanted to know was
      whether there was a chance of running short or not."</p>
<p>"Don't frighten yourself, Meg," returned the Resurrection Man. "Whenever I run low, I know
      how to get more. And now, that we mayn't have to talk upon this subject again, recollect once
      for all that I won't have you prying into any thing that I choose to keep to myself. You know
      that I am not a man to be trifled with; and if any one was to betray me—I don't mean to say
      that you ever had such an idea—I only mean you to understand that if anybody
      <hi>did</hi>—"</p>
<p>"Well—what?" said the Rattlesnake in a tone of alarm.</p>
<p>"I would not be taken alive," added the Resurrection Man; "and those who came to take me at
      all, would probably travel the same road that the police, the Cracksman, and the Mummy have
      gone already."</p>
<p>"Tony," exclaimed the woman, a deadly pallor overspreading her countenance, "you don't mean
      <pb n="301"/> to say that this house is provided with a pipe like the one—"</p>
<p>"I don't mean to say any thing at all about it, one way or another," interrupted the
      Resurrection Man coolly. "All I want you to do is to remain quiet—attend to my wishes—keep a
      close tongue in your head—and have no eyes for any thing that I don't tell you to look at,—and
      then we shall go on as pleasant as before. Otherwise—"</p>
<p>At this moment a knock at the street door was heard.</p>
<p>The Rattlesnake hastened to answer the summons, and returned accompanied by the Buffer and
      his wife.</p>
