<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>THE RICH AND THE POOR.</head>
<p>"We have had such a delightful excursion, mamma. Ellen, how I do wish you could have been
      with us!" joyously exclaimed Emmeline, as she ran into the usual sitting room, one of those
      lovely afternoons, that the first days of March so often bring, promising spring long before
      she really comes. "It is such a picturesque cottage, and Dame Collins, and Susan, and a host
      of little ones, look so nice, and so clean, and so pretty, and happy; it does one's heart good
      to look at them."</p>
<p>"Are you sure you can not find another adjective to apply to them, Emmy? You have heaped so
      many together, that it is a pity you can not find a few more."</p>
<p>"But they really do look so comfortable, and are so grateful for all you and papa have done
      for them: Emmeline's description for once, is not too flowing," rejoined the quieter Caroline,
      who had followed her sister into the room.</p>
<p>"And were they pleased with your visit?" asked Ellen.</p>
<p>"Oh, delighted! particularly at our making their pretty little parlor our dining-room, and
      remaining so long with them, that they could show us all their comforts and conveniences,
      without any bustle."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Collins is really a sensible woman. Do you not think so, mamma?" inquired
      Caroline.</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear. She has brought up her own large family and her poor orphan grandchildren so
      admirably, in the midst of their extreme poverty, and bears such a name for kindness among her
      still poorer neighbors, that I truly respect and admire her. She is quite one of those in whom
      I have often told you some of the very loftiest virtues are to be found; and yet to see her,
      as she trudges about in her homely, humble fashion, never dreaming she is doing or has done
      any thing remarkable in her hard-working life, who would suspect it?"</p>
<p>"Only look, Ellen, how beautifully our collection will be increased," continued Emmeline,
      who just at that moment was only alive to pleasure, not to contemplation, even of goodness, in
      which she much delighted, and pouring into her cousin's lap a basket of beautiful shells and
      other marine treasures. "Papa has just given us a new cabinet in time, though he only thought
      of it as a place for his Feroe curiosities. To think of his remembering our tastes even
      there!"</p>
<p>"But where did you get these from?"</p>
<p>"Why, the children were playing with some, which were so perfect, I could not help admiring
      them, and Mrs. Collins was in a bustle of pleasure that I liked any thing so trifling, because
      she could gratify me, and she made me take all these, adding, that her good man would be sure
      to look out for some more for us; for when I told her they not only pleased me, but my poor
      invalid cousin, who was Edward's sister, you should have seen how her eyes sparkled."</p>
<p>"Oh, you have quite won the dame's heart, Emmy!" said Miss Harcourt. "What with talking to
      her, and to Susan, and playing with every one of the children, and making them tell you all
      their plays and their schooling, and then gathering you a nosegay, telling them it should
      adorn your room at home!"</p>
<p>"And so it shall," gayly interrupted Emmeline; "I desired Robert to put them in water
      directly, for they were very pretty, and I like them better than the best bouquet from our
      greenhouse."</p>
<p>"I do not quite agree with you, Emmeline," said Caroline, smiling.</p>
<p>"Not you, Lina, who ever thought you would? by-the-by, I never saw you so agreeable and
      natural in a poor man's cottage in my life. What were you saying to Dame Collins? actually
      holding her hand, and something very bright shining in your eye."</p>
<p>"Dear Emmy, do not run on so," whispered Ellen, as she noticed Caroline's cheek crimson.
      Emmeline was at her side in a moment, with an arm round her neck.</p>
<p>"Caroline, dear, forgive me. I did not mean to tease you; only it was unusual, was it
      not?"</p>
<p>"I was trying to tell Mrs. Collins all I thought of her husband's share in saving our dear
      father, Emmy. I forgot all of folly and pride then."</p>
<p>"You are very seldom proud now, dearest Lina, and I was the foolish one not to have guessed
      what you were saying, with out tormenting you. Mamma, do you know I have such an admirable
      plan in my head?"</p>
<p>"First tell mamma," interrupted Caroline, "that William Grey has chosen to be a partner with
      Collins in the more extended fishing and boating business, which papa has secured them,
      instead of entering into business by himself; this has been settled since you were there, I
      think."</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear, I did not know it; but Mrs. Collins must like it, for she regretted very much
      that her sons were all scattered in different trades, and her little grandson, whose taste
      pointed to the sea, was not old enough to go out with his grandfather."</p>
<p>"But only listen to my plan, mamma, dear! William Grey and Susan Collins can not possibly
      see much of each other, without falling in love; and they will make such an industrious,
      pretty couple, and papa will give them a cottage to themselves, and I will go to their
      wedding!"</p>
<p>"Just such a plan as I should expect from your giddy brain, Emmy. But how do you know that
      Grey has any desire for a wife?"</p>
<p>"Oh, because Edward said he could not help remarking, even in the midst of that awful scene,
      how mournfully he said he would bear a hand, for he had neither mother, sister, nor wife to
      pipe for him; now, if he married Susan, he would have a very pretty wife to lament him."</p>
<p>"Poor Susan, I fancy she would rather not become his wife, if it be only to mourn for him,
      Emmy; rather a novel reason for a marriage, certainly."</p>
<p>"Oh, but mamma, dear! you know that I don't mean exactly and only that; somebody to be
      interested for, and love him. No one can be happy without that."</p>
<p>"Susan was telling me, mamma, how thankful she is to you, for finding her and her sister
      employment, that they might be able to help the family," rejoined Caroline. "I was quite
      pleased with her manner of speaking, and she blushed so prettily when Miss Harcourt praised
      the extreme neatness of her work."</p>
<p>"Ah, mamma, if you could but hear all they say of you!" again burst forth Emmeline, who it
      seemed could not be quiet, going from one subject to another with the same eager zest; "if you
      had but heard the old dame tell her astonishment and her pride, when she saw you enter their
      former miserable hut, and sitting down on an old sea-chest, invite her to tell, and listened
      to all her troubles, just as if you had been her equal, and left such comfort and such hope
      behind you, as had not been theirs for many a long day. She actually cried when she spoke, and
      so did I, because she spoke so of <hi>my</hi> mother. Oh, mother, darling, how proud your
      children ought to be, to belong to one so beloved, so revered by the poor and the rich too, as
      you are!"</p>
<p>"Flatterer!" playfully answered Mrs. Hamilton, laying her hand caressingly on her child's
      mouth, as she knelt in sport before her. "I will not bear such praise, even from you. Believe
      me, darling, to win love and respect is so easy, so delightful, that there is no merit in
      obtaining it. We ought only to be thankful, when granted such a station and such influence as
      will permit extended usefulness and thought for others, without wronging our own."</p>
<p>"Yes; but, mamma, many people do a great deal of good, but somehow or other they are not
      beloved."</p>
<p>"Because, perhaps, in their earnest desire to accomplish a great deal of good, they may not
      think quite enough of <hi>little</hi> things, and of the quick sympathy with other persons'
      feelings, which is the real secret of winning love, and without which, sometimes even the
      greatest benefit is not valued as it ought to be. But did you see old Collins himself?"</p>
<p>"He came in just before we left, and was so delighted to see papa sitting in his ingle-nook,
      and only wished Edward had been there too."</p>
<p>"And where is your father?" asked Mrs. Hamilton. "Did he not return with you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but Edward wanted him, and they are in the library. I am quite certain there is some
      conspiracy between them; these long private interviews bode no good. I shall scold papa for
      being so mysterious," said Emmeline.</p>
<p>"I rather think he will return the benefit, by scolding you for being so curious, Emmy. But
      here is Edward, so the interview to-day has not been very long."</p>
<p>"Has papa been telling you old Collins' naval news, Ned?" And, without waiting for an
      answer, she continued, "that there is a fine seventy-four, the Sea Queen, preparing at
      Plymouth, to take the place of your old ship, and send back Sir Edward Manly and the Prince
      William. Now do not tell me you know this, Edward, and so disappoint me of the rare pleasure
      of telling news."</p>
<p>"I am sorry, Emmy, but I have known it for some weeks."</p>
<p>"And why did you not tell us?"</p>
<p>"Because I did not think it would particularly interest you until I could add other
      intelligence to it." He stopped, and looked alternately at Mrs. Hamilton and Ellen, as if
      asking the former whether he might proceed.</p>
<p>"And can you do so now, my dear Edward?" she replied understanding him at once. "Ellen is
      too anxious for your advancement to expect, or wish you always to remain with her. Have you
      your appointment?"</p>
<p>"Yes aunt. My uncle's letter to the admiralty brought an answer at last. It came while he
      was out, and has been tantalizing me on the library-table for four hours. But it is all right.
      As the Prince William is returning, and I am so anxious to be still in active service, I am
      permitted, though somewhat against rule, to have a berth in the Sea Queen. I am sure it is all
      uncle Hamilton's representations, and I am so thankful, so glad!"</p>
<p>"To leave us all, again, you unfeeling savage!" exclaimed Emmeline, trying to laugh off the
      universal regret at this announcement. Ellen had looked earnestly at her brother all the time
      he spoke, and then turned her face away, and a few quiet tears trickled down her cheek.
      Edward's arm was very quickly round her, and he whispered so many fond words and earnest
      assurances, united with his conviction that it would still be a whole month, perhaps more,
      before he should be summoned, as he had leave to remain with his family till the Sea Queen was
      ready to sail, that she rallied her spirits, and, after remaining very quiet for an hour,
      which was always her custom when she had had any struggle with herself, for the frame felt
      it—though neither word nor sign betrayed it—she was enabled fully to enjoy the grand delight
      of the evening—Percy's and Herbert's arrival.</p>
<p>Easter week was indeed one of family joy and thankfulness not only that they were all
      permitted once more to be together but that the heavy clouds of sin and suffering had rolled
      away from their roof, and pleasure of the sweetest and most enduring because most domestic
      kind, reigned triumphant. Percy's astonishment at Edward's growth, and the alteration from the
      handsome, joyous, rosy boy, to the pale, almost care-worn looking youth (for as long as Ellen
      bore such vivid traces of all she had endured for his sake, and was, as it were, the constant
      presence of his errors, Edward tried in vain to recover his former spirits), was most
      amusing.</p>
<p>"You are all deceived," he would declare; "one of these days you will discover you have been
      receiving a spurious Edward Fortescue, and that he is as much a pretender as his namesake,
      Charles Edward."</p>
<p>"Then he is no pretender, Percy. He is as truly the son of Colonel Fortescue, as
      <hi>Prince</hi> Charles was the grandson of James. Now don't begin a civil contest directly
      you come home; you know you and I never do agree on historical subjects, and we never shall;
      you hate Mary the great, great, great grandmother of Prince Charles, and I love her, so we
      must be always at war."</p>
<p>"Stuart-mad, as usual, Tiny! but if that really be Edward, I wish he would just look a boy
      again, I don't like the change at all; poor fellow!" he added, to himself, "it is not much
      wonder."</p>
<p>The days passed much too quickly. Emmeline wished a dozen times that the days would be
      twenty-four, instead of twelve hours long. The weather was so genial that it added to
      enjoyment, and allowed Ellen the delight, known only to such prisoners to sickness as she had
      been, of driving out for an hour or two at a time, and taking gentle walks on the terrace, and
      in the garden. The young men were to return on the Monday, and of the Saturday previous, a
      little excursion had been planned, to which the only drawback was that Ellen was not quite
      strong enough to accompany them: it was to visit Alice Seaton, whom we mentioned in a former
      chapter. Mr. Hamilton had succeeded in finding her brother a lucrative employment with a
      lawyer in one of the neighboring towns, a few miles from where she and her aunt now lived,
      enabling young Seaton to spend every Sabbath with them; and Alice now kept a girls' school on
      her own account, and conducted herself so well as never to want scholars. It had been a long
      promise to go and see her, the drive from Oakwood being also most beautiful; and as she and
      her brother were both at home and at leisure the last day in Easter, it had been fixed upon
      for the visit. Percy was reveling in the idea of driving his mother and Miss Harcourt in a new
      barouche, and the rest of the party were to go on horse back. But a dispute had arisen who
      should stay with Ellen and Edward insisted upon it, it was his right; and, so they thought it
      was agreed.</p>
<p>"I wish, dear Percy you would prevail on Edward to accompany you," pleaded Ellen, fancying
      herself alone with him, not seeing Herbert, who was reading at a distant table.</p>
<p>"I wish, dear Ellen, you were going with us," he answered, mimicking her tone.</p>
<p>"But as I can not, make him go. It always makes him more unhappy when I am prevented any
      pleasure, than it does myself; and I can not bear to keep him by me four or five hours, when
      this lovely day, and the exercise of riding, and, above all, your company, Percy, would make
      him, at least for the time, almost his own merry self, again."</p>
<p>"Thanks for the implied compliment, cousin mine," replied Percy, with a low bow.</p>
<p>"Reward me for it, and make him go."</p>
<p>"How can I be so ungallant, as to make him leave you alone?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I do not mind it, I assure you! I am well enough to amuse myself now; I can not bear
      you all giving up so many pleasures as you have done for me; I am so afraid of getting
      selfish."</p>
<p>"You selfish, Ellen? I wish you were a little more so; you are the most patient, devoted
      little creature that ever took woman's form. You have made me reproach myself enough, I can
      tell you, and I owe you a grudge for doing so."</p>
<p>"Dear Percy, what can you mean? If you knew how hard I find it to be patient, sometimes, you
      would not praise me."</p>
<p>"I mean that the last time I was at home, I was blind and cruel, and added to your
      sufferings by my uncalled-for harshness, and never had an opportunity till this moment, to say
      how grieved I was—when the truth was known."</p>
<p>"Pray do not say any thing about it, dear Percy," entreated his cousin, the tears starting
      to her eyes, as he kissed her warmly; "it was only just and natural that you should have felt
      indignant with me, for causing aunt Emmeline so much misery, and alloying all the enjoyment of
      your holidays. I am sure you need not reproach yourself; but will you make Edward go?"</p>
<p>"If it really will oblige you, Ellen; but I do not half like it." And he was going very
      reluctantly, when he met Herbert.</p>
<p>"You need not go, Percy," he said, smiling; "my ungracious cousin would not depute me as her
      messenger, but I made myself such, and so successfully that Edward will go, Ellen."</p>
<p>"Dear Herbert, how can I thank you enough! he will be so much happier with you all."</p>
<p>"Not with me," said Herbert, archly, "for I remain in his place."</p>
<p>"You!" repeated Ellen, surprised; "indeed, dear Herbert, it must not be. I shall do very
      well alone."</p>
<p>"Ungracious still, Ellen! what if I have been looking all the morning for some excuse to
      stay at home, without owning to my mother the truth—that I do not feel to-day quite equal to
      riding? If your looks were as ungracious as your words, I would run away from you into my own
      room; but as they are rather more gratifying to my self-love, we will send them all away, and
      enjoy our own quiet pleasures and your little drive together, Nell."</p>
<p>Whatever Ellen might have said to convince him she could be happy alone, the beaming look of
      pleasure on her countenance, satisfied all parties as to the excellence of this arrangement;
      and happy, indeed, the day was. Herbert seemed to understand her unexpressed feelings so
      fully; and that always makes the charm of conversation, whatever its subject. We do not
      require the <hi>expression in words</hi> of sympathy—it is an indescribable something that
      betrays its existence. Favorite authors—and Herbert was almost surprised at Ellen's dawning
      taste and judgment in literature—the delights of nature after a long confinement, as if every
      flower were more sweet, every bit of landscape, or wood, or water more beautiful, and the many
      holy thoughts and pure joys springing from such feelings, were all discussed, either cosily in
      their sitting-room, or in their ramble in the garden; and after Ellen's early dinner, which
      Herbert shared with her as lunch, she proposed, what she knew he would like, that her drive
      should be to Greville Manor, and they might spend a full hour with their friends, and yet be
      back in time. Herbert assented gladly; and the warm welcome they received, Mrs. Greville's
      kind care of Ellen, and Mary's eager chat with her and Herbert, and the number of things they
      seemed to find to talk about, made the hour literally fly; but Herbert, enjoyable as it was,
      did not forget his charge, and drove her back to Oakwood while the sun still shone bright and
      warmly: and when the party returned, which they did only just in time to dress for dinner, and
      in the wildest spirits, the balance of pleasure at home and abroad, would certainly have been
      found quite equal.</p>
<p>Ellen still continued quietly to lie down in her own room while the family were at dinner,
      for she was then sufficiently refreshed to join them for a few hours in the evening. Percy and
      Emmeline, at dinner that day, kept up such a fire of wit and mirth, that it was somewhat
      difficult for any one else to edge in a word, though Edward and Caroline did sometimes
      contrive to bring a whole battery against themselves. Just as the dessert was placed on the
      table, however, sounds of rural music in the distance, advancing nearer and nearer, caused
      Percy to pause in his wild sallies, and spring with Edward to the window, and their
      exclamations soon compelled all the party to follow their example, and send for Ellen to see
      the unexpected sight too. Banners and pennons floated in the sunshine, and the greater part of
      the nautical inhabitants of Dartmouth were marshaled in goodly array beside them, headed by
      Captain Harvey and his crew, with old Collins in the midst of them; they were all attired in
      the new clothing which Mr. Hamilton had presented to them; and a fine picture Percy declared
      old Collins's head would make, with his weather-beaten, honest-speaking face, the very
      peculiar curls in which his really yellow hair was twisted, and the quid of tobacco, from
      which, even on this grand occasion, he could not relieve his mouth and cheek. A band of young
      men and girls surrounded the first banner, which, adorned with large bunches of primroses and
      violets up the staff, bore the words, "Hamilton and benevolence;" and among them Emmeline
      speedily recognized William Grey and Susan Collins, walking side by side, she looking down and
      smiling, and he so earnestly talking, that she whispered to her mother with the greatest glee,
      that her plan would take place after all. Then came a band of sturdy fishermen, chums and
      messmates of Collins, and then a band of boys and girls, from all Mr. Hamilton's own village
      schools, decked in their holiday attire, and holding in their hands tasteful garlands of all
      the spring flowers they could muster, and bearing two large banners, one with the words,
      "Fortescue forever! All hail to British sailors!" and the other a representation of the scene
      on the beach that eventful night, and the sinking vessel in the distance. The workmanship was
      rude indeed, but the effect so strikingly descriptive, that Mrs. Hamilton actually shuddered
      as she gazed, and grasped, almost unconsciously, the arm of her nephew as he stood by her, as
      if the magnitude of the danger, both to him and her husband, had never seemed so vivid
      before.</p>
<p>The windows of the dining-room had been thrown widely open, and as the rustic procession
      came in sight of those to whom their whole hearts tendered homage, they halted; the music
      ceased, and cheer on cheer resounded, till the very echoes of the old park were startled out
      of their sleep, and sent the shout back again. Percy was among them in a moment, singling out
      old Collins, whom he had tried repeatedly to see since his visit home, but never found him,
      and grasped and shook both his hands with the full vehemence of his character, pouring out the
      first words that chose to come, which better expressed his grateful feelings to the old man
      than the most studied speech. William Grey had already received substantial proofs of his
      gratitude, and so he had then only a kind nod, and a joke and look at the pretty, blushing
      Susan, which said a vast deal to both, and seemed as if he quite seconded Emmeline's plan.
      Mingling joyously with all, he had bluff words, after their own hearts, for the men, smiles
      for the maidens, and such wild jokes for the children, as lost them all decorum, and made them
      shout aloud in their glee. Herbert seconded him quite as well as his quieter nature would
      allow. Edward had hung back, even when his name was called out lustily, as if he could not
      bear such homage.</p>
<p>"Join them, my boy; their humble pleasure will not be half complete without you," whispered
      Mrs. Hamilton, earnestly, for she guessed his thoughts. "Remember only at this moment the
      large amount of happiness you have been permitted to call forth. Do not underrate a deed which
      all must admire, because of some sad thoughts; rather resolve—as you can and have
      resolved—that the alloy shall be burned away, and the true metal alone remain, for my sake, to
      whom you have given such happiness, dear Edward."</p>
<p>The cloud dispersed from brow and heart in a moment; and he was in the midst of them, glad
      and buoyant almost as Percy; while the cheer which greeted him was almost overpowering to his
      sister, so much humble, yet earnest feeling did it speak.</p>
<p>"You really should have given us timely notice of your intentions, my good friend," said Mr.
      Hamilton, warmly grasping Captain Harvey's hand. "At least we might have provided some
      substantial refreshment after your long march, as I fear we have but slender fare to offer
      you, though Ellis and Morris are busy already, I am happy to see."</p>
<p>And urged on by their own delight at this homage both to their master and his young
      preserver, who had become a complete idol among them, a long table was speedily laid in the
      servants' hall, covered with a variety of cold meats, and bread and cheese in abundance, and
      horns of cider sparkling brightly beside each trencher. Fruit and cakes eagerly sought for by
      Emmeline, were by her distributed largely to the children, who remained variously grouped on
      the lawn, their glee at the treat heightened by the sweet and gentle manner of its
      bestowal.</p>
<p>Captain Harvey and his mate, Mr. Hamilton entertained himself, introducing them to his
      family, and especially Ellen, who, as the sister of Edward, found herself regarded with an
      interest that surprised her. Percy brought in old Collins and Grey, both of whom had expressed
      such a wish to see any one so nearly belonging to the brave young sailor; and her manner of
      receiving and returning their greeting, thanking them for the help they had so efficiently
      given her brother, made them still prouder and happier than before. After an hour and a half
      of thorough enjoyment—for their humble homage to worth and goodness had been received in the
      same spirit as it had been tendered—the procession marshaled itself in the same order as it
      had come; and rude as the music was, it sounded, as Emmeline declared, really beautiful,
      becoming fainter and fainter in the distance, and quite picturesque the effect of the banners
      and pennons, as they gleamed in and out the woody windings of the park, both music and
      procession softened in the mild, lovely twilight of the season.</p>
