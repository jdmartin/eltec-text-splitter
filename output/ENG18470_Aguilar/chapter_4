<head>RETROSPECTIVE.—EFFECTS OF COQUETRY.—OBEDIENCE AND DISOBEDIENCE.</head>
<p>Eleanor's unfounded dislike toward Arthur Hamilton did not decrease when he became her
      brother-in-law; she chose to believe that he had injured her by being the only one who had
      remained proof against all the fascinations she had thrown in his way. Even in her childhood,
      if any one chanced to notice Emmeline more than herself, it was considered a mortal offense,
      and the person who had so offended was scarcely spoken to again. Therefore that Emmeline
      should be married before herself, and to the man she intended to captivate, but <hi>not to
      love</hi>, or wed, was an offense visited upon her sister by the withdrawal of her speech for
      six months, and on Mr. Hamilton by an insulting haughtiness of demeanor toward him, at which
      he only smiled; and, to her extreme annoyance, she found that even as she had failed to
      fascinate, she equally failed to offend. He <hi>would</hi> speak to her, <hi>would</hi> treat
      her with courtesy, and the quiet familiarity of an older relative—and more, actually
      remonstrate with her conduct whenever he thought it wrong. It was the recollection of this
      time, yet more than actual present feeling, which had occasioned the mistaken impressions she
      had infused into both her children, of the extreme severity and harshness of their uncle,
      thoughtlessly indeed, for the present was always all to her, and if she did think that they
      might one day be under his charge, she little imagined the unhappiness and mischief which
      their supposition of his unbending sternness might engender.</p>
<p>To Emmeline, the change in her young life was so marvelous, so complete—care, anxiety,
      loneliness, that sinking of the whole frame and heart, from the absence of appreciation and
      social kindness, had so departed, leaving in their stead such an intensity of quiet domestic
      happiness, that it was long before her full heart could believe it reality, and rest secure.
      She had always longed for one to reverence, to cling to, and her husband gave her room for
      both. As his betrothed, even before their marriage, she had been introduced to very different
      society to that of the marchioness; she beheld him reverenced, loved, appealed to by the
      wisest and the best men, often older than himself. That this man should so love, cherish, and
      actually reverence her—no wonder that under the magic of such feelings her character matured,
      displaying such engaging and unsuspected qualities, that even her husband often looked at her
      with astonishment, playfully asking her if she could be the same calm, almost too quiet, and
      seemingly too cold Emmeline Manvers whom he had first seen. Her very talents, which had seemed
      worthless, compared to her sister's, were called forth by her husband. She found that her
      voice and her touch on either piano or harp, could give him exquisite pleasure, and this once
      discovered, she made such improvement as almost to surprise herself. She found the sketches
      taken from the various lovely spots in the vicinity of their noble seat, and in which
      Devonshire abounds, delighted him, and when Eleanor did visit Oakwood, she was astounded at
      the various beautiful drawings, which evinced the employment of that leisure which she had
      declared must be even to the quiet Emmeline a horrid bore.</p>
<p>To Lord Delmont the change in his daughter was much more astonishing than to her husband. He
      was very often at Oakwood (particularly when a little grandson was added to the happy party),
      for his home under Eleanor's extravagant and heedless management had lost all the comfort that
      Emmeline had bestowed. He had begun, too, to discover that his darling, his still favorite
      Eleanor, was not faultless. Emmeline's generous assistance and determination to spare her
      father all discomfort had concealed Eleanor's personal extravagance from him; but after her
      marriage, as Eleanor's fashionable amusements increased, so did the quantity and amount of her
      bills, which, as the young lady did not seem inclined to settle them, were sent to her father.
      Lord Delmont was painfully startled, and with his usual want of judgment spoke to Eleanor at
      the very moment that he felt most angry; unaccustomed to reproof from him, she retorted with
      equal passion, and a violent altercation ensued, which ended in Eleanor ordering the carriage
      and driving to Lady Lascelles, declaring she could not think of returning home, till her
      father had sufficiently recovered his senses for her to do so in safety.</p>
<p>The interference of Emmeline at length succeeded in restoring peace, but Lord Delmont's eyes
      had been rudely opened, and, as is unhappily too often the case with those weak characters
      where over-indulgence of childhood, has occasioned those annoyances of ungoverned youth, he
      became irritable and sometimes even harsh with Eleanor, which conduct threw her still more
      with Lady Lascelles. As to joining society with Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton, when they were in
      London, Eleanor would not hear of it. But to her sister's great joy, and some surprise, she
      accepted an invitation to Oakwood a short time after little Percy's birth; and, still more
      surprising, condescended to make herself agreeable. The London season had tired her, and she
      thought she might just as well be dull on the banks of the Dart in August and September as in
      some stupid watering-place. Mr. Hamilton, despite her dislike, which she cared not to avow,
      she found could be at least very entertaining; her father was more like his former self, her
      sister far more delightful and lovely than she ever thought she could be, and her nephew
      certainly a pretty little plague. Then Mr. Hamilton had a beautiful horse entirely for her
      use, and she rode exceedingly well, and was greatly admired. She was seized with an exploring
      mania, and dragged Emmeline to every old ruin and dark wood within ten miles of Oakwood.
      Altogether the impression she left behind her, after a two months' visit, was such as to ease
      Mrs. Hamilton's great anxiety, more especially as it appeared from certain private
      conversations, that her affections were for the first time really engaged, and Emmeline had
      always fondly hoped that when that should be the case, Eleanor would become a very different
      person. Alas! penetrative as she was, she had not yet learned her sister's character; simply
      because utter heartlessness in any woman she could not comprehend.</p>
<p>Her visit to her father in London, in the winter, removed all their rising hopes, and caused
      such increased and intense anxiety, as so to injure her already delicate health that her
      husband bore her back to Oakwood a full month before they had originally intended. Whether or
      not Eleanor loved Lord Fitzclair, it was impossible to determine; but that he devotedly,
      passionately loved her, was only too evident, not only to the world, but to herself; and this
      once confirmed, she left no method untried to torment, and so, as she declared, to try if his
      affections were worth having. He was half an Italian, and had inherited all the strong, fierce
      passions of that country, without one atom of self-control. Mr. Hamilton knew him well, far
      better than he knew himself, and conjured him to withdraw from the society of one who could
      never make him happy, and whose capricious conduct was so likely to render him desperate and
      miserable: he reasoned, entreated in vain. "She only wants to try the strength of my love,"
      was his sole reply; "and were she to torment health and life away, it will never change—she
      will be mine yet."</p>
<p>And to the astonishment of Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton, two months afterward he proposed in form,
      and actually was accepted, with the sole condition that their engagement should be kept secret
      till it should please Eleanor to name the wedding day, which could not be at least for six or
      eight months.</p>
<p>This engagement might have eased anxiety, but the condition increased it, especially, as
      instead of coming to Oakwood, as Emmeline had asked and hoped, the latter part of the summer
      and autumn was to be spent in Cheltenham with a very gay party, in which Eleanor was still of
      course the star. Mrs. Hamilton entered the nursery one morning earlier than usual, for her
      infant had not been well the night before, and she had already experienced the care as well as
      the joy of a mother. Her babe was better, and as he lay smilingly and happily in her lap, and
      watched the eager movements of his brother, she was only sensible of pleasure. The nurse had
      arranged the chairs in a long line, that Master Percy might, with their help, walk the whole
      length of the large and airy room. The feat mightily pleased the little gentleman, who, having
      acquired the venerable age of fifteen months, liked better to feel his feet than crawl on the
      floor, or be carried about on any limbs but his own. Every two or three paces he stood nearly
      alone, and burst into a loud merry laugh, which was always echoed by a crow of joy from his
      little brother.</p>
<p>"Take care, Percy, love, don't fall and frighten mamma," said his young mother, who was
      watching him with such pleasure as to send for his father to share it. When her son, to prove
      how well he obeyed her commands to take care, stood for a second without any support, and then
      ran quite alone across the room, and with a yet louder laugh hid his rosy face in her lap.
      Mrs. Hamilton fondly kissed the little nestling head, and at that moment her husband entered
      the room. "Dearest Arthur," she eagerly exclaimed, "I was actually foolish enough to send for
      you. Herbert seems quite well; I was, it seems, needlessly alarmed, and Percy has this
      moment—" She stopped in sudden terror, for there was an expression on her husband's
      countenance of such unusual agitation, that though he tried to smile when he heard her words,
      she could not conquer her alarm, more than to say, in a caressing voice to her little boy—</p>
<p>"Will not Percy run to papa, and ask him why he looks so sad?"</p>
<p>The child looked up in her face, and then, as his father held out his arms to him, let go
      his mother's dress, and obeyed her. Mr. Hamilton caught him to his heart, held him for above a
      minute, kissed him fondly, and left the nursery without uttering a single word.</p>
<p>"Let me take Master Herbert, ma'am," said the head nurse respectfully, for she saw that her
      mistress's unexpressed alarm had nearly overpowered her; and in a few minutes Emmeline was
      with her husband, whose agitation was so excessive, that even his wife's presence, for the
      moment, had scarcely power to calm him.</p>
<p>The tale was soon told. Eleanor's conduct since her engagement had been such as to excite
      the displeasure, not of her father alone, but actually of the marchioness; who, though a weak
      and worldly woman, had yet some idea of propriety. As a near relation of Lord Delmont,
      Eleanor's engagement with Lord Fitzclair was of course told to her, and again and again she
      warned her that she was going too far, and might lose her lover before she was aware of it;
      but Eleanor only laughed at her, and at last won her over to the belief that it was certainly
      better to cure Fitzclair of his jealous tendency <hi>before</hi> marriage than afterward. Lord
      Delmont's reproofs she was wont to silence, by invariably making them the signal of mortifying
      and annoying Lord Fitzclair still more than usual. Yet still at times she relented, and so
      strengthened the love she had excited, so enhanced her own fascinations, that all the agony he
      had endured and was still, he knew, to endure, by an incomprehensible contradiction, riveted
      her power and hastened his own doom. Weak in all things but his love, he could not demand as
      his actual right the publication of their engagement. Eleanor vowed if he did till she
      permitted him, she would have nothing more to say to him. She knew, though she did not say it,
      that once made known, a chain would be thrown round her actions, which she did not choose to
      endure. And father, lover, and friend, all feeling she was wrong, and the first and last
      repeatedly telling her so, had yet neither of them the resolution to contend with her, and
      compel the proper course.</p>
<p>A month of their visit to Cheltenham so passed, when Eleanor's attention was arrested by a
      new actor on the scene. She had begun to tire of her present satellites, and a young military
      captain, whose furlough from India had just expired, and whose pale face, somewhat melancholy
      expression, and very elegant figure, presented a new subject for conquest impossible to be
      resisted; and it was unhappily, only too easily achieved. She made no secret of her
      admiration, speaking of him in such terms to her intended husband as to excite anew every
      jealous feeling. It was easy for Captain Fortescue to discover Fitzclair was his rival; but
      believing himself decidedly the object of Eleanor's preference, he increased his attentions,
      little imagining the storm he was exciting, the more fearful from its determined suppression.
      Lord Delmont interfered several times, not only by reproaches to Eleanor, but by determined
      coldness to her new suitor. Finding at length that her encouragement actually neared a
      criminal extent, and after a desperately stormy interview, he solemnly declared that if she
      did not dismiss Captain Fortescue at once, he would shame her in the face of the whole world,
      by proclaiming her engagement with the young marquis. Eleanor in equal anger, declared that if
      he threatened, so too could she; and if he tormented her any more she would prevent all
      publication of her engagement, by herself snapping it asunder, and pledging her faith to
      Captain Fortescue. This was too much even for Lord Delmont. Declaring if she did so, a
      father's heaviest malediction should fall on her head, he hastily left her; and Eleanor very
      composedly went to prepare for an excursion on horseback with Fortescue, Fitzclair and
      others.</p>
<p>When Lord Delmont's passions were once roused, even his ordinarily slender judgment entirely
      forsook him, and he did that which at another time, knowing Fitzclair as he did, he would have
      shrunk from. He sought him, while still exasperated, upbraided him for his weakness in
      permitting Eleanor's unprincipled conduct, and warned him that, if he did not adopt some
      strong measures to prevent it, he would certainly lose her entirely.</p>
<p>The young man heard him without reply; but his face grew livid, and he clenched his hand
      till the blood started from the nails, and in this mood of concentrated passion joined the
      riding party. The exercise itself is, to some temperaments, unusually exciting, and the
      determined coldness of Eleanor to himself, and the eagerly-received devotion of Fortescue,
      maddened him. He demanded an interview with her on their return home, struggled to speak
      calmly, expostulated, and, finally, reproached. Eleanor, already irritated; and, beyond all,
      that her lover, in general so obsequious and humble, should dare to call her to account for
      mere amusement, combined with the recollection of Captain Fortescue's flattering vows and
      willing homage, excited her to an extent of which she was herself unconscious, inasmuch as she
      firmly believed, whatever she might say then, a few soft words would speedily obliterate. She
      told him that really his jealous temperament was beyond all endurance; that he certainly must
      intend her to despise and abhor him; and that the contrast he presented to Captain Fortescue
      was such as to make her most heartily wish to put an end to their engagement, as she felt
      quite sure it must only end in misery for both; and, without waiting for a reply, she
      haughtily brushed by him, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Of the extent of Fitzclair's passion Eleanor had not the least idea, and this is saying a
      great deal, for she generally exaggerated her own power. She believed she had inflicted pain,
      but not as much as he deserved; and determined that she would torment him yet more at the ball
      that evening. But to her extreme mortification, he did not appear, and there was a vague dread
      on her spirits as she retired for the night, which prevented any thing like rest. His absence
      had excited surprise in all, especially Lady Lascelles, who knew that to leave Eleanor
      entirely to the attentions of young Fortescue was so unprecedented as to bode no good. But the
      wildest conjectures were far from reality. The very next morning all Cheltenham was thrown
      into the most painful excitement by the incomprehensible and most extraordinary fact of the
      suicide of Lord Fitzclair; by what occasioned, plunged into such mystery that nothing but
      sudden aberration of mind was imagined, a belief justified by the very peculiar temperament
      and manners of the young nobleman during his sojourn with them. His will, a valuable present,
      with a few lines of regard to his faithful attendant, and a letter addressed to Arthur
      Hamilton, Esq., were the sole evidences that the awful deed had not been committed without
      some preparation; but as that was often the case with madness itself, it excited no
      remark.</p>
<p>The state of Eleanor's mind when these awful tidings were communicated to her, which they
      were by her father, in his agitation and anger, without the least preparation, we leave our
      readers to imagine. Hardened, heartless, willful as she was, she was still a woman, and a very
      young one, and till Captain Fortescue appeared, had loved, as far as it was in her nature,
      Lord Fitzclair. To believe that she had nothing to do with his miserable end was an attempt so
      vain and hollow, that even she shrunk from the hopeless struggle to realize it; remorse in all
      its torturing, unmitigated anguish took possession of her, but instead of leading her to
      penitence, and thence the hope of peace, it urged her to a course of action from which she
      imagined there was no withdrawing; and which must in time, by removing her from all painful
      associations, lessen her present misery.</p>
<p>For three days and nights she never quitted her own apartment, and then joined her usual
      circles without the smallest evidence of the internal agony which was still hers. It was very
      easy to displace paleness by artificial roses, and her gay smiles and joyous sallies were
      tempered only by a judiciously-expressed horror when the late event was discussed before her,
      supposed natural to one who had known him so intimately; but the hours of loneliness which
      followed this conduct in society were terrible indeed. By a strange contrariety of feeling,
      her better nature longed for Emmeline, and her artificial, which had, alas! only too forcibly
      become her natural self, felt as if she would leave the kingdom rather than encounter the
      mild, sorrowful glance of those penetrating eyes.</p>
<p>Lord Delmont was himself in a most pitiable condition; even minor evils had always been
      great to him, and the effect of this, the wish to take Eleanor away from Captain Fortescue's
      increased and annoying attentions, and yet the dread that doing so would connect her with
      Fitzclair's death, so distracted him as to render him really ill—information which instantly
      brought Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton to Cheltenham.</p>
<p>Some young wives and mothers might have felt it hard that their domestic enjoyment should so
      continually have been disturbed and annoyed from the faults of others; but Emmeline had been
      accustomed to trace every thing that created personal suffering to the highest source, and
      feel that it was good for her, or it would not be; a conviction that enabled her to bear with
      and still to love the erring one that was the visible cause of pain.</p>
<p>Eleanor was at a gay ball the night of her arrival, and Mrs. Hamilton requested she might
      not be informed of it till the following day. About half an hour before her usual hour of
      rising after such scenes, she entered her sister's room. All around her lay the ornaments of
      the previous evening, looking so strange, gaudy, and faded in the darkened room, and judged by
      the calmer feelings of the morning. A sensation of intense depression crept over Emmeline as
      she gazed, increasing as she looked on the face of the sleeper, which, divested of its
      unnatural bloom, looked so fearfully wan and haggard. Her beautiful hair lay in tangled masses
      on her damp brow, and as Emmeline gently tried to remove it, Eleanor started and awoke.</p>
<p>"Is it already time to get up?" she said languidly, and only half unclosing her eyes; "I
      feel as if I had not slept at all. Am I dreaming?" she added, starting up, "or have I slept in
      one place, and awoke in another? Am I at Oakwood?"</p>
<p>"No, dearest Eleanor; will you not welcome me to Malvern House?"</p>
<p>The voice, the look, seemed to thrill through her; her temples were throbbing, her heart
      weighed down, as it always was when she first awoke, with an undefinable sense of guilt and
      pain; she tried to be cold, proud, reserved, but it would not do, and she suddenly flung her
      arms round her sister's neck, and burst into agonized tears.</p>
<p>It was a most unexpected greeting, and Mrs. Hamilton argued hopefully from it. Alas! the
      unwonted softening only lasted one brief half hour. She left her at Eleanor's entreaty while
      dressing, and when she returned, though the reckless girl told her with a half smile that she
      was ready for her lecture, for she could only have come from Oakwood to give her one; and that
      however severe her words might be, she could not alter her tone, that must be kind, in spite
      of herself. Yet Emmeline could not succeed in convincing her how wrongly, how cruelly she had
      acted. Eleanor would persist that she was not in the least to blame, and that poor Fitzclair's
      fearful end was only owing to his own violent passions; in fact, that he must have been out of
      his mind, and that, though it was certainly very dreadful, she had perhaps escaped a very
      terrible doom; but speak as she might, Emmeline was not deceived as to the agony she was
      actually enduring. Finding, however, that all her gentle efforts were useless, that even the
      perusal of Fitzclair's brief lines to her husband—which Eleanor insisted on seeing, and in
      which he deplored his madness in not having followed his advice, and flown from her presence,
      and bade him take his forgiveness to her, and say, that the means he had adopted would, he
      trusted, dissolve their engagement to her satisfaction—had no effect, save in causing her to
      turn so deadly pale, that her sister was convinced nothing but an almost supernatural effort
      of pride preserved her from fainting. She desisted; hoping against hope that Eleanor would yet
      repent and become a different being. She knew harshness would only harden, and so she tried to
      prevail on her father to treat her as usual, but this Lord Delmont could not do. It is strange
      how often we find those parents who have been over-indulgent to childhood, unusually harsh to
      the faults of youth. Weak characters, also, when driven to anger, are always more violent than
      firmer ones; and, certainly, Eleanor's continued haughtiness and coldness, as if she were the
      injured one, did not tend to calm him.</p>
<p>And his angry feelings were unfortunately but too soon aggravated by a proposal in form from
      Captain Fortescue for the hand of Eleanor. Without a moment's delay he dispatched a decided
      and almost insulting refusal to the young soldier, and then sought his daughter, and vented on
      her the anger and vexation which overpowered him, upbraiding her not only with the death of
      Fitzclair, but for having dared so to encourage young Fortescue as to give him courage for his
      audacious proposal. To his astonishment, he was heard without any attempt at reply; but he
      would have been startled, could he have seen the pallid cheek, compressed lip, and clenched
      hand with which, when he had left her, Eleanor muttered—</p>
<p>"Father, if it be sin to leave you, be it on your own head. I would have wedded with your
      consent, had you permitted it; but now my destiny is fixed. There is no peace in England: at
      least let me be spared the agony of breaking another loving heart."</p>
<p>Nearly three weeks rolled on, and Eleanor's extraordinary submission, and even in some
      degree withdrawal from society (for which Mrs. Hamilton's arrival was a good excuse), caused
      her father's irritation against her almost entirely to subside. That she passed several hours
      each day apart from her sister, excited no surprise. Emmeline was thankful even for her change
      of deportment, but nothing confidential ever again passed between them. That reports were
      floating about, connecting the names of Miss Manvers and the late Lord Fitzclair, seemed
      little heeded by Eleanor, though they caused natural vexation to her family. About this time
      an invitation arrived for Eleanor from a lady of rank, slightly known to her father, and
      living ten miles from Cheltenham in a beautiful villa, at which she expected a select party of
      fashionables to ruralize for a week or two. There was nothing in the note to excite the dread
      that weighed on Mrs. Hamilton's spirits, as Eleanor carelessly threw it to her for her
      perusal, but she would not express it, as Lord Delmont seemed inclined that Eleanor should
      accept it, knowing that the lady was much too exclusive for Captain Fortescue to join her
      guests, and believing that Eleanor's apparent indifference to the visit originated from that
      cause. Telling her he was so gratified by her having devoted so many evenings to her sister,
      he added, she had his full consent to go if she liked, as he could better spare her than when
      Emmeline returned to Oakwood. She quietly thanked him, but evinced no particular pleasure.</p>
<p>The day before her intended departure, the sisters were sitting together, and little Percy,
      who now ran firmly without any falls, was playing about the room. He had already displayed a
      high spirit and passionate temper, with their general accompaniment, self-will, even in
      trifles, that Mrs. Hamilton felt would render her task a trying one; but she was as firm as
      she was gentle, and faced the pain of contradicting her darling bravely:—</p>
<p>"Do not touch that, Percy, love," she said, as her little boy stretched out his hand toward
      a beautiful but fragile toy, that stood with other nick-nacks on a low table. The child looked
      laughingly and archly toward her, and withdrew his hand, but did not move from the table.</p>
<p>"Come here, Percy, you have not played with these pretty things for a long time;" and she
      took from her work-box some gayly colored ivory balls, which had been his favorite playthings,
      but just at present they had lost their charm, and the young gentleman did not move.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hamilton knelt down by him, and said quietly:</p>
<p>"My Percy will not disobey mamma, will he?"</p>
<p>"Me want that;" he replied, in the pretty coaxing tone of infancy; and he twined his little
      round arms caressingly round her neck.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hamilton felt very much tempted to indulge him, but she resisted it.</p>
<p>"But that is not a fit plaything for you, love; besides, it is not mine, and we must not
      touch what is not ours. Come and see if we can not find something just as pretty, that you may
      have."</p>
<p>And after some minutes' merry play in her lap his mother hoped he had forgotten it; but the
      little gentleman was not, he thought, to be so governed. The forbidden plaything was quietly
      grasped, and he seated himself on the ground, in silent but triumphant glee.</p>
<p>Surprised at his sudden silence, Mrs. Hamilton looked toward him. It was his first act of
      decided disobedience, and she knew she must not waver. Young as he was, he had already learned
      to know when she was displeased, and when she desired him very gravely to give her the toy, he
      passionately threw it down, and burst into a violent fit of crying. His nurse took him
      struggling from the room, and Mrs. Hamilton quietly resumed her work; but there was such an
      expression of pain in her countenance, that Eleanor exclaimed,</p>
<p>"Emmeline! I have been watching you for the last half hour, and I can not comprehend you. Do
      explain yourself."</p>
<p>"I will if I can;" and Mrs. Hamilton looked up, and smiled.</p>
<p>"Why would you not let that poor little Percy have that toy?"</p>
<p>"Because it would have been encouraging his touching or taking every thing he sees, whether
      proper for him or not."</p>
<p>"But he could not understand that."</p>
<p>"Not now, perhaps; but I wish him to know that when I speak, he must obey me. It is, I
      think, a mistaken doctrine, that we ought to give children a <hi>reason</hi> for all we desire
      them to do. Obedience can then never be prompt, as it ought to be. And, in fact, if we wait
      until they are old enough to understand the reasons for a command, the task will be much more
      difficult, from the ascendency which willfulness may already have obtained."</p>
<p>"But then why were you so cruel as to send the poor child up-stairs? Was it not enough to
      take the toy from him?"</p>
<p>"Not quite; for him to remember that he must not touch it again."</p>
<p>"And do you really think he will not?"</p>
<p>"I can only hope so, Eleanor; but I must not be disheartened if he do. He is an infant
      still, and I can not expect him to learn such a difficult lesson as obedience in one, two, or
      six lessons."</p>
<p>"And will he love you as much as if you had given it to him?"</p>
<p>"Not at the moment, perhaps, but when he is older he will love me more. And it is that hope
      which reconciles me to the pain which refusing to indulge him costs me now."</p>
<p>"And voluntarily you will bear the pain which had almost brought tears into the eyes of the
      severe and stoical Mrs. Hamilton!" exclaimed Eleanor.</p>
<p>"It was a foolish weakness, my dear Eleanor, for which my husband would have chidden me; but
      there must be pain to a mother if called upon to exert authority, when inclination so strongly
      points to indulgence."</p>
<p>"Well, if ever I have any thing to do with children, I certainly shall not be half as
      particular as you are, Emmeline. I really can not imagine what harm gratifying myself and
      Percy could possibly have done."</p>
<p>"If ever you have children, my dear Eleanor, may you have strength of mind and self-control
      sufficient to forget self, and refuse the gratification of the present moment for the welfare
      of future years!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Hamilton spoke impressively, and something, either in her words or tone, caused the
      blood to rush into Eleanor's cheeks, and she hastily walked to the window; then, as abruptly
      returning, she kissed her sister, a very rare token of affection, and declaring she was much
      too good for her to understand, quitted the room.</p>
<p>The following day, dressed for her visit, and only waiting for the carriage, Eleanor,
      accompanied by Mrs. Hamilton and her little boys, entered the same apartment. Though not in
      general fond of nursing, Eleanor had taken Herbert in her arms, and was playing with him with
      unusual fondness; Percy, who had not seen the tempting plaything since his banishment the
      preceding day, the moment his eye caught it, to the astonishment of Eleanor, ran up to his
      mother, and lisping, "Me no touch that—Percy good boy now," held up his little face lovingly
      to hers, and with a very pardonable feeling of delight, Mrs. Hamilton lifted him up and
      covered him with kisses. The feelings which thrilled through Eleanor at that moment she might
      indeed have found it difficult to explain, but she was so conscious of a change of countenance
      as to hide her face on Herbert's head. It might have been obedience and disobedience brought
      so suddenly and strangely in contrast—and who were the actors? an infant and herself. For a
      minute she recovered, stricken with sudden and agonized remorse; but it was too late, she had
      gone too far, and the announcement of the carriage was a relief from that bitter moment of
      painful indecision. Placing her baby nephew in his nurse's arms, she said, caressingly, "Will
      not Percy give Lina some of those kisses as well as mamma?" The child threw one little arm
      round her neck, and the other round that of his mother, and then burst into a merry laugh at
      thus seeing himself as it were a link between them. Never had it seemed to Eleanor that she
      had loved and admired her sister as she did at that moment; all the neglect, unkindness, she
      had shown her, all the sarcasm and satire, of which, either before or behind her, she had so
      often made her the victim, combined with an intense, but how painfully vain longing to have
      resembled her in the remotest degree, rather than be the character which had never before
      appeared so degraded, so hateful—almost overpowered her—a convulsive sob escaped her as she
      clasped Emmeline in a close embrace, and almost choked her hurried good-by! Lord Delmont and
      Mr. Hamilton were in the hall, and the former was surprised and delighted at the warmth with
      which his usually reckless child returned his kiss and farewell; the carriage drove off
      leaving unusual hope and cheerfulness behind it. Alas! in one short fortnight every rising
      hope was blighted, Emmeline's momentary dread fulfilled, and Lord Delmont experiencing, in all
      its agony,</p><quote>
