<head>HOME SCENE.—VISITORS.—CHILDISH MEDITATIONS.</head>
<p>The part of the day which to Emmeline Hamilton was the happiest of all, was that in which
      she and Caroline, and now, of course, Ellen, were with their mother alone. Not that she
      particularly liked the very quiet employment of plain work, which was then their usual
      occupation, but that she could talk without the least restraint, either about her lessons, or
      her pleasures, or her thoughts, and the stories or histories she had been reading, and if she
      thought wrong no one ever corrected her so delightfully so impressively as "mamma." The
      mornings, from three to four hours, according as their age and studies required, were always
      under the control of Miss Harcourt, with such visits from Mrs. Hamilton as gave an increased
      interest to exertion, and such interruption only as permitted their practice and lessons in
      music, which three times a week Mrs. Hamilton had as yet herself bestowed. The dressing-bell
      always rung at half-past three, and dinner was at four, to allow the lads return from Mr.
      Howard's, whose daily lessons commenced at nine and concluded at three. From half-past one to
      half-past three, in the very short days, was devoted to recreation, walking, or driving, and
      in the longer, to Emmeline's favorite time—an hour at work with her mother, and the remainder
      to the preparation of lessons and exercises for the next day, which in the winter occupied
      from five to six. From six to seven in the same generally gloomy season they read aloud some
      entertaining book with their mother and Miss Harcourt, and seven was the delightful hour of a
      general reunion at tea, and signal for such recreation till nine as they felt inclined for;
      their brothers having been employed for Mr. Howard part of the time between dinner and tea,
      with sufficient earnestness to enjoy the rest and recreation afterward, quite as buoyantly and
      gladly as their sisters; and many a merry dance enlivened their winter evenings.</p>
<p>In the summer, of course, this daily routine was frequently varied by most delightful
      excursions in the country. Mrs. Hamilton earnestly longing to implant a love of Nature and all
      its fresh, pure associations in the minds of her children while yet young, knowing that once
      obtained, the pleasures of the world would be far less likely to obtain too powerful dominion.
      That which the world often terms romance, she felt to be a high, pure sense of poetry in the
      Universe and in Man, which she was quite as anxious to instill as many mothers to root out.
      She did not believe that to cultivate the spiritual needed the banishment of the matter of
      fact; but she believed, that to infuse the latter with the former would be their best and
      surest preventive against all that was low and mean; their best help in the realization of a
      constant unfailing piety. For the same reason she cultivated a taste for the beautiful, not
      only in her girls, but in her boys—and beauty, not in arts and nature alone, but in character.
      She did not allude to beauty of merely the high and striking kind, but to the lowly virtues,
      struggles, faith, and heroism in the poor—their forbearance and kindness to one
      another—marking something to admire, even in the most rugged and surly, that at first sight
      would seem so little worthy of notice. It was gradually, and almost unconsciously, to accustom
      her daughters to such a train of thought and sentiment, that she so particularly laid aside
      one part of the day to have them with her alone; ostensibly, it was to give part of their day
      to working for the many poor, to whom gifts of ready-made clothing are sometimes much more
      valuable than money; but the <hi>education</hi> of that one hour she knew might, for the right
      cultivation of the heart, do more than the mere <hi>teaching</hi> of five or six, and that
      education, much as she loved and valued Miss Harcourt, she had from the first resolved should
      come from her alone.</p>
<p>To Emmeline this mode of life was so happy, she could not imagine any thing happier. But
      Caroline often and often envied her great friend Annie Grahame, and believed that occasional
      visits to London would make her much happier than remaining all the year round at Oakwood, and
      only with her own family. She knew the expression of such sentiments would meet no sympathy at
      home, and certainly not obtain their gratification, so she tried to check them, except when in
      company with Annie and Lady Helen; but her mother knew them, and, from the discontent and
      unhappiness they so often engendered in her child, caused her both pain and uneasiness. But
      she did not waver in her plans, because only in Emmeline they seemed to succeed: nor did she,
      as perhaps some over-scrupulous mothers would have done, check Caroline's association with
      Miss Grahame. She knew that those principles must be indeed of little worth, which could only
      actuate in retirement, and when free from temptation. That to prevent intimacy with all,
      except with those of whom she exactly approved, would be impossible, if she ever meant her
      daughters to enter the world; and therefore she endeavored so to obtain their unrestrained
      confidence and affection, as to be regarded, both now and when they were young women, as their
      first, best, and truest friend; and that end obtained, intimacies with their young companions,
      however varied their character, she felt would do no permanent harm.</p>
<p>"Dear, dear mamma!" exclaimed Emmeline, one morning about a week after her parents' return,
      and dropping her work to speak more eagerly, "you can not think how delightful it does seem to
      have you at home again; I missed this hour of the day so very much; I did not know how much I
      loved it when I always had it, but when you were away, every time the hour came I missed you,
      and longed for you so much that—I am afraid you will think me very silly—I could not help
      crying."</p>
<p>"Why, how Percy must have laughed at you, Emmy!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, he did not, mamma; I think he felt half inclined to cry too, the first day or two
      that he came home from Mr. Howard's, and could not rush up into your dressing-room, as he
      always does. He said it was a very different thing for you to go from home, than for him to go
      to London, and he did not like it at all; nor Herbert, nor Caroline, neither; though they did
      not say so much about it."</p>
<p>"I did not miss mamma after the first, quite so much as you did, Emmeline," replied her
      sister, ingenuously; "because when Lady Helen returned from London, she made me go there so
      often, and as I know you never refuse me that indulgence, mamma, and Miss Harcourt did not
      object, I was glad to do so."</p>
<p>"I have only one objection my dear Caroline, and I think you know what that is."</p>
<p>"That whenever I am with Annie I think and wish more about going to London, mamma; I am
      afraid I do; but indeed I try to think that you must know what is better for me, and try not
      to be discontented, though sometimes I know I do not succeed," and her eyes filled with
      tears.</p>
<p>"I am satisfied that you endeavor to trust my experience, my love; I am quite aware of all
      the difficulties you have to encounter in doing so, and therefore your most trifling conquest
      of self is a great source of comfort to me. I myself should feel that the pain of increased
      discontent, and so of course increased difficulty in conquering its constant accompaniment,
      ill temper, would more than balance the pleasure of Annie's society, and so not indulge in the
      one so often at the expense of the other; but of that you are yourself the best judge, and you
      know in such a case I always permit you to be a free agent. But what has become of Mary,
      Emmeline? I begged Mrs. Greville to let you be as much together as possible during my absence;
      did not her society afford you some pleasure?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, mamma, a great deal; but unfortunately Mr. Greville was at home almost all the
      time you were away, and poor Mary could not often leave her mother, and I don't feel as if it
      were quite right for me to go so often there, when he is at home. I am sure Mrs. Greville and
      Mary must both feel still more uncomfortable when any one is there to see how unkind he is,
      and hear the cruel things he says. Oh, how I do wish I could make poor Mary more happy!"</p>
<p>"She would tell you that affection is a great comfort to her, Emmy."</p>
<p>"Yours and Herbert's may be, mamma, because you are both so much better and wiser than I am;
      but I can do so little, so very little."</p>
<p>"You can be and are a great source of interest to her, my dear; and when we wish very much
      to make another person happy, you may be quite sure that the most trifling act gives pleasure;
      but Ellen looks very much as if she would like to know who this Mary is, that is so
      tried—suppose you tell her."</p>
<p>Emmeline eagerly obeyed, painting her friend in such glowing colors, that Ellen felt,
      however tried she might be, a person so good and holy must be happy, notwithstanding; besides,
      to be loved so by Mrs. Hamilton and Herbert, discovered to her mind such superior qualities,
      that she almost wondered how Emmeline could speak of her so familiarly, and think of her as
      her own particular friend. But the conversation on her, and then on other topics, so
      interested her, that she was almost as sorry as her cousin, when it was interrupted by a visit
      from Lady Helen Grahame and her daughter.</p>
<p>"Returned at length, dearest Emmeline!" was the former's lively greeting, and evincing far
      more warmth of manner than was usual to her. "Do you know, the banks of the Dart have seemed
      so desolate without their guardian spirit, that the very flowers have hung their heads, and
      the trees are withered?"</p>
<p>"I rather think the change of season, and not my absence, has been the cause of these
      melancholy facts," replied Mrs. Hamilton, in the same tone; "but even London will not change
      your kind thoughts for me, Helen."</p>
<p>"Nay, I must follow the example of my neighbors, rich and poor, whom you may appeal to as to
      the fact of your absence causing terrible lamentation; ask this naughty little girl too, who
      scarcely ever came to see me, because she had so many things to do to please mamma; but
      forgive me," she added, more seriously, as she glanced on the deep mourning of her friend, and
      indeed of all the group; "what a cold, heartless being you must believe me to run on in this
      way, when there has been so sad a cause for your absence—poor Eleanor!"</p>
<p>"I trust we may say happy Eleanor, my dear Helen; mercy has indeed been shown to her and to
      me—but we will talk of this another time. Annie," she continued, addressing Miss Grahame, who
      was already deep in conversation with Caroline, "I have another little girl to introduce to
      you, whom I hope you will be as friendly with as with Caroline and Emmeline."</p>
<p>The young lady turned round at the words, but her sole notice of Ellen, who had come timidly
      forward, was a haughty stare, a fashionable courtesy, and a few unintelligible words, which
      caused Emmeline to feel so indignant, that it was with difficulty she kept silence, and made
      Ellen so uncomfortable, that it was with even more than her usual shyness, she received Lady
      Helen's proffered hand.</p>
<p>"And why not introduce her to me too, Emmeline? I knew your mother when she was little older
      than you are, my dear; so I hope you will learn to know and to like me as fast as you
      can."</p>
<p>Ellen might have found courage to reply for there was an interest attached to all who had
      known her mother; but as she raised her eyes to speak, she again encountered Annie's rude and
      disagreeable stare, and the words died on her lips. The young party were, however, soon all in
      the garden, for Mrs. Hamilton never made any scruple in dismissing her children, when she
      wished to speak on subjects she did not choose them to hear; and she was anxious so to relate
      Eleanor's illness and change of sentiment, as to remove the impressions which her early career
      had left on Lady Helen's memory.</p>
<p>"It must be nearly time for my brothers to be returning; shall we go and look for them,
      Ellen? I dare say Edward will have a great deal to tell you," was Emmeline's affectionate
      address, as Annie and Caroline turned in a different direction; and generally judging others
      by herself, she thought that being Edward's first day of regular attendance on Mr. Howard,
      Ellen would like to know all about it as soon as possible, and they proceeded accordingly.</p>
<p>"Well, how do you like your new cousins, what are they like?" inquired Miss Grahame, the
      moment she had Caroline entirely to herself.</p>
<p>"Edward I think I may like very much; he is so affectionate and so good-natured, and as
      merry and full of fun as Percy. And he is so handsome, Annie, I think even you would admire
      him."</p>
<p>"Then altogether he must be very unlike his sister. I never saw a girl so plain, and I am
      sure she looks as if no fun could exist near her."</p>
<p>"Mamma says we must remember how short a time has elapsed since poor aunt's death, and also
      that Ellen is not strong enough to be very lively."</p>
<p>"That does not at all account for her looking cross. I am sure she has nothing to be
      ill-tempered about; there are few girls in her situation who would have made one of your
      family, as she will be. Mamma said it would be a very anxious thing for Mrs. Hamilton."</p>
<p>"Mamma did seem to think so," replied Caroline, thoughtfully; "but I fancy you are wrong,
      Annie. Ellen has not yet given any proof of ill-temper."</p>
<p>"She has had no time, my dear; but no one can be deceived by such a face. My cousin, Lady
      Adelaide Maldon, told me she could always judge people by their faces. But do you like her as
      well as her brother, Caroline?"</p>
<p>"Ask me that question this day month, my dear Annie; I can not answer you now, for I really
      do not know. I certainly do not see any thing particularly striking in her yet—I do not
      understand her; she is so dreadfully shy or timid, and so very inanimate, one can not tell
      whether she is pleased or sorry. To tell you the real truth, I am afraid I shall not like
      her."</p>
<p>"Why afraid?"</p>
<p>"Because mamma would be so sorry were she to know it. I know she wishes us to love one
      another."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, Caroline. Mrs. Hamilton can not be so unreasonable as to expect you to love every
      body alike."</p>
<p>"Mamma is never unreasonable," replied Caroline, with spirit; "and I do wish, Annie, you
      would treat Ellen exactly as you do us."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I shall not. What is Colonel Fortescue's daughter to me? Now don't be angry,
      Caroline, you and I are too old friends to quarrel for nothing: I shall certainly hate Ellen
      altogether, if she is to be a subject of dispute. Come, look kind again;" and the caress with
      which she concluded restored Caroline's serenity, and other subjects were discussed between
      them.</p>
<p>Annie Grahame was a few months younger than Caroline Hamilton (who was nearly thirteen,) but
      from having been emancipated from the nursery and school-room at a very early age, and made
      her mother's companion and confidant in all her home vexations—very pretty and engaging—she
      was very much noticed, and her visits to her titled relations in London, by causing her to
      imitate their fashionable manners, terms of speech, thoughts on dress, and rank, etc., made
      her a woman many years before her time; and though to Lady Helen's family and to Lady Helen
      herself this made her still more agreeable, from becoming so very companionable; to Mrs.
      Hamilton, and to all, in fact, who loved childhood for childhood's sake, it was a source of
      real regret, as banishing all the freshness and artlessness and warmth which ought to have
      been the characteristics of her age. Her father was the only one of her own family who did not
      admire—and so tried to check—this assumption of fine ladyism, on the part of his daughter; but
      it was not likely he could succeed, and he only estranged from him the affections of his
      child.</p>
<p>Annie Grahame had a great many fashionable acquaintances in London, but she still regarded
      Caroline Hamilton as her favorite friend. Why, she could not exactly tell, except that it was
      so very, very delightful to have some one in the country to whom she could dilate on all the
      pleasures of London, display her new dresses, new music, drawings, work, etc. (not however
      considering it at all necessary to mention that her work and drawings were only <hi>half</hi>
      her own, and Caroline was much too truthful herself to imagine it, and her mother too anxious
      to retain that guileless simplicity to enlighten her, as she was well capable of doing).
      Annie's quick eye discovered that at such times Caroline certainly envied her, and she
      imagined she must be a person of infinite consequence to excite such a feeling, and this was
      such a pleasant sensation, that she sought Caroline as much as possible during their stay at
      Moorlands. Of Mrs. Hamilton, indeed, she stood in such uncomfortable awe, though that lady
      never addressed her except in kindness, that as she grew older, it actually became dislike;
      but this only increased her intimacy with Caroline, whom she had determined should be as
      unlike her mother as possible; and as this friendship was the only one of his daughter's
      sentiments which gave Mr. Grahame unmixed satisfaction, he encouraged it by bringing them
      together as often as he could.</p>
<p>Emmeline and Ellen, meanwhile, had pursued their walk in silence, both engrossed with their
      own thoughts (for that children of eleven years, indeed, of any age, do not think, because
      when asked what they are thinking about, their answer is invariably "Nothing," is one of those
      mistaken notions which modern education is, we hope, exploding). Emmeline was so indignant
      with Annie that she felt more sure than ever that she did not and could never like her. "She
      is always talking of things mamma says are of such little consequence, and is so proud and
      contemptuous, and I am afraid she does not always tell the exact truth. I wonder if it is
      wrong to feel so toward her; one day when I am quite alone with mamma, I will ask her," was
      the tenor of her meditations.</p>
<p>But Ellen, though Annie's greeting had caused her to shrink still more into herself, and so
      produced pain, was not thinking only of her. The whole of that hour's intimate association
      with Mrs. Hamilton had puzzled her; she had doted on her father—she was sure she loved her
      aunt almost as dearly, but could she ever have given words to that affection as Emmeline had
      done, and as Edward always did? and so, perhaps, after all, she did not feel as they did,
      though the wish was so strong to caress her aunt, and sit as close and lovingly by her as
      Herbert and Emmeline and even Edward did, that its very indulgence seemed to give her pain.
      Then Caroline's confession too—could she ever have had courage to confess the indulgence of a
      feeling which she knew to be wrong—and all her aunt had said both to Caroline and Emmeline so
      fastened on her mind as to make her head ache, and she quite started when a loud shout sounded
      near them.</p>
<p>"It is only Percy," said Emmeline laughing; "I dare say he and Edward are running a race or
      having some sort of fun." And so they were; laughing, shouting, panting, they came full speed,
      darting in and out the trees in every variety of mathematical figures their ingenuity could
      frame; but as soon as Percy's restless eye discovered Emmeline, he directed his course toward
      her, exclaiming, "Holla, Edward, stop running for to-day: come here, and let us be sober. Why,
      Tiny, what brings you and Ellen out now? It is not your usual time."</p>
<p>"Ellen, Ellen, I have had such a happy day; I like Mr. Howard more than ever (he had only
      seen him twice before.) I am sure I shall get on with him, and he will teach me astronomy and
      navigation too, so I shall not be ashamed to go to sea next year; I shall learn so much
      first."</p>
<p>"Let me walk home with you, dear Edward, and do tell me every thing you have done and are
      going to do," asked Ellen, clinging to his arm, and looking in his face with such an
      expression that there was little trace of ill-temper. Emmeline meanwhile had made her brother
      a party in her indignation against Annie's pride, which he termed insolence, vowing he would
      make her feel it. And as they came in sight of her and Caroline, he called out to Ellen, who,
      all her timidity returning, tried to draw Edward into another walk.</p>
<p>"Not there, not there, Miss Nelly, you are not going to cut me in that fashion. You have
      talked quite enough to Edward and must now come to me. Edward, there's mamma; off with you to
      tell your tale of delight to her." And Edward did not wait a second bidding, leaving Ellen to
      Percy, who threw his arm affectionately round her, and began talking to her so amusingly that
      she could not help laughing, and so devoted did he appear to her, that he had only time to
      greet Miss Grahame, with a very marked and polite bow, and passed on. He wished to provoke,
      and he succeeded, for Annie was always particularly pleased when the handsome, spirited Percy
      Hamilton paid her any attention, and that he should be so devoted to his little pale,
      disagreeable-looking cousin, as not even to give her a word, annoyed her as much as he
      desired.</p>
<p>Edward's hasty progress to his aunt was slightly checked at seeing a stranger with her, but
      when he was introduced he made his bow with so much of his mother's grace, that, combined with
      the extraordinary likeness, and her feelings already interested in Mrs. Hamilton's account of
      her sister's sufferings and death, Lady Helen could not for the moment speak except to
      exclaim, "Oh, how that look recalls the past! I could almost fancy poor Eleanor herself stood
      before me."</p>
<p>"Did you—did you know my mother madam?" said Edward, with so much eagerness that his cheeks
      crimsoned and his voice trembled.—"Were you one of mamma's"—but he could not finish the
      sentence, and leaning his head against his aunt, he burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Poor child!" said Lady Helen pityingly, as Mrs. Hamilton pressed him closer to her, and
      stooped down to kiss his forehead without speaking; and that sudden and unexpected display of
      feeling contrasted with Ellen's painful shyness, stamped at once and indelibly Lady Helen's
      opinion of the two orphans.</p>
