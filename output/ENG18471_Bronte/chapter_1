<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>1801——I have just returned from a visit to my landlord—the solitary neighbour
                        that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly, a beautiful country! In
                        all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so
                        completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropist's
                        Heaven—and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the
                        desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart
                        warmed towards him when I beheld his black <pb n="2"/>eyes withdraw so
                        suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered
                        themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I
                        announced my name.</p>
<p>"Mr. Heathcliff?" I said.</p>
<p>A nod was the answer.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lockwood your new tenant, sir—I do myself the honour of calling as soon
                        as possible, after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not
                        inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of
                        Thrushcross Grange: I heard, yesterday, you had had some thoughts—"</p>
<p>"Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir," he interrupted wincing, "I should not
                        allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it—walk in!"</p>
<p>The "walk in," was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment, "Go
                        to the Deuce!" even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing
                        movement to the <pb n="3"/>words; and I think that circumstance determined
                        me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed more
                        exaggeratedly reserved than myself.</p>
<p>When he saw my horse's breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did pull out his
                        hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway, calling,
                        as we entered the court:</p>
<p>"Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse; and bring up some wine."</p>
<p>"Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose," was the
                        reflection, suggested by this compound order, "No wonder the grass grows up
                        between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters."</p>
<p>Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man, very old, perhaps, though hale and
                        sinewy.</p>
<p>"The Lord help us!" he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure,
                        while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime, in my face so sourly that
                        I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his <pb n="4"/>dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my
                        unexpected advent.</p>
<p>Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling. "Wuthering" being
                        a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to
                        which its station is exposed, in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation
                        they must have up there, at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of
                        the north wind, blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few,
                        stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all
                        stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the
                        architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply
                        set in the wall; and the corners defended with large jutting stones.</p>
<p>Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque
                        carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door,
                        above which, among a wilderness of <pb n="5"/>crumbling griffins, and
                        shameless little boys, I detected the date "1500," and the name "Hareton
                        Earnshaw," I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history
                        of the place, from the surly owner, but his attitude at the door appeared to
                        demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to
                        aggravate his impatience, previous to inspecting the penetralium.</p>
<p>One step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory
                        lobby, or passage: they call it here "the house" preeminently. It includes
                        kitchen, and parlor, generally, but I believe at Wuthering Heights, the
                        kitchen is forced to retreat altogether, into another quarter, at least I
                        distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep
                        within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the
                        huge fire-place; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on
                        the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat, <pb n="6"/>from ranks of immense pewter dishes; interspersed with silver
                        jugs, and tankards, towering row after row, in a vast oak dresser, to the
                        very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn, its entire anatomy lay
                        bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes,
                        and clusters of legs of beef, mutton and ham, concealed it. Above the
                        chimney were sundry villanous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols, and,
                        by way of ornament, three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its
                        ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone: the chairs, high-backed,
                        primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in
                        the shade. In an arch, under the dresser, reposed a huge, liver-coloured
                        bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies, and other dogs,
                        haunted other recesses.</p>
<p>The apartment, and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as
                        belonging to a homely, northern farmer with a stubborn <pb n="7"/>countenance, and stalwart limbs, set out to advantage in knee-breeches,
                        and gaiters. Such an individual, seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale
                        frothing on the round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five
                        or six miles among these hills, if you go at the right time, after dinner.
                        But, Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of
                        living. He is a dark skinned gypsy, in aspect, in dress, and manners, a
                        gentleman, that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather
                        slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss, with his negligence, because he
                        has an erect and handsome figure—and rather morose—possibly, some people
                        might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride—I have a sympathetic chord
                        within that tells me it is nothing of the sort; I know, by instinct, his
                        reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling—to
                        manifestations of mutual kindliness. He'll love and hate, equally under
                        cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence, to be loved <pb n="8"/>or
                        hated again—No, I'm running on too fast—I bestow my own attributes over
                        liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for
                        keeping his hand out of the way, when he meets a would be acquaintance, to
                        those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my
                        dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home, and only
                        last summer, I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.</p>
<p>While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown into
                        the company of a most fascinating creature, a real goddess, in my eyes, as
                        long as she took no notice of me. I "never told my love" vocally; still, if
                        looks have language, the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and
                        ears: she understood me, at last, and looked a return—the sweetest of all
                        imaginable looks—and what did I do? I confess it with shame—shrunk icily
                        into myself, like a snail, at every glance retired colder and farther; till,
                        finally, the <pb n="9"/>poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses, and,
                        overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to
                        decamp.</p>
<p>By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of
                        deliberate heartlessness, how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.</p>
<p>I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my
                        landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to
                        caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking
                        wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth
                        watering for a snatch.</p>
<p>My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.</p>
<p>"You'd better let the dog alone," growled Mr. Heathcliff, in unison, checking
                        fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. "She's not accustomed to be
                        spoiled—not kept for a pet."</p>
<p>Then, striding to a side-door, he shouted again.</p>
<p><pb n="10"/>"Joseph!"</p>
<p>Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar; but, gave no
                        intimation of ascending; so, his master dived down to him, leaving me
                            <hi>vis-à-vis</hi> the ruffianly bitch, and a pair of grim, shaggy sheep
                        dogs, who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements.</p>
<p>Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still—but, imagining
                        they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged in
                        winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy so
                        irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury, and leapt on my knees.
                        I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us. This
                        proceeding roused the whole hive. Half-a-dozen four-footed fiends, of
                        various sizes, and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre. I
                        felt my heels, and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and, parrying off
                        the larger combatants, as <pb n="11"/>effectually as I could, with the
                        poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the
                        household, in re-establishing peace.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm. I
                        don't think they moved one second faster than usual, though the hearth was
                        an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping.</p>
<p>Happily, an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch; a lusty dame, with
                        tucked up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the midst of
                        us flourishing a fryingpan; and used that weapon, and her tongue to such
                        purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only remained, heaving
                        like a sea after a high wind, when her master entered on the scene.</p>
<p>"What the devil is the matter?" he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I could
                        ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.</p>
<p>"What the devil, indeed!" I muttered. "The herd of possessed swine could have
                        had <pb n="12"/>no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir.
                        You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!"</p>
<p>"They wont meddle with persons who touch nothing," he remarked, putting the
                        bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. "The dogs do right to
                        be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?"</p>
<p>"No, thank you."</p>
<p>"Not bitten, are you?"</p>
<p>"If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter."</p>
<p>Heathcliff's countenance relaxed into a grin.</p>
<p>"Come, come," he said, "you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a little
                        wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs, I am
                        willing to own, hardly know how to receive them. Your health, sir!"</p>
<p>I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be
                        foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs: <pb n="13"/>besides, I felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement, at my
                        expense; since his humour took that turn.</p>
<p>He-probably swayed by prudential considerations of the folly of offending a
                        good tenant—relaxed, a little, in the laconic style of chipping of his
                        pronouns, and auxiliary verbs; and introduced, what he supposed would be a
                        subject of interest to me, a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages
                        of my present place of retirement.</p>
<p>I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and, before I went
                        home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit, to-morrow.</p>
<p>He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go,
                        notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with
                        him.</p>
