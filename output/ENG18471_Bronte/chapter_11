<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p>Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I've got up in a
                        sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm; I've
                        persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked
                        regarding his ways; and then I've recollected his confirmed bad habits, and,
                        hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from re-entering the dismal house,
                        doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word.</p>
<p>One time, I passed the old gate, going out of <pb n="243"/>my way, on a
                        journey to Gimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has
                        reached—a bright, frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and
                        dry.</p>
<p>I came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left
                        hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north side, on
                        the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as guide-post to the
                        Grange, and Heights, and village.</p>
<p>The sun shone yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot
                        say why, but all at once, a gush of child's sensations flowed into my heart.
                        Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before.</p>
<p>I gazed long at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole
                        near the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles which we were fond of
                        storing there with more perishable things—and, as fresh as reality, it
                        appeared that I beheld my early play-mate seated on the withered turf; his
                        dark, <pb n="244"/>square head bent forward, and his little hand scooping
                        out the earth with a piece of slate.</p>
<p>"Poor Hindley!" I exclaimed, involuntarily.</p>
<p>I started—my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child
                        lifted its face and stared straight into mine! It vanished in a twinkling;
                        but, immediately, I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the Heights.
                        Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse—supposing he should be
                        dead! I thought—or should die soon!—supposing it were a sign of death!</p>
<p>The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew: and on catching sight
                        of it, I trembled every limb. The apparition had outstripped me; it stood
                        looking through the gate. That was my first idea on observing an elf-locked,
                        brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars. Further
                        reflection suggested this must be Hareton, <hi>my</hi> Hareton, not altered
                        greatly since I left him, ten months since.</p>
<p><pb n="245"/>"God bless thee, darling!" I cried, forgetting instantaneously
                        my foolish fears. "Hareton, it's Nelly—Nelly, thy nurse."</p>
<p>He retreated out of arm's length, and picked up a large flint.</p>
<p>"I am come to see thy father, Hareton," I added, guessing from the action
                        that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not recognised as one
                        with me.</p>
<p>He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but could
                        not stay his hand. The stone struck my bonnet, and then ensued, from the
                        stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses which, whether he
                        comprehended them or not, were delivered with practised emphasis, and
                        distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity.</p>
<p>You may be certain this grieved, more than angered me. Fit to cry, I took an
                        orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him.</p>
<p><pb n="246"/>He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold, as if he
                        fancied I only intended to tempt, and disappoint him.</p>
<p>I showed another keeping it out of his reach.</p>
<p>"Who has taught you those fine words, my barn," I inquired. "The curate?"</p>
<p>"Damn the curate, and thee! Gie me that," he replied.</p>
<p>"Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it," said I. "Whose
                        your master?"</p>
<p>"Devil daddy," was his answer.</p>
<p>"And what do you learn from Daddy?" I continued.</p>
<p>He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher. "What does he teach you?" I
                        asked.</p>
<p>"Naught," said he, "but to keep out of his gait—Daddy cannot bide me, because
                        I swear at him."</p>
<p>"Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at Daddy?" I observed.</p>
<p>"Aye—nay," he drawled.</p>
<p><pb n="247"/>"Who then?"</p>
<p>"Heathcliff."</p>
<p>"I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff?</p>
<p>"Aye!" he answered again.</p>
<p>Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the
                        sentences. I known't—he pays Dad back what he gies to me—he curses Daddy for
                        cursing me—He says I mun do as I will."</p>
<p>"And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?" I pursued.</p>
<p>"No, I was told the curate should have his ——— teeth dashed down his ———
                        throat, if he stepped over the threshold—Heathcliff, had promised that!"</p>
<p>I put the orange in his hand; and bade him tell his father that a woman
                        called Nelly Dean, was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate.</p>
<p>He went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,
                        Heathcliff appeared on the door stones, and I turned directly <pb n="248"/>and ran down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I
                        gained the guide post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a
                        goblin.</p>
<p>This is not much connected with Miss Isabella's affair; except, that it urged
                        me to resolve further, on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to
                        check the spread of such bad influence at the Grange, even though I should
                        wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton's pleasure.</p>
<p>The next time Heathcliff came, my young lady chanced to be feeding some
                        pigeons in the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law, for
                        three days; but, she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and we
                        found it a great comfort.</p>
<p>Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on
                        Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as soon as he beheld her, his first precaution was
                        to take a sweeping survey of the house-front. I was standing by the <pb n="249"/>kitchen window, but I drew out of sight. He then stept across
                        the pavement to her, and said something: she seemed embarrassed, and
                        desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm: she
                        averted her face; he apparently put some question which she had no mind to
                        answer. There was another rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself
                        unseen, the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.</p>
<p>"Judas! Traitor!" I ejaculated "you are a hypocrite too, are you? A
                        deliberate deceiver."</p>
<p>"Who is Nelly?" said Catherine's voice at my elbow—I had been over-intent on
                        watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.</p>
<p>"Your worthless friend!" I answered warmly, "the sneaking rascal yonder—Ah,
                        he has caught a glimpse of us—he is coming in! I wonder will he have the art
                        to find a plausible excuse, for making love to Miss, when he told you he
                        hated her?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, <pb n="250"/>and run into the
                        garden; and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door.</p>
<p>I couldn't withhold giving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine
                        angrily insisted on silence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen,
                        if I dared be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.</p>
<p>"To hear you, people might think <hi>you</hi> were the mistress!" She cried.
                        "You want setting down in your right place! Heathcliff, what are you about,
                        raising this stir? I said you must let Isabella alone!—I beg you will unless
                        you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to draw the bolts
                        against you!"</p>
<p>"God forbid that he should try!" answered the black villain—I detested him
                        just then. "God keep him meek and patient! Every day I grow madder after
                        sending him to heaven!"</p>
<p>"Hush!" said Catherine shutting the inner door! "Don't vex me. Why have you
                            <pb n="251"/>disregarded my request? Did she come across you on
                        purpose?"</p>
<p>"What is it to you?" he growled, "I have a right to kiss her, if she chooses,
                        and you have no right to object—I'm not <hi>your</hi> husband <hi>you</hi>
                        needn't be jealous of me!"</p>
<p>"I'm not jealous of you;" replied the mistress, I'm jealous for you. Clear
                        your face, you shan't scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you shall marry
                        her. But, do you like her, tell the truth, Heathcliff? There, you wont
                        answer. I'm certain you don't!"</p>
<p>"And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?" I
                        inquired.</p>
<p>"Mr. Linton should approve," returned my lady decisively.</p>
<p>"He might spare himself the trouble," said Heathcliff, "I could do as well
                        without his approbation—And, as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to speak a
                        few words, now, while we are at it—I want you to be aware that I
                            <hi>know</hi> you have treated me infernally— <pb n="252"/>infernally!
                        Do you hear? And, if you flatter yourself that I don't perceive it you are a
                        fool—and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words you are an idiot—and
                        if you fancy I'll suffer unrevenged, I'll convince you of the contrary, in a
                        very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me your sister-in-law's
                        secret—I swear I'll make the most of it, and stand you aside!"</p>
<p>"What new phase of his character is this?" exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in
                        amazement. "I've treated you infernally—and you'll take revenge! How will
                        you take it, ungrateful brute? How have I treated you infernally?"</p>
<p>"I seek no revenge on you," replied Heathcliff less vehemently. "That's not
                        the plan—The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn against him,
                        they crush those beneath them—You are welcome to torture me to death for
                        your amusement, only, allow me me to amuse myself a little in the same
                        style—And refrain from insult, as much as you are <pb n="253"/>able. Having
                        levelled my palace, don't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own
                        charity in giving me that for a home. If I imagined you really wished me to
                        marry Isabella, I'd cut my throat!"</p>
<p>"Oh the evil is that I am <hi>not</hi> jealous, is it?" cried Catherine.
                        "Well, I won't repeat my offer of a wife—It is as bad as offering Satan a
                        lost soul—Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery—You prove it—Edgar
                        is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I begin to be
                        secure and tranquil; and, you, restless to know us at peace, appear resolved
                        on exciting a quarrel—quarrel with Edgar if you please, Heathcliff, and
                        deceive his sister; you'll hit on exactly the most efficient method of
                        revenging yourself on me."</p>
<p>The conversation ceased—Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and gloomy.
                        The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could neither lay
                        nor control it. He <pb n="254"/>stood on the hearth, with folded arms
                        brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them, to seek the
                        master who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.</p>
<p>"Ellen," said he, when I entered, "have you seen your mistress?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she's in the kitchen, sir," I answered. "She's sadly put out by Mr.
                        Heathcliff's behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it's time to arrange his
                        visits on another footing. There's harm in being too soft, and now it's come
                        to this—." And I related the scene in the court, and, as near as I dared,
                        the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could not be very prejucial to
                        Mrs. Linton, unless she made it so, afterwards, by assuming the defensive
                        for her guest.</p>
<p>Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close—His first words
                        revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame.</p>
<p>"This is insufferable!" he exclaimed. "It is disgraceful that she should own
                        him for a <pb n="255"/>friend, and force his company on me! Call me two men
                        out of the hall, Ellen—Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the
                        low ruffian—I have humoured her enough."</p>
<p>He descended, and, bidding the servants wait in the passage, went, followed
                        by me, to the kitchen. Its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion;
                        Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed vigour; Heathcliff had
                        moved to the window, and hung his head somewhat cowed by her violent rating
                        apparently.</p>
<p>He saw the master first, and made a hasty motion that she should be silent;
                        which she obeyed, abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.</p>
<p>"How is this?" said Linton, addressing her; "what notion of propriety must
                        you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to you by
                        that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk, you think
                        nothing of it—you are habituated to his baseness, <pb n="256"/>and, perhaps,
                        imagine I can get used to it too!"</p>
<p>"Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?" asked the mistress, in a tone
                        particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both carelessness
                        and contempt of his irritation.</p>
<p>Heathcliff, who had raised his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering
                        laugh at the latter, on purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton's attention
                        to him.</p>
<p>He succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights
                        of passion.</p>
<p>"I have been so far forbearing with you, sir," he said, quietly; "not that I
                        was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but, I felt you were
                        only partly responsible for that; and Catherine, wishing to keep up your
                        acquaintance, I acquiesced—foolishly. Your presence is a moral poison that
                        would contaminate the most virtuous—for that cause, and to prevent worse
                        consequences, I shall deny <pb n="257"/>you, hereafter, admission into this
                        house, and give notice, now, that I require your instant departure. Three
                        minutes' delay will render it involuntary and ignominious."</p>
<p>Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of
                        derision.</p>
<p>"Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!" he said. "It is in danger
                        of splitting its skull against my knuckles. By God, Mr. Linton, I'm mortally
                        sorry that you are not worth knocking down!"</p>
<p>My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men—he had
                        no intention of hazarding a personal encounter.</p>
<p>I obeyed the hint; but Mrs. Linton suspecting something, followed, and when I
                        attempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked
                        it.</p>
<p>"Fair means!" she said, in answer to her husband's look of angry surprise.
                        "If you have not the courage to attack him, make an apology, or allow
                        yourself to be beaten. It <pb n="258"/>will correct you of feigning more
                        valour than you possess. No, I'll swallow the key before you shall get it!
                        I'm delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each! After constant indulgence
                        of one's weak nature, and the other's bad one, I earn, for thanks, two
                        samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity! Edgar, I was defending
                        you, and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick, for daring to think
                        an evil thought of me!"</p>
<p>It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the
                        master. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine's grasp; and for safety she
                        flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was taken
                        with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale. For his life
                        he could not avert that access of emotion—mingled anguish and humiliation
                        overcame him completely. He leant on the back of a chair, and covered his
                        face.</p>
<p>"Oh! Heavens! In old days this would <pb n="259"/>win you knighthood!"
                        exclaimed Mrs. Linton. "We are vanquished, we are vanquished! Heathcliff
                        would as soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against
                        a colony of mice. Cheer up, you sha'n't be hurt! Your type is not a lamb,
                        it's a sucking leveret."</p>
<p>"I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!" said her friend. "I
                        compliment you on your taste: and that is the slavering, shivering thing you
                        preferred to me! I would not strike him with my fist, but I'd kick him with
                        my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he weeping, or is he
                        going to faint for fear?"</p>
<p>The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push. He'd
                        better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and struck
                        him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man.</p>
<p>It took his breath for a minute; and, while he choked, Mr. Linton walked out
                        by the back <pb n="260"/>door into the yard, and from thence, to the front
                        entrance.</p>
<p>"There! you've done with coming here," cried Catherine. "Get away, now—he'll
                        return with a brace of pistols, and half-a-dozen assistants. If he did
                        overhear us, of course, he'd never forgive you. You've played me an ill
                        turn, Heathcliff! But, go—make haste! I'd rather see Edgar at bay than
                        you."</p>
<p>"Do you suppose I'm going with that blow burning in my gullet?" he thundered.
                        "By Hell, no! I'll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut, before I cross
                        the threshold! If I don't floor him now, I shall murder him sometime, so, as
                        you value his existence, let me get at him!"</p>
<p>"He is not coming." I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. "There's the
                        coachman, and the two gardeners; you'll surely not wait to be thrust into
                        the road by them! Each has a bludgeon, and master will, very likely, be <pb n="261"/>watching from the parlour windows to see that they fulfil his
                        orders."</p>
<p>The gardeners, and coachman <hi>were</hi> there; but Linton was with them.
                        They had already entered the court—Heathcliff, on second thoughts resolved
                        to avoid a struggle against three underlings; he seized the poker, smashed
                        the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as they tramped in.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton who was very much excited, bid me accompany her up stairs. She
                        did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was anxious
                        to keep her in ignorance.</p>
<p>"I'm nearly distracted, Nelly!" she exclaimed, throwing herself on the sofa.
                        "A thousand smiths' hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella to shun
                        me—this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else aggravate my
                        anger at present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to Edgar, if you see him
                        again to-night, that I'm in danger of being seriously ill—I wish it may
                        prove true. He <pb n="262"/>has startled and distressed me shockingly! I
                        want to frighten him. Besides, he might come and begin a string of abuse, or
                        complainings; I'm certain I should recriminate, and God knows where we
                        should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You are aware that I am no way
                        blameable in this matter. What possessed him to turn listener? Heathcliff's
                        talk was outrageous, after you left us; but I could soon have diverted him
                        from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing. Now, all is dashed wrong by the
                        fool's craving to hear evil of self that haunts some people like a demon!
                        Had Edgar never gathered our conversation, he would never have been the
                        worse for it. Really, when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of
                        displeasure, after I had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for
                            <hi>him</hi>; I did not care, hardly, what they did to each other,
                        especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we should all be driven
                        asunder for nobody knows how long! Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for <pb n="263"/>my friend—if Edgar will be mean and jealous, I'll try to break
                        their hearts by breaking my own. That will be a prompt way of finishing all,
                        when I am pushed to extremity! But it's a deed to be reserved for a forlorn
                        hope—I'd not take Linton by surprise with it. To this this point he has been
                        discreet in dreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting
                        that policy; and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled,
                        on frenzy—I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of your countenance, and
                        look rather more anxious about me!"</p>
<p>The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt, rather
                        exasperating; for they were delivered in perfect sincerity, but I believed a
                        person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account,
                        beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control herself tolerably
                        even while under their influence; and I did not wish to <pb n="264"/>"frighten" her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for the
                        purpose of serving her selfishness.</p>
<p>Therefore I said nothing when I met the master coming towards the parlour;
                        but I took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume
                        their quarrel together.</p>
<p>He began to speak first.</p>
<p>"Remain where you are, Catherine,' he said, without any anger in his voice,
                        but with much sorrowful despondency. "I shall not stay. I am neither come to
                        wrangle, nor be reconciled: but I wish just to learn whether, after this
                        evening's events, you intend to continue your intimacy with—"</p>
<p>"Oh, for mercy's sake," interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, "for
                        mercy's sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood cannot be
                        worked into a fever—your veins are full of ice-water—but mine are boiling,
                        and the sight of such chillness makes them dance."</p>
<p><pb n="265"/>"To get rid of me—answer my question," persevered Mr. Linton.
                        "You <hi>must</hi> answer it; and that violence does not alarm me. I have
                        found that you can be as stoical as any one, when you please. Will you give
                        up Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me? It is impossible for you to
                        be <hi>my</hi> friend, and <hi>his</hi> at the same time; and I absolutely
                            <hi>require</hi> to know which you choose."</p>
<p>"I require to be let alone!" exclaimed Catherine, furiously. "I demand it!
                        Don't you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you—you leave me!"</p>
<p>She rung the bell till it broke with a twang: I entered leisurely. It was
                        enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages! There she
                        lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding her teeth, so
                        that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters!</p>
<p>Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden <pb n="266"/>compunction and fear.
                        He told me to fetch some water. She had no breath for speaking.</p>
<p>I brought a glass full; and, as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her
                        face. In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her
                        eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of
                        death.</p>
<p>Linton looked terrified.</p>
<p>"There is nothing in the world the matter," I whispered. I did not want him
                        to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.</p>
<p>"She has blood on her lips!" he said, shuddering.</p>
<p>"Never mind!" I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved,
                        previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy.</p>
<p>I incautiously gave the account aloud, and she heard me, for she started
                        up—her hair flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the <pb n="267"/>muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my
                        mind for broken bones, at least; but she only glared about her, for an
                        instant, and then rushed from the room.</p>
<p>The master directed me to follow; I did, to her chamber door; she hindered me
                        from going farther by securing it against me.</p>
<p>As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask
                        whether she would have some carried up.</p>
<p>"No!" she replied, peremptorily.</p>
<p>The same question was repeated at dinner, and tea; and again on the morrow
                        after, and received the same answer.</p>
<p>Mr. Linton, on his part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire
                        concerning his wife's occupations. Isabella and he had had an hour's
                        interview, during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper
                        horror for Heathcliff's advances; but he could make nothing of her evasive
                        replies, and was obliged <pb n="268"/>to close the examination,
                        unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were so
                        insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of
                        relationship between herself and him.</p>
