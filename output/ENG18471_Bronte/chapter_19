<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master's return. Isabella
                        was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter, and arrange
                        a room, and other accommodations, for his youthful nephew.</p>
<p>Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back: and
                        indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of her
                        "real" cousin.</p>
<p>The evening of their expected arrival came. Since early morning, she had been
                        busy, <pb n="101"/>ordering her own small affairs; and now, attired in her
                        new black frock—poor thing! her aunt's death impressed her with no definite
                        sorrow—she obliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her, down through
                        the grounds, to meet them.</p>
<p>"Linton is just six months younger than I am," she chattered as we strolled
                        leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under shadow of the
                        trees. "How delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow! Aunt
                        Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it was lighter than
                        mine—more flaxen, and quite as fine. I have it carefully preserved in a
                        little glass box; and I've often thought what pleasure it would be to see
                        its owner—Oh! I am happy—and papa, dear, dear papa! come, Ellen, let us run!
                        come run!"</p>
<p>She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps
                        reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the
                        path, and tried to wait <pb n="102"/>patiently; but that was impossible; she
                        couldn't be still a minute.</p>
<p>"How long they are!" she exclaimed. "Ah, I see some dust on the road—they are
                        coming! No! When will they be here? May we not go a little way—half a mile,
                        Ellen, only just half a mile? Do say yes, to that clump of birches at the
                        turn!"</p>
<p>I refused staunchily: and, at length, her suspense was ended: the travelling
                        carriage rolled in sight.</p>
<p>Miss Cathy shrieked, and stretched out her arms, as soon as she caught her
                        father's face, looking from the window. He descended, nearly as eager as
                        herself; and a considerable interval elapsed, ere they had a thought to
                        spare for any but themselves.</p>
<p>While they exchanged caresses, I took a peep in to see after Linton. He was
                        asleep, in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been
                        winter, A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been <pb n="103"/>taken for my master's younger brother, so strong was the resemblance, but
                        there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect, that Edgar Linton never
                        had.</p>
<p>The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close the
                        door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him.</p>
<p>Cathy would fain have taken one glance; but her father told her to come on,
                        and they walked together up the park, while I hastened before, to prepare
                        the servants.</p>
<p>"Now, darling," said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter,, as they halted at
                        the bottom of the front steps. "Your cousin is not so strong, or so merry as
                        you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time since,
                        therefore, don't expect him to play, and run about with you directly. And
                        don't harass him much by talking—let him be quiet this evening, at least,
                        will you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, papa," answered Catherine; <pb n="104"/>"but I do want to see him;
                        and he hasn't once looked out."</p>
<p>The carriage stopped; and the sleeper, being roused, was lifted to the ground
                        by his uncle.</p>
<p>"This is your cousin Cathy, Linton," he said, putting their little hands
                        together. "She's fond of you already; and mind you don't grieve her by
                        crying to-night. Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end, and
                        you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please."</p>
<p>"Let me go to bed then," answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine's salute;
                        and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.</p>
<p>"Come, come, there's a good child," I whispered, leading him in. "You'll make
                        her weep too—see how sorry she is for you!"</p>
<p>I do not know whether it were sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as sad a
                        countenance as himself, and returned to her father. <pb n="105"/>All three
                        entered, and mounted to the library where tea was laid ready.</p>
<p>I proceeded to remove Linton's cap, and mantle, and placed him on a chair by
                        the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh. My
                        master inquired what was the matter.</p>
<p>"I can't sit on a chair," sobbed the boy.</p>
<p>"Go to the sofa then; and Ellen shall bring you some tea," answered his
                        uncle, patiently.</p>
<p>He had been greatly tried during the journey, I felt convinced, by his
                        fretful, ailing charge.</p>
<p>Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down. Cathy carried a foot-stool
                        and her cup to his side.</p>
<p>At first she sat silent; but that could not last; she had resolved to make a
                        pet of her little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced
                        stroking his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her
                        saucer, like a baby. This pleased him, for he <pb n="106"/>was not much
                        better; he dried his eyes, and lightened into a faint smile.</p>
<p>"Oh, he'll do very well," said the master to me, after watching them a
                        minute. "Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen. The company of a child of his
                        own age will instil new spirit into him soon: and by wishing for strength
                        he'll gain it."</p>
<p>Aye, if we can keep him! I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came over me
                        that there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, however will that
                        weakling live at Wuthering Heights, between his father and Hareton? what
                        playmates and instructors they'll be.</p>
<p>Our doubts were presently decided; even earlier than I expected. I had just
                        taken the children up stairs, after tea was finished; and seen Linton
                        asleep—he would not suffer me to leave him, till that was the case—I had
                        come down, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bed-room
                        candle for Mr. Edgar, <pb n="107"/>when a maid stepped out of the kitchen,
                        and informed me that Mr. Heathcliff'a servant, Joseph, was at the door, and
                        wished to speak with the master.</p>
<p>"I shall ask him what he wants first," I said, in considerable trepidation.
                        "A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the instant they have
                        returned from a long journey. I don't think the master can see him."</p>
<p>Joseph had advanced through the kitchen, as I uttered these words, and now
                        presented himself in the hall. He was donned in his Sunday garments, with
                        his most sanctimonious and sourest face; and holding his hat in one hand,
                        and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Joseph," I said, coldly. "What business brings you here
                        to-night?"</p>
<p>"It's Maister Linton Aw mun spake tull," he answered, waving me disdainfully
                        aside.</p>
<p>"Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to say, I'm
                        sure he <pb n="108"/>wont hear it now," I continued. "You had better sit
                        down in there, and entrust your message to me."</p>
<p>"Which is his rahm?" pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed
                        doors.</p>
<p>I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation; so very reluctantly, I went
                        up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visiter; advising that he
                        should be dismissed till next day.</p>
<p>Mr. Linton had no time to empower me to do so, for he mounted close at my
                        heels, and pushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of
                        the table, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began in
                        an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition.</p>
<p>"Hathecliff has send me for his lad, un Aw 'munn't goa back 'baht him."</p>
<p>Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast
                        his features; he would have pitied the child on his own account; but,
                        recalling Isabella's hopes <pb n="109"/>and fears, and anxious wishes for
                        her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved bitterly at
                        the prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart how it might be
                        avoided. No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to keep
                        him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was nothing left
                        but to resign him. However, he was not going to rouse him from his
                        sleep.</p>
<p>"Tell Mr. Heathcliff," he answered, calmly, "that his son shall come to
                        Wuthering Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too tired to go the distance
                        now. You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired him to remain
                        under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is very precarious."</p>
<p>"Noa!" said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and assuming an
                        authoritative air. "Noa! that manes nowt—Hathecliff maks noa 'cahnt uh t'
                        mother, nur yah norther—bud he'll hev his lad; und Aw mun tak him—soa nah
                        yah knaw!"</p>
<p><pb n="110"/>"You shall not to-night!" answered Linton, decisively. "Walk
                        down stairs at once, and repeat to your master what I have said. Ellen, show
                        him down. Go—"</p>
<p>And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room of
                        him, and closed the door.</p>
<p>"Varrah weel!" shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off. "Tuh morn, he's come
                        hisseln, un' thrust <hi>him</hi> aht, if yah darr!"</p>
