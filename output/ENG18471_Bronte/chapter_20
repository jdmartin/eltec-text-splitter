<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton commissioned
                        me to take the boy home early, on Catherine's pony, and, said he—</p>
<p>"As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or bad, you must
                        say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter; she cannot associate with
                        him hereafter; and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his
                        proximity, lest she should be restless, and anxious to visit the
                        Heights—merely tell her, <pb n="112"/>his father sent for him suddenly, and
                        he has been obliged to leave us."</p>
<p>Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed, at five o'clock, and
                        astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling: but I
                        softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with
                        his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he did not like
                        to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey.</p>
<p>"My father?" he cried, in strange perplexity. "Mamma never told me I had a
                        father. Where does he live? I'd rather stay with uncle."</p>
<p>"He lives a little distance from the Grange," I replied, "just beyond those
                        hills—not so far, but you may walk over here, when you get hearty. And you
                        should be glad to go home, and to see him. You must try to love him, as you
                        did your mother, and then he will love you."</p>
<p><pb n="113"/>"But why have I not heard of him before?" asked Linton; "why
                        didn't mamma, and he live together as other people do?"</p>
<p>"He had business to keep him in the north," I answered; "and your mother's
                        health required her to reside in the south."</p>
<p>"And why didn't mamma speak to me about him?" persevered the child. "She
                        often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago. How am I to love
                        papa? I don't know him."</p>
<p>"Oh, all children love their parents," I said. "Your mother, perhaps, thought
                        you would want to be with him, if she mentioned him often to you. Let us
                        make haste. An early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to
                        an hour's more sleep."</p>
<p>"Is <hi>she</hi> to go with us," he demanded. "The little girl I saw
                        yesterday?"</p>
<p>"Not now," replied I.</p>
<p>"Is uncle?" he continued.</p>
<p><pb n="114"/>"No, I shall be your companion there," I said.</p>
<p>Linton sank back on his pillow, and fell into a brown study.</p>
<p>"I won't go without uncle;" he cried at length; "I can't tell where you mean
                        to take me."</p>
<p>I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet
                        his father: still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing; and
                        I had to call for my master's assistance, in coaxing him out of bed.</p>
<p>The poor thing was finally got off with several delusive assurances that his
                        absence should be short; that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him; and other
                        promises, equally ill-founded, which I invented and reiterated, at
                        intervals, throughout the way.</p>
<p>The pure heather-scented air, and the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter
                        of Minny relieved his despondency, after a while. He began to put questions
                        concerning his new home, <pb n="115"/>and its inhabitants, with greater
                        interest, and liveliness.</p>
<p>"Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?" he
                        inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light mist
                        mounted, and formed fleecy cloud, on the skirts of the blue.</p>
<p>"It is not so buried in trees," I replied, "and it is not quite so large, but
                        you can see the country beautifully, all round; and the air is healthier for
                        you—fresher, and dryer. You will, perhaps, think the building old and dark,
                        at first—though it is a respectable house, the next best in the
                        neighbourhood. And you will have such nice rambles on the moors! Hareton
                        Earnshaw—that is Miss Cathy's other cousin; and so yours in a manner—will
                        show you all the sweetest spots; and you can bring a book in fine weather,
                        and make a green hollow your study; and, now and then, your uncle may join
                        you in a walk; he does, frequently, walk out on the hills."</p>
<p><pb n="116"/>"And what is my father like?" he asked. "Is he as young and
                        handsome as uncle?"</p>
<p>"He's as young," said I "but he has black hair, and eyes; and looks sterner,
                        and he is taller and bigger altogether. He'll not seem to you so gentle and
                        kind at first, perhaps, because, it is not his way—still, mind you be frank
                        and cordial with him; and naturally, he'll be fonder of you than any uncle,
                        for you are his own."</p>
<p>"Black hair and eyes!" mused Linton. "I can't fancy him. Then I am not like
                        him, am I?"</p>
<p>"Not much," I answered. . .Not a morsel, I thought: surveying with regret the
                        white complexion, and slim frame of my companion, and his large languid
                        eyes. . .his mother's eyes save that, unless a morbid touchiness kindled
                        them, a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.</p>
<p>"How strange that he should never come to see mama, and me" he murmured. "Has
                        he <pb n="117"/>ever seen me? If he have, I must have been a baby—I remember
                        not a single thing about him!"</p>
<p>"Why, Master Linton," said I, "three hundred miles is a great distance: and
                        ten years seem very different in length, to a grown up person, compared with
                        what they do to you. It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going, from
                        summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity: and now it is
                        too late—Don't trouble him with questions on the subject: it will disturb
                        him for no good."</p>
<p>The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the
                        ride, till we halted before the farm-house garden gate. I watched to catch
                        his impressions in his countenanance. He surveyed the carved front, and
                        low-browed lattices; the straggling gooseberry bushes, and crooked firs,
                        with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private feelings
                        entirely disapproved of the exterior of <pb n="118"/>his new abode; but he
                        had sense to postpone complaining—there might be compensation within.</p>
<p>Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door. It was half-past six; the
                        family had just finished breakfast; the servant was clearing and wiping down
                        the table: Joseph stood by his master's chair telling some tale concerning a
                        lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for the hay-field.</p>
<p>"Hallo, Nelly!" cried Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me. "I feared I should have
                        to come down and fetch my property, myself—You've brought it have you? Let
                        us see what we can make of it."</p>
<p>He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping
                        curiosity. Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.</p>
<p>"Sure-ly," said Joseph after a grave inspection, 'he's swopped wi' ye,
                        maister, an' yon's his lass!"</p>
<p><pb n="119"/>Heathcliff having stared his son into an ague of confusion,
                        uttered a scornful laugh.</p>
<p>"God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!" he exclaimed. "Haven't
                        they reared it on snails, and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn my soul! but that's
                        worse than I expected—and the devil knows I was not sanguine!"</p>
<p>I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter. He did not
                        thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father's speech, or whether it were
                        intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim, sneering
                        stranger was his father; but he clung to me with growing trepidation; and on
                        Mr. Heathcliff's taking a seat, and bidding him "come hither," he hid his
                        face on my shoulder, and wept.</p>
<p>"Tut, tut!" said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly
                        between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin. "None of that
                        nonsense! we're not <pb n="120"/>going to hurt thee, Linton—isn't that thy
                        name? Thou art thy mother's child, entirely! Where is <hi>my</hi> share in
                        thee, puling chicken?"</p>
<p>He took off the boy's cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt his
                        slender arms, and his small fingers; during which examination, Linton ceased
                        crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.</p>
<p>"Do you know me?" asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the limbs
                        were all equally frail and feeble.</p>
<p>"No!" said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.</p>
<p>"You've heard of me, I dare say?"</p>
<p>"No," he replied again.</p>
<p>"No? What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for me!
                        You are my son, then, I'll tell you; and your mother was a wicked slut to
                        leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed—Now, don't wince,
                        and colour up! Though it <hi>is</hi> something to see you have not white
                        blood—Be a <pb n="121"/>good lad; and I'll do for you—Nelly, if you be tired
                        you may sit down, if not get home again—I guess you'll report what you hear,
                        and see, to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing won't be settled while
                        you linger about it."</p>
<p>"Well," replied I, "I hope you'll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or
                        you'll not keep him long, and he's all you have akin, in the wide world that
                        you will ever know—remember.</p>
<p>"I'll be <hi>very</hi> kind to him you needn't fear!" he said laughing. "Only
                        nobody else must be kind to him—I'm jealous of monopolizing his
                        affection—And, to begin my kindness, Joseph! bring the lad some
                        breakfast—Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work. Yes, Nell," he
                        added when they were departed, "my son is prospective owner of your place,
                        and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his successor.
                        Besides, he's <hi>mine</hi>, and I want the triumph of seeing <pb n="122"/><hi>my</hi> descendent fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring
                        their children, to till their fathers' lands for wages—That is the sole
                        consideration which can make me endure the whelp—I despise him for himself,
                        and hate him for the memories he revives! But, that consideration is
                        sufficient; he's as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully, as your
                        master tends his own—I have a room up stairs, furnished for him, in handsome
                        style—I've engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from twenty
                        miles distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I've ordered Hareton
                        to obey him: and in fact, I've arranged every thing with a view to preserve
                        the superior, and the gentleman in him, above his associates—I do regret
                        however, that he so little deserves the trouble—if I wished any blessing in
                        the world, it was to find him a worthy object of pride, and I'm bitterly
                        disappointed with the whey-faced whining wretch!"</p>
<p><pb n="123"/>While he was speaking, Joseph returned, bearing a basin of
                        milk-porridge, and placed it before Linton. He stirred round the homely mess
                        with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it.</p>
<p>I saw the old man servant shared largely in his master's scorn of the child,
                        though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because
                        Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.</p>
<p>"Cannot ate it?" repeated he, peering in Linton's face, and subduing his
                        voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard. "But Maister Hareton nivir
                        ate nowt else, when he wer a little un: und what wer gooid eneugh fur him's
                        gooid eneugh fur yah, Aw's rayther think!"</p>
<p>"I <hi>shan't</hi> eat it!" answered Linton, snappishly. "Take it away."</p>
<p>Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.</p>
<p><pb n="124"/>"Is there owt ails th' victuals?" he asked, thrusting the tray
                        under Heathcliff's nose.</p>
<p>"What should ail them?" he said.</p>
<p>"Wah!" answered Joseph, "yon dainty chap says he cannut ate 'em. Bud Aw guess
                        it's raight! His mother wer just soa—we wer a'most too mucky tuh sow t' corn
                        fur makking her breead."</p>
<p>"Don't mention his mother to me," said the master, angrily. "Get him
                        something that he can eat, that's all. What is his usual food, Nelly?"</p>
<p>I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions to
                        prepare some.</p>
<p>Come, I reflected, his father's selfishness may contribute to his comfort. He
                        perceives his delicate constitution, and the necessity of treating him
                        tolerably. I'll console Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn
                        Heathcliff's humour has taken.</p>
<p>Having no excuse for lingering longer, I <pb n="125"/>slipped out, while
                        Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly
                        sheep-dog. But he was too much on the alert to be cheated—as I closed the
                        door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words—</p>
<p>"Don't leave me! I'll not stay here! I'll not stay here!"</p>
<p>Then the latch was raised and fell—they did not suffer him to come forth. I
                        mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief guardianship
                        ended.</p>
