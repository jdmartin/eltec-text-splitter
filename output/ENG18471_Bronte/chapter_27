<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p>Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his assent
                        to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride to join
                        her cousin.</p>
<p>"It was a close, sultry day; devoid of sunshine, but with a sky too dappled
                        and hazy to threaten rain; and our place of meeting had been fixed at the
                        guide-stone, by the cross-roads. On arriving there, however, a little
                        herd-boy, despatched as a messenger, told us that—</p>
<p><pb n="238"/>"Maister Linton wer just ut this side th' Heights: and he'd be
                        mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further."</p>
<p>"Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle," I
                        observed: "he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are, off at
                        once."</p>
<p>"Well, we'll turn our horses' heads round, when we reach him," answered my
                        companion, "our excursion shall lie towards home."</p>
<p>But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his
                        own door, we found he had no horse, and we were forced to dismount, and
                        leave ours to graze.</p>
<p>He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach, and did not rise till we came
                        within a few yards. Then, he walked so feebly, and looked so pale, that I
                        immediately exclaimed—</p>
<p>"Why, Master Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble, this morning.
                        How ill you do look!"</p>
<p>Catherine surveyed him with grief and <pb n="239"/>astonishment; and changed
                        the ejaculation of joy on her lips, to one of alarm; and the congratulation
                        on their long postponed meeting, to an anxious inquiry, whether he were
                        worse than usual?</p>
<p>"No—better—better!" he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if he
                        needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her; the
                        hollowness round them, transforming to haggard wildness, the languid
                        expression they once possessed.</p>
<p>"But you have been worse," persisted his cousin, "worse than when I saw you
                        last—you are thinner, and—"</p>
<p>"I'm tired," he interrupted, hurriedly. "It is too hot for walking, let us
                        rest here. And, in the morning, I often feel sick—papa says I grow so
                        fast."</p>
<p>Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.</p>
<p>"This is something like your paradise," <pb n="240"/>said she, making an
                        effort at cheerfulness. "You recollect the two days we agreed to spend, in
                        the place and way, each thought pleasantest? This is nearly yours, only
                        there are clouds; but then, they are so soft and mellow, it is nicer than
                        sunshine. Next week, if you can, we'll ride down to the Grange Park, and try
                        mine."</p>
<p>Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of; and he had evidently
                        great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. His lack of
                        interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity to contribute
                        to her entertainment were so obvious, that she could not conceal her
                        disappointment. An indefinite alteration had come over his whole person and
                        manner. The pettishness that might be caressed into fondness, had yielded to
                        a listless apathy; there was less of the peevish temper of a child which
                        frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and more of the self-absorbed <pb n="241"/>moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling consolation, and
                        ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others, as an insult.</p>
<p>Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he held it rather a punishment,
                        than a gratification, to endure our company; and she made no scruple of
                        proposing, presently, to depart.</p>
<p>That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy, and threw him
                        into a strange state of agitation. He glanced fearfully towards the Heights,
                        begging she would remain another half-hour, at least.</p>
<p>"But, I think," said Cathy, "you'd be more comfortable at home than sitting
                        here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and songs, and
                        chatter; you have grown wiser than I, in these six months; you have little
                        taste for my diversions now; or else, if I could amuse you, I'd willingly
                        stay."</p>
<p>"Stay to rest yourself," he replied. "And, Catherine, don't think, or say
                        that I'm <hi>very</hi> unwell—it is the heavy weather, and heat that <pb n="242"/>make me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great
                        deal, for me. Tell uncle, I'm in tolerable health, will you?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell him that <hi>you</hi> say so, Linton. I couldn't affirm that you
                        are," observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion of
                        what was evidently an untruth.</p>
<p>"And be here again next Thursday," continued he, shunning her puzzled gaze.
                        "And give him my thanks for permitting you to come—my best thanks,
                        Catherine. And—and, if you <hi>did</hi> meet my father, and he asked you
                        about me, don't lead him to suppose that I've been extremely silent and
                        stupid—don't look sad and downcast, as you <hi>are</hi> doing—he'll be
                        angry."</p>
<p>"I care nothing for his anger," exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be its
                        object.</p>
<p>"But I do," said her cousin, shuddering.</p>
<p>"<hi>Don't</hi> provoke him against me, Catherine, for he is very hard."</p>
<p>"Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?" <pb n="243"/>I inquired. "Has he
                        grown weary of indulgence, and passed from passive, to active hatred?"</p>
<p>Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by his
                        side, another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on his
                        breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion, or
                        pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing the
                        produce of her researches with me: she did not offer them to him, for she
                        saw further notice would only weary and annoy.</p>
<p>"Is it half an hour now, Ellen!" she whispered in my ear, at last. "I can't
                        tell why we should stay. He's asleep, and papa will be wanting us back."</p>
<p>"Well, we must not leave him asleep," I answered; "wait till he wakes and be
                        patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to see poor
                        Linton has soon evaporated!"</p>
<p><pb n="244"/>"Why did <hi>he</hi> wish to see me?" returned Catherine. "In
                        his crossest humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present
                        curious mood. It's just as if it were a task he was compelled to
                        perform—this interview—for fear his father should scold him. But, I'm hardly
                        going to come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have
                        for ordering Linton to undergo this penance. And, though I'm glad he's
                        better in health, I'm sorry he's so much less pleasant, and so much less
                        affectionate to me."</p>
<p>"You think <hi>he</hi> is better in health, then?" I said.</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered; "because he always made such a great deal of his
                        sufferings, you know. He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell papa,
                        but he's better, very likely."</p>
<p>"There you differ with me, Miss Cathy," I remarked; "I should conjecture him
                        to be far worse."</p>
<p>Linton here started from his slumber in <pb n="245"/>bewildered terror, and
                        asked if any one had called his name.</p>
<p>"No," said Catherine; "unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you manage to
                        dose, out of doors, in the morning."</p>
<p>"I thought I heard my father," he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab
                        above us. "You are sure nobody spoke?"</p>
<p>"Quite sure," replied his cousin. "Only Ellen and I were disputing concerning
                        your health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we separated in
                        winter? If you be, I'm certain one thing is not stronger—your regard for
                        me—speak, are you?"</p>
<p>The tears gushed from Linton's eyes as he answered—</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I am!"</p>
<p>And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up and
                        down to detect its owner.</p>
<p>Cathy rose.</p>
<p>"For to-day we must part," she said. <pb n="246"/>"And I won't conceal that I
                        have been sadly disappointed with our meeting, though I'll mention it to
                        nobody but you—not that I stand in awe of Mr. Heathcliff!"</p>
<p>"Hush," murmured Linton; "for God's sake, hush! He's coming." And he clung to
                        Catherine's arm, striving to detain her; but, at that announcement, she
                        hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who obeyed her like a
                        dog.</p>
<p>"I'll be here next Thursday," she cried, springing to the saddle. "Good bye.
                        Quick, Ellen!"</p>
<p>And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed was he
                        in anticipating his father's approach.</p>
<p>"Before we reached home, Catherine's displeasure softened into a perplexed
                        sensation of pity and regret largely blended with vague, uneasy doubts about
                        Linton's actual circumstances, physical and social; in which I partook,
                        though I counselled her not to say much, <pb n="247"/>for a second journey
                        would make us better judges.</p>
<p>My master requested an account of our on-goings: his nephew's offering of
                        thanks was duly delivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also,
                        threw little light on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide, and
                        what to reveal.</p>
