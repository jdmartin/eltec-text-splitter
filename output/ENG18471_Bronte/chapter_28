<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<p>Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid
                        alteration of Edgar Linton's state. The havoc that months had previously
                        wrought, was now emulated by the inroads of hours.</p>
<p>Catherine, we would fain have deluded, yet, but her own quick spirit refused
                        to delude her. It divined, in secret, and brooded on the dreadful
                        probability, gradually ripening into certainty.</p>
<p>She had not the heart to mention her ride, <pb n="249"/>when Thursday came
                        round; I mentioned it for her; and obtained permission to order her out of
                        doors; for the library, where her father stopped a short time daily—the
                        brief period he could bear to sit up, and his chamber had become her whole
                        world. She grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his
                        pillow, or seated by his side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and
                        sorrow, and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself
                        would be a happy change of scene and society, drawing comfort from the hope
                        that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.</p>
<p>He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall, that as
                        his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for
                        Linton's letters bore few, or no indications of his defective character. And
                        I through pardonable weakness refrained from correcting the error; asking
                        myself what good there would be in disturbing his last <pb n="250"/>moments
                        with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to
                        account.</p>
<p>We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of
                        August—every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed whoever
                        respired it, though dying, might revive.</p>
<p>Catherine's face was just like the landscape—shadows and sunshine flitting
                        over it, in rapid succession; but the shadows rested longer and the sunshine
                        was more transient, and her poor little heart reproached itself for even
                        that passing forgetfulness of its cares.</p>
<p>We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before. My
                        young mistress alighted, and told me that as she was resolved to stay a very
                        little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback; but I
                        dissented, I wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a
                        minute; so we climbed the slope of heath, together.</p>
<p>Master Heathcliff received us with greater <pb n="251"/>animation on this
                        occasion; not the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it
                        looked more like fear.</p>
<p>"It is late!" he said, speaking short, and with difficulty. "Is not your
                        father very ill? I thought you wouldn't come."</p>
<p>"<hi>Why</hi> won't you be candid?" cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.
                        "Why cannot you say at once, you don't want me? It is strange Linton, that
                        for the second time, you have brought me here on purpose, apparently, to
                        distress us both, and for no reason besides!"</p>
<p>Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed, but his
                        cousin's patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical
                        behaviour.</p>
<p>"My father <hi>is</hi> very ill," she said, "and why am I called from his
                        bedside—why didn't you send to absolve me from my promise, when you wished I
                        wouldn't keep it? Come! I desire an explanation—playing and trifling are
                        completely banished out of my mind: and I <pb n="252"/>can't dance
                        attendance on your affectations now!'</p>
<p>"My affectations!" he murmured, "what are they? For Heaven's sake Catherine,
                        don't look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am a worthless,
                        cowardly wretch—I can't be scorned enough! but I'm too mean for your
                        anger—hate my father, and spare me, for contempt!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" cried Catherine in a passion. "Foolish, silly boy! And there! he
                        trembles, as if I were really going to touch him! You needn't bespeak
                        contempt, Linton; anybody will have it spontaneously, at your service. Get
                        off! I shall return home—it is folly dragging you from the hearth-stone, and
                        pretending—what do we pretend? Let go my frock—if I pitied you for crying,
                        and looking so very frightened, you should spurn such pity. Ellen, tell him
                        how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise, and don't degrade yourself into an
                        abject reptile—<hi>don't</hi>."</p>
<p><pb n="253"/>With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had
                        thrown his nerveless frame along the ground; he seemed convulsed with
                        exquisite terror.</p>
<p>"Oh!" he sobbed, "I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I'm a traitor too,
                        and I dare not tell you! But leave me and I shall be killed! <hi>Dear</hi>
                        Catherine, my life is in your hands; and you have said you loved me—and if
                        you did, it wouldn't harm you. You'll not go, then? kind, sweet, good
                        Catherine! And perhaps you <hi>will</hi> consent—and he'll let me die with
                        you!"</p>
<p>My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him. The
                        old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she grew
                        thoroughly moved and alarmed.</p>
<p>"Consent to what?" she asked. "To stay? Tell me the meaning of this strange
                        talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract me! Be calm
                        and frank, and confess <pb n="254"/>at once, all that weighs on your heart.
                        You wouldn't injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn't let any enemy hurt
                        me, if you could prevent it? I'll believe you are a coward, for yourself,
                        but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend."</p>
<p>"But my father threatened me," gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated
                        fingers, "and I dread him—I dread him! I <hi>dare</hi> not tell!"</p>
<p>"Oh well!" said Catherine, with scornful compassion, "keep your secret,
                            <hi>I'm</hi> no coward—save yourself, I'm not afraid!"</p>
<p>Her magnanimity provoked his tears; he wept wildly, kissing her supporting
                        hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out.</p>
<p>I was cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should
                        never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will. When hearing a
                        rustle among the ling, I looked up, and saw Mr. Heathcliff almost close upon
                        us, descending the Heights. He <pb n="255"/>didn't cast a glance towards my
                        companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton's sobs to be
                        audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none
                        besides, and the sincerity of which, I couldn't avoid doubting, he said.</p>
<p>"It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly! How are you at the
                        Grange? Let us hear! The rumour goes," he added in a lower tone, "that Edgar
                        Linton is on his death-bed—perhaps they exaggerate his illness?"</p>
<p>"No; my master is dying," I replied, "it is true enough. A sad thing it will
                        be for us all, but a blessing for him!"</p>
<p>"How long will he last, do you think?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know," I said.</p>
<p>"Because," he continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed
                        under his eye—Linton appeared as if he could not <pb n="256"/>venture to
                        stir, or raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his
                        account—"Because that lad yonder, seems determined to beat me—and I'd thank
                        his uncle to be quick, and go before him—Hallo! Has the whelp been playing
                        that game long? I <hi>did</hi> give him some lessons about snivelling. Is he
                        pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?"</p>
<p>"Lively? no—he has shown the greatest distress;" I answered. "To see him, I
                        should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills, he
                        ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor."</p>
<p>"He shall be, in a day or two," muttered Heathcliff "But first—get up,
                        Linton! Get up!" he shouted. "Don't grovel on the ground, there—up this
                        moment!"</p>
<p>Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear, caused
                        by his father's glance towards him, I suppose, there was nothing else to
                        produce such humiliation. <pb n="257"/>He made several efforts to obey, but
                        his little strength was annihilated, for the time, and be fell back again
                        with a moan.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf.</p>
<p>"Now," said he with curbed ferocity, "I'm getting angry—and if you don't
                        command that paltry spirit of yours—<hi>Damn</hi> you! Get up,
                        directly!"</p>
<p>"I will, father!" he panted. "Only, let me alone, or I shall faint! I've done
                        as you wished—I'm sure. Catherine will tell you that I—that I—have been
                        cheerful. Ah! keep by me Catherine; give me your hand."</p>
<p>"Take mine," said his father, "stand on your feet! There now—she'll lend you
                        her arm. . .that's right, look at <hi>her</hi>. You would imagine I was the
                        devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to walk
                        home with him, will you? He shudders, if I touch him."</p>
<p><pb n="258"/>"Linton, dear!" whispered Catherine, "I can't go to Wuthering
                        Heights. . .papa has forbidden me. . .He'll not harm you, why are you so
                        afraid?"</p>
<p>"I can never re-enter that house," he answered. "I am <hi>not</hi> to
                        re-enter it without you!"</p>
<p>"Stop. . ." cried his father. "We'll respect Catherine's filial scruples.
                        Nelly, take him in, and I'll follow your advice concerning the doctor,
                        without delay."</p>
<p>"You'll do well," replied I, "but I must remain with my mistress. To mind
                        your son is not my business."</p>
<p>"You are very stiff!" said Heathcliff, "I know that—but you'll force me to
                        pinch the baby, and make it scream, before it moves your charity. Come then,
                        my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?"</p>
<p>He approached once more, and made as if be would seize the fragile being; but
                            <pb n="259"/>shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored
                        her to accompany him with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial.</p>
<p>However I disapproved, I couldn't hinder her; indeed how could she have
                        refused him herself? What was filling him with dread, we had no means of
                        discerning, but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and any addition
                        seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy.</p>
<p>We reached the threshold; Catherine walked in; and I stood waiting till she
                        had conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out, immediately; when
                        Mr. Heathcliff pushing me forward, exclaimed—</p>
<p>"My house is not stricken with the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be
                        hospitable today; sit down, and allow me to shut the door."</p>
<p>He shut and locked it also, I started.</p>
<p>"You shall have tea, before you go home," he added. "I am by myself. Hareton
                        is gone with some cattle to the Lees—and Zillah <pb n="260"/>and Joseph are
                        off on a journey of pleasure. And, though I'm used to being alone, I'd
                        rather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton, take
                        your seat by <hi>him</hi>. I give you what I have; the present is hardly
                        worth accepting; but, I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton, I mean.
                        How she does stare! It's odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that
                        seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less strict, and tastes
                        less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivifisection of those two, as
                        an evening's amusement."</p>
<p>He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself.</p>
<p>"By hell! I hate them."</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of you!" exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the latter
                        part of his speech.</p>
<p>She stepped close up; her black eyes flashing with passion and
                        resolution.</p>
<p>"Give me that key—I will have it!" she <pb n="261"/>said "I would'nt eat or
                        drink here, if I were starving."</p>
<p>Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. He looked up,
                        seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness, or, possibly, reminded by
                        her voice and glance, of the person from whom she inherited it.</p>
<p>She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out of his
                        loosened lingers; but her action recalled him to the present; he recovered
                        it speedily.</p>
<p>"Now, Catherine Linton," he said, "stand off, or I shall knock you down; and
                        that will make Mrs. Dean mad."</p>
<p>Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand, and its contents
                        again.</p>
<p>"We <hi>will</hi> go!" she repeated, exerting her utmost efforts to cause the
                        iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails made no impression, she
                        applied her teeth pretty sharply.</p>
<p>Heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept <pb n="262"/>me from interfering
                        a moment. Catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He
                        opened them, suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had
                        well secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling her on
                        his knee, administered, with the other, a shower of terrific slaps on both
                        sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat, had she
                        been able to fall.</p>
<p>At this diabolical violence, I rushed on him furiously.</p>
<p>"You villain!" I began to cry, "you villain!"</p>
<p>A touch on the chest silenced me; I am stout, and soon put out of breath;
                        and, what with that and the rage, I staggered dizzily back, and felt ready
                        to suffocate, or to burst a blood-vessel.</p>
<p>The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released, put her two hands to
                        her temples, and looked just as if she were not sure <pb n="263"/>whether
                        her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor thing, and leant
                        against the table perfectly bewildered.</p>
<p>"I know how to chastise children, you see," said the scoundrel, grimly, as he
                        stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the floor. "Go
                        to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall be your father
                        to-morrow—all the father you'll have in a few days—and you shall have plenty
                        of that—you can bear plenty—you're no weakling—you shall have a daily taste,
                        if I catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again!"</p>
<p>Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down, and put her burning cheek
                        on my lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle,
                        as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that the correction
                        had lighted on another than him.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff, perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made
                        the tea himself. <pb n="264"/>The cups and saucers were laid ready. He
                        poured it out, and handed me a cup.</p>
<p>"Wash away your spleen," he said. "And help your own naughty pet and mine. It
                        is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I'm going out to seek your
                        horses."</p>
<p>Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We tried
                        the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside; we looked at the
                        windows—they were too narrow for even Cathy's little figure.</p>
<p>"Master Linton," I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned. "You know what
                        your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or I'll box your
                        ears, as he has done your cousin's."</p>
<p>"Yes, Linton; you must tell," said Catherine. "It was for your sake I came;
                        and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse."</p>
<p>"Give me some tea, I'm thirsty, and then I'll tell you," he answered. "Mrs.
                        Dean, go <pb n="265"/>away. I don't like you standing over me. Now,
                        Catherine, you are letting your tears fall into my cup! I wont drink that.
                        Give me another."</p>
<p>Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted at the
                        little wretch's composure, since he was no longer in terror for himself. The
                        anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered
                        Wuthering Heights; so, I guessed he had been menaced with an awful
                        visitation of wrath, if he failed in decoying us there; and, that
                        accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.</p>
<p>"Papa wants us to be married," he continued, after sipping some of the
                        liquid. "And he knows your papa wouldn't let us marry now; and he's afraid
                        of my dying, if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning, and you are
                        to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you shall return home
                        next day, and take me with you."</p>
<p><pb n="266"/>"Take you with her, pitiful changeling?" I exclaimed.
                            "<hi>You</hi> marry? Why, the man is mad, or he thinks us fools, every
                        one. And, do you imagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty
                        girl, will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you
                        cherishing the notion that <hi>anybody</hi>, let alone Miss Catherine
                        Linton, would have you for a husband? You want whipping for bringing us in
                        here at all, with your dastardly, puling tricks; and—don't look so silly
                        now! I've a very good mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible
                        treachery, and your imbecile conceit."</p>
<p>I did give him a slight shaking, but it brought on the cough, and he took to
                        his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine rebuked me.</p>
<p>"Stay all night? No!" she said, looking slowly round. "Ellen, I'll burn that
                        door down, but I'll get out."</p>
<p>And she would have commenced the <pb n="267"/>execution of her threat
                        directly, but Linton was up in alarm, for his dear self, again. He clasped
                        her in his two feeble arms, sobbing—</p>
<p>"Won't you have me, and save me—not let me come to the Grange? Oh! darling
                        Catherine! you mustn't go, and leave me, after all. You <hi>must</hi> obey
                        my father, you <hi>must</hi>!"</p>
<p>"I must obey my own," she replied, "and relieve him from this cruel suspense.
                        The whole night! What would he think? he'll be distressed already. I'll
                        either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet! You're in no
                        danger—but, if you hinder me—Linton, I love papa better than you!"</p>
<p>The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff 's anger, restored to the boy his
                        coward's eloquence. Catherine was near distraught—still, she persisted that
                        she must go home, and tried entreaty, in her turn, persuading him to subdue
                        his selfish agony.</p>
<p>While they were thus occupied, our jailer re-entered.</p>
<p><pb n="268"/>"Your beasts have trotted off;" he said, "and—Now, Linton!
                        snivelling again? What has she been doing to you? Come, come—have done, and
                        get to bed. In a month or two, my lad, you'll be able to pay her back her
                        present tyrannies, with a vigorous hand—you're pining for pure love, are you
                        not? nothing else in the world—and she shall have you! There, to bed! Zillah
                        wont be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush! hold your noise!
                        Once in your own room, I'll not come near you, you needn't fear. By chance,
                        you've managed tolerably. I'll look to the rest,"</p>
<p>He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass; and the
                        latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the
                        person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze.</p>
<p>The lock was re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress
                        and I stood silent. Catherine looked up, and <pb n="269"/>instinctively
                        raised her hand to her cheek—his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation.
                        Anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with
                        sternness, but he scowled on her, and muttered—</p>
<p>"Oh, you are not afraid of me? Your courage is well disguised—you
                            <hi>seem</hi> damnably afraid!"</p>
<p>"I <hi>am</hi> afraid <hi>now</hi>," she replied; "because if I stay, papa
                        will be miserable; and how can I endure making him miserable—when he—when
                        he—Mr. Heathcliff, <hi>let</hi> me go home! I promise to marry Linton—papa
                        would like me to, and I love him—and why should you wish to force me to do
                        what I'll willingly do of myself?"</p>
<p>"Let him dare to force you!" I cried. "There's law in the land, thank God,
                        there is! though we <hi>be</hi> in an out-of-the-way place. I'd inform, if
                        he were my own son, and it's felony without benefit of clergy!"</p>
<p>"Silence!" said the ruffian. "To the <pb n="270"/>devil with your clamour! I
                        don't want <hi>you</hi> to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself
                        remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable; I shall not sleep for
                        satisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence
                        under my roof, for the next twenty-four hours, than informing me that such
                        an event would follow. As to your promise to marry Linton; I'll take care
                        you shall keep it, for you shall not quit the place till it is
                        fulfilled."</p>
<p>"Send Ellen then, to let papa know I'm safe!" exclaimed Catherine, weeping
                        bitterly. "Or marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he'll think we're lost. What
                        shall we do?"</p>
<p>"Not he! He'll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off, for a
                        little amusement," answered Heathcliff. "You cannot deny that you entered my
                        house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary.
                        And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age; and
                        that you should weary of nursing a sick man, and <pb n="271"/>that man,
                            <hi>only</hi> your father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when
                        your days began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world, (I
                        did, at least). And it would just do if he cursed you as <hi>he</hi> went
                        out of it. I'd join him. I don't love you! How should I? Weep away. As far
                        as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter: unless Linton make
                        amends for other losses; and your provident parent appears to fancy he may.
                        His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly. In his last, he
                        recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and kind to her when he got her.
                        Careful and kind—that's paternal! But Linton requires his whole stock of
                        care and kindness for himself Linton can play the little tyrant well. He'll
                        undertake to torture any number of cats if their teeth be drawn, and their
                        claws pared. You'll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his
                            <hi>kindness</hi>, when you get home again, I assure you."</p>
<p>"You're right there!" I said, "explain <pb n="272"/>your son's character.
                        Show his resemblance to yourself; and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think
                        twice, before she takes the cockatrice!"</p>
<p>"I don't much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now," he answered,
                        "because she must either accept him, or remain a prisoner, and you along
                        with her, till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite concealed,
                        here, If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and you'll have an
                        opportunity of judging!"</p>
<p>"I'll not retract my word," said Catherine. "I'll marry him, within this
                        hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff, you're a
                        cruel man, but you're not a fiend; and you wont, from <hi>mere</hi> malice,
                        destroy, irrevocably, all my happiness. If papa thought I had left him, on
                        purpose; and if he died before I returned, could I bear to live? I've given
                        over crying; but I'm going to kneel here, at your knee; and I'll not get up,
                        and I'll not take my eyes from your face, till you <pb n="273"/>look back at
                        me! No, don't turn away! <hi>do</hi> look! You'll see nothing to provoke
                        you. I don't hate you. I'm not angry that you struck me. Have you never
                        loved <hi>anybody</hi>, in all your life, uncle? <hi>never</hi>? Ah! you
                        must look once—I'm so wretched—you can't help being sorry and pitying
                        me."</p>
<p>"Keep your eft's fingers off; and move, or I'll kick you!" cried Heathcliff,
                        brutally repulsing her. "I'd rather be hugged by a snake. How the devil can
                        you dream of fawning on me? I <hi>detest</hi> you!"</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders—shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept with
                        aversion; and thrust back his chair: while I got up, and opened my mouth, to
                        commence a downright torrent of abuse; but I was rendered dumb in the middle
                        of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be shown into a room by
                        myself, the very next syllable I uttered.</p>
<p>It was growing dark—we heard a sound of voices at the garden gate. Our host
                        hurried <pb n="274"/>out, instantly; <hi>he</hi> had his wits about him;
                            <hi>we</hi> had not. There was a talk of two or three minutes, and he
                        returned alone.</p>
<p>"I thought it had been your cousin Hareton," I observed to Catherine. "I wish
                        he would arrive! Who knows but he might take our part?"</p>
<p>"It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange," said Heathcliff,
                        overhearing me. "You should have opened a lattice, and called out; but I
                        could swear that chit is glad you didn't. She's glad to be obliged to stay,
                        I'm certain."</p>
<p>At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief without
                        control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o'clock; then he bid us go
                        up stairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah's chamber; and I whispered my
                        companion to obey; perhaps, we might contrive to get through the window
                        there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.</p>
<p>The window, however, was narrow like those <pb n="275"/>below, and the garret
                        trap was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before.</p>
<p>We neither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and
                        watched anxiously for morning—a deep sigh being the only answer I could
                        obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest.</p>
<p>I seated myself in a chair, and rocked, to and fro, passing harsh judgment on
                        my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the
                        misfortunes of all my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I
                        am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night, and I thought
                        Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen.</p>
<p>She ran to the door immediately, and answered—</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Here then," he said, opening it, and pulling her out.</p>
<p><pb n="276"/>I rose to follow, but he turned the lock again. I demanded my
                        release.</p>
<p>"Be patient," he replied; "I'll send up your breakfast in a while."</p>
<p>I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine asked
                        why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it another hour,
                        and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at length, I heard a
                        footstep, not Heathcliff's.</p>
<p>"I've brought you something to eat," said a voice; "oppen t' door!"</p>
<p>Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me all
                        day.</p>
<p>"Tak it!" he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.</p>
<p>"Stay one minute," I began.</p>
<p>"Nay!" cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour forth to
                        detain him.</p>
<p>"And there I remained enclosed, the whole day, and the whole of the next
                        night; and <pb n="277"/>another, and another. Five nights and four days I
                        remained, altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton, once every morning, and he
                        was a model of a jailer—surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving
                        his sense of justice or compassion.</p>
