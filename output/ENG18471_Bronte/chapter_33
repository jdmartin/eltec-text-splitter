<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<p>1802.—This September, I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend, in
                        the North; and, on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came within
                        fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The hostler, at a roadside public-house, was
                        holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green
                        oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked—</p>
<p>"Yon's frough Gimmerton, nah! They're alias three wick' after other folk wi'
                        ther harvest."</p>
<p><pb n="341"/>"Gimmerton?" I repeated, my residence in that locality had
                        already grown dim and dreamy. "Ah! I know! How far is it from this?"</p>
<p>"Happen fourteen mile' o'er th' hills, and a rough road," he answered.</p>
<p>A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely noon,
                        and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own roof, as in
                        an inn. Besides, I could spare a day easily, to arrange matters with my
                        landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood
                        again.</p>
<p>Having rested a while, I directed my servant to inquire the way to the
                        village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we managed the distance in
                        some three hours.</p>
<p>I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey church looked
                        greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a moor sheep
                        cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm weather <pb n="342"/>—too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from
                        enjoying the delightful scenery above and below; had I seen it nearer
                        August, I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its
                        solitudes. In winter, nothing more dreary, in summer, nothing more divine,
                        than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells of
                        heath.</p>
<p>I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the
                        family had retreated into the back premises, I judged by one thin, blue
                        wreath curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear.</p>
<p>I rode into the court. Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten, sat knitting,
                        and an old woman reclined on the horse-steps, smoking a meditative pipe.</p>
<p>"Is Mrs. Dean within?" I demanded of the dame.</p>
<p>"Mistress Dean? Nay!" she answered, "shoo doesn't bide here; shoe's up at th'
                        Heights."</p>
<p><pb n="343"/>"Are you the housekeeper, then?" I continued.</p>
<p>"Eea, Aw keep th' hause," she replied.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master—Are there any rooms to lodge me in, I
                        wonder? I wish to stay here all night"</p>
<p>"T' maister!" she cried in astonishment, "Whet, whoiver knew yah wur coming?
                        Yah sud ha' send word! They's nowt norther dry—nor mensful abaht t'
                        place—nowt there is n't!'</p>
<p>She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I entered too;
                        soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, that I had almost
                        upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition.</p>
<p>I bid her be composed—I would go out for a walk; and, meantime, she must try
                        to prepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bed-room to
                        sleep in—No sweeping and dusting, only good fires and dry sheets were
                        necessary.</p>
<p>She seemed willing to do her best; though <pb n="344"/>she thrust the
                        hearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker; and mal-appropriated
                        several other articles of her craft; but I retired, confiding in her energy
                        for a resting-place against my return.</p>
<p>Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An after-thought
                        brought me back, when I had quitted the court.</p>
<p>"All well at the Heights?" I enquired of the woman.</p>
<p>"Eea, f'r owt Ee knaw!" she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot
                        cinders.</p>
<p>I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange; but it was
                        impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so, I turned away and made my
                        exit, rambling leisurely along with the glow of a sinking sun behind, and
                        the mild glory of a rising moon in front; one fading, and the other
                        brightening, as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road branching
                        off to Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.</p>
<p>Before I arrived in sight of it, all that <pb n="345"/>remained of day was a
                        beamless, amber light along the west; but I could see every pebble on the
                        path, and every blade of grass by that splendid moon.</p>
<p>I had neither to climb the gate, nor to knock—it yielded to my hand.</p>
<p>That is an improvement! I thought. And I noticed another, by the aid of my
                        nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wall flowers, wafted on the air, from
                        amongst the homely fruit trees.</p>
<p>Both doors and lattices were open; and, yet, as is usually the case in a coal
                        district, a fine, red fire illumined the chimney; the comfort which the eye
                        derives from it, renders the extra heat endurable. But the house of
                        Wuthering Heights is so large, that the inmates have plenty of space for
                        withdrawing out of its influence; and, accordingly, what inmates there were
                        had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows. I could both see
                        them and hear them talk before I entered; and, looked and listened in <pb n="346"/>consequence, being moved thereto by a mingled sense of
                        curiosity, and envy that grew as I lingered.</p>
<p>"Con-<hi>trary</hi>!" said a voice, as sweet as a silver bell—"That for the
                        third time, you dunce! I'm not going to tell you, again—Recollect, or I pull
                        your hair!"</p>
<p>"Contrary, then," answered another, in deep, but softened tones. And now,
                        kiss me, for minding so well."</p>
<p>"No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake."</p>
<p>The male speaker began to read—he was a young man, respectably dressed, and
                        seated at a table, having a book before him. His handsome features glowed
                        with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a
                        small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a smart slap on
                        the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention.</p>
<p>Its owner stood behind; her light shining <pb n="347"/>ringlets blending, at
                        intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent to superintend his studies; and
                        her face—it was lucky he could not see her face, or he would never have been
                        so steady—I could, and I bit my lip, in spite, at having thrown away the
                        chance I might have had, of doing something besides staring at its smiting
                        beauty.</p>
<p>The task was done, not free from further blunders, but the pupil claimed a
                        reward and received, at least five kisses, which, however, he generously
                        returned. Then, they came to the door, and from their conversation, I judged
                        they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors. I supposed I
                        should be condemned in Hareton Earashaw's heart, if not by his mouth, to the
                        lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed my unfortunate person in his
                        neighbourhood then, and feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to
                        seek refuge in the kitchen.</p>
<p>There, was unobstructed admittance on that <pb n="348"/>side also; and, at
                        the door, sat my old friend, Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song, which
                        was often interrupted from within, by harsh words of scorn and intolerance,
                        uttered in far from musical accents.</p>
<p>"Aw'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev 'em swearing i' my lugs frough morn tuh
                        neeght, nur hearken yah, hahsiver!" said the tenant of the kitchen, in
                        answer to an unheard speech of Nelly's. "It's a blazing shaime, ut Aw cannut
                        oppen t' Blessed Book, bud yah set up them glories tuh sattan, un' all t'
                        flay some wickednesses ut iver wer born intuh t' warld! Oh! yah're a raight
                        nowt; un' shoo's another; un' that poor lad 'ull be lost, atween ye. Poor
                        lad!" he added, with a groan; "he's witched, Aw'm sartin on't! O, Lord,
                        judge 'em, fur they's norther law nur justice amang wer rullers!"</p>
<p>"No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose," retorted the
                        singer. "But wisht, old man, and read your Bible, like a <pb n="349"/>christian, and never mind me. This is 'Fairy Annie's Wedding'—a bonny
                        tune—it goes to a dance."</p>
<p>Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced, and recognising me
                        directly, she jumped to her feet, crying—</p>
<p>"Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood! How could you think of returning in this way?
                        All's shut up at Thrushcross Grange. You should have given us notice!"</p>
<p>"I've arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay," I
                        answered. "I depart again to-morrow. And how are you transplanted here, Mrs.
                        Dean? tell me that."</p>
<p>"Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went to
                        London, and stay till you returned. But, step in, pray! Have you walked from
                        Gimmerton this evening?"</p>
<p>"From the Grange," I replied; "and, while they make me lodging room there, I
                        want to finish my business with your master, because <pb n="350"/>I don't
                        think of having another opportunity in a hurry."</p>
<p>"What business, sir?" said Nelly, conducting me into the house. "He's gone
                        out, at present, and wont return soon."</p>
<p>"About the rent," I answered.</p>
<p>"Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle," she observed, " or
                        rather with me. She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I act for
                        her; there's nobody else." I looked surprised.</p>
<p>"Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff's death, I see!" she continued.</p>
<p>"Heathcliff dead?" I exclaimed, astonished. "How long ago?"</p>
<p>"Three months since—but, sit down, and let me take your hat, and I'll tell
                        you all about it. Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?"</p>
<p>"I want nothing. I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too. I never
                        dreamt ot his dying! Let me hear how it came to pass <pb n="351"/>You say
                        you don't expect them back for some time—the young people?"</p>
<p>"No—I have to scold them every evening, for their late rambles—but they don't
                        care for me. At least, have a drink of our old ale—it will do you good—you
                        seem weary."</p>
<p>She hastened to fetch it, before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking,
                        whether "it warn't a crying scandal that she should have fellies at her time
                        of life? And then, to get them jocks out uh t' Maister's cellar! He fair
                        shaamed to 'bide still and see it."</p>
<p>She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered, in a minute, bearing a
                        reaming, silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness. And
                        afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff's history. He had
                        a "queer" end, as she expressed it.</p>
<p>"I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving us,"
                        she said; "and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine's sake.</p>
<p><pb n="352"/>"My first interview with her grieved and shocked me! she had
                        altered so much since our separation. Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his
                        reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he
                        wanted me, and he was tired of seeing Catherine, I must make the little
                        parlour my sitting room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were
                        obliged to see her once or twice a day.</p>
<p>"She seemed pleased at this arrangement; and, by degrees, I smuggled over a
                        great number of books, and other articles, that had formed her amusement at
                        the Grange; and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort.</p>
<p>"The delusion did not last long. Catherine, contented at first, in a brief
                        space grew irritable and restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move
                        out of the garden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow
                        bounds, as Spring drew on—for another, in following the house, I was forced
                        to quit her <pb n="353"/>frequently, and she complained of loneliness; she
                        preferred quarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen, to sitting at peace in her
                        solitude.</p>
<p>"I did not mind their skirmishes; but Hareton was often obliged to seek the
                        kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself; and,
                        though, in the beginning, she either left it at his approach, or quietly
                        joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking, or addressing him—and
                        though he was always as sullen and silent, as possible—after a while, she
                        changed her behaviour, and became incapable of letting him alone. Talking at
                        him; commenting on his stupidity and idleness; expressing her wonder how he
                        could endure the life he lived—how he could sit a whole evening staring into
                        the fire, and dozing.</p>
<p>"'He's just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?' she once observed, "or a
                        cart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps, eternally! What a
                        blank, dreary mind he must have! Do <pb n="354"/>you ever dream, Hareton?
                        And, if you do, what is it about? But, you can't speak to me!'</p>
<p>"Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth, nor look
                        again.</p>
<p>"'He's perhaps, dreaming now,' she continued. 'He twitched his shoulder as
                        Juno twitches hers. Ask him, Ellen."</p>
<p>"'Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you up stairs, if you don't
                        behave!' I said. He had not only twitched his shoulder, but clenched his
                        fist, as if tempted to use it.</p>
<p>"'I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,' she exclaimed,
                        on another occasion. 'He is afraid I shall laugh at him. Ellen, what do you
                        think? He began to teach himself to read once; and, because I laughed, he
                        burned his books, and dropped it—was he not a fool?'</p>
<p>"'Were not you naughty?' I said; 'answer me that.'</p>
<p>"'Perhaps I was,' she went on, 'but I did <pb n="355"/>not expect him to be
                        so silly. Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I'll
                        try!'</p>
<p>"She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and
                        muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.</p>
<p>"'Well I shall put it here,' she said, 'in the table drawer, and I'm going to
                        bed.'</p>
<p>"Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed. But he
                        would not come near it, and so I informed her in the morning, to her great
                        disappointment. I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and
                        indolence—her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving
                        himself—she had done it effectually.</p>
<p>But her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury; while I ironed, or
                        pursued other stationary employments I could not well do in in the
                        parlour—she would bring some pleasant volume, and read it aloud to me. When
                        Hareton was there, she generally paused in an <pb n="356"/>interesting part,
                        and left the book lying about—that she did repeatedly; but he was as
                        obstinate as a mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather
                        he took to smoking with Joseph, and they sat like automatons, one on each
                        side of the fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked
                        nonsense, as he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to
                        disregard it. On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions,
                        and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off
                        into the court or garden, the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried
                        and said, she was tired of living, her life was useless.</p>
<p>"Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost
                        banished Earnshaw out of his apartment. Owing to an accident, at the
                        commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen. His
                        gun burst, while out on the hills, by himself; a splinter cut his arm, and
                        he lost a good <pb n="357"/>deal of blood before he could reach home. The
                        consequence was, that, perforce, he was condemned to the fire-side and
                        tranquillity, till he made it up again.</p>
<p>"It suited Catherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her
                        room up stairs, more than ever; and she would compel me to find out business
                        below, that she might accompany me.</p>
<p>"On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and, in
                        the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen—Earnshaw sat,
                        morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was beguiling
                        an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window panes, varying her
                        amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations, and
                        quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her cousin,
                        who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate.</p>
<p>"At a notice that I could do with her no longer, intercepting my light, she
                        removed to <pb n="358"/>the hearthstone. I bestowed little attention on her
                        proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin—</p>
<p>"'I've found out, Hareton, that I want—that I'm glad—that I should like you
                        to be my cousin, now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so
                        rough.'</p>
<p>"Hareton returned no answer.</p>
<p>"'Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?' she continued.</p>
<p>"'Get off wi' ye!' he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.</p>
<p>"'Let me take that pipe,' she said, cautiously advancing her hand, and
                        abstracting it from his mouth.</p>
<p>"Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the fire.
                        He swore at her and seized another.</p>
<p>"'Stop,' she cried, 'you must listen to me, first; and I can't speak while
                        those clouds are floating in my face.'</p>
<p><pb n="359"/>"'Will you go to the devil!' he exclaimed, ferociously, 'and let
                        me be!'</p>
<p>"'No,' she persisted, 'I wont—I can't tell what to do to make you talk to me,
                        and you are determined not to understand. When I call you stupid, I don't
                        mean anything—I don't mean that I despise you. Come you shall take notice of
                        me, Hareton—you are my cousin, and you shall own me.'</p>
<p>"'I shall have naught to do wi' you, and your mucky pride, and your damned,
                        mocking tricks!' he answered. 'I'll go to hell, body and soul, before I look
                        sideways after you again! side out of t' gait, now; this minute!'</p>
<p>"Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat, chewing her lip, and
                        endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing tendency to
                        sob.</p>
<p>"'You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,' I interrupted, 'since
                        she repents of her sauciness! it would do you a great deal <pb n="360"/>of
                        good—it would make you another man, to have her for a companion.'</p>
<p>"'A companion?' he cried; 'when she hates me, and does not think me fit to
                        wipe her shoon! Nay, if it made me a king, I'd not be scorned for seeking
                        her good will any more.'</p>
<p>"'It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!' wept Cathy, no longer
                        disguising her trouble. 'You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does, and
                        more.'</p>
<p>"'You're a damned liar,' began Earnshaw; 'why have I made him angry, by
                        taking your part then, a hundred times? and that, when you sneered at, and
                        despised me, and—Go on plaguing me, and I'll step in yonder, and say you
                        worried me out of the kitchen!'</p>
<p>"'I didn't know you took my part,' she answered, drying her eyes; 'and I was
                        miserable and bitter at every body; but, now I thank you, and beg you to
                        forgive me, what can I do besides?'</p>
<p>"She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand.</p>
<p><pb n="361"/>"He blackened, and scowled like a thunder cloud, and kept his
                        fists resolutely clenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground.</p>
<p>"Catherine, by instinct, must have divined it was obdurate perversity, and
                        not dislike, that prompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an
                        instant, undecided, she stooped, and impressed on his cheek a gentle
                        kiss.</p>
<p>"The little rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took her
                        former station by the window, quite demurely.</p>
<p>"I shook my head reprovingly; and then she blushed, and whispered—</p>
<p>"'Well! what should I have done, Ellen? He wouldn't shake hands, and he
                        wouldn't look—I must show him some way that I like him, that I want to be
                        friends.'</p>
<p>"Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell; he was very careful, for
                        some minutes, that his face should not be seen; and when he did raise it, he
                        was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.</p>
<p><pb n="362"/>"Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly
                        in white paper; and having tied it with a bit of ribband, and addressed it
                        to 'Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,' she desired me to be her ambassadress, and convey
                        the present to its destined recipient.</p>
<p>"'And tell him, if he'll take it, I'll come and teach him to read it right,'
                        she said, 'and, if he refuse it, I'll go up stairs, and never tease him
                        again,'</p>
<p>"I carried it, and repeated the message, anxiously watched by my employer.
                        Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee. He did not
                        strike it off either. I returned to my work: Catherine leaned her head and
                        arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being
                        removed, then she stole away, and quietly seated herself beside her cousin.
                        He trembled, and his face glowed—all his rudeness, and all his surly
                        harshness had deserted him—he could not summon <pb n="363"/>courage, at
                        first, to utter a syllable, in reply to her questioning look, and her
                        murmured petition.</p>
<p>"'Say you forgive me, Hareton, do! You can make me so happy, by speaking that
                        little word.'</p>
<p>"He muttered something inaudible.</p>
<p>"'And you'll be my friend?' added Catherine, interrogatively.</p>
<p>"'Nay! you'll be ashamed of me every day of your life,' he answered. 'And the
                        more, the more you know me, and I cannot bide it.'</p>
<p>"'So, you wont be my friend?' she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and
                        creeping close up.</p>
<p>"I overheard no further distinguishable talk; but on looking round again, I
                        perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted
                        book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified, on both sides, and
                        the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.</p>
<p>"The work they studied was full of costly <pb n="364"/>pictures; and those,
                        and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved, till Joseph came
                        home. He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine
                        seated on the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his
                        shoulder; and confounded at his favourite's endurance of her proximity. It
                        affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night.
                        His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as he solemnly
                        spread his large bible on the table, and overlaid it with dirty bank-notes
                        from his pocket-book, the produce of the day's transactions. At length, he
                        summoned Hareton from his seat.</p>
<p>"'Tak' these in tuh t' maister, lad,' he said, 'un' bide theare; Aw's gang up
                        tuh my awn rahm. This hoile's norther mensful, nor seemly fur us—we mun side
                        aht, and seearch another!'</p>
<p>"'Come, Catherine, I said, we must 'side out,' too—I've done my ironing, are
                        you ready to go?'</p>
<p><pb n="365"/>"'It is not eight o'clock!' she answered, rising unwillingly,
                        'Hareton, I'll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I'll bring some
                        more to-morrow.'</p>
<p>"'Ony books ut yah leave, Aw suall tak' intuh th' hahse,' said Joseph, 'un'
                        it 'ull be mitch if yah find 'em agean; soa, yah muh plase yourseln!'</p>
<p>"Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as she
                        passed Hareton, went singing up stairs, lighter of heart, I venture to say,
                        than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps, during her
                        earliest visits to Linton.</p>
<p>"The intimacy, thus commenced, grew rapidly; though it encountered temporary
                        interruptions, Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish; and my young
                        lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their minds
                        tending to the same point—one loving and desiring to esteem; and the other
                        loving and desiring to be esteemed—they contrived in the end, to reach
                        it.</p>
<p><pb n="366"/>"You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs.
                        Heathcliff's heart; but now, I'm glad you did not try—the crown of all my
                        wishes will be the union of those two; I shall envy no one on their
                        wedding-day—there won't be a happier woman than myself in England!"</p>
