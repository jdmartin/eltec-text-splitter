<head>CHAPTER VII</head>
<head>A Bird's-eye Glimpse of Miss Tox's Dwelling-place; also of the State of Miss Tox's
     Affections</head>
<p>MISS TOX inhabited a dark little house that had been squeezed, at some remote period of
     English History, into a fashionable neighbourhood at the west end of the town, where it stood
     in the shad like a poor relation of the great street round the corner, coldly looked down upon
     by mighty mansions. It was not exactly in a court, and it was not exactly in a yard; but it was
     in the dullest of No-Thoroughfares, rendered anxious and haggard by distant double knocks. The
     name of this retirement, where grass grew between the chinks in the stone pavement, was
     Princess's Place; and in Princess's Place was Princess's Chapel, with a tinkling bell, where
     sometimes as many as five-and-twenty people attended service on a Sunday. The Princess's Arms
     was also there, and much resorted to by splendid footmen. A sedan chair was kept inside the
     railing before the Princess's Arms, but it had never come out within the memory of man; and on
     fine mornings, the top of every rail (there were eight-and-forty, as Miss Tox had often
     counted) was decorated with a pewter-pot. </p>
<p>There was another private house besides Miss Tox's in Princess's Place: not to mention an
     immense pair of gates, with an immense pair of lion-headed knockers on them, which were never
     opened by any chance, and were supposed to constitute a disused entrance to somebody's stables.
     Indeed, there was a smack of stabling in the air of Princess's Place; and Miss Tox's bedroom
     (which was at the back) commanded a vista of Mews, where hostlers, at whatever sort of work
     engaged, were continually accompanying themselves with effervescent noises; and where the most
     domestic and confidential garments of coachmen and their wives and families, usually hung, like
     Macbeth's banners, on the outward walls. </p>
<p>At this other private house in Princess's Place, tenanted by a retired butler who had married
     a housekeeper, apartments were let Furnished, to a single gentleman: to wit, a wooden-featured,
     blue-faced Major, with his eyes starting out of his head, in whom Miss Tox recognised, as she
     herself expressed it, `something so truly military;´ and between whom and herself, an
     occasional interchange of newspapers and pamphlets, and such Platonic dalliance, was effected
     through the medium of a dark servant of the Major's, who Miss Tox was quite content to classify
     as a `native,´ without connecting him with any geographical idea whatever. </p>
<p>Perhaps there never was a smaller entry and staircase, than the entry and staircase of Miss
     Tox's house. Perhaps, taken altogether, from top to bottom, it was the most inconvenient little
     house in England, and the crookedest; but then, Miss Tox said, what a situation! There was very
     little daylight to be got there in the winter: no sun at the best of times: air was out of the
     question, and traffic was walled out. Still Miss Tox said, think of the situation! So said the
     blue-faced Major, whose eyes were starting out of his head: who gloried in Princess's Place:
     and who delighted to turn the conversation at his club, whenever he could, to something
     connected with some of the great people in the great street round the corner, that he might
     have the satisfaction of saying they were his neighbours. </p>
<p>The dingy tenement inhabited by Miss Tox was her own; having been devised and bequeathed to
     her by the deceased owner of the fishy eye in the locket, of whom a miniature portrait, with a
     powdered head and a pigtail, balanced the kettleholder on opposite sides of the parlour
     fireplace. The greater part of the furniture was of the powdered-head and pig-tail period:
     comprising a platewarmer, always languishing and sprawling its four attenuated bow legs in
     somebody's way; and an obsolete harpsichord, illuminated round the maker's name with a painted
     garland of sweet peas. </p>
<p>Although Major Bagstock had arrived at what is called in polite literature, the grand
     meridian of life, and was proceeding on his journey down-hill with hardly any throat, and a
     very rigid pair of jaw-bones, and long-flapped elephantine ears, and his eyes and complexion in
     the state of artificial excitement already mentioned, he was mightily proud of awakening an
     interest in Miss Tox, and tickled his vanity with the fiction that she was a splendid woman,
     who had her eye on him. This he had several times hinted at the club: in connexion with little
     jocularities, of which old Joe Bagstock, old Joey Bagstock, old J. Bagstock, old Josh Bagstock,
     or so forth, was the perpetual theme: it being, as it were, the Major's stronghold and
     donjon-keep of light humour, to be on the most familiar terms with his own name. </p>
<p>`Joey B., Sir,´ the Major would say, with a flourish of his walking-stick, `is worth a dozen
     of you. If you had a few more of the Bagstock breed among you, Sir, you'd be none the worse for
     it. Old Joe, Sir, needn't look far for a wife even now, if he was on the look-out; but he's
     hard-hearted, Sir, is Joe—he's tough, Sir, tough, and de-vilish sly!´ After such a declaration
     wheezing sounds would be heard; and the Major's blue would deepen into purple, while his eyes
     strained and started convulsively. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding his very liberal laudation of himself, however, the Major was selfish. It may
     be doubted whether there ever was a more entirely selfish person at heart; or at stomach is
     perhaps a better expression, seeing that he was more decidedly endowed with that latter organ
     than with the former. He had no idea of being overlooked or slighted by anybody; least of all,
     had he the remotest comprehension of being over-looked and slighted by Miss Tox. </p>
<p>And yet, Miss Tox, as it appeared, forgot him—gradually forgot him. She began to forget him
     soon after her discovery of the Toodle family. She continued to forget him up to the time of
     the christening. She went on forgetting him with compound interest after that. Something or
     somebody had superseded him as a source of interest. </p>
<p>`Good morning, Ma'am,´ said the Major, meeting Miss Tox in Princess's Place, some weeks after
     the changes chronicled in the last chapter. </p>
<p>`Good morning, Sir,´ said Miss Tox; very coldly. </p>
<p>`Joe Bagstock, Ma'am,´ observed the Major, with his usual gallantry, `has not had the
     happiness of bowing to you at your window, for a considerable period. Joe has been hardly used,
     ma'am. His sun has been behind a cloud.´ </p>
<p>Miss Tox inclined her head; but very coldly indeed. </p>
<p>`Joe's luminary has been out of town, Ma'am, perhaps,´ inquired the Major. </p>
<p>`I? out of town? oh no, I have not been out of town,´ said Miss Tox. `I have been much
     engaged lately. My time is nearly all devoted to some very intimate friends. I am afraid I have
     none to spare, even now. Good morning, Sir!´ </p>
<p>As Miss Tox, with her most fascinating step and carriage, disappeared from Princess's Place,
     the Major stood looking after her with a bluer face than ever: muttering and growling some not
     at all complimentary remarks. </p>
<p>`Why, damme, Sir,´ said the Major, rolling his lobster eyes round and round Princess's Place,
     and apostrophizing its fragrant air, `six months ago, the woman loved the ground Joe Bagstock
     walked on. What's the meaning of it?´ </p>
<p>The Major decided, after some consideration, that it meant man-traps; that it meant plotting
     and snaring; that Miss Tox was digging pitfalls. `But you won't catch Joe, Ma'am,´ said the
     Major. `He's tough, Ma'am, tough, is J. B. Tough, and de-vilish sly!´ over which reflection he
     chuckled for the rest of the day. </p>
<p>But still, when that day and many other days were gone and past, it seemed that Miss Tox took
     no heed whatever of the Major, and thought nothing at all about him. She had been wont, once
     upon a time, to look out at one of her little dark windows by accident, and blushingly return
     the Major's greeting; but now, she never gave the Major a chance, and cared nothing at all
     whether he looked over the way or not. Other changes had come to pass too. The Major, standing
     in the shade of his own apartment, could make out that an air of greater smartness had recently
     come over Miss Tox's house; that a new cage with gilded wires had been provided for the ancient
     little canary bird; that divers ornaments, cut out of coloured card-boards and paper, seemed to
     decorate the chimney-piece and tables; that a plant or two had suddenly sprung up in the
     windows; that Miss Tox occasionally practised on the harpsichord, whose garland of sweet peas
     was always displayed ostentatiously, crowned with the Copenhagen and Bird Waltzes in a Music
     Book of Miss Tox's own copying. </p>
<p>Over and above all this, Miss Tox had long been dressed with uncommon care and elegance in
     slight mourning. But this helped the Major out of his difficulty; and he determined within
     himself that she had come into a small legacy, and grown proud. </p>
<p>It was on the very next day after he had eased his mind by arriving at this decision, that
     the Major, sitting at his breakfast, saw an apparition so tremendous and wonderful in Miss
     Tox's little drawing-room, that he remained for some time rooted to his chair; then, rushing
     into the next room, returned with a double-barrelled opera-glass, through which he surveyed it
     intently for some minutes. </p>
<p>`It's a Baby, Sir,´ said the Major, shutting up the glass again, `for fifty thousand pounds!´ </p>
<p>The Major couldn't forget it. He could do nothing but whistle, and stare to that extent, that
     his eyes compared with what they now became, had been in former times quite cavernous and
     sunken. Day after day, two, three, four times a week, this Baby reappeared. The Major continued
     to stare and whistle. To all other intents and purposes he was alone in Princess's Place. Miss
     Tox has ceased to mind what he did. He might have been black as well as blue, and it would have
     been of no consequence to her. </p>
<p>The perseverance with which she walked out of Princess's Place to fetch this baby and its
     nurse, and walked back with them, and walked home with them again, and continually mounted
     guard over them; and the perseverance with which she nursed it herself, and fed it, and played
     with it, and froze its young blood with airs upon the harpsichord; was extraordinary. At about
     this same period, too, she was seized with a passion for looking at a certain bracelet; also
     with a passion for looking at the moon, of which she would take long observations from her
     chamber window. But whatever she looked at; sun, moon, stars, or bracelet; she looked no more
     at the Major. And the Major whistled, and stared, and wondered, and dodged about his room, and
     could make nothing of it. </p>
<p>`You'll quite win my brother Paul's heart, and that's the truth, my dear,´ said Mrs. Chick,
     one day. </p>
<p>Miss Tox turned pale. </p>
<p>`He grows more like Paul every day,´ said Mrs. Chick. </p>
<p>Miss Tox returned no other reply than by taking the little Paul in her arms, and making his
     cockade perfectly flat and limp with her caresses. </p>
<p>`His mother, my dear,´ said Miss Tox, `whose acquaintance I was to have made through you,
     does he at all resemble her?´ </p>
<p>`Not at all,´ returned Louisa. </p>
<p>`She was—she was pretty, I believe?´ faltered Miss Tox. </p>
<p>`Why, poor dear Fanny was interesting,´ said Mrs. Chick, after some judicial consideration.
     `Certainly interesting. She had not that air of commanding superiority which one would somehow
     expect, almost as a matter of course, to find in my brother's wife; nor had she that strength
     and vigour of mind which such a man requires.´ </p>
<p>Miss Tox heaved a deep sigh. </p>
<p>`But she was pleasing:´ said Mrs. Chick: `extremely so. And she meant!—oh, dear, how well
     poor Fanny meant!´ </p>
<p>`You Angel!´ cried Miss Tox to little Paul. `You picture of you own Papa!´ </p>
<p>If the Major could have known how many hopes and ventures, what a multitude of plans and
     speculations, rested on that baby head; and could have seen them hovering, in all their
     heterogeneous confusion and disorder, round the puckered cap of the unconscious little Paul; he
     might have stared indeed. Then would he have recognised, among the crowd, some few ambitious
     motes and beams belonging to Miss Tox; then would he perhaps have understood the nature of that
     lady's faltering investment in the Dombey Firm. </p>
<p>If the child himself could have awakened in the night, and seen, gathered about his
     cradle-curtains, faint reflections of the dreams that other people had of him, they might have
     scared him, with good reason. But he slumbered on, alike unconscious of the kind intentions of
     Miss Tox, the wonder of the Major, the early sorrows of his sister, and the stern visions of
     his father; and innocent that any spot of earth contained a Dombey or a Son. </p>
