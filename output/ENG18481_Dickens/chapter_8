<head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
<head>Paul's further Progress, Growth, and Character</head>
<p>BENEATH the watching and attentive eyes of Time—so far another Major—Paul's slumbers
     gradually changed. More and more light broke in upon them; distincter and distincter dreams
     disturbed them; an accumulating crowd of objects and impressions swarmed about his rest; and so
     he passed from babyhood to childhood, and became a talking, walking, wondering Dombey. </p>
<p>On the downfall and banishment of Richards, the nursery may be said to have been put into
     commission: as a Public Department is sometimes, when no individual Atlas can be found to
     support it. The Commissioners were, of course, Mrs. Chick and Miss Tox: who devoted themselves
     to their duties with such astonishing ardour that Major Bagstock had every day some new
     reminder of his being forsaken, while Mr. Chick, bereft of domestic supervision, cast himself
     upon the gay world, dined at clubs and coffee-houses, smelt of smoke on three different
     occasions, went to the play by himself, and in short, loosened (as Mrs. Chick once told him)
     every social bond, and moral obligation. </p>
<p>Yet, in spite of his early promise, all this vigilance and care could not make little Paul a
     thriving boy. Naturally delicate, perhaps, he pined and wasted after the dismissal of his
     nurse, and, for a long time, seemed but to wait his opportunity of gliding through their hands,
     and seeking his lost mother. This dangerous ground in his steeple-chase towards manhood passed,
     he still found it very rough riding, and was grievously beset by all the obstacles in his
     course. Every tooth was a break-neck fence, and every pimple in the measles a stone wall to
     him. He was down in every fit of the hooping-cough, and rolled upon and crushed by a whole
     field of small diseases, that came trooping on each other's heels to prevent his getting up
     again. Some bird of prey got into his throat instead of the thrush; and the very chickens
     turning ferocious—if they have anything to do with that infant malady to which they lend their
     name—worried him like tiger-cats. </p>
<p>The chill of Paul's christening had struck home, perhaps to some sensitive part of his
     nature, which could not recover itself in the cold shade of his father; but he was an
     unfortunate child from that day. Mrs. Wickam often said she never see a dear so put upon. </p>
<p>Mrs. Wickam was a waiter's wife—which would seem equivalent to being any other man's
     widow—whose application for an engagement in Mr. Dombey's service had been favourably
     considered, on account of the apparent impossibility of her having any followers, or any one to
     follow; and who, from within a day or two of Paul's sharp weaning, had been engaged as his
     nurse. Mrs. Wickam was a meek woman, of a fair complexion, with her eyebrows always elevated,
     and her head always drooping; who was always ready to pity herself, or to be pitied, or to pity
     anybody else; and who had a surprising natural gift of viewing all subjects in an utterly
     forlorn and pitiable light, and bringing dreadful precedents to bear upon them, and deriving
     the greatest consolation from the exercise of that talent. </p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to observe, that no touch of this quality ever reached the magnificent
     knowledge of Mr. Dombey. It would have been remarkable, indeed, if any had; when no one in the
     house—not even Mrs. Chick or Miss Tox—dared ever whisper to him that there had, on any one
     occasion, been the least reason for uneasiness in reference to little Paul. He had settled,
     within himself, that the child must necessarily pass through a certain routine of minor
     maladies, and that the sooner he did so the better. If he could have bought him off, or
     provided a substitute, as in the case of an unlucky drawing for the militia, he would have been
     glad to do so on liberal terms. But as this was not feasible, he merely wondered, in his
     haughty manner, now and then, what Nature meant by it; and comforted himself with the
     reflection that there was another milestone passed upon the road, and that the great end of the
     journey lay so much the nearer. For the feeling uppermost in his mind, now and constantly
     intensifying, and increasing in it as Paul grew older, was impatience. Impatience for the time
     to come, when his visions of their united consequence and grandeur would be triumphantly
     realized. </p>
<p>Some Philosophers tell us that selfishness is at the root of our best loves and affections.
     Mr. Dombey's young child was, from the beginning, so distinctly important to him as a part of
     his own greatness, or (which is the same thing) of the greatness of Dombey and Son, that there
     is no doubt his parental affection might have been easily traced, like many a goodly
     super-structure of fair fame, to a very low foundation. But he loved his son with all the love
     he had. If there were a warm place in his frosty heart, his son occupied it; if its very hard
     surface could receive the impression of any image, the image of that son was there; though not
     so much as an infant, or as a boy, but as a grown man—the `Son´ of the Firm. Therefore he was
     impatient to advance into the future, and to hurry over the intervening passages of his
     history. Therefore he had little or no anxiety about them, in spite of his love; feeling as if
     the boy had a charmed life, and <hi>must</hi> become the man with whom he held such constant
     communication in his thoughts, and for whom he planned and projected, as for an existing
     reality, every day. </p>
<p>Thus Paul grew to be nearly five years old. He was a pretty little fellow; though there was
     something wan and wistful in his small face, that gave occasion to many significant shakes of
     Mrs. Wickam's head, and many long-drawn inspirations of Mrs. Wickam's breath. His temper gave
     abundant promise of being imperious in after-life; and he had as hopeful an apprehension of his
     own importance, and the rightful subservience of all other things and persons to it, as heart
     could desire. He was childish and sportive enough at times, and not of a sullen disposition;
     but he had a strange, old-fashioned, thoughtful way, at other times, of sitting brooding in his
     miniature armchair, when he looked (and talked) like one of those terrible little Beings in the
     Fairy tales, who, at a hundred and fifty or two hundred years of age, fantastically represent
     the children for whom they have been substituted. He would frequently be stricken with this
     precocious mood upstairs in the nursery; and would sometimes lapse into it suddenly, exclaiming
     that he was tired: even while playing with Florence, or driving Miss Tox in single harness. But
     at no time did he fall into it so surely, as when, his little chair being carried down into his
     father's room, he sat there with him after dinner, by the fire. They were the strangest pair at
     such a time that ever firelight shone upon. Mr. Dombey so erect and solemn, gazing at the
     blaze; his little image, with an old, old face, peering into the red perspective with the fixed
     and rapt attention of a sage. Mr. Dombey entertaining complicated worldly schemes and plans;
     the little image entertaining Heaven knows what wild fancies, half-formed thoughts, and
     wandering speculations. Mr. Dombey stiff with starch and arrogance; the little image by
     inheritance, and in unconscious imitation. The two so very much alike, and yet so monstrously
     contrasted. </p>
<p>On one of these occasions, when they had both been perfectly quiet for a long time, and Mr.
     Dombey only knew that the child was awake by occasionally glancing at his eye, where the bright
     fire was sparkling like a jewel, little Paul broke silence thus: </p>
<p>`Papa! what's money?´ </p>
<p>The abrupt question had such immediate reference to the subject of Mr. Dombey's thoughts,
     that Mr. Dombey was quite disconcerted. </p>
<p>`What is money, Paul?´ he answered. `Money?´ </p>
<p>`Yes,´ said the child, laying his hands upon the elbows of his little chair, and turning the
     old face up towards Mr. Dombey's; `what is money?´ </p>
<p>Mr. Dombey was in a difficulty. He would have liked to give him some explanation involving
     the terms circulating-medium, currency, depreciation of currency, paper, bullion, rates of
     exchange, value of precious metals in the market, and so forth; but looking down at the little
     chair, and seeing what a long way down it was, he answered: `Gold, and silver, and copper.
     Guineas, shillings, half-pence. You know what they are?´ </p>
<p>`Oh yes, I know what they are,´ said Paul. `I don't mean that, Papa. I mean what's money
     after all?´ </p>
<p>Heaven and Earth, how old his face was as he turned it up again towards his father's! </p>
<p>`What is money after all!´ said Mr. Dombey, backing his chair a little, that he might the
     better gaze in sheer amazement at the presumptuous atom that propounded such an inquiry. </p>
<p>`I mean, Papa, what can it do?´ returned Paul, folding his arms (they were hardly long enough
     to fold), and looking at the fire, and up at him, and at the fire, and up at him again. </p>
<p>Mr. Dombey drew his chair back to its former place, and patted him on the head. `You'll know
     better by-and-by, my man,´ he said. `Money, Paul, can do anything.' He took hold of the little
     hand, and beat it softly against one of his own, as he said so. </p>
<p>But Paul got his hand free as soon as he could; and rubbing it gently to and fro on the elbow
     of his chair, as if his wit were in the palm, and he were sharpening it—and looking at the fire
     again, as though the fire had been his adviser and prompter—repeated, after a short pause: </p>
<p>`Anything, Papa?´ </p>
<p>`Yes. Anything—almost,´ said Mr. Dombey. </p>
<p>`Anything means everything, don't it, Papa?´ asked his son: not observing, or possibly not
     understanding, the qualification. </p>
<p>`It includes it: yes,´ said Mr. Dombey. </p>
<p>`Why didn't money save me my Mama?´ returned the child. `It isn't cruel, is it?´ </p>
<p>`Cruel!´ said Mr. Dombey, settling his neckcloth, and seeming to resent the idea. `No. A good
     thing can't be cruel.´ </p>
<p>`If it's a good thing, and can do anything,´ said the little fellow, thoughtfully, as he
     looked back at the fire, `I wonder why it didn't save me my Mama.´ </p>
<p>He didn't ask the question of his father this time. Perhaps he had seen, with a child's
     quickness, that it had already made his father uncomfortable. But he repeated the thought
     aloud, as if it were quite an old one to him, and had troubled him very much; and sat with his
     chin resting on his hand, still cogitating and looking for an explanation in the fire. </p>
<p>Mr. Dombey having recovered from his surprise, not to say his alarm (for it was the very
     first occasion on which the child had ever broached the subject of his mother to him, though he
     had had him sitting by his side, in this same manner, evening after evening), expounded to him
     how that money, though a very potent spirit, never to be disparaged on any account whatever,
     could not keep people alive whose time was come to die; and how that we must all die,
     unfortunately, even in the City, though we were never so rich. But how that money caused us to
     be honoured, feared, respected, courted, and admired, and made us powerful and glorious in the
     eyes of all men; and how that it could, very often, even keep off death, for a long time
     together. How, for example, it had secured to his Mama the services of Mr. Pilkins, by which
     he, Paul, had often profited himself; likewise of the great Doctor Parker Peps, whom he had
     never known. And how it could do all, that could be done. This, with more to the same purpose,
     Mr. Dombey instilled into the mind of his son, who listened attentively, and seemed to
     understand the greater part of what was said to him. </p>
<p>`It can't make me strong and quite well, either, Papa; can it?´ asked Paul, after a short
     silence; rubbing his tiny hands. </p>
<p>`Why, you <hi>are</hi> strong and quite well,´ returned Mr. Dombey. `Are you not?´ </p>
<p>Oh! the age of the face that was turned up again, with an expression, half of melancholy,
     half of slyness, on it! </p>
<p>`You are as strong and well as such little people usually are? Eh?´ said Mr. Dombey. </p>
<p>`Florence is older than I am, but I'm not as strong and well as Florence, I know,´ returned
     the child; `but I believe that when Florence was as little as me, she could play a great deal
     longer at a time without tiring herself. I am so tired sometimes,´ said little Paul, warming
     his hands, and looking in between the bars of the grate, as if some ghostly puppet-show were
     performing there, `and my bones ache so (Wickam says it's my bones), that I don't know what to
     do.´ </p>
<p>`Aye! But that's at night,´ said Mr. Dombey, drawing his own chair closer to his son's, and
     laying his hand gently on his back; `little people should be tired at night, for then they
     sleep well.´ </p>
<p>`Oh, it's not at night, Papa,´ returned the child, `it's in the day; and I lie down in
     Florence's lap, and she sings to me. At night I dream about such curi-ous things!´ </p>
<p>And he went on, warming his hands again, and thinking about them, like an old man or a young
     goblin. </p>
<p>Mr. Dombey was so astonished, and so uncomfortable, and so perfectly at loss how to pursue
     the conversation, that he could only sit looking at his son by the light of the fire, with his
     hand resting on his back, as if it were detained there by some magnetic attraction. Once he
     advanced his other hand, and turned the contemplative face towards his own for a moment. But it
     sought the fire again as soon as he released it; and remained, addressed towards the flickering
     blaze, until the nurse appeared, to summon him to bed. </p>
<p>`I want Florence to come for me,´ said Paul. </p>
<p>`Won't you come with your poor Nurse Wickam, Master Paul?´ inquired that attendant, with
     great pathos. </p>
<p>`No, I won't,´ replied Paul, composing himself in his armchair again, like the master of
     house. </p>
<p>Invoking a blessing upon his innocence, Mrs. Wickam withdrew, and presently Florence appeared
     in her stead. The child immediately started up with sudden readiness and animation, and raised
     towards his father in bidding him good night, a countenance so much brighter, so much younger,
     and so much more childlike altogether, that Mr. Dombey, while he felt greatly reassured by the
     change, was quite amazed at it. </p>
<p>After they had left the room together, he thought he heard a soft voice singing; and
     remembering that Paul had said his sister sung to him, he had the curiosity to open the door
     and listen, and look after them. She was toiling up the great, wide, vacant staircase, with him
     in her arms; his head was lying on her shoulder, one of his arms thrown negligently round her
     neck. So they went, toiling up; she singing all the way, and Paul sometimes crooning out a
     feeble accompaniment. Mr. Dombey looked after them until they reached the top of the
     staircase—not without halting to rest by the way—and passed out of his sight; and then he still
     stood gazing upwards, until the dull rays of the moon, glimmering in a melancholy manner
     through the dim skylight, sent him back to his own room. </p>
<p>Mrs. Chick and Miss Tox were convoked in council at dinner next day; and when the cloth was
     removed, Mr. Dombey opened the proceedings by requiring to be informed, without any gloss or
     reservation, whether there was anything the matter with Paul, and what Mr. Pilkins said about
     him. </p>
<p>`For the child is hardly,´ said Mr. Dombey, `as stout as I could wish.´ </p>
<p>`With your usual happy discrimination, my dear Paul,´ returned Mrs. Chick, `you have hit the
     point at once. Our darling is <hi>not</hi> altogether as stout as we could wish. The fact is,
     that his mind is too much for him. His soul is a great deal too large for his frame. I am sure
     the way in which that dear child talks!´ said Mrs. Chick, shaking her head; `no one would
     believe. His expressions, Lucretia, only yesterday upon the subject of Funerals!—´ </p>
<p>`I am afraid,´ said Mr. Dombey, interrupting her testily, `that some of those persons
     upstairs suggest improper subjects to the child. He was speaking to me last night about
     his—about his Bones,´ said Mr. Dombey, laying an irritated stress upon the word. `What on earth
     has anybody to do with the—with the—Bones of my son? He is not a living skeleton, I suppose.´ </p>
<p>`Very far from it,´ said Mrs. Chick, with unspeakable expression. </p>
<p>`I hope so,´ returned her brother. `Funerals again! who talks to the child of funerals? We
     are not undertakers, or mutes, or grave-diggers, I believe.´ </p>
<p>`Very far from it,´ interposed Mrs. Chick, with the same profound expression as before. </p>
<p>`Then who puts such things into his head?´ said Mr. Dombey. `Really I was quite dismayed and
     shocked last night. Who puts such things into his head, Louisa?´ </p>
<p>`My dear Paul,´ said Mrs. Chick, after a moment's silence, `it is of no use inquiring. I do
     not think, I will tell you candidly, that Wickam is a person of very cheerful spirit, or what
     one would call a—´ </p>
<p>`A daughter of Momus,´ Miss Tox softly suggested. </p>
<p>`Exactly so,´ said Mrs. Chick; `but she is exceedingly attentive and useful, and not at all
     presumptuous; indeed I never saw a more biddable woman. If the dear child,´ pursued Mrs. Chick,
     in the tone of one who was summing up what had been previously quite agreed upon, instead of
     saying it all for the first time, `is a little weakened by that last attack, and is not in
     quite such vigorous health as we could wish; and if he has some temporary weakness in his
     system, and does occasionally seem about to lose, for the moment, the use of his—´ </p>
<p>Mrs. Chick was afraid to say limbs, after Mr. Dombey's recent objection to bones, and
     therefore waited for a suggestion from Miss Tox, who, true to her office, hazarded `members.´ </p>
<p>`Members!´ repeated Mr. Dombey. </p>
<p>`I think the medical gentleman mentioned legs this morning, my dear Louisa, did he not?´ said
     Miss Tox. </p>
<p>`Why, of course he did, my love,´ retorted Mrs. Chick, mildly reproachful. `How can you ask
     me? You heard him. I say, if our dear Paul should lose, for the moment, the use of his legs,
     these are casualties common to many children at his time of life, and not to be prevented by
     any care or caution. The sooner you understand that, Paul, and admit that, the better.´ </p>
<p>`Surely you must know, Louisa,´ observed Mr. Dombey, `that I don't question your natural
     devotion to, and regard for, the future head of my house. Mr. Pilkins saw Paul this morning, I
     believe?´ said Mr. Dombey. </p>
<p>`Yes, he did,´ returned his sister. `Miss Tox and myself were present, Miss Tox and myself
     are always present. We make a point of it. Mr. Pilkins has seen him for some days past, and a
     very clever man I believe him to be. He says it is nothing to speak of; which I can confirm, if
     that is any consolation; but he recommended, to-day, sea-air. Very wisely, Paul, I feel
     convinced.´ </p>
<p>`Sea-air,´ repeated Mr. Dombey, looking at his sister. </p>
<p>`There is nothing to be made uneasy by, in that,´ said Mrs. Chick. `My George and Frederick
     were both ordered sea-air, when they were about his age; and I have been ordered it myself a
     great many times. I quite agree with you, Paul, that perhaps topics may be incautiously
     mentioned upstairs before him, which it would be as well for his little mind not to expatiate
     upon; but I really don't see how that is to be helped in the case of a child of his quickness.
     If he were a common child, there would be nothing in it. I must say I think, with Miss Tox,
     that a short absence from this house, the air of Brighton, and the bodily and mental training
     of so judicious a person as Mrs. Pipchin for instance—´ </p>
<p>`Who is Mrs. Pipchin, Louisa?´ asked Mr. Dombey; aghast at this familiar introduction of a
     name he had never heard before. </p>
<p>`Mrs. Pipchin, my dear Paul,´ returned his sister, `is an elderly lady—Miss Tox knows her
     whole history—who has for some time devoted all the energies of her mind, with the greatest
     success, to the study and treatment of infancy, and who has been extremely well connected. Her
     husband broke his heart in—how did you say her husband broke his heart, my dear? I forget the
     precise circumstances.´ </p>
<p>`In pumping water out of the Peruvian Mines,´ replied Miss Tox. </p>
<p>`Not being a Pumper himself, of course,´ said Mrs. chick, glancing at her brother; and it
     really did seem necessary to offer the explanation, for Miss Tox had spoken of him as if he had
     died at the handle; `but having invested money in the speculation, which failed. I believe that
     Mrs. Pipchin's management of children is quite astonishing. I have heard it commended in
     private circles ever since I was—dear me—how high!´ Mrs. Chick's eye wandered about the
     bookcase near the bust of Mr. Pitt, which was about ten feet from the ground. </p>
<p>`Perhaps I should say of Mrs. Pipchin, my dear Sir,´ observed Miss Tox, with an ingenuous
     blush, `having been so pointedly referred to, that the encomium which has been passed upon her
     by your sweet sister is well merited. Many ladies and gentlemen, now grown up to be interesting
     members of society, have been indebted to her care. The humble individual who addresses you was
     once under her charge. I believe Juvenile nobility itself is no stranger to her establishment.´ </p>
<p>`Do I understand that this respectable matron keeps an establishment, Miss Tox?' inquired Mr.
     Dombey, condescendingly. </p>
<p>`Why, I really don't know,´ rejoined that lady, `whether I am justified in calling it so. It
     is not a Preparatory School by any means. Should I express my meaning,´ said Miss Tox, with
     peculiar sweetness, `if I designated it an infantine Boarding-House of a very select
     description?´ </p>
<p>`On an exceedingly limited and particular scale,´ suggested Mrs. Chick, with a glance at her
     brother. </p>
<p>`Oh! Exclusion itself!´ said Miss Tox. </p>
<p>There was something in this. Mrs. Pipchin's husband having broken his heart of the Peruvian
     mines was good. It had a rich sound. Besides, Mr. Dombey was in a state almost amounting to
     consternation at the idea of Paul remaining where he was one hour after his removal had been
     recommended by the medical practitioner. It was a stoppage and delay upon the road the child
     must traverse, slowly at the best, before the goal was reached. Their recommendation of Mrs.
     Pipchin had great weight with him; for he knew that they were jealous of any interference with
     their charge, and he never for a moment took it into account that they might be solicitous to
     divide a responsibility, of which he had, as shown just now, his own established views. Broke
     his heart of the Peruvian mines, mused Mr. Dombey. Well, a very respectable way of doing it. </p>
<p>`Supposing we should decide, on to-morrow's inquiries, to send Paul down to Brighton to this
     lady, who would go with him?´ inquired Mr. Dombey, after some reflection. </p>
<p>`I don't think you could send the child anywhere at present without Florence, my dear Paul,´
     returned his sister, hesitating. `It's quite an infatuation with him. He's very young, you
     know, and has his fancies.´ </p>
<p>Mr. Dombey turned his head away, and going slowly to the bookcase, and unlocking it, brought
     back a book to read. </p>
<p>`Anybody else, Louisa?´ he said, without looking up, and turning over the leaves. </p>
<p>`Wickam, of course. Wickam would be quite sufficient, I should say,´ returned his sister.
     `Paul being in such hands as Mrs. Pipchin's, you could hardly send anybody who would be a
     further check upon her. You would go down yourself once a-week at least, of course.´ </p>
<p>`Of course,´ said Mr. Dombey; and sat looking at one page for an hour afterwards, without
     reading one word. </p>
<p>This celebrated Mrs. Pipchin was a marvellous ill-favoured, ill-conditioned old lady, of a
     stooping figure, with a mottled face, like bad marble, a hook nose, and a hard grey eye, that
     looked as if it might have been hammered at on an anvil without sustaining any injury. Forty
     years at least had elapsed since the Peruvian mines had been the death of Mr. Pipchin; but his
     relict still wore black bombazeen, of such a lustreless, deep, dead, sombre shade, that gas
     itself couldn't light her up after dark, and her presence was a quencher to any number of
     candles. She was generally spoken of as `a great manager´ of children; and the secret of her
     management was, to give them everything that they didn't like, and nothing that they did—which
     was found to sweeten their dispositions very much. She was such a bitter old lady, that one was
     tempted to believe there had been some mistake in the application of the Peruvian machinery,
     and that all her waters of gladness and milk of human kindness, had been pumped out dry,
     instead of the mines. </p>
<p>The Castle of this ogress and child-queller was in a steep by-street at righton; where the
     soil was more than usually chalky, flinty, and sterile, and the houses were more than usually
     brittle and thin; where the small frontgardens had the unaccountable property of producing
     nothing but marigolds, whatever was sown in them; and where snails were constantly discovered
     holding on to the street doors, and other public places they were not expected to ornament,
     with the tenacity of cupping-glasses. In the winter time the air couldn't be got out of the
     Castle, and in the summer time it couldn't be got in. There was such a continual reverberation
     of wind in it, that it sounded like a great shell, which the inhabitants were obliged to hold
     to their ears night and day, whether they liked it or no. It was not, naturally, a
     freshsmelling house; and in the window of the front parlour, which was never opened, Mrs.
     Pipchin kept a collection of plants in pots, which imparted an earthy flavour of their own to
     the establishment. However choice examples of their kind, too, these plants were of a kind
     peculiarly adapted to the embowerment of Mrs. Pipchin. There were half-a-dozen specimens of the
     cactus, writhing round bits of lath, like hairy serpents; another specimen shooting out broad
     claws, like a green lobster; several creeping vegetables, possessed of sticky and adhesive
     leaves; and one uncomfortable flower-pot hanging to the ceiling, which appeared to have boiled
     over, and tickling people underneath with its long green ends, reminded them of spiders—in
     which Mrs. Pipchin's dwelling was uncommonly prolific, though perhaps it challenged competition
     still more proudly, in the season, in point of earwigs. </p>
<p>Mrs. Pipchin's scale of charges being high, however, to all who could afford to pay, and Mrs.
     Pipchin very seldom sweetening the equable acidity of her nature in favour of anybody, she was
     held to be an old lady of remarkable firmness, who was quite scientific in her knowledge of the
     childish character. On this reputation, and on the broken heart of Mr. Pipchin, she had
     contrived, taking one year with another, to eke out a tolerable sufficient living since her
     husband's demise. Within three days after Mrs. Chick's first allusion to her, this excellent
     old lady had the satisfaction of anticipating a handsome addition to her current receipts, from
     the pocket of Mr. Dombey; and of receiving Florence and her little brother Paul, as inmates of
     the Castle. </p>
<p>Mrs. Chick and Miss Tox, who had brought them down on the previous night (which they all
     passed at an Hotel), had just driven away from the door, on their journey home again; and Mrs.
     Pipchin, with her back to the fire, stood, reviewing the new-comers, like an old soldier. Mrs.
     Pipchin's middle-aged niece, her good-natured and devoted slave, but possessing a gaunt and
     ironbound aspect, and much afflicted with boils on her nose, was divesting Master Bitherstone
     of the clean collar he had worn on parade. Miss Pankey, the only other little boarder at
     present, had that moment been walked off to the Castle Dungeon (an empty apartment at the back,
     devoted to correctional purposes), for having sniffed thrice, in the presence of visitors. </p>
<p>`Well, Sir,´ said Mrs. Pipchin to Paul, `how do you think you shall like me?´ </p>
<p>`I don't think I shall like you at all,´ replied Paul. `I want to go away. This isn't my
     house.´ </p>
<p>`No. It's mine,´ retorted Mrs. Pipchin. </p>
<p>`It's a very nasty one,´ said Paul. </p>
<p>`There's a worse place in it than this though,´ said Mrs. Pipchin, `where we shut up our bad
     boys.´ </p>
<p>`Has <hi>he</hi> ever been in it?´ asked Paul: pointing out Master Bitherstone. </p>
<p>Mrs. Pipchin nodded assent; and Paul had enough to do, for the rest of that day, in surveying
     Master Bitherstone from head to foot, and watching all the workings of his countenance, with
     the interest attaching to a boy of mysterious and terrible experiences. </p>
<p>At one o'clock there was a dinner, chiefly of the farinaceous and vegetable kind, when Miss
     Pankey (a mild little blue-eyed morsel of a child, who was shampoo'd every morning, and seemed
     in danger of being rubbed away, altogether) was led in from captivity by the ogress herself,
     and instructed that nobody who sniffed before visitors ever went to Heaven. When this great
     truth had been thoroughly impressed upon her, she was regaled with rice; and subsequently
     repeated the form of grace established in the Castle, in which there was a special clause,
     thanking Mrs. Pipchin for a good dinner. Mrs. Pipchin's niece, Berinthia, took cold pork. Mrs.
     Pipchin, whose constitution required warm nourishment, made a special repast of mutton-chops,
     which were brought in hot and hot, between two plates, and smelt very nice. </p>
<p>As it rained after dinner, and they couldn't go out walking on the beach, and Mrs. Pipchin's
     constitution required rest after chops, they went away with Berry (otherwise Berinthia) to the
     Dungeon; an empty room looking out upon a chalk wall and a water-butt, and made ghastly by a
     ragged fireplace without any stove in it. Enlivened by company, however, this was the best
     place after all; for Berry played with them there, and seemed to enjoy a game at romps as much
     as they did; until Mrs. Pipchin knocking angrily at the wall, like the Cock Lane Ghost revived,
     they left off, and Berry told them stories in a whisper until twilight. </p>
<p>For tea there was plenty of milk and water, and bread and butter, with a little black tea-pot
     for Mrs. Pipchin and Berry, and buttered toast unlimited for Mrs. Pipchin, which was brought
     in, hot and hot, like the chops. Though Mrs. Pipchin got very greasy, outside, over this dish,
     it didn't seem to lubricate her internally, at all; for she was as fierce as ever, and the hard
     grey eye knew no softening. </p>
<p>After tea, Berry brought out a little work-box, with the Royal Pavilion on the lid, and fell
     to working busily; while Mrs. Pipchin, having put on her spectacles and opened a great volume
     bound in green baize, began to nod. And whenever Mrs. Pipchin caught herself falling forward
     into the fire, and woke up, she filliped Master Bitherstone on the nose for nodding too. </p>
<p>At last it was the children's bedtime, and after prayers they went to bed. As little Miss
     Pankey was afraid of sleeping alone in the dark, Mrs. Pipchin always made a point of driving
     her up stairs herself, like a sheep; and it was cheerful to hear Miss Pankey moaning long
     afterwards, in the least eligible chamber, and Mrs. Pipchin now and then going in to shake her.
     At about halfpast nine o'clock the odour of a warm sweet-bread (Mrs. Pipchin's constitution
     wouldn't go to sleep without sweet-bread) diversified the prevailing fragrance of the house,
     which Mrs. Wickam said was `a smell of building;´ and slumber fell upon the Castle shortly
     after. </p>
<p>The breakfast next morning was like the tea over night, except that Mrs. Pipchin took her
     roll instead of toast, and seemed a little more irate when it was over. Master Bitherstone read
     aloud to the rest a pedigree from Genesis (judi-ciously selected by Mrs. Pipchin), getting over
     the names with the ease and clearness of a person tumbling up the treadmill. That done, Miss
     Pankey was borne away to be shampoo'd; and Master Bitherstone to have something else done to
     him with salt water, from which he always returned very blue and dejected. Paul and Florence
     went out in the meantime on the beach with Wickam—who was constantly in tears—and at about noon
     Mrs. Pipchin presided over some Early Readings. It being a part of Mrs. Pipchin's system not to
     encourage a child's mind to develop and expand itself like a young flower, but to open it by
     force like an oyster, the moral of these lessons was usually of a violent and stunning
     character: the hero—a naughty boy—seldom, in the mildest catastrophe, being finished off by
     anything less than a lion, or a bear. </p>
<p>Such was life at Mrs. Pipchin's. On Saturday Mr. Dombey came down; and Florence and Paul
     would go to his Hotel, and have tea. They passed the whole of Sunday with him, and generally
     rode out before dinner; and on these occasions Mr. Dombey seemed to grow, like Falstaff's
     assailants, and instead of being one man in buckram, to become a dozen. Sunday evening was the
     most melancholy evening in the week; for Mrs. Pipchin always made a point of being particularly
     cross on Sunday nights. Miss Pankey was generally brought back from an aunt's at Rottingdean,
     in deep distress; and Master Bitherstone, whose relatives were all in India, and who was
     required to sit, between the services, in an erect position with his head against the parlour
     wall, neither moving hand nor foot, suffered so acutely in his young spirits that he once asked
     Florence, on a Sunday night, if she could give him any idea of the way back to Bengal. </p>
<p>But it was generally said that Mrs. Pipchin was a woman of system with children; and no doubt
     she was. Certainly the wild ones went home tame enough, after sojourning for a few months
     beneath her hospitable roof. It was generally said, too, that it was highly creditable of Mrs.
     Pipchin to have devoted herself to this way of life, and to have made such a sacrifice of her
     feelings, and such a resolute stand against her troubles, when Mr. Pipchin broke his heart in
     the Peruvian mines. </p>
<p>At this exemplary old lady, Paul would sit staring in his little arm-chair by the fire, for
     any length of time. He never seemed to know what weariness was, when he was looking fixedly at
     Mrs. Pipchin. He was not fond of her; he was not afraid of her; but in those old, old moods of
     his, she seemed to have a grotesque attraction for him. There he would sit, looking at her, and
     warming his hands, and looking at her, until he sometimes quite confounded Mrs. Pipchin, Ogress
     as she was. Once she asked him, when they were alone, what he was thinking about. </p>
<p>`You,´ said Paul, without the least reserve. </p>
<p>`And what are you thinking about me?´ asked Mrs. Pipchin. </p>
<p>`I'm thinking how old you must be,´ said Paul. </p>
<p>`You mustn't say such things as that, young gentleman,´ returned the dame. `That'll never
     do.´ </p>
<p>`Why not?´ asked Paul. </p>
<p>`Because it's not polite,´ said Mrs. Pipchin, snappishly. </p>
<p>`Not polite?´ said Paul. </p>
<p>`No.´ </p>
<p>`It's not polite,´ said Paul, innocently, `to eat all the mutton-chops and toast, Wickam
     says.´ </p>
<p>`Wickam,´ retorted Mrs. Pipchin, colouring, `is a wicked, impudent, boldfaced hussy.´ </p>
<p>`What's that?´ inquired Paul. </p>
<p>`Never you mind, Sir,´ retorted Mrs. Pipchin. `Remember the story of the little boy that was
     gored to death by a mad bull for asking questions.´ </p>
<p>`If the bull was mad,´ said Paul, `how did <hi>he</hi> know that the boy had asked questions?
     Nobody can go and whisper secrets to a mad bull. I don't believe that story.´ </p>
<p>`You don't believe it, Sir?´ repeated Mrs. Pipchin, amazed. </p>
<p>`No,´ said Paul. </p>
<p>`Not if it should happen to have been a tame bull, you little Infidel?´ said Mrs. Pipchen. </p>
<p>As Paul had not considered the subject in that light, and had founded his conclusions on the
     alleged lunacy of the bull, he allowed himself to be put down for the present. But he sat
     turning it over in his mind, with such an obvious intention of fixing Mrs. Pipchin presently,
     that even that hardy old lady deemed it prudent to retreat until he should have forgotten the
     subject. </p>
<p>From that time, Mrs. Pipchin appeared to have something of the same odd kind of attraction
     towards Paul, as Paul had towards her. She would make him move his chair to her side of the
     fire, instead of sitting opposite; and there he would remain in a nook between Mrs. Pipchin and
     the fender, with all the light of his little face absorbed into the black bombazeen drapery,
     studying every line and wrinkle of her countenance, and peering at the hard grey eye, until
     Mrs. Pipchin was sometimes fain to shut it on pretence of dozing. Mrs. Pipchin had an old black
     cat, who generally lay coiled upon the centre foot of the fender, purring egotistically, and
     winking at the fire until the contracted pupils of his eyes were like two notes of admiration.
     The good old lady might have been—not to record it disrespectfully—a witch, and Paul and the
     cat her two familiars, as they all sat by the fire together. It would have been quite in
     keeping with the appearance of the party if they had all sprung up the chimney in a high wind
     one night, and never been heard of any more. </p>
<p>This, however, never came to pass. The cat, and Paul, and Mrs. Pipchin, were constantly to be
     found in their usual places after dark; and Paul, eschewing the companionship of Master
     Bitherstone, went on studying Mrs. Pipchin, and the cat, and the fire, night after night, as if
     they were a book of necromancy, in three volumes. </p>
<p>Mrs. Wickam put her own construction on Paul's eccentricities: and being confirmed in her low
     spirits by a perplexed view of chimneys from the room where she was accustomed to sit, and by
     the noise of the wind, and by the general dulness (gashliness was Mrs. Wickam's strong
     expression) of her present life, deduced the most dismal reflections from the foregoing
     premises. It was a part of Mrs. Pipchin's policy to prevent her own `young hussy'—that was Mrs.
     Pipchin's generic name for female servant—from communicating with Mrs. Wickam: to which end she
     devoted much of her time to concealing herself behind doors, and springing out on that devoted
     maiden, whenever she made an approach towards Mrs. Wickam's apartment. But Berry was free to
     hold what converse she could in that quarter consistently with the discharge of the
     multifarious duties at which she toiled incessantly from morning to night; and to Berry Mrs.
     Wickam unburdened her mind. </p>
<p>`What a pretty fellow he is when he's asleep!´ said Berry, stopping to look at Paul in bed,
     one night when she took up Mrs. Wickam's supper. </p>
<p>`Ah!´ sighed Mrs. Wickam. `He need be.´ </p>
<p>`Why, he's not ugly when he's awake,´ observed Berry. </p>
<p>`No, Ma'am. Oh, no. No more was my uncle's Betsey Jane,´ said Mrs. Wickam. </p>
<p>Berry looked as if she would like to trace the connexion of ideas between Paul Dombey and
     Mrs. Wickam's Uncle's Betsey Jane. </p>
<p>`My uncle's wife,´ Mrs. Wickam went on to say, `died just like his mama. My uncle's child
     took on just as Master Paul do. My uncle's child made people's blood run cold, sometimes, she
     did!´ </p>
<p>R`How!´ asked Berry. </p>
<p>`I wouldn't have sat up all night alone with Betsey Jane!´ said Mrs. Wickam, `not if you'd
     have put Wickam into business next morning for himself. I couldn't have done it, Miss Berry.´ </p>
<p>Miss Berry naturally asked why not? But Mrs. Wickam, agreeably to the usage of some ladies in
     her condition, pursued her own branch of the subject without any compunction. </p>
<p>`Betsey Jane,´ said Mrs. Wickam, `was as sweet a child as I could wish to see. I couldn't
     wish to see a sweeter. Everything that a child could have in the way of illnesses, Betsey Jane
     had come through. The cramps was as common to her,´ said Mrs. Wickam, `as biles is to yourself,
     Miss Berry.´ Miss Berry involuntarily wrinkled her nose. </p>
<p>`But Betsey Jane,´ said Mrs. Wickam, lowering her voice, and looking round the room, and
     towards Paul in bed, `had been minded, in her cradle, by her departed mother. I couldn't say
     how, nor I couldn't say when, nor I couldn't say whether the dear child knew it or not, but
     Betsey Jane had been watched by her mother, Miss Berry! You may say nonsense! I an't offended,
     Miss. I hope you may be able to think in your own conscience that it <hi>is</hi> nonsense;
     you'll find your spirits all the better for it in this—you'll excuse my being so free—in this
     burying-ground of a place; which is wearing of me down. Master Paul's a little restless in his
     sleep. Pat his back, if you please.´ </p>
<p>`Of course you think,´ said Berry, gently doing what she was asked, `that <hi>he</hi> has
     been nursed by his mother, too?´ </p>
<p>`Betsey Jane,´ returned Mrs. Wickam in her most solemn tones, `was put upon as that child has
     been put upon, and changed as that child has changed. I have seen her sit, often and often,
     think, think, thinking, like him. I have seen her look, often and often, old, old, old, like
     him. I have heard her, many a time, talk just like him. I consider that child and Betsey Jane
     on the same footing entirely, Miss Berry.´ </p>
<p>`Is your uncle's child alive?´ asked Berry. </p>
<p>`Yes, Miss, she is alive,´ returned Mrs. Wickam with an air of triumph, for it was evident
     Miss Berry expected the reverse; `and is married to a silverchaser. Oh yes, Miss, <hi rend="sc">she</hi> is alive,´ said Mrs. Wickam, laying strong stress on her nominative case. </p>
<p>It being clear that somebody was dead, Mrs. Pipchin's niece inquired who it was. </p>
<p>`I wouldn't wish to make you uneasy,´ returned Mrs. Wickam, pursuing her supper. `Don't ask
     me.´ </p>
<p>This was the surest way of being asked again. Miss Berry repeated her question, therefore;
     and after some resistance, and reluctance, Mrs. Wickam laid down her knife, and again glancing
     round the room and at Paul in bed, replied: </p>
<p>`She took fancies to people; whimsical fancies, some of them; others, affections that one
     might expect to see—only stronger than common. They all died.´ </p>
<p>This was so very unexpected and awful to Mrs. Pipchin's niece, that she sat upright on the
     hard edge of the bedstead, breathing short, and surveying her informant with looks of
     undisguised alarm. </p>
<p>Mrs. Wickam shook her left fore-finger stealthily towards the bed where Florence lay; then
     turned it upside down, and made several emphatic points at the floor; immediately below which
     was the parlour in which Mrs. Pipchin habitually consumed the toast. </p>
<p>`Remember my words, Miss Berry,´ said Mrs. Wickam, `and be thankful that Master Paul is not
     too fond of you. I am, that he's not too fond of me, I assure you; though there isn't much to
     live for—you'll excuse my being so free—in this jail of a house!´ </p>
<p>Miss Berry's emotion might have led to her patting Paul too hard on the back, or might have
     produced a cessation of that soothing monotony, but he turned in his bed just now, and,
     presently awaking, sat up in it with his hair hot and wet from the effects of some childish
     dream, and asked for Florence. </p>
<p>She was out of her own bed at the first sound of his voice; and bending over his pillow
     immediately, sang him to sleep again. Mrs. Wickam shaking her head, and letting fall several
     tears, pointed out the little group to Berry, and turned her eyes up to the ceiling. </p>
<p>`Good night, Miss!´ said Wickam, softly. `Good night! Your aunt is an old lady, Miss Berry,
     and it's what you must have looked for, often.´ </p>
<p>This consolatory farewell, Mrs. Wickam accompanied with a look of heartfelt anguish; and
     being left alone with the two children again, and becoming conscious that the wind was blowing
     mournfully, she indulged in melancholy—that cheapest and most accessible of luxuries—until she
     was overpowered by slumber. </p>
<p>Although the niece of Mrs. Pipchin did not expect to find that exemplary dragon prostrate on
     the hearth-rug when she went down stairs, she was relieved to find her unusually fractious and
     severe, and with every present appearance of intending to live a long time to be a comfort to
     all who knew her. Nor had she any symptoms of declining, in the course of the ensuing week,
     when the constitutional viands still continued to disappear in regular succession,
     notwithstanding that Paul studied her as attentively as ever, and occupied his usual seat
     between the black skirts and the fender, with unwavering constancy. </p>
<p>But as Paul himself was no stronger at the expiration of that time than he had been on his
     first arrival, though he looked much healthier in the face, a little carriage was got for him,
     in which he could lie at his ease, with an alphabet and other elementary works of reference,
     and be wheeled down to the sea-side. Consistent in his odd tastes, the child set aside a
     ruddy-faced lad who was proposed as the drawer of this carriage, and selected, instead, his
     grandfather—a weazen, old, crab-faced man, in a suit of battered oilskin, who had got tough and
     stringy from long pickling in salt water, and who smelt like a weedy sea-beach when the tide is
     out. </p>
<p>With this notable attendant to pull him along, and Florence always walking by his side, and
     the despondent Wickam bringing up the rear, he went down to the margin of the ocean every day;
     and there he would sit or lie in his carriage for hours together: never so distressed as by the
     company of children—Florence alone excepted, always. </p>
<p>`Go away, if you please,´ he would say to any child who came to bear him company. `Thank you,
     but I don't want you.´ </p>
<p>Some small voice, near his ear, would ask him how he was, perhaps. </p>
<p>`I am very well, I thank you,´ he would answer. `But you had better go and play, if you
     please.´ </p>
<p>Then he would turn his head, and watch the child away, and say to Florence, `We don't want
     any others, do we? Kiss me, Floy.´ </p>
<p>He had even a dislike, at such times, to the company of Wickam, and was well pleased when she
     strolled away, as she generally did, to pick up shells and acquaintances. His favourite spot
     was quite a lonely one, far away from most loungers; and with Florence sitting by his side at
     work, or reading to him, or talking to him, and the wind blowing on his face, and the water
     coming up among the wheels of his bed, he wanted nothing more. </p>
<p>`Floy,´ he said one day, `where's India, where that boy's friends live?´ </p>
<p>`Oh, it's a long, long distance off,´ said Florence, raising her eyes from her work. </p>
<p>`Weeks off?´ asked Paul. </p>
<p>`Yes, dear. Many weeks´ journey, night and day.´ </p>
<p>`If you were in India, Floy,´ said Paul, after being silent for a minute, `I should—what is
     that Mama did? I forget.´ </p>
<p>`Loved me!´ answered Florence. </p>
<p>`No, no. Don't I love you now, Floy? What is it?—Died. If you were in India, I should die,
     Floy.´ </p>
<p>She hurriedly put her work aside, and laid her head down on his pillow, caressing him. And so
     would she, she said, if he were there. He would be better soon. </p>
<p>`Oh! I am a great deal better now!´ he answered. `I don't mean that. I mean that I should die
     of being so sorry and so lonely, Floy!´ </p>
<p>Another time, in the same place, he fell asleep, and slept quietly for a long time. Awaking
     suddenly, he listened, started up, and sat listening. </p>
<p>Florence asked him what he thought he heard. </p>
<p>`I want to know what it says,´ he answered, looking steadily in her face. `The sea, Floy,
     what is it that it keeps on saying?´ </p>
<p>She told him that it was only the noise of the rolling waves. </p>
<p>`Yes, yes,´ he said. `But I know that they are always saying something. Always the same
     thing. What place is over there?´ He rose up, looking eagerly at the horizon. </p>
<p>She told him that there was another country opposite, but he said he didn't mean that: he
     meant farther away—farther away! </p>
<p>Very often afterwards, in the midst of their talk, he would break off, to try to understand
     what it was that the waves were always saying; and would rise up in his couch to look towards
     that invisible region, far away. </p>
