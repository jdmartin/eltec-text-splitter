<p>The day arrived on which the masters were to have an interview with a deputation of the
     work-people. The meeting was to take place in a public room, at an hotel; and there, about
     eleven o'clock, the mill-owners, who had received the foreign orders, began to collect.</p>
<p>Of course, the first subject, however full their minds might be of another, was the weather.
     Having done their duty by all the showers and sunshine which had occurred during the past week,
     they fell to talking about the business which brought them together. There might be about
     twenty gentlemen in the room, including some by courtesy, who were not immediately concerned in
     the settlement of the present question; but who, nevertheless, were sufficiently interested to
     attend. These were divided into little groups, who did not seem unanimous by any means. Some
     were for a slight concession, just a sugar-plum to quieten the naughty child, a sacrifice to
     peace and quietness. Some were steadily and vehemently opposed to the dangerous precedent of
     yielding one jot or one tittle to the outward force of a turn-out. It was teaching the
     work-people how to become masters, said they. Did they want the wildest thing heareafter, they
     would know that the way to obtain their wishes would be to strike work. Besides, one or two of
     those present had only just returned from the New Bailey, where one of the turn-outs had been
     tried for a cruel assault on a poor north-country weaver, who had attempted to work at the low
     price. They were indignant, and justly so, at the merciless manner in which the poor fellow had
     been treated; and their indignation at wrong, took (as it so often does) the extreme form of
     revenge. They felt as if, rather than yield to the body of men who were resorting to such cruel
     measures towards their fellow-workmen, they, the masters, would sooner relinquish all the
     benefits to be derived from the fulfilment of the commission, in order that the workmen might
     suffer keenly. They forgot that the strike was in this instance the consequence of want and
     need, suffered unjustly, as the endurers believed; for, however insane, and without ground of
     reason, such was their belief, and such was the cause of their violence. It is a great truth,
     that you cannot extinguish violence by violence. You may put it down for a time; but while you
     are crowing over your imaginary success, see if it does not return with seven devils worse than
     its former self!</p>
<p>No one thought of treating the workmen as brethren and friends, and openly, clearly, as
     appealing to reasonable men, stating the exact and full circumstances which led the masters to
     think it was the wise policy of the time to make sacrifices themselves, and to hope for them
     from the operatives.</p>
<p>In going from group to group in the room, you caught such a medley of sentences as the
     following:</p>
<p>"Poor devils! they're near enough to starving, I'm afraid. Mrs. Aldred makes two cows' heads
     into soup every week, and people come several miles to fetch it; and if these times last we
     must try and do more. But we must not be bullied into any thing!"</p>
<p>"A rise of a shilling or so won't make much difference, and they will go away thinking
     they've gained their point."</p>
<p>"That's the very thing I object to. They'll think so, and whenever they've a point to gain,
     no matter how unreasonable, they'll strike work."</p>
<p>"It really injures them more than us."</p>
<p>"I don't see how our interests can be separated."</p>
<p>"The d——d brute had thrown vitriol on the poor fellow's ankles, and you know what a bad part
     that is to heal. He had to stand still with the pain, and that left him at the mercy of the
     cruel wretch, who beat him about the head till you'd hardly have known he was a man. They doubt
     if he'll live."</p>
<p>"If it were only for that, I'll stand out against them, even if it were the cause of my
     ruin."</p>
<p>"Ay, I for one won't yield one farthing to the cruel brutes; they're more like wild beasts
     than human beings."</p>
<p>(Well! who might have made them different?)</p>
<p>"I say, Carson, just go and tell Duncombe of this fresh instance of their abominable conduct.
     He's wavering, but I think this will decide him."</p>
<p>The door was now opened, and a waiter announced that the men were below, and asked if it were
     the pleasure of the gentlemen that they should be shown up.</p>
<p>They assented, and rapidly took their places round the official table; looking, as like as
     they could, to the Roman senators who awaited the irruption of Brennus and his Gauls.</p>
<p>Tramp, tramp, came the heavy clogged feet up the stairs; and in a minute five wild,
     earnest-looking men stood in the room. John Barton, from some mistake as to time, was not among
     them. Had they been larger boned men, you would have called them gaunt; as it was, they were
     little of stature, and their fustian clothes hung loosely upon their shrunk limbs. In choosing
     their delegates, too, the operatives had had more regard to their brains, and power of speech,
     than to their wardrobes; they might have read the opinions of that worthy Professor
     Teufelsdruch, in Sartor Resartus, to judge from the dilapidated coats and trousers, which yet
     clothed men of parts and of power. It was long since many of them had known the luxury of a new
     article of dress; and air-gaps were to be seen in their garments. Some of the masters were
     rather affronted at such a ragged detachment coming between the wind and their nobility; but
     what cared they?</p>
<p>At the request of a gentleman hastily chosen to officiate as chairman, the leader of the
     delegates read, in a high-pitched, psalm-singing voice, a paper, containing the operatives'
     statement of the case at issue, their complaints, and their demands, which last were not
     remarkable for moderation.</p>
<p>He was then desired to withdraw for a few minutes, with his fellow delegates, to another
     room, while the masters considered what should be their definitive answer.</p>
<p>When the men had left the room, a whispered earnest consultation took place, every one
     re-urging his former arguments. The conceders carried the day, but only by a majority of one.
     The minority haughtily and audibly expressed their dissent from the measures to be adopted,
     even after the delegates re-entered the room; their words and looks did not pass unheeded by
     the quick-eyed operatives; their names were registered in bitter hearts.</p>
<p>The masters could not consent to the advance demanded by the workmen. They would agree to
     give one shilling per week more than they had previously offered. Were the delegates empowered
     to accept such offer?</p>
<p>They were empowered to accept or decline any offer made that day by the masters.</p>
<p>Then it might be as well for them to consult among themselves as to what should be their
     decision. They again withdrew.</p>
<p>It was not for long. They came back, and positively declined any compromise of their
     demands.</p>
<p>Then up sprang Mr. Henry Carson, the head and voice of the violent party among the masters,
     and addressing the chairman, even before the scowling operatives, he proposed some resolutions,
     which he, and those who agreed with him, had been concocting during this last absence of the
     deputation.</p>
<p>They were, firstly, withdrawing the proposal just made, and declaring all communication
     between the masters and that particular Trades' Union at an end; secondly, declaring that no
     master would employ any workman in future, unless he signed a declaration that he did not
     belong to any Trades' Union, and pledged himself not to assist or subscribe to any society,
     having for its object interference with the masters' powers; and, thirdly, that the masters
     should pledge themselves to protect and encourage all workmen willing to accept employment on
     those conditions, and at the rate of wages first offered. Considering that the men who now
     stood listening with lowering brows of defiance were all of them leading members of the Union,
     such resolutions were in themselves sufficiently provocative of animosity: but not content with
     simply stating them, Harry Carson went on to characterise the conduct of the workmen in no
     measured terms; every word he spoke rendering their looks more livid, their glaring eyes more
     fierce. One among them would have spoken, but checked himself in obedience to the stern glance
     and pressure on his arm, received from the leader. Mr. Carson sat down, and a friend instantly
     got up to second the motion. It was carried, but far from unanimously. The chairman announced
     it to the delegates (who had been once more turned out of the room for a division). They
     received it with deep brooding silence, but spake never a word, and left the room without even
     a bow.</p>
<p>Now there had been some by-play at this meeting, not recorded in the Manchester newspapers,
     which gave an account of the more regular part of the transaction.</p>
<p>While the men had stood grouped near the door, on their first entrance, Mr. Harry Carson had
     taken out his silver pencil, and had drawn an admirable caricature of them—lank, ragged,
     dispirited, and famine-stricken. Underneath he wrote a hasty quotation from the fat knight's
     well-known speech in Henry IV. He passed it to one of his neighbours, who acknowledged the
     likeness instantly, and by him it was sent round to others, who all smiled and nodded their
     heads. When it came back to its owner he tore the back of the letter on which it was drawn, in
     two; twisted them up, and flung them into the fire-place; but, careless whether they reached
     their aim or not, he did not look to see that they fell just short of any consuming
     cinders.</p>
<p>This proceeding was closely observed by one of the men.</p>
<p>He watched the masters as they left the hotel (laughing, some of them were, at passing
     jokes), and when all had gone, he re-entered. He went to the waiter, who recognised him.</p>
<p>"There's a bit on a picture up yonder, as one o' the gentlemen threw away; I've a little lad
     at home as dearly loves a picture; by your leave I'll go up for it."</p>
<p>The waiter, good-natured and sympathetic, accompanied him up-stairs; saw the paper picked up
     and untwisted, and then being convinced, by a hasty glance at its contents, that it was only
     what the man had called it, "a bit of a picture," he allowed him to bear away his prize.</p>
<p>Towards seven o'clock that evening many operatives began to assemble in a room in the
     Weavers' Arms public-house, a room appropriated for "festive occasions," as the landlord, in
     his circular, on opening the premises, had described it. But, alas! it was on no festive
     occasion that they met there on this night. Starved, irritated, despairing men, they were
     assembling to hear the answer that morning given by the masters to their delegates; after
     which, as was stated in the notice, a gentleman from London would have the honour of addressing
     the meeting on the present state of affairs between the employers and the employed, or (as he
     chose to term them) the idle and the industrious classes. The room was not large, but its
     bareness of furniture made it appear so. Unshaded gas flared down upon the lean and unwashed
     artisans as they entered, their eyes blinking at the excess of light.</p>
<p>They took their seats on benches, and awaited the deputation. The latter, gloomily and
     ferociously, delivered the masters' ultimatum, adding thereunto not one word of their own; and
     it sank all the deeper into the sore hearts of the listeners for their forbearance.</p>
<p>Then the "gentleman from London" (who had been previously informed of the masters' decision)
     entered. You would have been puzzled to define his exact position, or what was the state of his
     mind as regarded education. He looked so self-conscious, so far from earnest, among the group
     of eager, fierce, absorbed men, among whom he now stood. He might have been a disgraced medical
     student of the Bob Sawyer class, or an unsuccessful actor, or a flashy shopman. The impression
     he would have given you would have been unfavourable, and yet there was much about him that
     could only be characterised as doubtful.</p>
<p>He smirked in acknowledgment of their uncouth greetings, and sat down; then glancing round,
     he inquired whether it would not be agreeable to the gentlemen present to have pipes and liquor
     handed round; adding, that he would stand treat.</p>
<p>As the man who has had his taste educated to love reading, falls devouringly upon books after
     a long abstinence, so these poor fellows, whose tastes had been left to educate themselves into
     a liking for tobacco, beer, and similar gratifications, gleamed up at the proposal of the
     London delegate. Tobacco and drink deaden the pangs of hunger, and make one forget the
     miserable home, the desolate future.</p>
<p>They were now ready to listen to him with approbation. He felt it; and rising like a great
     orator, with his right arm outstretched, his left in the breast of his waistcoat, he began to
     declaim, with a forced theatrical voice.</p>
<p>After a burst of eloquence, in which he blended the deeds of the elder and the younger
     Brutus, and magnified the resistless might of the "millions of Manchester," the Londoner
     descended to matter-of-fact business, and in his capacity this way he did not belie the good
     judgment of those who had sent him as delegate. Masses of people, when left to their own free
     choice, seem to have discretion in distinguishing men of natural talent; it is a pity they so
     little regard temper and principles. He rapidly dictated resolutions, and suggested measures.
     He wrote out a stirring placard for the walls. He proposed sending delegates to entreat the
     assistance of other Trades' Unions in other towns. He headed the list of subscribing Unions, by
     a liberal donation from that with which he was especially connected in London; and what was
     more, and more uncommon, he paid down the money in real, clinking, blinking, golden sovereigns!
     The money, alas, was cravingly required; but before alleviating any private necessities on the
     morrow, small sums were handed to each of the delegates, who were in a day or two to set out on
     their expeditions to Glasgow, Newcastle, Nottingham, etc. These men were most of them
     members of the deputation who had that morning waited upon the masters. After he had drawn up
     some letters, and spoken a few more stirring words, the gentleman from London withdrew,
     previously shaking hands all round; and many speedily followed him out of the room, and out of
     the house.</p>
<p>The newly-appointed delegates, and one or two others, remained behind to talk over their
     respective missions, and to give and exchange opinions in more homely and natural language than
     they dared to use before the London orator.</p>
<p>"He's a rare chap, yon," began one, indicating the departed delegate by a jerk of his thumb
     towards the door. "He's gotten the gift of the gab, anyhow!"</p>
<p>"Ay! ay! he knows what he's about. See how he poured it into us about that there Brutus. He
     were pretty hard, too, to kill his own son!"</p>
<p>"I could kill mine if he took part wi' the masters; to be sure, he's but a step-son, but that
     makes no odds," said another.</p>
<p>But now tongues were hushed, and all eyes were directed towards the member of the deputation
     who had that morning returned to the hotel to obtain possession of Harry Carson's clever
     caricature of the operatives.</p>
<p>The heads clustered together, to gaze at and detect the likenesses.</p>
<p>"That's John Slater! I'd ha' known him anywhere, by his big nose. Lord! how like; that's me,
     by G——, it's the very way I'm obligated to pin my waistcoat up, to hide that I've gotten no
     shirt. That <hi>is</hi> a shame, and I'll not stand it."</p>
<p>"Well!" said John Slater, after having acknowledged his nose and his likeness; "I could laugh
     at a jest as well as e'er the best on 'em, though it did tell again mysel, if I were not
     clemming" (his eyes filled with tears; he was a poor, pinched, sharp-featured man, with a
     gentle and melancholy expression of countenance), "and if I could keep from thinking of them at
     home, as is clemming; but with their cries for food ringing in my ears, and making me afeard of
     going home, and wonder if I should hear 'em wailing out, if I lay cold and drowned at th'
     bottom o' th' canal, there,—why, man, I cannot laugh at ought. It seems to make me sad that
     there is any as can make game on what they've never knowed; as can make such laughable pictures
     on men, whose very hearts within 'em are so raw and sore as ours were and are, God help
     us."</p>
<p>John Barton began to speak; they turned to him with great attention. "It makes me more than
     sad, it makes my heart burn within me, to see that folk can make a jest of earnest men; of
     chaps who comed to ask for a bit o' fire for th' old granny, as shivers in th' cold; for a bit
     o' bedding, and some warm clothing to the poor wife as lies in labour on th' damp flags; and
     for victuals for the childer, whose little voices are getting too faint and weak to cry aloud
     wi' hunger. For, brothers, is not them the things we ask for when we ask for more wage? We
     donnot want dainties, we want bellyfuls; we donnot want gimcrack coats and waistcoats, we want
     warm clothes, and so that we get 'em we'd not quarrel wi' what they're made on. We donnot want
     their grand houses, we want a roof to cover us from the rain, and the snow, and the storm; ay,
     and not alone to cover us, but the helpless ones that cling to us in the keen wind, and ask us
     with their eyes why we brought 'em into th' world to suffer?" He lowered his deep voice almost
     to a whisper.</p>
<p>"I've seen a father who had killed his child rather than let it clem before his eyes; and he
     were a tender-hearted man."</p>
<p>He began again in his usual tone. "We come to th' masters wi' full hearts, to ask for them
     things I named afore. We know that they've gotten money, as we've earned for 'em; we know trade
     is mending, and that they've large orders, for which they'll be well paid; we ask for our share
     o' th' payment; for, say we, if th' masters get our share of payment it will only go to keep
     servants and horses, to more dress and pomp. Well and good, if yo choose to be fools we'll not
     hinder you, so long as you're just; but our share we must and will have; we'll not be cheated.
      <hi>We</hi> want it for daily bread, for life itself; and not for our own lives neither (for
     there's many a one here, I know by mysel, as would be glad and thankful to lie down and die out
     o' this weary world), but for the lives of them little ones, who don't yet know what life is,
     and are afeard of death. Well, we come before th' masters to state what we want, and what we
     must have, afore we'll set shoulder to their work; and they say, 'No.' One would think that
     would be enough of hard-heartedness, but it isn't. They go and make jesting pictures of us! I
     could laugh at mysel, as well as poor John Slater there; but then I must be easy in my mind to
     laugh. Now I only know that I would give the last drop o' my blood to avenge us on yon chap,
     who had so little feeling in him as to make game on earnest, suffering men!"</p>
<p>A low angry murmur was heard among the men, but it did not yet take form or words. John
     continued—</p>
<p>"You'll wonder, chaps, how I came to miss the time this morning; I'll just tell you what I
     was a-doing. Th' chaplain at the New Bailey sent and gived me an order to see Jonas
     Higginbotham; him as was taken up last week for throwing vitriol in a knob-stick's face. Well,
     I couldn't help but go; and I didn't reckon it would ha' kept me so late. Jonas were like one
     crazy when I got to him; he said he could na get rest night or day for th' face of the poor
     fellow he had damaged; then he thought on his weak, clemmed look, as he tramped, foot-sore,
     into town; and Jonas thought, may be, he had left them at home as would look for news, and hope
     and get none, but, haply, tidings of his death. Well, Jonas had thought on these things till he
     could not rest, but walked up and down continually like a wild beast in his cage. At last he
     bethought him on a way to help a bit, and he got th' chaplain to send for me; and he telled me
     this; and that th' man were lying in th' Infirmary, and he bade me go (to-day's the day as folk
     may be admitted into th' Infirmary) and get his silver watch, as was his mother's, and sell it
     as well as I could, and take the money, and bid the poor knob-stick send it to his friends
     beyond Burnley; and I were to take him Jonas's kind regards, and he humbly axed him to forgive
     him. So I did what Jonas wished. But bless your life, none on us would ever throw vitriol again
     (at least at a knob-stick) if they could see the sight I saw to-day. The man lay, his face all
     wrapped in cloths, so I didn't see <hi>that</hi>; but not a limb, nor a bit of a limb, could
     keep from quivering with pain. He would ha' bitten his hand to keep down his moans, but
     couldn't, his face hurt him so if he moved it e'er so little. He could scarce mind me when I
     telled him about Jonas; he did squeeze my hand when I jingled the money, but when I axed his
     wife's name he shrieked out, 'Mary, Mary, shall I never see you again? Mary, my darling,
     they've made me blind because I wanted to work for you and our own baby; oh, Mary, Mary!' Then
     the nurse came, and said he were raving, and that I had made him worse. And I'm afeard it was
     true; yet I were loth to go without knowing where to send the money. … So that kept me beyond
     my time, chaps."</p>
<p>"Did yo hear where the wife lived at last?" asked many anxious voices.</p>
<p>"No! he went on talking to her, till his words cut my heart like a knife. I axed th' nurse to
     find out who she was, and where she lived. But what I'm more especial naming it now for is
     this,—for one thing I wanted yo all to know why I weren't at my post this morning; for another,
     I wish to say, that I, for one, ha' seen enough of what comes of attacking knob-sticks, and
     I'll ha nought to do with it no more."</p>
<p>There were some expressions of disapprobation, but John did not mind them.</p>
<p>"Nay! I'm no coward," he replied, "and I'm true to th' backbone. What I would like, and what
     I would do, would be to fight the masters. There's one among yo called me a coward. Well! every
     man has a right to his opinion; but since I've thought on th' matter to-day, I've thought we
     han all on us been more like cowards in attacking the poor like ourselves; them as has none to
     help, but mun choose between vitriol and starvation. I say we're more cowardly in doing that
     than in leaving them alone. No! what I would do is this. Have at the masters!" Again he
     shouted, "Have at the masters!" He spoke lower; all listened with hushed breath.</p>
<p>"It's the masters as has wrought this woe; it's the masters as should pay for it. Him as
     called me coward just now, may try if I am one or not. Set me to serve out the masters, and see
     if there's ought I'll stick at."</p>
<p>"It would give th' masters a bit on a fright if one on them were beaten within an inch of his
     life," said one.</p>
<p>"Ay! or beaten till no life were left in him," growled another.</p>
<p>And so with words, or looks that told more than words, they built up a deadly plan. Deeper
     and darker grew the import of their speeches, as they stood hoarsely muttering their meaning
     out, and glaring, with eyes that told the terror their own thoughts were to them, upon their
     neighbours. Their clenched fists, their set teeth, their livid looks, all told the suffering
     their minds were voluntarily undergoing in the contemplation of crime, and in familiarising
     themselves with its details.</p>
<p>Then came one of those fierce terrible oaths which bind members of Trades' Unions to any
     given purpose. Then, under the flaring gaslight, they met together to consult further. With the
     distrust of guilt, each was suspicious of his neighbour; each dreaded the treachery of another.
     A number of pieces of paper (the identical letter on which the caricature had been drawn that
     very morning) were torn up, and <hi>one was marked</hi>. Then all were folded up again, looking
     exactly alike. They were shuffled together in a hat. The gas was extinguished; each drew out a
     paper. The gas was re-lighted. Then each went as far as he could from his fellows, and examined
     the paper he had drawn without saying a word, and with a countenance as stony and immovable as
     he could make it.</p>
<p>Then, still rigidly silent, they each took up their hats and went every one his own way.</p>
<p>He who had drawn the marked paper had drawn the lot of the assassin! and he had sworn to act
     according to his drawing! But no one save God and his own conscience knew who was the appointed
     murderer!</p>
<p> </p>
