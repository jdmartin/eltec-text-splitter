<l>"Something there was, what, none presumed to say,</l>

<p>Mary went home. Oh! how her head did ache, and how dizzy her brain was growing! But there
     would be time enough she felt for giving way, hereafter.</p>
<p>So she sat quiet and still by an effort; sitting near the window, and looking out of it, but
     seeing nothing, when all at once she caught sight of something which roused her up, and made
     her draw back.</p>
<p>But it was too late. She had been seen.</p>
<p>Sally Leadbitter flaunted into the little dingy room, making it gaudy with the Sunday excess
     of colouring in her dress.</p>
<p>She was really curious to see Mary; her connexion with a murderer seemed to have made her
     into a sort of <hi>lusus naturæ</hi>, and was almost, by some, expected to have made a change
     in her personal appearance, so earnestly did they stare at her. But Mary had been too much
     absorbed this last day or two to notice this.</p>
<p>Now Sally had a grand view, and looked her over and over (a very different thing from looking
     her through and through), and almost learnt her off by heart;—"her every-day gown (Hoyle's
     print you know, that lilac thing with the high body) she was so fond of; a little black silk
     handkerchief just knotted round her neck, like a boy; her hair all taken back from her face, as
     if she wanted to keep her head cool—she would always keep that hair of hers so long; and her
     hands twitching continually about."</p>
<p>Such particulars would make Sally into a Gazette Extraordinary the next morning at the
     work-room, and were worth coming for, even if little else could be extracted from Mary.</p>
<p>"Why, Mary!" she began. "Where have you hidden yourself? You never showed your face all
     yesterday at Miss Simmonds'. You don't fancy we think any the worse of you for what's come and
     gone. Some on us, indeed, were a bit sorry for the poor young man, as lies stiff and cold for
     your sake, Mary; but we shall ne'er cast it up against you. Miss Simmonds, too, will be mighty
     put out if you don't come, for there's a deal of mourning, agait."</p>
<p>"I can't," Mary said, in a low voice. "I don't mean ever to come again."</p>
<p>"Why, Mary!" said Sally, in unfeigned surprise. "To be sure you'll have to be in Liverpool,
     Tuesday, and may be Wednesday; but after that you'll surely come, and tell us all about it.
     Miss Simmonds knows you'll have to be off those two days. But between you and me, she's a bit
     of a gossip, and will like hearing all how and about the trial, well enough to let you off very
     easy for your being absent a day or two. Besides, Betsy Morgan was saying yesterday, she
     shouldn't wonder but you'd prove quite an attraction to customers. Many a one would come and
     have their gowns made by Miss Simmonds just to catch a glimpse at you, at after the trial's
     over. Really, Mary, you'll turn out quite a heroine."</p>
<p>The little fingers twitched worse than ever; the large soft eyes looked up pleadingly into
     Sally's face; but she went on in the same strain, not from any unkind or cruel feeling towards
     Mary, but solely because she was incapable of comprehending her suffering.</p>
<p>She had been shocked, of course, at Mr. Carson's death, though at the same time the
     excitement was rather pleasant than otherwise; and dearly now would she have enjoyed the
     conspicuous notice which Mary was sure to receive.</p>
<p>"How shall you like being cross-examined, Mary?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," answered Mary, when she found she must answer.</p>
<p>"La! what impudent fellows those lawyers are! And their clerks, too, not a bit better. I
     shouldn't wonder" (in a comforting tone, and really believing she was giving comfort) "if you
     picked up a new sweetheart in Liverpool. What gown are you going in, Mary?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know and don't care," exclaimed Mary, sick and weary of her visitor.</p>
<p>"Well, then! take my advice, and go in that blue merino. It's old to be sure, and a bit worn
     at elbows, but folk won't notice that, and th' colour suits you. Now mind, Mary. And I'll lend
     you my black watered scarf," added she, really good-naturedly, according to her sense of
     things, and withal, a little bit pleased at the idea of her pet article of dress figuring away
     on the person of a witness at a trial for murder.</p>
<p>"I'll bring it to-morrow before you start."</p>
<p>"No, don't!" said Mary; "thank you, but I don't want it."</p>
<p>"Why, what can you wear? I know all your clothes as well as I do my own, and what is there
     you can wear? Not your old plaid shawl, I do hope? You would not fancy this I have on, more nor
     the scarf, would you?" said she, brightening up at the thought, and willing to lend it, or any
     thing else.</p>
<p>"Oh Sally! don't go on talking a-that-ns; how can I think on dress at such a time? When it's
     a matter of life and death to Jem?"</p>
<p>"Bless the girl! It's Jem, is it? Well now, I thought there was some sweetheart in the
     back-ground, when you flew off so with Mr. Carson. Then what in the name of goodness made him
     shoot Mr. Harry? After you had given up going with him, I mean? Was he afraid you'd be on
     again?"</p>
<p>"How dare you say he shot Mr. Harry?" asked Mary, firing up from the state of languid
     indifference into which she had sunk while Sally had been settling about her dress. "But it's
     no matter what you think as did not know him. What grieves me is, that people should go on
     thinking him guilty as did know him," she said, sinking back into her former depressed tone and
     manner.</p>
<p>"And don't you think he did it?" asked Sally.</p>
<p>Mary paused; she was going on too fast with one so curious and so unscrupulous. Besides she
     remembered how even she herself had, at first, believed him guilty; and she felt it was not for
     her to cast stones at those who, on similar evidence, inclined to the same belief. None had
     given him much benefit of a doubt. None had faith in his innocence. None but his mother; and
     there the heart loved more than the head reasoned, and her yearning affection had never for an
     instant entertained the idea that her Jem was a murderer. But Mary disliked the whole
     conversation; the subject, the manner in which it was treated, were all painful, and she had a
     repugnance to the person with whom she spoke.</p>
<p>She was thankful, therefore, when Job Legh's voice was heard at the door, as he stood with
     the latch in his hand, talking to a neighbour, and when Sally jumped up in vexation and said,
     "There's that old fogey coming in here, as I'm alive! Did your father set him to look after you
     while he was away? or what brings the old chap here? However, I'm off; I never could abide
     either him or his prim grand-daughter. Goodbye, Mary."</p>
<p>So far in a whisper, then louder,</p>
<p>"If you think better of my offer about the scarf, Mary, just step in to-morrow before nine,
     and you're quite welcome to it."</p>
<p>She and Job passed each other at the door, with mutual looks of dislike, which neither took
     any pains to conceal.</p>
<p>"Yon's a bold, bad girl," said Job to Mary.</p>
<p>"She's very good-natured," replied Mary, too honourable to abuse a visitor who had only that
     instant crossed her threshold, and gladly dwelling on the good quality most apparent in Sally's
     character.</p>
<p>"Ay, ay! good-natured, generous, jolly, full of fun; there are a number of other names for
     the good qualities the devil leaves his childer, as baits to catch gudgeons with. D'ye think
     folk could be led astray by one who was every way bad? Howe'er, that's not what I came to talk
     about. I've seen Mr. Bridgenorth, and he is in a manner of the same mind as me; he thinks it
     would have an awkward look, and might tell against the poor lad on his trial; still if she's
     ill she's ill, and it can't be helped."</p>
<p>"I don't know if she's so bad as all that," said Mary, who began to dread her part in doing
     any thing which might tell against her poor lover.</p>
<p>"Will you come and see her, Job? The doctor seemed to say as I liked, not as he thought."</p>
<p>"That's because he had no great thought on the subject, either one way or t'other," replied
     Job, whose contempt for medical men pretty nearly equalled his respect for lawyers. "But I'll
     go and welcome. I han not seen th' oud ladies since their sorrows, and it's but manners to go
     and ax after them. Come along."</p>
<p>The room at Mrs. Wilson's had that still, changeless look you must have often observed in the
     house of sickness or mourning. No particular employment going on; people watching and waiting
     rather than acting, unless in the more sudden and violent attacks; what little movement is
     going on, so noiseless and hushed; the furniture all arranged and stationary, with a view to
     the comfort of the afflicted; the window-blinds drawn down to keep out the disturbing variety
     of a sun-beam; the same saddened, serious look on the faces of the in-dwellers; you fall back
     into the same train of thought with all these associations, and forget the street, the outer
     world, in the contemplation of the one stationary, absorbing interest within.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson sat quietly in her chair, with just the same look Mary had left on her face; Mrs.
     Davenport went about with creaking shoes, which made all the more noise from her careful and
     lengthened tread, annoying the ears of those who were well, in this instance, far more than the
     dulled senses of the sick and the sorrowful. Alice's voice still was going on cheerfully in the
     upper room with incessant talking and little laughs to herself, or perhaps in sympathy with her
     unseen companions; "unseen," I say, in preference to "fancied," for who knows whether God does
     not permit the forms of those who were dearest when living, to hover round the bed of the
     dying?</p>
<p>Job spoke, and Mrs. Wilson answered.</p>
<p>So quietly, that it was unnatural under the circumstances. It made a deeper impression on the
     old man than any token of mere bodily illness could have done. If she had raved in delirium, or
     moaned in fever, he could have spoken after his wont, and given his opinion, his advice, and
     his consolation; now he was awed into silence.</p>
<p>At length he pulled Mary aside into a corner of the house-place where Mrs. Wilson was
     sitting, and began to talk to her.</p>
<p>"Yo're right, Mary! She's no ways fit to go to Liverpool, poor soul. Now I've seen her, I
     only wonder the doctor could ha' been unsettled in his mind at th' first. Choose how it goes
     wi' poor Jem, she cannot go. One way or another it will soon be over, and best to leave her in
     the state she is till then."</p>
<p>"I was sure you would think so," said Mary.</p>
<p>But they were reckoning without their host. They esteemed her senses gone, while, in fact,
     they were only inert, and could not convey impressions rapidly to the over-burdened, troubled
     brain. They had not noticed that her eyes had followed them (mechanically it seemed at first)
     as they had moved away to the corner of the room; that her face, hitherto so changeless, had
     begun to work with one or two of the old symptoms of impatience.</p>
<p>But when they were silent she stood up, and startled them almost as if a dead person had
     spoken, by saying clearly and decidedly—"I go to Liverpool. I hear you and your plans; and I
     tell you I shall go to Liverpool. If my words are to kill my son, they have already gone forth
     out of my mouth, and nought can bring them back. But I will have faith. Alice (up above) has
     often telled me I wanted faith, and now I will have it. They cannot—they will not kill my
     child, my only child. I will not be afeared. Yet, oh! I am so sick with terror. But if he is to
     die, think ye not that I will see him again; ay! see him at his trial? When all are hating him,
     he shall have his poor mother near him, to give him all the comfort, eyes, and looks, and
     tears, and a heart that is dead to all but him, can give; his poor old mother, who knows how
     free he is from sin—in the sight of man at least. They'll let me go to him, maybe, the very
     minute it's over; and I know many Scripture texts (though you would not think it), that may
     keep up his heart. I missed seeing him ere he went to yon prison, but nought shall keep me away
     again one minute when I can see his face; for maybe the minutes are numbered, and the count but
     small. I know I can be a comfort to him, poor lad. You would not think it, now, but he'd alway
     speak as kind and soft to me as if he were courting me, like. He loved me above a bit; and am I
     to leave him now to dree all the cruel slander they'll put upon him? I can pray for him at each
     hard word they say against him, if I can do nought else; and he'll know what his mother is
     doing for him, poor lad, by the look on my face."</p>
<p>Still they made some look, or gesture of opposition to her wishes. She turned sharp round on
     Mary, the old object of her pettish attacks, and said,</p>
<p>"Now, wench! once for all! I tell yo this. <hi>He</hi> could never guide me; and he'd sense
     enough not to try. What he could na do, don't you try. I shall go to Liverpool to-morrow, and
     find my lad, and stay with him through thick and thin; and if he dies, why, perhaps, God of His
     mercy will take me too. The grave is a sure cure for an aching heart."</p>
<p>She sank back in her chair, quite exhausted by the sudden effort she had made; but if they
     even offered to speak, she cut them short (whatever the subject might be), with the repetition
     of the same words, "I shall go to Liverpool."</p>
<p>No more could be said, the doctor's opinion had been so undecided; Mr. Bridgenorth had given
     his legal voice in favour of her going, and Mary was obliged to relinquish the idea of
     persuading her to remain at home, if indeed under all the circumstances it could be thought
     desirable.</p>
<p>"Best way will be," said Job, "for me to hunt out Will, early to-morrow morning, and yo,
     Mary, come at after with Jane Wilson. I know a decent woman where yo two can have a bed, and
     where we may meet together when I've found Will, afore going to Mr. Bridgenorth's at two
     o'clock; for, I can tell him, I'll not trust none of his clerks for hunting up Will, if Jem's
     life is to depend on it."</p>
<p>Now Mary disliked this plan inexpressibly; her dislike was partly grounded on reason, and
     partly on feeling. She could not bear the idea of deputing to any one the active measures
     necessary to be taken in order to save Jem. She felt as if they were her duty, her right. She
     durst not trust to any one the completion of her plan; they might not have energy, or
     perseverance, or desperation enough to follow out the slightest chance; and her love would
     endow her with all these qualities, independently of the terrible alternative which awaited her
     in case all failed and Jem was condemned. No one could have her motives; and consequently no
     one could have her sharpened brain, her despairing determination. Besides (only that was purely
     selfish), she could not endure the suspense of remaining quiet, and only knowing the result
     when all was accomplished.</p>
<p>So with vehemence and impatience she rebutted every reason Job adduced for his plan; and of
     course, thus opposed, by what appeared to him wilfulness, he became more resolute, and angry
     words were exchanged, and a feeling of estrangement rose up between them, for a time, as they
     walked homewards.</p>
<p>But then came in Margaret with her gentleness, like an angel of peace, so calm and
     reasonable, that both felt ashamed of their irritation, and tacitly left the decision to her
     (only, by the way, I think Mary could never have submitted if it had gone against her, penitent
     and tearful as was her manner now to Job, the good old man who was helping her to work for Jem,
     although they differed as to the manner).</p>
<p>"Mary had better go," said Margaret to her grandfather, in a low tone, "I know what she's
     feeling, and it will be a comfort to her soon, may be, to think she did all she could herself.
     She would perhaps fancy it might have been different; do, grandfather, let her."</p>
<p>Margaret had still, you see, little or no belief in Jem's innocence; and besides, she thought
     if Mary saw Will, and heard herself from him that Jem had not been with him that Thursday
     night, it would in a measure break the force of the blow which was impending.</p>
<p>"Let me lock up house, grandfather, for a couple of days, and go and stay with Alice. It's
     but little one like me can do, I know" (she added softly); "but, by the blessing o' God, I'll
     do it and welcome; and here comes one kindly use o' money, I can hire them as will do for her
     what I cannot. Mrs. Davenport is a willing body, and one who knows sorrow and sickness, and I
     can pay her for her time, and keep her there pretty near altogether. So let that be settled.
     And you take Mrs. Wilson, dear grandad, and let Mary go find Will, and you can all meet
     together at after, and I'm sure I wish you luck."</p>
<p>Job consented with only a few dissenting grunts; but on the whole, with a very good grace for
     an old man who had been so positive only a few minutes before.</p>
<p>Mary was thankful for Margaret's interference. She did not speak, but threw her arms round
     Margaret's neck, and put up her rosy-red mouth to be kissed; and even Job was attracted by the
     pretty, child-like gesture; and when she drew near him, afterwards, like a little creature
     sidling up to some person whom it feels to have offended, he bent down and blessed her, as if
     she had been a child of his own.</p>
<p>To Mary the old man's blessing came like words of power.</p>
