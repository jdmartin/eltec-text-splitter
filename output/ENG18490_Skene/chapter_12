<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p>MEANWHILE Mr. Verney was by no means disposed to submit without a
                    struggle to the stern commands of his proud father. His affection for the quiet
                    gentle Mary Clayton had taken deep root in his heart, with a strength of which
                    he was not aware till she was actually taken from him. For the time it absorbed
                    all other considerations, and extinguished whatever pride he might have
                    inherited from his parents. They had accustomed him from childhood to the
                    unrestrained indulgence of every wish, and now when, for the first time, they
                    thwarted him, he resolved to cast off their authority altogether. If they would
                    not give their consent to his union with Mr. Clayton’s daughter, he would marry
                    her without it.</p>
<p>After about three weeks spent in vain expostulations with Lord and Lady Verney,
                    Mr. Verney went to The Mount, to announce his resolution to Mary, and to obtain
                    her consent to a private marriage. He was perfectly aware of the depth of the
                    attachment with which he had <pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7062-161"/> inspired her,
                    and of all the worldly advantages of an alliance with him; and his astonishment
                    was therefore unbounded when Mary positively refused to marry him without the
                    full consent of his father and mother.</p>
<p>Mr. Verney would not believe it possible that she could continue firm in her
                    determination, for her extreme agitation showed what the sacrifice cost her, and
                    he used every argument to induce her to relent. He assured her that as soon as
                    the marriage was over, and opposition of no further avail, Lord and Lady Verney
                    would gladly receive her; and he called upon Richard to use all his influence
                    with her. It was, perhaps, the bitterest pang which Mary Clayton had yet
                    experienced in this sore trial, when her father, complying with Mr. Verney’s
                    request, urged her to do that which was actually wrong. Gently and even humbly,
                    (for was she not his daughter?) she implored of him to desist from further
                    entreaties, and again quietly repeated her refusal to Mr. Verney. He saw that
                    she was too resolute in the strait and narrow path of duty, to be allured from
                    it, though he tempted her with a whole life of happiness; and in his bitter
                    anger and disappointment, he upbraided her with many a cruel reproach. He
                    declared that she had never really felt any true affection for him, that she was
                    cold and heart‐<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7062-162"/> less, that it cost her nothing
                    to consign him to misery. These were terrible words to her who would so
                    thankfully have devoted her whole existence to make him happy—but no answering
                    word of bitterness came from her colourless lips. She bade him farewell meekly,
                    as though she had really injured him; and when he was gone, she returned to all
                    her home duties with a strong effort to appear contented and at peace, at least
                    in her father’s eyes.</p>
<p>During Richard Clayton’s illness, Mr. Lambert, now Vicar of B—, had, unasked,
                    come to visit him, and from that period he continued ministering to the
                    spiritual necessities of the various members of the family, with faithfulness
                    and zeal. Agnes had surrendered herself as an humble penitent entirely to his
                    guidance. Richard himself seemed now well disposed to follow her example; and to
                    Mary, his counsels were of inestimable benefit. He advised her as to her conduct
                    towards her father and stepmother, for her position was by no means an easy one
                    in their house, and he now confirmed and strengthened her in her resolution to
                    do that which was right, however much suffering it might entail upon herself.
                    Very soon, however, her miserable father began to fear that she would prove,
                    with her life itself, the falsity of Mr. Verney’s assertion, that he was the
                    only <pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7062-163"/> sufferer in this trial, for her health
                    and strength began gradually to sink under her constant mental exertion.</p>
<p>Mr. Verney, though he professed to leave The Mount angry and hopeless, had in
                    truth only felt his esteem and affection for Mary increased by her holy
                    resignation and obedience to the Will of Heaven. He was more than ever
                    determined not to lose her, and he spent his days in devising some means of
                    overcoming the difficulties in his way. Lord and Lady Verney had returned to
                    their own home, but he himself persisted in remaining at B—, though he
                    consented, at their earnest request, to stay at the house of their friends, who
                    received private instructions to watch his proceedings. They were continually
                    enlarging on the disgrace which he would have incurred by his marriage with Mary
                    Clayton; and one day in particular they expatiated much on the miserable
                    position of her brother Edward; who, although he would be allowed quietly to
                    succeed to his father’s property, might have his legitimacy called in question
                    any day.</p>
<p>These casual remarks suddenly gave Mr. Verney a new and hopeful idea. It struck
                    him that if Mary could be put in possession of the whole of the large fortune
                    which belonged to the Clayton family, by the setting aside of<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7062-164"/> her brother’s claim, his proud but poverty‐stricken
                    parents might possibly be induced to overlook Richard’s disgraced name, and
                    receive her as their daughter even yet. It seemed clear to him, that if Edward’s
                    legal right were disproved, Mary would succeed to an amount of wealth which
                    might well cover the dishonour of her family, and enable him at once to obtain
                    the consent of his parents; but it was a question which a lawyer alone could
                    answer, and Mr. Verney repaired without loss of time to Mr. Sharp, who had now a
                    considerable reputation in the neighbourhood of B—.</p>
<p>He was too much absorbed in his resolution to remember how cruel and selfish he
                    was towards Edward and his unhappy parents, in contemplating such a measure. He
                    quieted his conscience with the conviction, that Mary would make a much better
                    use of the money than her dissipated brother, and never thought of the shame and
                    misery he was bringing upon Agnes, or of her son’s existence thus early ruined
                    and blighted.</p>
<p>Mr. Verney put the question to Mr. Sharp, and received at once a decisive answer.
                    The passing of the act in 1835, respecting marriages within the prohibited
                    degrees of affinity, has made the law in the present day different to what it
                    was at the period to which <pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7062-165"/> we refer. At that
                    time, as the lawyer informed Mr. Verney, the legitimacy of the offspring of a
                    man and his sister‐in‐law could be set aside if an action were brought against
                    them during the lifetime of both parents. Thus, in the case of Edward Clayton,
                    the thing was perfectly possible, and his sister might unquestionably succeed to
                    the property; but, of course, the necessary measures could only be taken by Mr.
                    Verney when he should be her husband. This was, however, quite satisfactory to
                    him; as he thought it by no means impossible that his father and mother might
                    consent to his marriage, if he could hold out so sure a prospect of his wife’s
                    becoming a wealthy heiress.</p>
<p>He therefore determined to proceed at once to his own home, in order to acquaint
                    his parents with his plans; but he could not resist the temptation of first
                    paying a visit at The Mount, that Mary might learn the new hopes which cheered
                    him. He informed both her and Richard, that he had found a means whereby he
                    hoped to overcome all the obstacles to their union; and with all the ardour of
                    his peculiarly sanguine temperament, he assured her, that he doubted not his
                    parents would soon come themselves to claim her as their daughter. Mr. Verney
                    was scrupulously careful to conceal from Mary the cruel and wicked scheme he had
                        <pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7062-166"/> devised. He knew enough of her character
                    and principles to feel certain that she would never consent to be his wife on
                    such terms, and he resolved that she should only know the truth, when as her
                    husband he could claim her obedience to his wishes.</p>
<p>Mary never asked, however, what was the plan of which he spoke. She was
                    bewildered with joy; for she implicitly believed his assurance, that they should
                    yet be happy, and the sudden revulsion of feeling was almost too much for her
                    enfeebled frame.</p>
<p>After he left her Mr. Verney wrote to Mr. Sharp, to inform him that his marriage
                    would be concluded very shortly, and that he held him engaged to commence
                    immediately afterwards the legal proceedings against Edward Clayton.</p>
<p>This letter was entrusted by Mr. Sharp to his son, who was in the habit of making
                    copies of such documents for his father’s use. It so chanced that this young man
                    had once a violent quarrel with Edward when he was little more than a boy. He
                    had taunted him, as many others were in the habit of doing, with the
                    circumstances of his birth, and the insult had been answered by a blow. This
                    indignity was never forgotten by the lawyer’s son, who was a mean and pitiful
                    character; and even if he had <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7062-167"/> been disposed
                    to forgive it, his mother was at hand to foster his anger and encourage his
                    desire for revenge. Mrs. Sharp saw, in the insult her son had received from
                    Edward, only an aggravation of that offered to herself by Agnes, many years
                    previously; for the lapse of time had but served to strengthen her enmity
                    against the whole family, which was now brought to its height by her son’s
                    complaints. Of late she had been bitterly displeased at the bright prospects
                    which had seemed to dawn for them in the proposed marriage of Mary Clayton, and
                    it was now with a spiteful pleasure that she learnt, from Mr. Verney’s letter,
                    the disgrace and misery which were preparing for them. Neither she nor her son,
                    however, could resist forestalling the evils which threatened the Claytons, when
                    so favourable an opportunity for revenge presented itself. Together they
                    arranged a plan for Edward’s public humiliation, which Mr. Sharp’s son knew he
                    could put in execution without loss of time.</p>
<p>That same evening he took Mr. Verney’s letter with him when he went to join a
                    dinner party of young men, where he knew he should meet Edward. There he openly
                    repeated the insult which years before had provoked the return he resented; and
                    when Edward, stung almost to fury at his words, would have called him to account
                    for them, he flung Mr. Verney’s <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7062-168"/> letter across
                    the table to him, and told him he might learn there how he would soon have to
                    fight the whole world for attributing to him a disgrace which was to be publicly
                    and legally proved. The lawyer’s son was perfectly aware that he was betraying
                    his employer’s confidence by this proceeding, but he had the less scruple in
                    doing it for the gratification of his own malice, because he knew that it was
                    perfectly impossible for Edward or his family to avert the threatened evil, if
                    Mary’s husband chose to institute proceedings against him.</p>
<p>It was late in the evening, and the family at The Mount were assembled together
                    in the drawing‐room. Richard and Agnes were both silently watching Mary, whose
                    sweet face, though still pale from recent suffering, was now once again
                    brightened by the light of hope, like sunshine beaming on a placid lake. There
                    was no balm to the wounded conscience of Agnes Clayton like to that of a smile
                    on the face of Elizabeth’s daughter; but Richard could not yet believe there was
                    any happiness in store for them; his health was dreadfully shaken by his late
                    attack, and he was now the victim to a settled despondency. Still the sound of
                    Mary’s cheerful voice was as music to his ears to‐night, and he felt a greater
                    sensation of peace than he had known for many weeks.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as they sat there quietly, there <pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7062-169"/> was
                    a sound of rushing footsteps in the hall without; exclamations of astonishment
                    from some of the servants, and the door of the room was burst open by a furious
                    hand. They all looked round trembling, and the conviction of some new misfortune
                    darted like lightning into the minds of each member of this unhappy family. They
                    were not mistaken.</p>
<p>Edward Clayton rushed into the room, seemingly half frantic; he had never curbed
                    his anger, even for trifling causes, and now it was ungovernable. His face was
                    actually livid with rage, his teeth set, the veins starting on his forehead. In
                    his clenched hand he held a letter, which he flung down before his father, and
                    in a few words, that sounded to the miserable man like the sentence of a
                    terrible judgment, he told him how it contained the assurance that he, his
                    innocent son, should for his parents’ sin be publicly branded with disgrace,
                    deprived of the property he had always considered his own, and sent out into the
                    world to struggle in poverty with a blighting stain upon his name. Then (the
                    sense of his misery, and of the injustice done to him increasing as he spoke,)
                    Edward looked for a moment on both his parents with a glance they never forgot,
                    and burst into a storm of invective against them, upbraiding them in terms <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7062-170"/> too dreadful to be recorded here, for having
                    given him an existence, which by their fault was already blighted and
                    destroyed.</p>
<p>To Mary, also, he turned, and thanked her with taunting bitterness for the
                    lessons of Christianity which she had given him; her religion was bearing noble
                    fruit truly, when it permitted her to rob her brother by such a cruel means, and
                    to seek for his ruin and dishonour, that she might herself become the happy wife
                    of her proud lover. He heeded not her wild frantic protestation, that she knew
                    nothing of such a scheme; but, gathering all the passion that was bursting from
                    his lips, as it were into one sentence, he frantically declared, that he would
                    not remain another moment in the place, where he was soon to be stripped of his
                    lawful inheritance, and made an object of public scorn. He would never look
                    again on those who had so injured him; he would go to plunge into the only mode
                    of life, which now was open to him in the haunts of vice and misery; he would
                    find an existence in gaming, or cheating; and when his parents heard of him in
                    disgrace, in crime, in infamy, let them remember that they themselves had driven
                    him to it!</p>
<p>With these words he dashed aside the clinging hands of his mother, who had fallen
                        almost<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7062-171"/> at his feet, and rushed from the
                    room. They heard his frantic steps in the hall, then outside, passing the
                    window; his flying figure appeared for a moment among the trees; it vanished
                    swiftly, and he was gone—their only son—self‐exiled from his home; driven forth
                    from it by the shadow of their crime, which haunted him like a mysterious
                    avenger.</p>
<p>For a few moments all three were so paralyzed with the suddenness of this event,
                    that they were incapable of speaking or moving. Mary was the first to awaken
                    from the sort of stupor into which they were plunged: she started up with an
                    expression of so much anguish, that it attracted the attention even of the
                    parents, in whose ears the terrible words of their son were yet ringing.</p>
<p>“He must not go, thinking I could be so base, so wicked!” she exclaimed; “I
                    cannot bear it—I must find him, or I shall never know peace again!” And careless
                    of the rain, which now was pouring down in torrents, or of the chill and gloom
                    of the night, she darted from the house, and followed wildly on the path which
                    Edward had taken.</p>
<p>More than an hour elapsed before Richard could find her again. He sought for her
                    in vain through the grounds, and out on the road which Edward had already
                    quitted long since <pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7062-172"/> on his way to London. It
                    was a wild tempestuous night, and the father felt an indescribable terror as he
                    thought of his child, so fragile and tender, exposed to the fury of the storm.
                    He saw that she had gone out bewildered and almost unconscious of what she did,
                    her brain reeling under the terrible remorse which her brother’s misery had
                    caused her, though she was so innocent of it. And when at length he discerned
                    her standing on the brink of the river, which rolled with a deep strong current
                    below the house, a dreadful fear took possession of him that she was about to
                    seek oblivion of her bitter sorrow within its whelming waters.</p>
<p>She was standing fixed and rigid on the steep bank, gazing on the stream with
                    eyes wide and dilated, unconscious apparently of the drenching rain. Richard
                    flew towards her—he seized her in his arms, and called her by every endearing
                    name, but she did not seem to hear him; and he saw at once, by the vacant stare
                    of her glazed eyes, and the expression of her open mouth, that reason had for
                    the time deserted her. He could not wonder that it was so, for to a person of
                    her peculiarly sensitive nature, Edward’s bitter accusation against herself, and
                    his look and manner when he well‐nigh cursed his parents, was in truth a trial
                    sufficient, seriously to affect her mind. He carried her back, <pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7062-173"/> passive and unconscious, to the house. Throughout the
