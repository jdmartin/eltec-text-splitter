<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p>RICHARD CLAYTON had written to announce his marriage to his father and
                    also to his household; and although it was with considerable trepidation that he
                    awaited a meeting with the former, it never occurred to him to anticipate any
                    manifestation of feeling on the part of those who formed his establishment. He
                    never bestowed a thought on persons in that inferior station, and certainly did
                    not imagine them to be capable of forming an opinion on such a matter as that
                    now in question. But it is a peculiarity of the lower classes which must have
                    been remarked by many, that they display a singular delicacy of feeling in their
                    reverence for the dead. They seem to consider it a holy duty to be most
                    scrupulous in all things pertaining to the honour of those helpless ones
                    departed. And though Richard’s servants could not understand how far Agnes had
                    sinned against all conventional laws by remaining in the house, <emph>not of her
                        brother‐in‐law</emph> (for to that no right‐minded person should have
                    objected), <emph>but <pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7062-099"/> of a man whom she thought
                        it possible to marry</emph>, they could yet feel the instinctive revolting
                    of conscience against a union between those two, for death had dissolved the tie
                    between Richard and Elizabeth in one sense only—<emph>it had not dissolved the
                        relationship which that tie had produced</emph>—Agnes was still sister to
                    her who mouldered in the dust—Richard was still one flesh with her—the
                    fraternity between them remained unbroken as between children of the same
                    parents; the humble servants felt these things, though they could not have
                    expressed them, and their natural indignation and repugnance at the step which
                    their master had taken were fostered to the uttermost by the assiduous efforts
                    of Mrs. Sharp.</p>
<p>This lady, under pretence of visiting the little Mary, had come to the Mount
                    every day since the departure of Richard and Agnes, in order to glean what
                    information she could respecting their mysterious journey, which she could not
                    help connecting with her own visit to Mr. and Mrs. Hardman, and the letter which
                    she knew they had written in consequence. She was herself under the full belief
                    that Agnes had returned to her guardian’s protection; and when she heard of
                    their marriage, she was, to do her justice, sincerely and deeply shocked. In
                    fact, no person, even worldly minded and unrefined <pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7062-100"/> as Mrs. Sharp was, could fail to be otherwise on
                    first hearing of a union of that description, unless their mind had received a
                    bias to a contrary opinion from the sophistical arguments of those who fear not
                    to show a practical contempt of God’s laws and ordinances; and it seemed to her
                    a very horrible thing that Richard should hold in such light esteem the sacred
                    tie which had united him to Elizabeth, that he thus openly set at nought the
                    indissoluble bonds with which it had bound him as brother to her sister. Soon,
                    however, when the first feelings of astonishment and indignation had subsided,
                    it was with no small delight that Mrs. Sharp found she had now a fair and most
                    legitimate ground for inveighing against Agnes in the strongest terms; and she
                    so worked on the minds of Richard’s servants, already sufficiently excited on
                    the subject, that they received the newly‐married couple on their arrival with
                    the most cold and sullen looks; some of them, full of that superstitious dread
                    of a judgment on those who do such deeds (which is not altogether a
                    superstition), did not even delay an hour informing their master that they would
                    not remain in his service. This was a chilling reception for the unhonoured
                    bride; but a sharper pang awaited her. Mary had been left entirely to the care
                    of the servants, and to the tender mercies of Mrs. <pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7062-101"/> Sharp, and they had not failed to fill her young mind
                    with many painful ideas respecting her father and aunt, which, with all the
                    strength and power of early impressions, were destined to influence her feelings
                    towards them during the remainder of her life. No attempt is made at the age of
                    this innocent little being to hide what passes in the mind, and they received
                    their first bitter lesson as to the manner in which both God and man were to
                    view this deed, from the pure lips of the child they loved so well.</p>
<p>Richard was furiously angry, Agnes miserable, and their first evening at home was
                    a very sad one.</p>
<p>The next morning, Richard wrote a note to Mr. Clayton, requesting to know when he
                    could see him. It was not without a pang that they felt such a measure to be
                    necessary. The answer was delayed some hours; it came at last, merely a verbal
                    message, naming an hour on the following day, when Mr. Clayton would receive
                    them. They looked forward with the most painful anxiety to the interview. The
                    profound affection which both felt almost equally for him, was mingled with a
                    respect amounting to awe; for it does not require a mind of a high order to feel
                    the influence of superior holiness.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour they walked together to the vicarage. They had to cross the
                        church‐<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7062-102"/> yard, which was separated from the
                    garden only by an invisible fence; there was a grave laid there, which they
                    passed with hurried steps and averted head; the church stood so near the house,
                    that it seemed placed almost within the grounds, and the east window was close
                    to that of the drawing‐room.</p>
<p>It was impossible at the vicarage of B— to be indifferent to the proximity of
                    that holy and beautiful house, with its quiet grass‐grown tombs, telling of the
                    body sown in dishonour and weakness, and its cross, giving a hope of that which
                    is raised in glory and power. It was a blessed thing when some earthly sorrow
                    was at work, and many a hidden pang smote through the soul, to be able at once
                    to lift the eyes to that fair church and think of the sure rest that remaineth
                    for the people of God: but these two, as they sat waiting in the drawing‐room of
                    the vicarage, turned away their eyes from the sight.</p>
<p>It was some time before Mr. Clayton appeared. Agnes had buried her face in her
                    hands. Richard walked moodily to and fro. He entered at last. Their hearts sunk
                    within them at sight of him who for their sakes had spent the last three days in
                    fasting and prayer. He was not stern, but grave and calm; his face had the
                    traces of bitter suffering, but it wore <pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7062-103"/> also
                    an expression of firm determination, which they knew resulted from the triumph
                    of duty over natural affection.</p>
<p>They all seemed simultaneously to feel that the customary expressions of welcome
                    and greeting would be a bitter mockery, and for a few minutes no one spoke. The
                    tears which Agnes had shed abundantly over the estrangement of the little Mary
                    were dried up now by the burning blush that crimsoned her face when she found
                    herself standing before that grey‐haired old man, who had so struggled after a
                    rigid and unshrinking holiness, that his life and thoughts were pure as those of
                    an innocent child. Richard seemed endeavouring to conceal his fierce uneasiness,
                    his restless angry suffering. Mr. Clayton looked from the one to the other, and
                    became much agitated; he turned to the window to hide his emotion; the sight
                    probably of the church, at whose altar he ministered as priest, restored to him
                    his courage and his strength. He came and stood before them severe and
                    unmoved.</p>
<p>“It is best we should understand each other,” he said, addressing his son.
                    “Richard, you have taken a step which you were perfectly aware could only meet
                    with the most severe and unqualified disapprobation from me; but you will
                    doubtless say that you have long since cast off<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7062-104"/> the trammels of paternal authority—that you are no longer of an age when it
                    is necessary for you to be influenced by my opinions, or to consult my
                    wishes—that we stand together as man with man, the one as likely to be right in
                    his ideas as the other, each holding his own views in independence, acting by
                    his own standard of right and wrong. Be this as it may, certain it is that you
                    stand on your own responsibility so far as regards the ordering of your life in
                    the sight of God. I have not the power, because I am your earthly father, of
                    compelling you to serve your Father which is in heaven. As your parent, then, I
                    profess no authority to condemn the deed which you have done; but on far higher
                    ground I do most solemnly condemn it, even as a priest of the Most High! Let me
                    set aside, then, all other relationship save that of a clergyman and his
                    parishioner; as such, I must tell you plainly, that the union you have
                    contracted is contrary to the will of God, to the authority of the Church, and
                    to the law of the land; it is unhallowed, it must be unblest. Your purpose in
                    coming here to‐day is to request that I, a minister of Christ, will sanction the
                    marriage of a man with a woman who is virtually his sister. You are aware that
                    my first and highest duty is to my flock; I am set before them not as a teacher
                    only, but as an example, in humblest<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7062-105"/> imitation
                    of Him whose servant I am, and who was Teacher and Example to the world. You
                    know that I have always most strongly prohibited amongst them such marriages as
                    that which you have contracted. I have turned away persons so connected from the
                    very steps of the altar where they came to be united. I have spoken against them
                    from the pulpit. I have admonished my people on the subject in their own houses.
                    I have openly refused to sanction parties joined in such unlawful unions, even
                    though already married when they came into my parish. And now, Richard, I ask it
                    of yourself,—do you think it possible for me, to whom is committed authority in
                    the Church of God, without derogating fearfully from my holy calling, to
                    countenance the man who has made such a marriage, although that man is my
                    son?”</p>
<p>“You need not have said all this, to prove to me what you mean to do,” exclaimed
                    Richard, taking refuge from the painful feelings that oppressed him, in a burst
                    of anger; “I have guessed it from the first. You mean that you will cast us
                    off,—at least that you will not receive us, or come to visit us.”</p>
<p>“I do mean it,” said Mr. Clayton, calmly, though sadly; “since by no other means
                    can I prove to my flock how profoundly I disapprove of your act, now, alas! so
                    irrevocable.”</p>
<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7062-106"/>
<p>“What an existence!“ said Richard, rising and pacing the room in violent
                    agitation; ”father and son living within a few hundred yards of each other on
                    such terms as these! You will bear it calmly, I doubt not; but to me it will be
                        insupportable.<corr>”</corr></p>
<p>“Richard,” said Mr. Clayton, his voice trembling with emotion, “I did not expect
                    that you would do me justice in believing with what bitter anguish to myself I
                    have taken this resolution respecting you; but I have at least an opportunity of
                    showing you that, however rigidly I must adhere to my most painful duty, I have
                    not been without consideration for your feelings. I am quite aware how galling
                    it would be to you to have your residence henceforward so near to mine. I know,
                    also, that it would be very injurious to your prospects in life, were you to
                    quit this place, on many accounts. I have, therefore, determined on leaving B—
                    myself, at the same time openly informing my flock of the reason which induces
                    me to do so. A clergyman with whom I am acquainted, in Kent, has long been
                    desirous of holding this living. I have effected an exchange with him: in a week
                    he comes to this house, and I leave it for ever.”</p>
<p>“Impossible—it cannot be!” exclaimed Richard and Agnes both at once. “Oh no!”
                        con‐<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7062-107"/> tinued the latter, horror‐stricken at
                    finding that they were to be the means of driving the old man from his sweet and
                    peaceful home;—“ you must not go,—you cannot leave a place you have loved so
                    well.”</p>
<p>“I love <emph>him</emph> more than all upon this earth,” said Mr. Clayton,
                    pointing to his son; “and yet I leave him for conscience sake. Therefore the
                    love of this home shall not detain me, though you said truly that it has been
                    very dear to me.”—He looked towards the church as he spoke, with quivering lips,
                    and then continued, after a moment’s silence,—“ I may still believe and hope
                    that the unnumbered prayers I have uttered within these sacred walls for him
                    have not all been said in vain. Thank Heaven, I need not scruple to come to you,
                    were you in sickness or in sorrow: suffering casts down all barriers for the
                    servant of Him who in all our afflictions was afflicted. Meantime, do not think
                    to change my resolution in any way; there is but one path opened for me in this,
                    as in all other earthly trials—the path of duty—and that alone will I
                    follow.”</p>
<p>Agnes turned away, weeping bitterly. Richard flung himself into a chair, and hid
                    his face on his arm. There was a painful silence for a few minutes, till Mr.
                    Clayton spoke again.</p>
<p>“I have yet a painful task to perform,” he <pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7062-108"/>
                    said; “I have to request a favour of you both, which you can only grant with a
                    great sacrifice to yourselves, but which I might, perhaps, claim as a
                    right.”</p>
<p>“We will refuse you nothing,” said Richard, in a voice hoarse from agitation;
                    “you may ask what you will of us.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” exclaimed Agnes, “give us the means of making some sacrifice for you
                    who have made such an one for us!”</p>
<p>They were rewarded for these words by the look of tenderness which Mr. Clayton
                    cast upon them both; but he went on:—</p>
<p>“Mary Clayton is my god‐child,” he said; “I am responsible for her spiritual
                    welfare, and, as her grandfather, deeply interested also in her temporal
                    concerns. Agnes, it grieves me to utter so painful a truth, but I am compelled
                    to tell you that I must now consider you as wholly unfit to have the charge of
                    this child, and that it would be highly injurious to her interests, both earthly
                    and eternal, were she to remain with you. Her prospects in this world would be
                    seriously affected by it. It is perfectly clear to me that you have never either
                    of you viewed the matter in this light,—that you are altogether unaware how
                    severely your conduct will be denounced in society. Would that you had known it!
                    it might have deterred you from the<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7062-109"/> step you
                    have taken;—but at least this innocent child must not suffer. You, Agnes, have
                    lived for two years in the house of the man whom you have now thought fit to
                    marry; you could only do so,—you only obtained my sanction for so doing, on the
                    ground that he was your <emph>brother</emph>. Had you continued to consider him
                    as such, not the faintest breath of slander could have reached your name, even
                    though such a letter as that of Mr. Hardman compelled you to leave your home.
                    But you have not done so. Since you have now married him, it is impossible that
                    you can ever have looked upon him as your brother,—at least so must the world
                    conclude. If you cast aside the relationship, they must do so also,—nay, Heaven
                    forbid it should now be supposed to exist!” he added, with a slight shudder, as
                    his eye fell on Agnes’ wedding‐ring. “I leave you, therefore, to draw your own
                    conclusion as to the opinion that will be formed of your conduct, in residing
                    for so long a period alone with the person to whom you are now united; and from
                    that you may also clearly perceive what a fatal influence it might have on
                    Mary’s whole existence, that she should be educated by you.”</p>
<p>“Do you really mean,” interrupted Richard, “that our marriage will be so strongly
                    disapproved of by society in general,—by any, in <pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7062-110"/> fact, excepting, perhaps, a few clergymen like
                    yourself?”</p>
<p>“I fear you will not have to ask me that question a month or two hence,” replied
                    Mr. Clayton. “I feel certain you will have but too many palpable proofs of the
                    truth of my words. However fearfully corrupt may be the internal machinery of
                    society, they yet have outwardly a code of laws, against which they allow none
                    to rebel with impunity.”</p>
<p>It was evident that this idea was as new as it was bitter to Richard. He saw at
                    once, that if his marriage was a sin against the world’s rule of propriety, he
                    might expect to be visited with no light punishment. He literally groaned as he
                    thought of what he had done, and of what was to come. The union he had
                    contracted, suddenly appeared before him in the light of an irretrievable
                    mistake. Agnes saw what was passing in his mind; and no words can describe how
                    her heart died within her.</p>
<p>“And now,” said Mr. Clayton, “I have shown you why, in a worldly point of view,
                    it is necessary that Mary should not remain with you. I have myself far higher
                    motives for requiring of you that she should be entrusted to my own care. I dare
                    not, Agnes, consider you fit, at least at present, to guide an immortal soul in
                    that most difficult and painful course <pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7062-111"/> of
                    bitter self‐denial which alone can bring us to the feet of the Crucified. In the
                    most important occasion of your life, you have preferred your own will to the
                    will of God. You have thrown off the yoke of the Saviour, who bade you serve Him
                    in suffering. You have trampled under foot the cross which He presented before
                    you, in the heavy trial laid upon you, to quit all most dear on earth, rather
                    than remain with them by means of an unhallowed alliance. You will say you did
                    not know that the course you took was so wrong;—<emph>how</emph> wrong it was, I
                    believe, in truth, you did not dream; but that you had more than misgivings on
                    the subject, is sufficiently proved by the fact that you concealed it from me.
                    Had you felt but one conscientious earnest desire to do what was right, at the
                    expense of any amount of pain to yourself; you would have consulted Mr. Lambert,
                    or myself, and you know that we would have prohibited your doing as you have
                    done. You will say you did it for the sake of Richard’s children, but I ask by
                    what right you did evil that good might come? How did you dare to doubt, that He
                    who carries the lambs in his bosom would have cared for these little ones? But I
                    spare you; only I must repeat and enforce my request, that you submit to a
                    separation from Mary, and that <pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7062-112"/> you entrust
                    her entirely to my care. I demand this sacrifice of you. My sister, Mrs.
                    Harewood, has consented to come and reside with me in order to take charge of
                    her; you need have no fear for the dear child’s welfare.” He paused waiting for
                    a reply. Richard rose instantly.</p>
<p>“Agnes, you must not dream of hesitating one instant; he shall have the child. I
                    would rather never see her again, than that my innocent daughter should suffer
                    by any imprudence of yours—or mine,” he added more gently, as he saw her start
                    with the pang his words had caused. “It is better clearly that Mary should go to
                    her grandfather,” continued Richard, bitterly; “we have had a specimen these
                    last two days as to the manner in which the mind of a child may be worked upon;
                    I have no doubt that in a very little time we should find the sacrifice far less
                    severe than it seems to us at present; her health is besides well established
                    now—it was for my little son that I was chiefly desirous to secure your care;
                    there is, therefore, no reason why I should scruple to give my free and full
                    consent, and I wish that the matter should be settled at once.” And it was so
                    decided.</p>
<p>Agnes offered no opposition, she was utterly bewildered and overwhelmed with all
                    that had passed, she did not even remind him of what rose <pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7062-113"/> so painfully to her own mind at the moment, that by
                    giving up Mary, however advisable such a measure might be, they were rendering
                    altogether null the one potent argument which had principally induced them to
                    marry, namely, the absolute necessity of the children being left to her care!
                    She said nothing of this, although it proved to her how weak and sophistical had
                    been the reasoning with which they had quieted their consciences, for she felt
                    crushed to the very earth with the painful thoughts that were crowding on her.
                    The whole affair had been shown to her in a new and terrible light; she had
                    acted thoughtlessly, recklessly; and now all was most different from what she
                    had expected, her heart was full of a bitter dread for the consequences,
                    enduring even to her life’s end, of the deed she had done. She could not collect
                    her ideas, or bring her mind thoroughly to understand her position; she had a
                    sort of feeling as though she had been hardly dealt with; she had always
                    anticipated a happy and an honoured life as a kind of right; gay and beautiful
                    as she had ever been, she had looked upon admiration and affection as her due;
                    and now, she scarce knew how, she found herself in a situation where it would
                    seem that not only trial, but disgrace was to be her portion.</p>
<p>Agnes was too much absorbed with a miser‐<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7062-114"/> able
                    foreboding of future suffering to herself, to find any difficulty in submitting
                    to her husband’s decision that Mary should be taken from her; and when the
                    matter was thus finally arranged, Richard Clayton and his wife left the Vicarage
                    to enter it no more.</p>
<p>Mr. Clayton dismissed them with one parting injunction, addressed chiefly to
                    Agnes. He implored them if sorrow or suffering came upon them, more especially
                    if penitence came—as he prayed it might—to apply at once to Mr. Lambert, and to
                    open their griefs to him; doubtless the Curate would not countenance them now,
                    but in their distress he would be a valuable and faithful friend. They saw that
                    the old man murmured a blessing as they passed him, but Richard was in no humour
                    to feel softened by it: he drew Agnes almost roughly from the room, and they
                    quitted the house that had been as a home to them, with downcast eyes and
                    sorrowful hearts.</p>
<p>Agnes Clayton had never been accustomed, as we have said before, to control her
                    feelings. She did not remember, that there is a profound selfishness in allowing
                    those around us to be saddened with the aspect of our suffering; there is enough
                    of sorrow in this world without our adding to it by constraining others to feel
                    for us a painful sympathy. We have a <pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7062-115"/> Friend
                    most merciful, to whom we may pour out the bitterness of our soul; but let us
                    ever walk among men with calm face and serene aspect, whatever may be our
                    internal anguish, lest haply we cast a shadow over the sunshine which He hath
                    given them. She had no thought for this; as soon as they had entered their own
                    house, she went and flung herself upon a sofa, and burst into a passion of
                    tears. It could not be an agreeable sight for Richard to see her there; her face
                    disfigured with weeping, her frame convulsed with sobs. He had followed her into
                    the room, in the hope that her cheerful voice and loving eyes might have
                    dispelled the gloom that hung upon him; when he saw how she thought only of
                    indulging her grief he turned abruptly and went out. Agnes loved him well and
                    truly, but she had not for him that noble affection which would have made her
                    rather die of her inward agony than let him suffer by it.</p>
<p>Richard took a long walk, but solitude was unsupportable to him, and he returned
                    towards evening, trusting to find his house restored to cheerfulness and
                    comfort. Agnes still lay in the same position; her tangled hair falling over her
                    face stained with tears, and for the time devoid of beauty. The room was dark
                    and cold, the whole establishment in confusion.<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7062-116"/> Richard was violent in temper, and he was not a man to submit easily to
                    annoyance or vexation. He walked up to Agnes, and taking her angrily by the arm,
                    he forced her to raise herself up. She trembled when she saw the expression of
                    his countenance, and still more when he spoke, his voice was so stern and
                    harsh.</p>
<p>“Agnes,” he said, “let me beg of you to tell me once for all, whether you intend
                    to render my life insupportable by this absurd and intolerable conduct? Instead
                    of the gaiety and cheerfulness which made you attractive to me formerly, do you
                    mean henceforward to regale me with scenes such as these, tears and ill humour,
                    discomfort and confusion throughout the house?”</p>
<p>Agnes felt her face crimson at these words, with a feeling of something very like
                    anger.</p>
<p>“Have I nothing to make me sorrowful?” she asked, reproachfully.</p>
<p>“Not half so much as I have, at all events,” replied Richard; “but that is not
                    the question. I wish to tell you most plainly that I will not submit for one
                    hour to have a dismal companion at my side, complaining and groaning. I will
                    give you your choice. You have your room, where you may go and weep and pine as
                    much as you please, but there you must stay. You <pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7062-117"/> shall either appear before me with a look of
                    cheerfulness at all times on your face, or else you shall not come into my
                    presence at all. In the one case, I shall have you merry and bright as you were
                    before; in the other, I may try to forget your existence—so make your
                    choice.”</p>
<p>Agnes was completely subdued. She fancied that Richard was cruel to her, but
                    still he was her husband, and she loved him. It was a mockery to say that he
                    gave her any choice; she had no alternative; she could not go and shut herself
                    up from him; she must submit to wear ever a smile as gay as her heart was sad.
                    It was with a dreary sense of desolation that she thought how she must drive
                    back all her feelings within her own breast, and never hope for the sympathy
                    which, with her naturally frank disposition, she would so earnestly have sought;
                    but her womanly powers of endurance came to her assistance. She scarce knew with
                    what a strength of determination she at that moment resolved, henceforward, to
                    bear all in silence. She was driven to it, partly by pride, partly by a helpless
                    feeling of submission. She looked up, she dashed the tears from her eyes, and
                    said calmly:—</p>
<p>“I will endeavour to please you; you need not be afraid; I will look sad no
                    more.” She <pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7062-118"/> said this with a bitter conviction
                    of his unkindness—with a sullen morbid feeling rankling at her heart; and
                    Richard understood, readily enough, what was passing in her mind, but from that
                    hour she obeyed him so implicitly to the letter, that it was impossible for him
                    to find fault with the thoughts which he could only guess to be in her heart;
                    and, as a natural result, a sort of indefinite estrangement rose up between
                    them. So commenced the married life of Elizabeth’s husband and sister.</p>
