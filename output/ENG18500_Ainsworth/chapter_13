<head>The Tomb of the Rosicrucian</head>
<p>On the night of the 1st of March 1800, and at a late hour, a man, wrapped in a large
     horseman’s cloak, and of strange and sinister appearance, entered an old deserted house in the
     neighbourhood of Stepney Green. He was tall, carried himself very erect, and seemed in the full
     vigour of early manhood; but his features had a worn and ghastly look, as if bearing the stamp
     of long-indulged and frightful excesses, while his dark gleaming eyes gave him an expression
     almost diabolical.</p>
<p>This person had gained the house from a garden behind it, and now stood in a large dismantled
     hall, from which a broad oaken staircase, with curiously-carved banisters, led to a gallery,
     and thence to the upper chambers of the habitation. Nothing could be more dreary than the
     aspect of the place. The richly-moulded ceiling was festooned with spiders’ webs, and in some
     places had fallen in heaps upon the floor; the glories of the tapestry upon the walls were
     obliterated by damps; the squares of black and white marble, with which the hall was paved,
     were loosened, and quaked beneath the footsteps; the wide and empty fireplace yawned like the
     mouth of a cavern; the bolts of the closed windows were rusted in their sockets; and the heaps
     of dust before the outer door proved that long years had elapsed since any one had passed
     through it.</p>
<p>Taking a dark lantern from beneath his cloak, the individual in question gazed for a moment
     around him, and then, with a sardonic smile playing upon his features, directed his steps
     towards a room on the right, the door of which stood open.</p>
<p>This chamber, which was large and cased with oak, was wholly unfurnished, like the hall, and
     in an equally dilapidated condition. The only decoration remaining on its walls was the
     portrait of a venerable personage in the cap and gown of Henry the Eighth’s time, painted
     against a panel—a circumstance which had probably saved it from destruction—and beneath it,
     fixed in another panel, a plate of brass, covered with mystical characters and symbols, and
     inscribed with the name “Cyprianus de Rougemont, Fra. R.C.” The same name likewise appeared
     upon a label beneath the portrait, with the date 1550.</p>
<p>Pausing before the portrait, the young man threw the light of the lantern full upon it, and
     revealed features somewhat resembling his own in form, but of a severe and philosophic cast. In
     the eyes alone could be discerned the peculiar and terrible glimmer which distinguished his own
     glances.</p>
<p>After regarding the portrait for some time fixedly, he thus addressed it:</p>
<p>“Dost hear me, old ancestor?” he cried. “I, thy descendant, Cyprian de Rougemont, call upon
     thee to point out where thy gold is hidden? I know that thou wert a brother of the Rosy
     Cross—one of the illuminati—and didst penetrate the mysteries of nature, and enter the region
     of light. I know, also, that thou wert buried in this house with a vast treasure; but though I
     have made diligent search for it, and others have searched before me, thy grave has never yet
     been discovered! Listen to me! Methought Satan appeared to me in a dream last night, and bade
     me come hither, and I should find what I sought. The conditions he proposed were, that I should
     either give him my own soul, or win him that of Auriol Darcy. I assented. I am here. Where is
     thy treasure?”</p>
<p>After a pause, he struck the portrait with his clenched hand, exclaiming in a loud voice:</p>
<p>“Dost hear me, I say, old ancestor? I call on thee to give me thy treasure. Dost hear, I
     say?”</p>
<p>And he repeated the blow with greater violence.</p>
<p>Disturbed by the shock, the brass plate beneath the picture started from its place, and fell
     to the ground.</p>
<p>“What is this?” cried Rougemont, gazing into the aperture left by the plate. “Ha!—my
     invocation has been heard!”</p>
<p>And, snatching up the lantern, he discovered, at the bottom of a little recess, about two
     feet deep, a stone, with an iron ring in the centre of it. Uttering a joyful cry, he seized the
     ring, and drew the stone forward without difficulty, disclosing an open space beyond it.</p>
<p>“This, then, is the entrance to my ancestor’s tomb,” cried Rougemont; “there can be no doubt
     of it. The old Rosicrucian has kept his secret well; but the devil has helped me to wrest it
     from him. And now to procure the necessary implements, in case, as is not unlikely, I should
     experience further difficulty.”</p>
<p>With this he hastily quitted the room, but returned almost immediately with a mallet, a
     lever, and a pitchfork; armed with which and the lantern, he crept through the aperture. This
     done, he found himself at the head of a stone staircase, which he descended, and came to the
     arched entrance of a vault. The door, which was of stout oak, was locked, but holding up the
     light towards it, he read the following inscription:</p>
<quote>
<l>“POST C.C.L. ANNOS PATEBO, 1550.”</l></quote>
<p>“In two hundred and fifty years I shall open!” cried Rougemont, “and the date 1550—why, the
     exact time is arrived. Old Cyprian must have foreseen what would happen, and evidently intended
     to make me his heir. There was no occasion for the devil’s interference. And see, the key is in
     the lock. So!” And he turned it, and pushing against the door with some force, the rusty hinges
     gave way, and it fell inwards.</p>

<p>From the aperture left by the fallen door, a soft and silvery light streamed forth, and,
     stepping forward, Rougemont found himself in a spacious vault, from the ceiling of which hung a
     large globe of crystal, containing in its heart a little flame, which diffused a radiance,
     gentle as that of the moon, around. This, then, was the ever-burning lamp of the Rosicrucians,
     and Rougemont gazed at it with astonishment. Two hundred and fifty years had elapsed since that
     wondrous flame had been lighted, and yet it burnt on brightly as ever. Hooped round the globe
     was a serpent with its tail in its mouth—an emblem of eternity—wrought in purest gold; while
     above it were a pair of silver wings, in allusion to the soul. Massive chains of the more
     costly metal, fashioned like twisted snakes, served as suspenders to the lamp.</p>
<p>But Rougemont’s astonishment at this marvel quickly gave way to other feelings, and he gazed
     around the vault with greedy eyes.</p>
<p>It was a septilateral chamber, about eight feet high, built of stone, and supported by
     beautifully groined arches. The surface of the masonry was as smooth and fresh as if the chisel
     had only just left it.</p>
<p>In six of the corners were placed large chests, ornamented with ironwork of the most
     exquisite workmanship, and these Rougemont’s imagination pictured as filled with inexhaustible
     treasure; while in the seventh corner, near the door, was a beautiful little piece of
     monumental sculpture in white marble, representing two kneeling and hooded figures, holding a
     veil between them, which partly concealed the entrance to a small recess. On one of the chests
     opposite the monument just described stood a strangely-formed bottle and a cup of antique
     workmanship, both encrusted with gems.</p>
<p>The walls were covered with circles, squares, and diagrams, and in some places were
     ornamented with grotesque carvings. In the centre of the vault was a round altar, of black
     marble, covered with a plate of gold, on which Rougemont read the following inscription:</p>
<quote>
<l>“Hoc universi compendium unius mihi sepulcrum feci.”</l></quote>
<p>“Here, then, old Cyprian lies,” he cried.</p>
<p>And, prompted by some irresistible impulse, he seized the altar by the upper rim, and
     overthrew it. The heavy mass of marble fell with a thundering crash, breaking asunder the flag
     beneath it. It might be the reverberation of the vaulted roof, but a deep groan seemed to
     reproach the young man for his sacrilege. Undeterred, however, by this warning, Rougemont
     placed the point of the lever between the interstices of the broken stone, and, exerting all
     his strength, speedily raised the fragments, and laid open the grave.</p>
<p>Within it, in the garb he wore in life, with his white beard streaming to his waist, lay the
     uncoffined body of his ancestor, Cyprian de Rougemont. The corpse had evidently been carefully
     embalmed, and the features were unchanged by decay. Upon the breast, with the hands placed over
     it, lay a large book, bound in black vellum, and fastened with brazen clasps. Instantly
     possessing himself of this mysterious-looking volume, Rougemont knelt upon the nearest chest,
     and opened it. But he was disappointed in his expectation. All the pages he examined were
     filled with cabalistic characters, which he was totally unable to decipher.</p>
<p>At length, however, he chanced upon one page the import of which he comprehended, and he
     remained for some time absorbed in its contemplation, while an almost fiendish smile played
     upon his features.</p>
<p>“Aha!” he exclaimed, closing the volume, “I see now the cause of my extraordinary dream. My
     ancestor’s wondrous power was of infernal origin—the result, in fact, of a compact with the
     Prince of Darkness. But what care I for that? Give me wealth—no matter what source it comes
     from!—ha! ha!”</p>
<p>And seizing the lever, he broke open the chest beside him. It was filled with bars of silver.
     The next he visited in the same way was full of gold. The third was laden with pearls and
     precious stones; and the rest contained treasure to an incalculable amount. Rougemont gazed at
     them in transports of joy.</p>
<p>“At length I have my wish,” he cried. “Boundless wealth, and therefore boundless power, is
     mine. I can riot in pleasure—riot in vengeance. As to my soul, I will run the risk of its
     perdition; but it shall go hard if I destroy not that of Auriol. His love of play and his
     passion for Edith Talbot shall be the means by which I will work. But I must not neglect
     another agent which is offered me. That bottle, I have learnt from yon volume, contains an
     infernal potion, which, without destroying life, shatters the brain, and creates maddening
     fancies. It will well serve my purpose; and I thank thee, Satan, for the gift.”</p>
