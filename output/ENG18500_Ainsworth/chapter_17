<head>Chapter 5</head>
<head>The Seventh Night</head>
<p>It was a delicious morning in May, and the sun shone brightly on Auriol’s gorgeous equipage,
     as he drove to St. George’s, Hanover Square, where he was united to Edith. Thus far all seemed
     auspicious, and he thought he could now bill defiance to fate. With the object of his love
     close beside him, and linked to him by the strongest and holiest ties, it seemed impossible she
     could be snatched from him. Nothing occurred during the morning to give him uneasiness, and he
     gave orders that a carriage and four should be ready an hour before midnight, to convey him and
     his bride to Richmond, where they were to spend their honeymoon.</p>
<p>Night came, and with it began to arrive the guests who were bidden to the ball. No expense
     had been spared by Auriol to give splendour to his fete. It was in all respects magnificent.
     The amusements of the evening commenced with a concert, which was performed by the first
     singers from the Italian Opera; after which, the ball was opened by Auriol and his lovely
     bride. As soon as the dance was over, Auriol made a sign to an attendant, who instantly
     disappeared.</p>
<p>“Are you prepared to quit this gay scene with me, Edith?” he asked, with a heart swelling
     with rapture.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” she replied, gazing at him with tenderness; “I long to be alone with you.”</p>
<p>“Come, then,” said Auriol.</p>
<p>Edith arose, and passing her arm under that of her husband, they quitted the ball-room, but
     in place of descending the principal staircase, they took a more private course. The hall,
     which they were obliged to cross, and which they entered from a side-door, was spacious and
     beautifully proportioned, and adorned with numerous statues on pedestals. The ceiling was
     decorated with fresco paintings, and supported by two stately scagliola pillars. From between
     these, a broad staircase of white marble ascended to the upper room. As Auriol had foreseen,
     the staircase was thronged with guests ascending to the ball-room, the doors of which being
     open, afforded glimpses of the dancers, and gave forth strains of liveliest music. Anxious to
     avoid a newly-arrived party in the hall, Auriol and his bride lingered for a moment near a
     pillar.</p>
<p>“Ha! who is this?” cried Edith, as a tall man, with a sinister countenance, and habited
     entirely in black, moved from the farther side of the pillar, and planted himself in their
     path, with his back partly towards them.</p>
<p>A thrill of apprehension passed through Auriol’s frame. He looked up and beheld Rougemont,
     who, glancing over his shoulder, fixed his malignant gaze upon him. Retreat was now
     impossible.</p>
<p>“You thought to delude me,” said Rougemont, in a deep whisper, audible only to Auriol; “but
     you counted without your host. I am come to claim my victim.”</p>
<p>“What is the matter with you, that you tremble so, dear Auriol?” cried Edith. “Who is this
     strange person?”</p>
<p>But her husband returned no answer. Terror had taken away his power of utterance.</p>
<p>“Your carriage waits for you at the door, madam—all is prepared,” said Rougemont, advancing
     towards her, and taking her hand.</p>
<p>“You are coming, Auriol?” cried Edith, who scarcely knew whether to draw back or go
     forward.</p>
<p>“Yes—yes,” cried Auriol, who fancied he saw a means of escape. “This is my friend, Mr.
     Rougemont—go with him.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Rougemont!” cried Edith. “You told my father he would not be here.”</p>
<p>“Your husband did not invite me, madam,” said Rougemont, with sarcastic emphasis; “but
     knowing I should be welcome, I came unasked. But let us avoid those persons.”</p>
<p>In another moment they were at the door. The carriage was there with its four horses, and a
     man-servant, in travelling attire, stood beside the steps. Reassured by the sight, Auriol
     recovered his courage, and suffered Rougemont to throw a cloak over Edith’s shoulders. The next
     moment she tripped up the steps of the carriage, and was ensconced within it. Auriol was about
     to follow her, when he received a violent blow on the chest, which stretched him on the
     pavement. Before he could regain his feet, Rougemont had sprung into the carriage. The steps
     were instantly put up by the man-servant, who mounted the box with the utmost celerity, while
     the postillions, plunging spurs into their horses, dashed off with lightning speed. As the
     carriage turned the corner of King Street, Auriol, who had just arisen, beheld, by the light of
     a lamp, Rougemont’s face at the window of the carriage, charged with an expression of the most
     fiendish triumph.</p>
<p>“What is the matter?” cried Mr. Talbot, who had approached Auriol, “I came to bid you
     good-bye. Why do I find you here alone? Where is the carriage?—what has become of Edith?”</p>
<p>“She is in the power of the Fiend, and I have sold her to him,” replied Auriol gloomily.</p>
<p>“What mean you, wretch?” cried Mr. Talbot, in a voice of distraction. “I heard that Cyprian
     Rougemont was here. Can it be he that has gone off with her?”</p>
<p>“You have hit the truth,” replied Auriol. “He bought her with the money I gave you. I have
     sold her and myself to perdition!”</p>
<p>“Horror!” exclaimed the old man, falling backwards.</p>
<p>“Ay, breathe your last—breathe your last!” cried Auriol wildly. “Would I could yield up my
     life, likewise!”</p>
<p>And he hurried away, utterly unconscious whither he went.</p>
