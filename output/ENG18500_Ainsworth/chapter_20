<head>Gerard Paston</head>
<p>Before the chair, in which Mr. Thorneycroft was fixed, reached the ground, terror had taken
     away his senses. A bottle of salts, placed to his nose, revived him after a time; but he had
     nearly relapsed into insensibility on seeing two strange figures, in hideous masks and sable
     cloaks, standing on either side of him, while at a little distance was a third, who carried a
     strangely-fashioned lantern. He looked round for his companions in misfortune, but, though the
     chairs were there, they were unoccupied.</p>
<p>The masked attendants paid no attention to the iron-merchant’s cries and entreaties; but as
     soon as they thought him able to move, they touched a spring, which freed his arms and legs
     from their bondage, and raising him, dragged him out of the vault, and along a narrow passage,
     till they came to a large sepulchral-looking chamber, cased with black marble, in the midst of
     which, on a velvet fauteuil of the same hue as the walls, sat Cyprian Rougemont. It was, in
     fact, the chamber where Ebba had been subject to her terrible trial.</p>
<p>Bewildered with terror, the poor iron-merchant threw himself at the feet of Rougemont, who,
     eyeing him with a look of malignant triumph, cried—</p>
<p>“You have come to seek your daughter. Behold her!”</p>
<p>And at the words, the large black curtains at the farther end of the room were suddenly
     withdrawn, and discovered the figure of Ebba Thorneycroft standing at the foot of the marble
     staircase. Her features were as pale as death; her limbs rigid and motionless; but her eyes
     blazed with preternatural light. On beholding her, Mr. Thorneycroft uttered a loud cry, and,
     springing to his feet, would have rushed towards her, but he was held back by the two masked
     attendants, who seized each arm, and detained him by main force.</p>
<p>“Ebba!” he cried—“Ebba!”</p>
<p>But she appeared wholly insensible to his cries, and remained in the same attitude, with her
     eyes turned away from him.</p>
<p>“What ails her?” cried the agonised father. “Ebba! Ebba!”</p>
<p>“Call louder,” said Rougemont, with a jeering laugh.</p>
<p>“Do you not know me? do you not hear me?” shrieked Mr. Thorneycroft.</p>
<p>Still the figure remained immovable.</p>
<p>“I told you you should see her,” replied Rougemont, in a taunting tone; “but she is beyond
     your reach.”</p>
<p>“Not so, not so!” cried Thorneycroft. “Come to me, Ebba!—come to your father. O Heaven! she
     hears me not! she heeds me not! Her senses are gone.”</p>
<p>“She is fast bound by a spell,” said Rougemont. “Take a last look of her. You will see her no
     more.”</p>
<p>And, stretching out his hand, the curtains slowly descended, and shrouded the figure from
     view.</p>
<p>Thorneycroft groaned aloud.</p>
<p>“Are you not content?” cried Rougemont. “Will you depart in peace, and swear never to come
     here more? If so, I will liberate you and your companions.”</p>
<p>“So far from complying with your request, I swear never to rest till I have rescued my child
     from you, accursed being!” cried Thorneycroft energetically.</p>
<p>“You have sealed your doom, then,” replied Rougemont. “But before you are yourself immured,
     you shall see how Auriol Darcy is circumstanced. Bring him along.”</p>
<p>And, followed by the attendants, who dragged Mr. Thorneycroft after him, he plunged into an
     opening on the right. A few steps brought him to the entrance of the cell. Touching the heavy
     iron door, it instantly swung open, and disclosed Auriol chained to a stone at the farther
     corner of the narrow chamber.</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken for some minutes, but the captives regarded each other piteously.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Thorneycroft,” cried Auriol, at length, “I beseech you forgive me. I have destroyed
     your daughter.”</p>
<p>“You!” exclaimed the iron-merchant in astonishment.</p>
<p>“It is true,” said Rougemont.</p>
<p>“I would have saved her if it had been possible!” cried Auriol. “I warned her that to love me
     would be fatal to her. I told her I was linked to an inexorable destiny, which would involve
     her in its meshes—but in vain.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” ejaculated Thorneycroft.</p>
<p>“You see you ought to blame him, not me,” said Rougemont, with a derisive laugh.</p>
<p>“I would have given my life, my soul, to preserve her, had it been possible!” cried
     Auriol.</p>
<p>“Horrors crowd so thick upon me that my brain reels,” cried Thorneycroft. “Merciless wretch!”
     he added, to Rougemont, “fiend—whatever you are, complete your work of ruin by my destruction.
     I have nothing left to tie me to life.”</p>
<p>“I would have the miserable live,” said Rougemont, with a diabolical laugh. “It is only the
     happy I seek to destroy. But you have to thank your own obstinacy for your present distress.
     Bid a lasting farewell to Auriol. You will see him no more.”</p>
<p>“Hold!” exclaimed Auriol. “A word before we part.”</p>
<p>“Ay, hold!” echoed a loud and imperious voice from the depths of the passage.</p>
<p>“Ha!—who speaks?” demanded Rougemont, a shade passing over his countenance.</p>
<p>“I, Gerard Paston!” exclaimed Reeks, stepping forward.</p>
<p>The crape was gone from his brow, and in its place was seen the handsome and resolute
     features of a man of middle life. He held a pistol in either hand.</p>
<p>“Is it you, Gerard Paston?” cried Auriol, regarding him; “the brother of Clara, my second
     victim!”</p>
<p>“It is,” replied the other. “Your deliverance is at hand, Auriol.”</p>
<p>“And you have dared to penetrate here, Gerard?” cried Rougemont, stamping the ground with
     rage. “Recollect, you are bound to me by the same ties as Auriol, and you shall share his
     fate.”</p>
<p>“I am not to be intimidated by threats,” replied Paston, with a scornful laugh. “You have
     employed your arts too long. Deliver up Auriol and this gentleman at once, or——” And he
     levelled the pistols at him.</p>
<p>“Fire!” cried Rougemont, drawing himself up to his towering height. “No earthly bullets can
     injure me.”</p>
<p>“Ve’ll try that!” cried Ginger, coming up at the moment behind Paston.</p>
<p>And he discharged a pistol, with a deliberate aim, at the breast of Rougemont. The latter
     remained erect, and apparently uninjured.</p>
<p>“You see how ineffectual your weapons are,” said Rougemont, with a derisive laugh.</p>
<p>“It must be the devil!” cried Ginger, running off.</p>
<p>“I will try mine,” said Paston.</p>
<p>But before he could draw the triggers, the pistols were wrested from his grasp by the two
     attendants, who had quitted Thorneycroft, and stolen upon him unperceived, and who next
     pinioned his arms.</p>
