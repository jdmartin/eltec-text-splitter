<head>Chapter 5</head>
<head>New Perplexities</head>
<p>For several hours deep sleep, occasioned by some potent medicaments, had bound up the senses
     of Auriol. On awaking, he found himself within a cell, the walls, the floor, and the ceiling of
     which were of solid stone masonry. In the midst of this chamber, and supporting the ponderous
     roof, stood a massive granite pillar, the capital of which was grotesquely ornamented with
     death’s-heads and cross-bones, and against this pillar leaned Auriol, with his left arm chained
     by heavy links of iron to a ring in the adjoining wall. Beside him stood a pitcher of water,
     and near him lay an antique-looking book, bound in black vellum. The dungeon in which he was
     confined was circular in form, with a coved roof, sustained by the pillar before mentioned, and
     was approached by a steep flight of steps rising from a doorway, placed some six feet below the
     level of the chamber, and surmounted by a pointed arch. A stream of light, descending from a
     narrow aperture in the roof, fell upon his wasted and haggard features. His dark-brown hair
     hung about his face in elf-locks, his beard was untrimmed, and a fixed and stony glare like
     that of insanity sat in his eye. He was seated on the ground—neither bench nor stool being
     allowed him—with his hand supporting his chin. His gaze was fixed upon vacancy—if that can he
     called vacancy which to him was filled with vivid images. His garb was not that of modern
     times, but consisted of a doublet and hose of rich material, wrought in the fashion of
     Elizabeth’s days.</p>
<p>After remaining for some time in this musing attitude, Auriol opened the old tome before him,
     and began to turn over its leaves. It was full of magical disquisitions and mysterious
     characters, and he found inscribed on one of its earlier pages a name which instantly riveted
     his attention. Having vainly sought some explanation of this name in the after contents of the
     book, he laid it aside, and became lost in meditation. His reverie ended, he heaved a deep
     sigh, and turned again to the open volume lying before him, and in doing so his eye rested for
     the first time on his habiliments. On beholding them he started, and held out his arm to
     examine his sleeve more narrowly. Satisfied that he was not deceived, he arose and examined
     himself from head to foot. He found himself, as has been stated, attired in the garb of a
     gentleman of Elizabeth’s time.</p>
<p>“What can this mean?” he cried. “Have I endured a long and troubled dream, during which I
     have fancied myself living through more than two centuries? O Heaven, that it may be so! Oh
     that the fearful crimes I suppose I have committed have only been enacted in a dream! Oh that
     my victims are imaginary! Oh that Ebba should only prove a lovely phantom of the night! And
     yet, I could almost wish the rest were real—so that she might exist. I cannot bear to think
     that she is nothing more than a vision. But it must be so—I have been dreaming—and what a dream
     it has been!—what strange glimpses it has afforded me into futurity! Methought I lived in the
     reigns of many sovereigns—beheld one of them carried to the block—saw revolutions convulse the
     kingdom—old dynasties shaken down, and new ones spring up. Fashions seem to me to have so
     changed, that I had clean forgotten the old ones; while my fellow-men scarcely appeared the
     same as heretofore. Can I be the same myself? Is this the dress I once wore? Let me seek for
     some proof.”</p>
<p>And thrusting his hand into his doublet, he drew forth some tablets, and hastily examined
     them. They bore his name, and contained some writing, and he exclaimed aloud with joy, “This is
     proof enough—I have been dreaming all this while.”</p>
<p>“The scheme works to a miracle,” muttered a personage stationed at the foot of the steps
     springing from the doorway, and who, though concealed from view himself, was watching the
     prisoner with a malignant and exulting gaze.</p>
<p>“And yet, why am I here?” pursued Auriol, looking around. “Ah! I see how it is,” he added,
     with a shudder; “I have been mad—perhaps am mad still. That will account for the strange
     delusion under which I have laboured.”</p>
<p>“I will act upon that hint,” muttered the listener.</p>
<p>“Of what use is memory,” continued Auriol musingly, “if things that are not, seem as if they
     were? If joys and sorrows which we have never endured are stamped upon the brain—if visions of
     scenes, and faces and events which we have never witnessed, never known, haunt us, as if they
     had once been familiar? But I am mad—mad!”</p>
<p>The listener laughed to himself.</p>
<p>“How else, if I were not mad, could I have believed that I had swallowed the fabled elixir
     vitæ? And yet, is it a fable? for I am puzzled still. Methinks I am old—old—old—though I feel
     young, and look young. All this is madness. Yet how clear and distinct it seems! I can call to
     mind events in Charles the Second’s time. Ha!—who told me of Charles the Second? How know I
     there was such a king? The reigning sovereign should be James, and yet I fancy it is George the
     Fourth. Oh! I am mad—clean mad!”</p>
<p>There was another pause, during which the listener indulged in a suppressed fit of
     laughter.</p>
<p>“Would I could look forth from this dungeon,” pursued Auriol, again breaking silence, “and
     satisfy myself of the truth or falsehood of my doubts by a view of the external world, for I am
     so perplexed in mind, that if I were not distracted already, they would be enough to drive me
     so. What dismal, terrible fancies have possessed me, and weigh upon me still—the compact with
     Rougemont—ha!”</p>
<p>“Now it comes,” cried the listener.</p>
<p>“Oh, that I could shake off the conviction that this were not so—that my soul, though heavily
     laden, might still be saved! Oh, that I dared to hope this!”</p>
<p>“I must interrupt him if he pursues this strain,” said the listener.</p>

<p>“Whether my crimes are real or imaginary—whether I snatched the cup of immortality from my
     grandsire’s dying lips—whether I signed a compact with the Fiend, and delivered him a victim on
     each tenth year—I cannot now know; but if it is so, I deeply, bitterly regret them, and would
     expiate my offences by a life of penance.”</p>
<p>At this moment Rougemont, attired in a dress similar to that of the prisoner, marched up the
     steps, and cried, “What ho, Auriol!—Auriol Darcy!”</p>
<p>“Who speaks?” demanded Auriol. “Ah! is it you, Fiend?”</p>
<p>“What, you are still in your old fancies,” rejoined Rougemont. “I thought the draught I gave
     you last night would have amended you.”</p>
<p>“Tell me who and what I am,” cried Auriol, stupefied with astonishment; “in what age I am
     living; and whether I am in my right mind or not?”</p>
<p>“For the first, you are called Auriol Darcy,” replied Rougemont; “for the second, you are
     living in the reign of his most Catholic Majesty James I. of England, and Sixth of Scotland;
     and for the third, I trust you will soon recover your reason.”</p>
<p>“Amazement!” cried Auriol, striking his brow with his clenched hand. “Then I <hi>am</hi>
     mad.”</p>
<p>“It’s plain your reason is returning, since you are conscious of your condition,” replied
     Rougemont; “but calm yourself, you have been subject to raging frenzies.”</p>
<p>“And I have been shut up here for safety?” demanded Auriol.</p>
<p>“Precisely,” observed the other.</p>
<p>“And you are——”</p>
<p>“Your keeper,” replied Rougemont.</p>
<p>“My God! what a brain mine must be!” cried Auriol. “Answer me one question—Is there such a
     person as Ebba Thorneycroft?”</p>
<p>“You have often raved about her,” replied Rougemont. “But she is a mere creature of the
     imagination.”</p>
<p>Auriol groaned, and sank against the wall.</p>
<p>“Since you have become so reasonable, you shall again go forth into the world,” said
     Rougemont; “but the first essay must be made at night, for fear of attracting observation. I
     will come to you again a few hours hence. Farewell for the present.”</p>
<p>And casting a sinister glance at his captive, he turned upon his heel, descended the steps,
     and quitted the cell.</p>
