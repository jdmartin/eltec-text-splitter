<p>Philip's marriage could not take place at once. No one said, but every one felt, that it
      must not be talked of tillthe end of Amabel's first year of widowhood; and in the meantime
      Philip remained at Hollywell, gaining strength every day, making more progress in one week,
      than he had done in six at St. Mildred's, finding that, as his strength returned, his mind and
      memory regained their tone, and he was as capable as ever of applying to business, and, above
      all, much settled and comforted by some long conversations with Mr. Ross.</p>
<p>Still he could not endure the thought of being at Redclyffe. The business connected with it
      was always performed with pain and dislike, and he shrank with suffering at every casual
      mention of his going thither. Mrs. Edmonstone began to wonder whether he could mean to linger
      at Hollywell all the summer, and Amabel had some fears that it would end in his neglecting
      Redclyffe, till a letter arrived from Lord Thorndale, saying that his brother, the member
      <pb n="308"/> for Moorworth, had long been thinking of giving up his seat, and latterly had
      only waited in hopes that the succession of Redclyffe might come to Philip Morville. Moorworth
      was entirely under the Thorndale and Morville interest, and Lord Thorndale wrote to propose
      that Philip should come forward at once, inviting him to Thorndale instead of going to his own
      empty house.</p>
<p>To be in parliament had been one of the favourite visions of Philip's youth, and for that
      very reason he hesitated, taking it as one of the strange fulfilments of his desires that had
      become punishments. He could not but feel that as this unhappy load of wealth had descended on
      him, he was bound to make it as beneficial as he could to others, and, not seeking for rest or
      luxury, to stand in the gap where every good man and true was needed. But still he dreaded his
      old love of distinction. He disliked a London life for Laura, and he thought that, precarious
      as his health had become, it might expose her to much anxiety, since he was determined that if
      he undertook it at all he would never be an idle member.</p>
<p>It ended in his referring the decision to Laura, who, disliking London, fearful for his
      health, eager for his glory, and reluctant to keep back such a champion from the battle, was
      much perplexed, only desirous to say what he wished, yet not able to make out what that might
      be. She carried her doubts to Charles and Amabel, who both pronounced that the thought of
      going to Redclyffe seemed far worse for him than any degree of employment—that occupation of
      the mind was the best thing for his spirits; and ended by recommending that Dr. Mayerne should
      be consulted.</p>
<p>He was of the same opinion. He said a man could hardly have two fevers following, and one of
      them upon the brain, without having reason to remember them. That his constitution had been
      seriously weakened, and there was an excitability of brain and
      <pb n="309"/> nerves which made care requisite; but depression of spirits was the chief thing
      to guard against, and a London life, provided he did not overwork himself, was better for him
      than solitude at Redclyffe.</p>
<p>Accordingly Philip went to Thorndale, and was returned for Moorworth without opposition.
      Markham sent his nephew to transact business with him at Thorndale, for he could not bear to
      meet him himself, and while there was any prospect of his coming to Redclyffe, walked about in
      paroxysms of grunting and ill-humour. The report that Mr. Morville was engaged to the other
      Miss Edmonstone did but render him more furious, for he regarded it as a sort of outrage to
      Lady Morville's feelings that a courtship should be carried on in the house with her. She was
      at present the object of all his devoted affection for the family, and he would not believe,
      but that she had been as much disappointed at the birth of her daughter, as he was himself. He
      would not say one word against Mr. Morville, but looked and growled enough to make Mr. Ashford
      afraid that the new squire would find him very troublesome.</p>
<p>The Ashfords were in the state of mind themselves to think that Mr. Morville ought to be
      everything excellent to make up for succeeding Sir Guy; but having a very high opinion of him
      to begin with, they were very sorry to find all Redclyffe set against him. In common with the
      parish, they were very anxious for the first report of his arrival, and at length he came.
      James Thorndale, as before, drove him thither, coming to the Ashfords while he was busy with
      Markham. He would not go up to the Park, he only went through some necessary business with
      Markham, and then walked down to the Cove, afterwards sitting for about ten minutes in Mrs.
      Ashford's drawing-room.</p>
<p>The result of the visit was that old James Robinson reported that the new squire took on as
      much about poor Sir Guy as any one could do, and turned as pale
      <pb n="310"/> as if he had been going into a swoon, when he spoke his name and gave Ben his
      message. And as to poor Ben, the old man said, he regularly did cry like a child, and small
      blame to him, to hear that Sir Guy had took thought of him at such a time and so far away; and
      he verily believed Ben could never take again to his bad ways, after such a message as
      that.</p>
<p>Markham was gruff with the Robinsons for some time after, and was even heard to mutter
      something about worshipping the rising sun, an act of idolatry of which he could not be
      accused, since it was in the most grudging manner that he allowed, that Mr. Morville's sole
      anxiety seemed to be to continue all Sir Guy had undertaken; while Mrs. Ashford, on the other
      hand, was much affected by the account her cousin James had been giving her of the grief that
      he had suffered at Sir Guy's death, his long illness, his loss of spirits, the reluctance he
      had shown to come here at all, and his present unconquerable dread of going to the Park.</p>
<p>He was soon after in London, where, as far as could be judged in such early days, he seemed
      likely to distinguish himself according to the fondest hopes that Margaret or Laura could ever
      have entertained. Laura was only afraid he was overworking himself, especially as, having at
      present little command of ready money, he lived in a small lodging, kept no horse, and did not
      enter into society; but she was reassured when he came to Hollywell for a day or two at
      Whitsuntide, not having indeed regained flesh or colour, but appearing quite well, in better
      spirits, and very eager about political affairs.</p>
<p>All would have been right that summer, but that, as Philip observed, the first evening of
      his arrival, Amabel was not looking as well as she had done at the time of the christening.
      She had, just after it, tried her strength and spirits too much, and had ever since been not
      exactly unwell, but sad and weary, more dejected
      <pb n="311"/> than ever before, unable to bear the sight of flowers or the sound of music, and
      evidently suffering much under the recurrence of the season, which had been that of her great
      happiness—the summer sunshine, the long evenings, the nightingales' songs. She was fatigued by
      the most trifling exertion, and seemed able to take interest in nothing but her baby, and a
      young widow in the village, who was in a decline; and though she was willing to do all that
      was asked of her, it was in a weary, melancholy manner, as if she had no peace but in being
      allowed to sit alone, drooping over her child.</p>
<p>From society she especially shrank, avoiding every chance of meeting visitors, and
      distressed and harassed when her father brought home some of his casual dinner guests, and was
      vexed not to see her come into the drawing-room in the evening. If she did make the effort of
      coming, to please him, she was so sure to be the worse for it, that her mother would keep her
      upstairs the next time, and try to prevent her from knowing that her father was put out, and
      declared it was nonsense to expect poor Amy to get up her spirits while she never saw a living
      soul, and only sat moping in the dressing-room.</p>
<p>A large dinner-party did not interfere with her, for even he could not expect her to appear
      at it; and one of these he gave during Philip's visit, for the pleasure of exhibiting such
      company as the M.P. for Moorworth.</p>
<p>After dinner, Charlotte told Mary Ross to go and see Amy. Not finding her in the
      dressing-room, she knocked at her own door. 'Come in,' answered the low soft voice; and in the
      window, overhung by the long shoots of the roses, Amabel's close cap and small head were seen
      against the deep-blue evening sky, as she sat in the summer twilight, her little one asleep in
      her cot.</p>
<p>'Thank you for coming,' said she. 'I thought you
      <pb n="312"/> would not mind sitting here with baby and me. I have sent Anne out walking.'</p>
<p>'How pretty she looks!' said Mary, stooping over the infant. 'Sleep is giving her quite a
      colour; and how fast she grows!'</p>
<p>'Poor little woman!' said Amy, sighing.</p>
<p>'Tired, Amy?' said Mary, sitting down, and taking up the little lambswool shoe, that Amy had
      been knitting.</p>
<p>'N—no thank you,' said Amy, with another sigh.</p>
<p>'I am afraid you are. You have been walking to Alice Lamsden's again.'</p>
<p>'I don't think that tires me. Indeed, I believe the truth is,' and her voice sounded
      especially sad in the subdued tone in which she spoke, that she might not disturb the child,
      'I am not so much tired with what I do, which is little enough, as of the long, long life that
      is before me.'</p>
<p>Mary's heart was full, but she did not show her though otherwise than by a look towards the
      babe.</p>
<p>'Yes, poor little darling,' said Amabel, 'I know there is double quantity to be done for
      her, but I am so sorry for her, when I think she must grow up without knowing him.'</p>
<p>'She has you though,' Mary could not help saying, as she felt that Amabel was superior to
      all save her husband.</p>
<p>Perhaps Amy did not hear; she went up to the cot, and went on:—'If he had but once seen her,
      if she had but had one kiss, one touch that I could tell her of by and by, it would not seem
      as if she was so very fatherless. Oh no, baby, I must wait, that you may know something about
      him; for no one else can tell you so well what he was, though I can't tell much!' She
      presently returned to her seat. 'No, I don't believe I really wish I was like poor Alice,'
      said she; 'I hope not, I am sure I don't, for her sake. But Mary, I never knew till I was well
      again, how much I had reckoned
      <pb n="313"/> on dying when she was born. I did not think I was wishing it, but it seemed
      likely, and I was obliged to arrange things in case of it. Then somehow, as he came back last
      spring, after that sad winter, it seemed as if this spring, though he would not come back to
      me, I might be going to him.'</p>
<p>'But then she comforted you.'</p>
<p>'Yes, that she did, my precious one; I was so glad of her, it was a sort of having him
      again, and so it is still sometimes, and will be more so, I dare say. I am very thankful for
      her, indeed I am; and I hope I am not repining, for it does not signify after all, in the end,
      if I am weary and lonely sometimes. I wish I was sure it was not wrong. I know I don't wish to
      alter things.'</p>
<p>'No, I am sure you don't.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' said Amabel, smiling, 'it is only the old, silly little Amy that does feel such a
      heart-aching and longing for one glance of his eye, or touch of his hand, or sound of his foot
      in the passage. Oh, Mary, the worst of all is to wake up, after dreaming I have heard his
      voice. There is nothing for it but to take our baby and hold her very tight.'</p>
<p>'Dearest Amy! But you are not blaming yourself for these feelings. It might be wrong to
      indulge them and foster them; but while you struggle with them, they can't in themselves be
      wrong.'</p>
<p>'I hope not,' said Amabel, pausing to think. 'Yes, I have 'the joy' at the bottom still; I
      know it is all quite right, and it came straight from heaven, as he said. I can get happy very
      often when I am by myself, or at church, with him; it is only when I miss his bright outside
      and can't think myself into the inner part, that it is so forlorn and dreary. I can do pretty
      well alone. Only I wish I could help being so trouble-some and disagreeable to everybody,'
      said Amy, concluding in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p>'My dear!' said Mary, almost laughing.</p>
<pb n="314"/>
<p>'It is so stupid of me to be always poorly, and making mamma anxious when there's nothing
      the matter with me. And I know I am a check on them down-stairs— papa, and Charlotte, and
      all—they are very kind and considerate, and yet'—she paused—'and it is a naughty feeling; but
      when I feel all those dear kind eyes watching me always, and wanting me to be happy, it is
      rather oppressive, especially when I can't; but if I try not to disappoint them, I do make
      such a bad hand of it, and am sure to break down afterwards, and that grieves mamma all the
      more.'</p>
<p>'It will be better when this time of year is over,' said Mary.</p>
<p>'Perhaps; yes. He always seemed to belong to summer days, and to come with them. Well, I
      suppose trials always come in a different shape from what one expects; for I used to think I
      could bear all the doom with him, but I did not know it would be without him, and yet that is
      the best. Oh, baby!'</p>
<p>'I should not have come to disturb her.'</p>
<p>'No—never mind; she never settles fairly to sleep till we are shut in by ourselves. Hush!
      hush, darling —No? Will nothing do but being taken up? Well, then, there! Come, and show your
      godmamma what a black fringe those little wakeful eyes are getting.'</p>
<p>And when Mary went down it was with the conviction that those black eye-lashes, too marked
      to be very pretty in so young a babe, were more of a comfort to Amabel than anything she could
      say.</p>
<p>The evening wore on, and at length Laura came into her sister's room. She looked fagged and
      harassed, the old face she used to wear in the time of disguise and secrecy. Amabel asked if
      it had been a tiresome party.</p>
<p>'Yes—no—I don't know. Just like others,' said Laura.</p>
<p>'You are tired at any rate,' said Amabel. 'You
      <pb n="315"/> took too long a ride with Philip. I saw you come in very late.'</p>
<p>'I am not in the least tired, thank you.'</p>
<p>'Then he is,' said Amabel. 'I hope he has not one of his headaches again.'</p>
<p>'No,' said Laura, still in a dissatisfied, uncomfortable tone.</p>
<p>'No? Dear Laura, I am sure there is something wrong;' and with a little more of her winning,
      pleading kindness, she drew from Laura that Philip had told her she idolized him. He had told
      her so very gently and kindly, but he had said she idolized him in a manner that was neither
      good for herself nor him; and he went on to blame himself for it, which was what she could not
      bear. It had been rankling in her mind ever since that he had found fault with her for loving
      him so well, and it had made her very unhappy. She <hi>could</hi> not love him less, and how
      should she please him? She had much rather he had blamed her than himself.</p>
<p>'I think I see what he means,' said Amy, thoughtfully. 'He has grown afraid of himself, and
      afraid of being admired now.'</p>
<p>'But how am I to help that, Amy?' said Laura, with tears in her eyes; 'he cannot help being
      the first, the very first of all with me'—</p>
<p>'No, no,' said Amy, quickly, 'not the very first, or what would you do if you were to
      be—like me? Don't turn away, dear Laura; I don't think I ever could bear this at all, if dear
      Guy had not kept it always before my eyes from the very first that we were to look to
      something else besides each other.'</p>
<p>'Of course, I meant the first earthly thing,' said Laura; but it was not heartfelt—she knew
      she ought, therefore she thought she did.</p>
<p>'And so,' proceeded Amy, 'I think if that other is first, it would make you have some
      standard of right besides himself; then you would be a stay and help to him. I think that is
      what he means.'</p>
<pb n="316"/>
<p>'Amy! let me ask you,' said Laura, a little entreatingly, yet as if she must needs put the
      question— 'surely, you never thought Guy had faults?'</p>
<p>Her colour deepened, 'Yes, Laura,' she answered, firmly. 'I could not have understood his
      repentance if I had not thought so. And, dear Laura, if you will forgive me for saying it, it
      would be much better for yourself and Philip, if you would see the truth.'</p>
<p>'I thought you forgave him,' murmured Laura.</p>
<p>'Oh, Laura! but does not that word 'forgive' imply something? I could not have done anything
      to comfort him that day, if I had not believed he had something to be comforted for. It can't
      be pleasant to him to see you think his repentance vain.'</p>
<p>'It is noble and great.'</p>
<p>'But if it was not real, it would be thrown away. Besides, dear Laura, do let me say this
      for once. If you would but understand that you let him lead you into what was not right, and
      be really sorry for that, and show mamma that you are, I do think it would all begin much more
      happily when you are married.'</p>
<p>'I could never have told, till I was obliged to betray myself,' said Laura. 'You know, Amy,
      it was no engagement. We never wrote to each other, we had but one walk; it was no business of
      his to speak till he could hope for papa's consent to our marriage. It would have been all
      confusion if he had told, and that would have been only that we had always loved each other
      with all our hearts, which every one knew before.'</p>
<p>'Yet, Laura, it was what preyed on him when he thought he was dying.'</p>
<p>'Because it was the only thing like a fault he could think of,' said Laura, excited by this
      shade of blame to defend him vehemently—'because his scruples are high and noble and
      generous.'</p>
<p>She spoke so eagerly, that the baby's voice again broke on the conversation, and she was
      obliged to go
      <pb n="317"/> away; but though her idolatry was complete, it did not seem to give full
      satisfaction or repose. As to Philip, though his love for her was unchanged, it now and then
      was felt, though not owned by him, that she was not fully a helpmeet, only a 'Self;' not such
      a 'Self' as he had left at St. Mildred's, but still reflecting on him his old character,
      instead of aiding him to a new one.</p>
