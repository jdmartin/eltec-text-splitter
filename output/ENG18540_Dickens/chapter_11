<head>CHAPTER XI NO WAY OUT</head>
<p>The Fairy palaces burst into illumination, before pale morning showed the monstrous
      serpents of smoke trailing themselves over Coketown.  A clattering of clogs upon the pavement;
      a rapid ringing of bells; and all the melancholy mad elephants, polished and oiled up for the
      day’s monotony, were at their heavy exercise again.</p>
<p>Stephen bent over his loom, quiet, watchful, and steady.  A special contrast, as every man
      was in the forest of looms where Stephen worked, to the crashing, smashing, tearing piece of
      mechanism at which he laboured.  Never fear, good people of an anxious turn of mind, that Art
      will consign Nature to oblivion.  Set anywhere, side by side, the work of <hi>God</hi> and the
      work of man; and the former, even though it be a troop of Hands of very small account, will
      gain in dignity from the comparison.</p>
<p>So many hundred Hands in this Mill; so many hundred horse Steam Power.  It is known, to the
      force of a single pound weight, what the engine will do; but, not all the calculators of the
      National Debt can tell me the capacity for good or evil, for love or hatred, for patriotism or
      discontent, for the decomposition of virtue into vice, or the reverse, at any single moment in
      the soul of one of these its quiet servants, with the composed faces and the regulated
      actions.  There is no mystery in it; there is an unfathomable mystery in the meanest of them,
      for ever. — Supposing we were to reverse our arithmetic for material objects, and to govern
      these awful unknown quantities by other means!</p>
<p>The day grew strong, and showed itself outside, even against the flaming lights within.  The
      lights were turned out, and the work went on.  The rain fell, and the Smoke-serpents,
      submissive to the curse of all that tribe, trailed themselves upon the earth.  In the
      waste-yard outside, the steam from the escape pipe, the litter of barrels and old iron, the
      shining heaps of coals, the ashes everywhere, were shrouded in a veil of mist and rain.</p>
<p>The work went on, until the noon-bell rang.  More clattering upon the pavements.  The looms,
      and wheels, and Hands all out of gear for an hour.</p>
<p>Stephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets, haggard and worn. 
      He turned from his own class and his own quarter, taking nothing but a little bread as he
      walked along, towards the hill on which his principal employer lived, in a red house with
      black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street door, up two white steps,
       <hi>Bounderby</hi> (in letters very like himself) upon a brazen plate, and a round brazen
      door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop.</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch.  So Stephen had expected.  Would his servant say that one of
      the Hands begged leave to speak to him?  Message in return, requiring name of such Hand. 
      Stephen Blackpool.  There was nothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool; yes, he might
      come in.</p>
<p>Stephen Blackpool in the parlour.  Mr. Bounderby (whom he just knew by sight), at lunch on
      chop and sherry.  Mrs. Sparsit netting at the fireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with one
      foot in a cotton stirrup.  It was a part, at once of Mrs. Sparsit’s dignity and service, not
      to lunch.  She supervised the meal officially, but implied that in her own stately person she
      considered lunch a weakness.</p>
<p>‘Now, Stephen,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘what’s the matter with <hi>you</hi>?’</p>
<p>Stephen made a bow.  Not a servile one — these Hands will never do that!  Lord bless you,
      sir, you’ll never catch them at that, if they have been with you twenty years! — and, as a
      complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit, tucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.</p>
<p>‘Now, you know,’ said Mr. Bounderby, taking some sherry, ‘we have never had any difficulty
      with you, and you have never been one of the unreasonable ones.  You don’t expect to be set up
      in a coach and six, and to be fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, as a good
      many of ’em do!’  Mr. Bounderby always represented this to be the sole, immediate, and direct
      object of any Hand who was not entirely satisfied; ‘and therefore I know already that you have
      not come here to make a complaint.  Now, you know, I am certain of that, beforehand.’</p>
<p>‘No, sir, sure I ha’ not coom for nowt o’ th’ kind.’</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby seemed agreeably surprised, notwithstanding his previous strong conviction. 
      ‘Very well,’ he returned.  ‘You’re a steady Hand, and I was not mistaken.  Now, let me hear
      what it’s all about.  As it’s not that, let me hear what it is.  What have you got to say? 
      Out with it, lad!’</p>
<p>Stephen happened to glance towards Mrs. Sparsit.  ‘I can go, Mr. Bounderby, if you wish it,’
      said that self-sacrificing lady, making a feint of taking her foot out of the stirrup.</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby stayed her, by holding a mouthful of chop in suspension before swallowing it,
      and putting out his left hand.  Then, withdrawing his hand and swallowing his mouthful of
      chop, he said to Stephen:</p>
<p>‘Now you know, this good lady is a born lady, a high lady.  You are not to suppose because
      she keeps my house for me, that she hasn’t been very high up the tree — ah, up at the top of
      the tree!  Now, if you have got anything to say that can’t be said before a born lady, this
      lady will leave the room.  If what you have got to say <hi>can</hi> be said before a born
      lady, this lady will stay where she is.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, I hope I never had nowt to say, not fitten for a born lady to year, sin’ I were born
      mysen’,’ was the reply, accompanied with a slight flush.</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ said Mr. Bounderby, pushing away his plate, and leaning back.  ‘Fire away!’</p>
<p>‘I ha’ coom,’ Stephen began, raising his eyes from the floor, after a moment’s
      consideration, ‘to ask yo yor advice.  I need ’t overmuch.  I were married on Eas’r Monday
      nineteen year sin, long and dree.  She were a young lass — pretty enow — wi’ good accounts of
      herseln.  Well!  She went bad — soon.  Not along of me.  Gonnows I were not a unkind husband
      to her.’</p>
<p>‘I have heard all this before,’ said Mr. Bounderby.  ‘She took to drinking, left off
      working, sold the furniture, pawned the clothes, and played old Gooseberry.’</p>
<p>‘I were patient wi’ her.’</p>
<p>(‘The more fool you, I think,’ said Mr. Bounderby, in confidence to his wine-glass.)</p>
<p>‘I were very patient wi’ her.  I tried to wean her fra ’t ower and ower agen.  I tried this,
      I tried that, I tried t’other.  I ha’ gone home, many’s the time, and found all vanished as I
      had in the world, and her without a sense left to bless herseln lying on bare ground.  I ha’
      dun ’t not once, not twice — twenty time!’</p>
<p>Every line in his face deepened as he said it, and put in its affecting evidence of the
      suffering he had undergone.</p>
<p>‘From bad to worse, from worse to worsen.  She left me.  She disgraced herseln everyways,
      bitter and bad.  She coom back, she coom back, she coom back.  What could I do t’ hinder her? 
      I ha’ walked the streets nights long, ere ever I’d go home.  I ha’ gone t’ th’ brigg, minded
      to fling myseln ower, and ha’ no more on’t.  I ha’ bore that much, that I were owd when I were
      young.’</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit, easily ambling along with her netting-needles, raised the Coriolanian eyebrows
      and shook her head, as much as to say, ‘The great know trouble as well as the small.  Please
      to turn your humble eye in My direction.’</p>
<p>‘I ha’ paid her to keep awa’ fra’ me.  These five year I ha’ paid her.  I ha’ gotten decent
      fewtrils about me agen.  I ha’ lived hard and sad, but not ashamed and fearfo’ a’ the minnits
      o’ my life.  Last night, I went home.  There she lay upon my har-stone!  There she is!’</p>
<p>In the strength of his misfortune, and the energy of his distress, he fired for the moment
      like a proud man.  In another moment, he stood as he had stood all the time — his usual stoop
      upon him; his pondering face addressed to Mr. Bounderby, with a curious expression on it, half
      shrewd, half perplexed, as if his mind were set upon unravelling something very difficult; his
      hat held tight in his left hand, which rested on his hip; his right arm, with a rugged
      propriety and force of action, very earnestly emphasizing what he said: not least so when it
      always paused, a little bent, but not withdrawn, as he paused.</p>
<p>‘I was acquainted with all this, you know,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘except the last clause,
      long ago.  It’s a bad job; that’s what it is.  You had better have been satisfied as you were,
      and not have got married.  However, it’s too late to say that.’</p>
<p>‘Was it an unequal marriage, sir, in point of years?’ asked Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
<p>‘You hear what this lady asks.  Was it an unequal marriage in point of years, this unlucky
      job of yours?’ said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
<p>‘Not e’en so.  I were one-and-twenty myseln; she were twenty nighbut.’</p>
<p>‘Indeed, sir?’ said Mrs. Sparsit to her Chief, with great placidity.  ‘I inferred, from its
      being so miserable a marriage, that it was probably an unequal one in point of years.’</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that had an odd
      sheepishness about it.  He fortified himself with a little more sherry.</p>
<p>‘Well?  Why don’t you go on?’ he then asked, turning rather irritably on Stephen
      Blackpool.</p>
<p>‘I ha’ coom to ask yo, sir, how I am to be ridded o’ this woman.’  Stephen infused a yet
      deeper gravity into the mixed expression of his attentive face.  Mrs. Sparsit uttered a gentle
      ejaculation, as having received a moral shock.</p>
<p>‘What do you mean?’ said Bounderby, getting up to lean his back against the chimney-piece. 
      ‘What are you talking about?  You took her for better for worse.’</p>
<p>‘I mun’ be ridden o’ her.  I cannot bear ’t nommore.  I ha’ lived under ’t so long, for that
      I ha’ had’n the pity and comforting words o’ th’ best lass living or dead.  Haply, but for
      her, I should ha’ gone battering mad.’</p>
<p>‘He wishes to be free, to marry the female of whom he speaks, I fear, sir,’ observed Mrs.
      Sparsit in an undertone, and much dejected by the immorality of the people.</p>
<p>‘I do.  The lady says what’s right.  I do.  I were a coming to ’t.  I ha’ read i’ th’ papers
      that great folk (fair faw ’em a’!  I wishes ’em no hurt!) are not bonded together for better
      for worst so fast, but that they can be set free fro’ <hi>their</hi> misfortnet marriages, an’
      marry ower agen.  When they dunnot agree, for that their tempers is ill-sorted, they has rooms
      o’ one kind an’ another in their houses, above a bit, and they can live asunders.  We fok ha’
      only one room, and we can’t.  When that won’t do, they ha’ gowd an’ other cash, an’ they can
      say “This for yo’ an’ that for me,” an’ they can go their separate ways.  We can’t.  Spite o’
      all that, they can be set free for smaller wrongs than mine.  So, I mun be ridden o’ this
      woman, and I want t’ know how?’</p>
<p>‘No how,’ returned Mr. Bounderby.</p>
<p>‘If I do her any hurt, sir, there’s a law to punish me?’</p>
<p>‘Of course there is.’</p>
<p>‘If I flee from her, there’s a law to punish me?’</p>
<p>‘Of course there is.’</p>
<p>‘If I marry t’oother dear lass, there’s a law to punish me?’</p>
<p>‘Of course there is.’</p>
<p>‘If I was to live wi’ her an’ not marry her — saying such a thing could be, which it never
      could or would, an’ her so good — there’s a law to punish me, in every innocent child
      belonging to me?’</p>
<p>‘Of course there is.’</p>
<p>‘Now, a’ God’s name,’ said Stephen Blackpool, ‘show me the law to help me!’</p>
<p>‘Hem!  There’s a sanctity in this relation of life,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘and — and — it
      must be kept up.’</p>
<p>‘No no, dunnot say that, sir.  ’Tan’t kep’ up that way.  Not that way.  ’Tis kep’ down that
      way.  I’m a weaver, I were in a fact’ry when a chilt, but I ha’ gotten een to see wi’ and eern
      to year wi’.  I read in th’ papers every ’Sizes, every Sessions — and you read too — I know
      it! — with dismay — how th’ supposed unpossibility o’ ever getting unchained from one another,
      at any price, on any terms, brings blood upon this land, and brings many common married fok to
      battle, murder, and sudden death.  Let us ha’ this, right understood.  Mine’s a grievous case,
      an’ I want — if yo will be so good — t’ know the law that helps me.’</p>
<p>‘Now, I tell you what!’ said Mr. Bounderby, putting his hands in his pockets.  ‘There
       <hi>is</hi> such a law.’</p>
<p>Stephen, subsiding into his quiet manner, and never wandering in his attention, gave a
      nod.</p>
<p>‘But it’s not for you at all.  It costs money.  It costs a mint of money.’</p>
<p>‘How much might that be?’ Stephen calmly asked.</p>
<p>‘Why, you’d have to go to Doctors’ Commons with a suit, and you’d have to go to a court of
      Common Law with a suit, and you’d have to go to the House of Lords with a suit, and you’d have
      to get an Act of Parliament to enable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if it was a
      case of very plain sailing), I suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound,’ said Mr.
      Bounderby.  ‘Perhaps twice the money.’</p>
<p>‘There’s no other law?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly not.’</p>
<p>‘Why then, sir,’ said Stephen, turning white, and motioning with that right hand of his, as
      if he gave everything to the four winds, ‘’<hi>tis</hi> a muddle.  ’Tis just a muddle
      a’toogether, an’ the sooner I am dead, the better.’</p>
<p>(Mrs. Sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the people.)</p>
<p>‘Pooh, pooh!  Don’t you talk nonsense, my good fellow,’ said Mr. Bounderby, ‘about things
      you don’t understand; and don’t you call the Institutions of your country a muddle, or you’ll
      get yourself into a real muddle one of these fine mornings.  The institutions of your country
      are not your piece-work, and the only thing you have got to do, is, to mind your piece-work. 
      You didn’t take your wife
      <pb n=" 59"/>for fast and for loose; but for better for worse.  If she has turned out worse —
      why, all we have got to say is, she might have turned out better.’</p>
<p>‘’Tis a muddle,’ said Stephen, shaking his head as he moved to the door.  ‘’Tis a’ a
      muddle!’</p>
<p>‘Now, I’ll tell you what!’ Mr. Bounderby resumed, as a valedictory address.  ‘With what I
      shall call your unhallowed opinions, you have been quite shocking this lady: who, as I have
      already told you, is a born lady, and who, as I have not already told you, has had her own
      marriage misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds — tens of Thousands of
      Pounds!’ (he repeated it with great relish).  ‘Now, you have always been a steady Hand
      hitherto; but my opinion is, and so I tell you plainly, that you are turning into the wrong
      road.  You have been listening to some mischievous stranger or other — they’re always about —
      and the best thing you can do is, to come out of that.  Now you know;’ here his countenance
      expressed marvellous acuteness; ‘I can see as far into a grindstone as another man; farther
      than a good many, perhaps, because I had my nose well kept to it when I was young.  I see
      traces of the turtle soup, and venison, and gold spoon in this.  Yes, I do!’ cried Mr.
      Bounderby, shaking his head with obstinate cunning.  ‘By the Lord Harry, I do!’</p>
<p>With a very different shake of the head and deep sigh, Stephen said, ‘Thank you, sir, I wish
      you good day.’  So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling at his own portrait on the wall, as if he
      were going to explode himself into it; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her
      stirrup, looking quite cast down by the popular vices.</p>
