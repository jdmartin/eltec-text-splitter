<head>CHAP. XVII. SIR ABRAHAM HAPHAZARD.</head>
<p>Mr. Harding was shown into a comfortable inner
                                        sitting-room, looking more like a gentleman's book-room than
                                        a lawyer's chambers, and there waited for Sir Abraham. Nor
                                        was he kept waiting long: in ten or fifteen minutes he heard
                                        a clatter of voices speaking quickly in the passage, and
                                        then the attorney-general entered.</p>
<p>"Very sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Warden," said Sir Abraham,
                                        shaking hands with him; "and sorry, too, to name so
                                        disagreeable an hour; but your notice was short, and as you
                                        said to-day, I named the very earliest hour that was not
                                        disposed of."</p>
<p>Mr. Harding assured him that he was aware that it was he that
                                        should apologise.</p>
<p>Sir Abraham was a tall thin man, with hair prematurely grey, but
                                        bearing no other sign of age; he had a slight stoop, in his
                                        neck rather than his back, acquired by his constant habit of
                                        leaning forward <pb n="272"/> as he addressed his various
                                        audiences. He might be fifty years old, and would have
                                        looked young for his age, had not constant work hardened his
                                        features, and given him the appearance of a machine with a
                                        mind. His face was full of intellect, but devoid of natural
                                        expression. You would say he was a man to use, and then have
                                        done with; a man to be sought for on great emergencies, but
                                        ill adapted for ordinary services; a man whom you would ask
                                        to defend your property, but to whom you would be sorry to
                                        confide your love. He was bright as a diamond, and as
                                        cutting, and also as unimpressionable. He knew every one
                                        whom to know was an honour, but he was without a friend; he
                                        wanted none, however, and knew not the meaning of the word
                                        in other than its parliamentary sense. A friend! Had he not
                                        always been sufficient to himself, and now, at fifty, was it
                                        likely that he should trust another? He was married, indeed,
                                        and had children, but what time had he for the soft idleness
                                        of conjugal felicity? His working days or term times were
                                        occupied from his time of rising to the late hour at which
                                        he went to rest, and even his vacations were more full of
                                        labour than the busiest days of other men. He never
                                        quarrelled with his wife, but he never talked to her, —he
                                        never had time to talk, he was so taken up with <pb n="273"/> speaking. She, poor lady, was not unhappy; she had all
                                        that money could give her, she would probably live to be a
                                        peeress, and she really thought Sir Abraham the best of
                                        husbands.</p>
<p>Sir Abraham was a man of wit, and sparkled among the brightest at
                                        the dinner-tables of political grandees; indeed, he always
                                        sparkled; whether in society, in the House of Commons, or
                                        the courts of law, coruscations flew from him; glittering
                                        sparkles, as from hot steel, but no heat; no cold heart was
                                        ever cheered by warmth from him, no unhappy soul ever
                                        dropped a portion of its burden at his door.</p>
<p>With him success alone was praiseworthy, and he knew none so
                                        successful as himself. No one had thrust him forward; no
                                        powerful friends had pushed him along on his road to power.
                                        No, he was attorney-general, and would, in all human
                                        probability, be lord chancellor by sheer dint of his own
                                        industry and his own talent. Who else in all the world rose
                                        so high with so little help? A premier, indeed! Who had ever
                                        been premier without mighty friends? An archbishop! Yes, the
                                        son or grandson of a great noble, or else, probably, his
                                        tutor. But he, Sir Abraham, had had no mighty lord at his
                                        back; his father had been a country apothecary, his mother a
                                        farmer's daughter. Why should he respect <pb n="274"/> any
                                        but himself? And so he glitters along through the world, the
                                        brightest among the bright; and when his glitter is gone,
                                        and he is gathered to his fathers, no eye will be dim with a
                                        tear, no heart will mourn for its lost friend.</p>
<p>"And so, Mr. Warden," said Sir Abraham, "all our trouble about
                                        this law-suit is at an end."</p>
<p>Mr. Harding said he hoped so, but he did n't at all understand
                                        what Sir Abraham meant. Sir Abraham, with all his sharpness,
                                        could not have looked into his heart and read his
                                        intentions.</p>
<p>"All over. You need trouble yourself no further about it; of
                                        course they must pay the costs, and the absolute expense to
                                        you and Dr. Grantly will be trifling—that is, compared with
                                        what it might have been if it had been continued."</p>
<p>"I fear I don't quite understand you, Sir Abraham."</p>
<p>"Don't you know that their attorneys have noticed us that they
                                        have withdrawn the suit?"</p>
<p>Mr. Harding explained to the lawyer that he knew nothing of this,
                                        although he had heard in a round-about way that such an
                                        intention had been talked of; and he also at length
                                        succeeded in making Sir Abraham understand that even this
                                        did not satisfy him. The attorney-general stood up, put his
                                        hands into his breeches pockets, and raised his eyebrows, as
                                                <pb n="275"/> Mr. Harding proceeded to detail the
                                        grievance from which he now wished to rid himself.</p>
<p>"I know I have no right to trouble you personally with this
                                        matter, but as it is of most vital importance to me, as all
                                        my happiness is concerned in it, I thought I might venture
                                        to seek your own advice."</p>
<p>Sir Abraham bowed, and declared his clients were entitled to the
                                        best advice he could give them; particularly a client so
                                        respectable in every way as the Warden of Barchester
                                        Hospital.</p>
<p>"A spoken word, Sir Abraham, is often of more value than volumes
                                        of written advice. The truth is, I am ill satisfied with
                                        this matter as it stands at present. I do see—I cannot help
                                        seeing, that the affairs of the hospital are not arranged
                                        according to the will of the founder."</p>
<p>"None of such institutions are, Mr. Harding, nor can they be; the
                                        altered circumstances in which we live do not admit of
                                        it."</p>
<p>"Quite true—that is quite true; but I can't see that those
                                        altered circumstances give me a right to eight hundred a
                                        year. I don't know whether I ever read John Hiram's will,
                                        but were I to read it now I could not understand it. What I
                                        want you, Sir Abraham, to tell me, is this—am I, as warden,
                                        legally and distinctly entitled to the proceeds of the <pb n="276"/> property, after the due maintenance of the
                                        twelve bedesmen?"</p>
<p>Sir Abraham declared that he could n't exactly say in so many
                                        words that Mr. Harding was legally entitled to, etc.,
                                        etc., &amp;c., and ended in expressing a strong opinion
                                        that it would be madness to raise any further question on
                                        the matter, as the suit was to be, —nay, was, abandoned.</p>
<p>Mr. Harding, seated in his chair, began to play a slow tune on an
                                        imaginary violoncello.</p>
<p>"Nay, my dear sir," continued the attorney-general, "there is no
                                        further ground for any question; I don't see that you have
                                        the power of raising it."</p>
<p>"I can resign," said Mr. Harding, slowly playing away with his
                                        right hand, as though the bow were beneath the chair in
                                        which he was sitting.</p>
<p>"What! throw it up altogether?" said the attorney-general, gazing
                                        with utter astonishment at his client.</p>
<p>"Did you see those articles in the Jupiter?" said Mr. Harding,
                                        piteously, appealing to the sympathy of the lawyer.</p>
<p>Sir Abraham said he had seen them. This poor little clergyman,
                                        cowed into such an act of extreme weakness by a newspaper
                                        article, was to Sir Abraham <pb n="277"/> so contemptible an
                                        object, that he hardly knew how to talk to him as to a
                                        rational being.</p>
<p>"Had n't you better wait," said he, "till Dr. Grantly is in town
                                        with you? Would n't it be better to postpone any serious
                                        step till you can consult with him?"</p>
<p>Mr. Harding declared vehemently that he could not wait, and Sir
                                        Abraham began seriously to doubt his sanity.</p>
<p>"Of course," said the latter, "if you have private means
                                        sufficient for your wants, and if this—"</p>
<p>"I have n't a sixpence, Sir Abraham," said the warden.</p>
<p>"God bless me! Why, Mr. Harding, how do you mean to live?"</p>
<p>Mr. Harding proceeded to explain to the man of law that he meant
                                        to keep his precentorship,—that was eighty pounds a year;
                                        and, also, that he meant to fall back upon his own little
                                        living of Crabtree, which was another eighty pounds. That,
                                        to be sure, the duties of the two were hardly compatible;
                                        but perhaps he might effect an exchange. And then,
                                        recollecting that the attorney-general would hardly care to
                                        hear how the service of a cathedral church is divided among
                                        the minor canons, stopped short in his explanations.</p>
<pb n="278"/>
<p>Sir Abraham listened in pitying wonder. "I really think, Mr.
                                        Harding, you had better wait for the archdeacon. This is a
                                        most serious step: one for which, in my opinion, there is
                                        not the slightest necessity; and, as you have done me the
                                        honour of asking my advice, I must implore you to do nothing
                                        without the approval of your friends. A man is never the
                                        best judge of his own position."</p>
<p>"A man is the best judge of what he feels himself. I'd sooner beg
                                        my bread till my death, than read such another article as
                                        those two that have appeared, and feel, as I do, that the
                                        writer has truth on his side."</p>
<p>"Have you not a daughter, Mr. Harding,—an unmarried
                                        daughter?"</p>
<p>"I have," said he, now standing also, but still playing away on
                                        his fiddle with his hand behind his back. "I have, Sir
                                        Abraham; and she and I are completely agreed on this
                                        subject."</p>
<p>"Pray excuse me, Mr. Harding, if what I say seems impertinent:
                                        but surely it is you that should be prudent on her behalf.
                                        She is young, and does not know the meaning of living on an
                                        income of a hundred and fifty pounds a year. On her account
                                        give up this idea. Believe me, it is sheer Quixotism."</p>
<p>The warden walked away to the window, and <pb n="279"/> then back
                                        to his chair; and then, irresolute what to say, took another
                                        turn to the window. The attorney-general was really
                                        extremely patient, but he was beginning to think that the
                                        interview had been long enough.</p>
<p>"But if this income be not justly mine, what if she and I have
                                        both to beg?" said the warden at last, sharply, and in a
                                        voice so different from that he had hitherto used, that Sir
                                        Abraham was startled. "If so, it would be better to
                                        beg."</p>
<p>"My dear sir, nobody now questions its justness."</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir Abraham, one does question it,—the most important of
                                        all witnesses against me,—I question it myself. My God knows
                                        whether or no I love my daughter; but I would sooner that
                                        she and I should both beg, than that she should live in
                                        comfort on money which is truly the property of the poor. It
                                        may seem strange to you, Sir Abraham, it is strange to
                                        myself, that I should have been ten years in that happy
                                        home, and not have thought of these things, till they were
                                        so roughly dinned into my ears. I cannot boast of my
                                        conscience, when it required the violence of a public
                                        newspaper to awaken it; but, now that it is awake, I must
                                        obey it. When I came here I did not know that the suit was
                                        withdrawn by Mr. Bold, and my object was to beg you <pb n="280"/> to abandon my defence. As there is no
                                        action, there can be no defence; but it is, at any rate, as
                                        well that you should know that, from to-morrow, I shall
                                        cease to be the warden of the hospital. My friends and I
                                        differ on this subject, Sir Abraham, and that adds much to
                                        my sorrow: but it cannot be helped." And, as he finished
                                        what he had to say, he played up such a tune as never before
                                        had graced the chambers of any attorney-general. He was
                                        standing up, gallantly fronting Sir Abraham, and his right
                                        arm passed with bold and rapid sweeps before him, as though
                                        he were embracing some huge instrument, which allowed him to
                                        stand thus erect; and with the fingers of his left hand he
                                        stopped, with preternatural velocity, a multitude of
                                        strings, which ranged from the top of his collar to the
                                        bottom of the lappet of his coat. Sir Abraham listened and
                                        looked in wonder. As he had never before seen Mr. Harding,
                                        the meaning of these wild gesticulations was lost upon him;
                                        but he perceived that the gentleman who had a few minutes
                                        since been so subdued as to be unable to speak without
                                        hesitation, was now impassioned—nay, almost violent.</p>
<p>"You'll sleep on this, Mr. Harding, and to-morrow—"</p>
<p>"I have done more than sleep upon it," said the <pb n="281"/>
                                        warden; "I have laid awake upon it, and that night after
                                        night. I found I could not sleep upon it; now I hope to do
                                        so."</p>
<p>The attorney-general had no answer to make to this; so he
                                        expressed a quiet hope that whatever settlement was finally
                                        made would be satisfactory; and Mr. Harding withdrew,
                                        thanking the great man for his kind attention.</p>
<p>Mr. Harding was sufficiently satisfied with the interview to feel
                                        a glow of comfort as he descended into the small old square
                                        of Lincoln's Inn. It was a calm, bright, beautiful night,
                                        and by the light of the moon, even the chapel of Lincoln's
                                        Inn, and the sombre row of chambers, which surround the
                                        quadrangle, looked well. He stood still a moment to collect
                                        his thoughts, and reflect on what he had done, and was about
                                        to do. He knew that the attorney-general regarded him as
                                        little better than a fool, but that he did not mind; he and
                                        the attorney-general had not much in common between them; he
                                        knew also that others, whom he did care about, would think
                                        so too; but Eleanor, he was sure, would exult in what he had
                                        done, and the bishop, he trusted, would sympathise with
                                        him.</p>
<p>In the meantime he had to meet the archdeacon, and so he walked
                                        slowly down Chancery Lane and <pb n="282"/> along Fleet
                                        Street, feeling sure that his work for the night was not yet
                                        over. When he reached the hotel he rang the bell quietly,
                                        and with a palpitating heart; he almost longed to escape
                                        round the corner, and delay the coming storm by a further
                                        walk round St. Paul's Churchyard, but he heard the slow
                                        creaking shoes of the old waiter approaching, and he stood
                                        his ground manfully.</p>
