<head>CHAP. XVIII. THE WARDEN IS VERY OBSTINATE.</head>
<p>" <hi>Dr. Grantly</hi> is here, sir," greeted his ears before the
                                        door was well open, "and Mrs. Grantly; they have a
                                        sitting-room above, and are waiting up for you."</p>
<p>There was something in the tone of the man's voice which seemed
                                        to indicate that even he looked upon the warden as a runaway
                                        school-boy, just recaptured by his guardian, and that he
                                        pitied the culprit, though he could not but be horrified at
                                        the crime.</p>
<p>The warden endeavoured to appear unconcerned, as he said, "Oh,
                                        indeed! I'll go upstairs at once;" but he failed signally:
                                        there was, perhaps, a ray of comfort in the presence of his
                                        married daughter; that is to say, of comparative comfort,
                                        seeing that his son-in-law was there: but how much would he
                                        have preferred that they should both have been safe at
                                        Plumstead Episcopi! However, upstairs he went, the waiter
                                        slowly preceding him; and on the door <pb n="284"/> being
                                        opened the archdeacon was discovered standing in the middle
                                        of the room, erect, indeed, as usual, but oh! how sorrowful!
                                        and on a dingy sofa behind him reclined his patient
                                        wife.</p>
<p>"Papa, I thought you were never coming back," said the lady;
                                        "it's twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear," said the warden. "The attorney-general named ten
                                        for my meeting; to be sure ten is late, but what could I do,
                                        you know? Great men will have their own way."</p>
<p>And he gave his daughter a kiss, and shook hands with the doctor,
                                        and again tried to look unconcerned.</p>
<p>"And you have absolutely been with the attorney-general?" asked
                                        the archdeacon.</p>
<p>Mr. Harding signified that he had.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, how unfortunate!" And the archdeacon raised his
                                        huge hands in the manner in which his friends are so
                                        accustomed to see him express disapprobation and
                                        astonishment. "What will Sir Abraham think of it? Did you
                                        not know that it is not customary for clients to go direct
                                        to their counsel?"</p>
<p>"Is n't it?" asked the warden, innocently. "Well, at any rate,
                                        I've done it now. Sir Abraham did n't seem to think it so
                                        very strange."</p>
<pb n="285"/>
<p>The archdeacon gave sigh that would have moved a man-of-war.</p>
<p>"But, papa, what did you say to Sir Abraham?" asked the lady.</p>
<p>"I asked him, my dear, to explain John Hiram's will to me. He
                                        could n't explain it in the only way which would have
                                        satisfied me, and so I resigned the wardenship."</p>
<p>"Resigned it!" said the archdeacon, in a solemn voice, sad and
                                        low, but yet sufficiently audible; a sort of whisper that
                                        Macready would have envied, and the galleries have applauded
                                        with a couple of rounds. "Resigned it! Good heavens!" and
                                        the dignitary of the church sank back horrified into a
                                        horse-hair arm chair.</p>
<p>"At least I told Sir Abraham that I would resign; and of course I
                                        must now do so."</p>
<p>"Not at all," said the archdeacon, catching a ray of hope.
                                        "Nothing that you say in such a way to your own counsel can
                                        be in any way binding on you; of course you were there to
                                        ask his advice. I'm sure, Sir Abraham did not advise any
                                        such step."</p>
<p>Mr. Harding could not say that he had.</p>
<p>"I am sure he disadvised you from it," continued the reverend
                                        cross-examiner.</p>
<pb n="286"/>
<p>Mr. Harding could not deny this.</p>
<p>"I'm sure Sir Abraham must have advised you to consult your
                                        friends."</p>
<p>To this proposition also Mr. Harding was obliged to assent.</p>
<p>"Then your threat of resignation amounts to nothing, and we are
                                        just where we were before."</p>
<p>Mr. Harding was now standing on the rug, moving uneasily from one
                                        foot to the other. He made no distinct answer to the
                                        archdeacon's last proposition, for his mind was chiefly
                                        engaged on thinking how he could escape to bed. That his
                                        resignation was a thing finally fixed on, a fact all but
                                        completed, was not in his mind a matter of any doubt; he
                                        knew his own weakness; he knew how prone he was to be led;
                                        but he was not weak enough to give way now, to go back from
                                        the position to which his conscience had driven him, after
                                        having purposely come to London to declare his
                                        determination: he did not in the least doubt his resolution,
                                        but he greatly doubted his power of defending it against his
                                        son-in-law.</p>
<p>"You must be very tired, Susan," said he: "would n't you like to
                                        go to bed?"</p>
<p>But Susan didn't want to go till her husband went—she had an idea
                                        that her papa might be <pb n="287"/> bullied if she were
                                        away: she was n't tired at all, or at least she said so.</p>
<p>The archdeacon was pacing the room, expressing, by certain
                                        noddles of his head, his opinion of the utter fatuity of his
                                        father-in-law.</p>
<p>"Why," at last he said,—and angels might have blushed at the
                                        rebuke expressed in his tone and emphasis —"Why did you go
                                        off from Barchester so suddenly? Why did you take such a
                                        step without giving us notice, after what had passed at the
                                        palace?"</p>
<p>The warden hung his head, and made no reply: he could not
                                        condescend to say that he had not intended to give his
                                        son-in-law the slip; and as he had not the courage to avow
                                        it, he said nothing.</p>
<p>"Papa has been to much for you," said the lady.</p>
<p>The archdeacon took another turn, and again ejaculated, "Good
                                        heavens!" this time in a very low whisper, but still
                                        audible.</p>
<p>"I think I'll go to bed," said the warden, taking up a side
                                        candle.</p>
<p>"At any rate you'll promise me to take no further step without
                                        consultation," said the archdeacon. Mr. Harding made no
                                        answer, but slowly proceeded to light his candle. "Of
                                        course," continued <pb n="288"/> the other, "such a
                                        declaration as that you made to Sir Abraham means nothing.
                                        Come, warden, promise me this. The whole affair, you see, is
                                        already settled, and that with very little trouble or
                                        expense. Bold has been compelled to abandon his action, and
                                        all you have to do is to remain quiet at the hospital." Mr.
                                        Harding still made no reply, but looked meekly into his
                                        son-in-law's face. The archdeacon thought he knew his
                                        father-in-law, but he was mistaken; he thought that he had
                                        already talked over a vacillating man to resign his promise.
                                        "Come," said he, "promise Susan to give up this idea of
                                        resigning the wardenship."</p>
<p>The warden looked at his daughter, thinking probably at the
                                        moment that if Eleanor were contented with him, he need not
                                        so much regard his other child, and said, "I am sure Susan
                                        will not ask me to break my word, or to do what I know to be
                                        wrong."</p>
<p>"Papa," said she, "it would be madness in you to throw up your
                                        preferment. What are you to live on?"</p>
<p>"God, that feeds the young ravens, will take care of me also,"
                                        said Mr. Harding, with a smile, as though afraid of giving
                                        offence by making his reference to scripture too solemn.</p>
<pb n="289"/>
<p>"Pish!" said the archdeacon, turning away rapidly; "if the ravens
                                        persisted in refusing the food prepared for them, they would
                                        n't be fed." A clergyman generally dislikes to be met in
                                        argument by any scriptural quotation; he feels as affronted
                                        as a doctor does, when recommended by an old woman to take
                                        some favourite dose, or as a lawyer when an unprofessional
                                        man attempts to put him down by a quibble.</p>
<p>"I shall have the living of Crabtree," modestly suggested the
                                        warden.</p>
<p>"Eighty pounds a year!" sneered the archdeacon.</p>
<p>"And the precentorship," said the father-in-law.</p>
<p>"It goes with the wardenship," said the son-in-law." Mr. Harding
                                        was prepared to argue this point, and began to do so, but
                                        Dr. Grantly stopped him. "My dear warden," said he, "this is
                                        all nonsense. Eighty pounds or a hundred and sixty makes
                                        very little difference. You can't live on it—you can't ruin
                                        Eleanor's prospects for ever. In point of fact, you can't
                                        resign; the bishop would n't accept it; the whole thing is
                                        settled. What I now want to do is to prevent any
                                        inconvenient tittle tattle,— any more newspaper
                                        articles."</p>
<p>"That's what I want, too," said the warden.</p>
<pb n="290"/>
<p>"And to prevent that," continued the other, "we must n't let any
                                        talk of resignation get abroad."</p>
<p>"But I shall resign," said the warden, very, very meekly.</p>
<p>"Good heavens! Susan, my dear, what can I say to him?"</p>
<p>"But, papa," said Mrs. Grantly, getting up, and putting her arm
                                        through that of her father, "what is Eleanor to do if you
                                        throw away your income?"</p>
<p>A hot tear stood in each of the warden's eyes as he looked round
                                        upon his married daughter. Why should one sister who was so
                                        rich predict poverty for another? some such idea as this was
                                        on his mind, but he gave no utterance to it. Then he thought
                                        of the pelican feeding its young with blood from its own
                                        breast, but he gave no utterance to that either; and then of
                                        Eleanor waiting for him at home, waiting to congratulate him
                                        on the end of all his trouble.</p>
<p>"Think of Eleanor, papa," said Mrs. Grantly.</p>
<p>"I do think of her," said her father.</p>
<p>"And you will not do this rash thing?" The lady was really moved
                                        beyond her usual calm composure.</p>
<p>"It can never be rash to do right," said he. "I shall certainly
                                        resign this wardenship."</p>
<p>"Then, Mr. Harding, there is nothing before you <pb n="291"/> but
                                        ruin," said the archdeacon, now moved beyond all endurance.
                                        "Ruin both for you and Eleanor. How do you mean to pay the
                                        monstrous expenses of this action?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Grantly suggested that, as the action was abandoned, the
                                        costs would not be heavy.</p>
<p>"Indeed they will, my dear," continued he. "One cannot have the
                                        attorney-general up at twelve o'clock at night for
                                        nothing;—but of course your father has not thought of
                                        this."</p>
<p>"I will sell my furniture," said the warden.</p>
<p>"Furniture!" ejaculated the other, with a most powerful
                                        sneer.</p>
<p>"Come, archdeacon," said the lady, "we needn't mind that at
                                        present. You know you never expected papa to pay the
                                        costs."</p>
<p>"Such absurdity is enough to provoke Job," said the archdeacon,
                                        marching quickly up and down the room. "Your father is like
                                        a child. Eight hundred pounds a-year!—eight hundred and
                                        eighty with the house—with nothing to do. The very place for
                                        him. And to throw that up because some scoundrel writes an
                                        article in a newspaper! Well—I have done my duty. If he
                                        chooses to ruin his child I cannot help if;" and he stood
                                        still at the fireplace, and looked at <pb n="292"/> himself

<p>"Good night, papa," said the lady.</p>
<p>And so the warden retired; but, as he closed the door behind him,
                                        he heard the well-known ejaculation —slower, lower, more
                                        solemn, more ponderous than ever—"Good heavens!"</p>
