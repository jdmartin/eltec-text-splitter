<head>CHAP IV. HIRAM'S BEDESMEN.</head>
<p>The parties most interested in the movement which is
                                        about to set Barchester by the ears, were not the foremost
                                        to discuss the merit of the question, as is often the case;
                                        but when the bishop, the archdeacon, the warden, the
                                        steward, and Messrs. Cox and Cummins, were all busy with the
                                        matter, each in his own way, it is not to be supposed that
                                        Hiram's bedesmen themselves were altogether passive
                                        spectators. Finney, the attorney, had been among them,
                                        asking sly questions, and raising immoderate hopes, creating
                                        a party hostile to the warden, and establishing a corps in
                                        the enemy's camp, as he figuratively calls it to himself.
                                        Poor old men; whoever may be righted or wronged by this
                                        inquiry, they at any rate will assuredly be only injured; to
                                        them it can only be an unmixed evil. How can their lot be
                                        improved? all their wants are supplied; every comfort is
                                        administered; they have warm houses, good clothes, plentiful
                                        diet, and rest after a life of labour; <pb n="52"/> and
                                        above all, that treasure so inestimable in declining years,
                                        a true and kind friend to listen to their sorrows, watch
                                        over their sickness, and administer comfort as regards this
                                        world, and the world to come!</p>
<p>John Bold sometimes thinks of this, when he is talking loudly of
                                        the rights of the bedesmen, whom he has taken under his
                                        protection; but he quiets the suggestion within his breast
                                        with the high-sounding name of justice—"fiat justitia; ruat
                                        coelum." These old men should, by rights, have one hundred
                                        pounds a year instead of one shilling and sixpence a day,
                                        and the warden should have two hundred or three hundred
                                        pounds instead of eight hundred pounds. What is unjust must
                                        be wrong; what is wrong should be righted; and if he
                                        declined the task, who else would do it?</p>
<p>"Each one of you is clearly entitled to one hundred pounds a year
                                        by common law:" such had been the important whisper made by
                                        Finney into the ears of Abel Handy, and by him retailed to
                                        his eleven brethren.</p>
<p>Too much must not be expected from the flesh and blood even of
                                        John Hiram's bedesmen, and the positive promise of one
                                        hundred a year to each of the twelve old men, had its way
                                        with most of them. The <pb n="53"/> great Bunce was not to
                                        be wiled away, and was upheld in his orthodoxy by two
                                        adherents. Abel Handy, who was the leader of the aspirants
                                        after wealth, had, alas, a stronger following. No less than
                                        five of the twelve soon believed that his views were just,
                                        making with their leader a moiety of the hospital. The other
                                        three, volatile unstable minds, vacillated between the two
                                        chieftains, now led away by the hope of gold, now anxious to
                                        propitiate the powers that still existed.</p>
<p>It had been proposed to address a petition to the bishop as
                                        visiter, praying his lordship to see justice done to the
                                        legal recipients of John Hiram's Charity, and to send copies
                                        of this petition and of the reply it would elicit, to all
                                        the leading London papers, and thereby to obtain notoriety
                                        for the subject. This it was thought would pave the way for
                                        ulterior legal proceedings. It would have been a great thing
                                        to have had the signatures and marks of all the twelve
                                        injured legatees; but this was impossible: Bunce would have
                                        cut his hand off sooner than have signed it. It was then
                                        suggested by Finney that if even eleven could be induced to
                                        sanction the document, the one obstinate recusant might have
                                        been represented as unfit to judge on such a question,—in
                                        fact, as being <hi>non compos mentis</hi> ,—and the petition
                                        would <pb n="54"/> have been taken as representing the
                                        feeling of the men. But this could not be done: Bunce's
                                        friends were as firm as himself, and as yet only six crosses
                                        adorned the document. It was the more provoking, as Bunce
                                        himself could write his name legibly, and one of those three
                                        doubting souls had for years boasted of like power, and
                                        possessed, indeed, a Bible, in which he was proud to show
                                        his name written by himself some thirty years ago—"Job
                                        Skulpit;" but it was thought that Job Skulpit, having
                                        forgotten his scholarship, on that account recoiled from the
                                        petition, and that the other doubters would follow as he led
                                        them. A petition signed by half the hospital would have but
                                        a poor effect.</p>
<p>It was in Skulpit's room that the petition was now lying, waiting
                                        such additional signatures as Abel Handy, by his eloquence,
                                        could obtain for it. The six marks it bore were duly
                                        attested, thus:— Abel his + mark Handy, Greg y his + mark
                                        Moody, Mathew his + mark Spriggs, etc., and places were
                                        duly designated in pencil for those brethren who were now
                                        expected to join: for Skulpit alone was left a spot on which
                                        his genuine signature might be written in fair clerklike
                                        style. Handy had brought in the document, and spread it out
                                        on the small deal table, and was now <pb n="55"/> standing
                                        by it persuasive and eager. Moody had followed with an
                                        inkhorn, carefully left behind by Finney; and Spriggs bore
                                        aloft, as though it were a sword, a well-worn ink-black pen,
                                        which from time to time he endeavoured to thrust into
                                        Skulpit's unwilling hand.</p>
<p>With the learned man were his two abettors in indecision, William
                                        Gazy and Jonathan Crumple. If ever the petition were to be
                                        forwarded, now was the time, so said Mr. Finney; and great
                                        was the anxiety on the part of those whose one hundred
                                        pounds a year, as they believed, mainly depended on the
                                        document in question.</p>
<p>"To be kept out of all that money," as the avaricious Moody had
                                        muttered to his friend Handy, "by an old fool saying that he
                                        can write his own name like his betters."</p>
<p>"Well Job," said Handy, trying to impart to his own sour,
                                        ill-omened visage a smile of approbation, in which he
                                        greatly failed; "so you're ready now, Mr. Finney says;
                                        here's the place, d'ye see,"—and he put his huge brown
                                        finger down on the dirty paper,— "name or mark, it's all
                                        one. Come along, old boy; if so be we're to have the
                                        spending of this money, why the sooner the better—that's my
                                        maxim."</p>
<p>"To be sure," said Moody; "we a'n't none of us <pb n="56"/> so
                                        young: we can't stay waiting for old Catgut no longer."</p>
<p>It was thus these miscreants named our excellent friend: the
                                        nickname he could easily have forgiven, but the allusion to
                                        the divine source of all his melodious joy would have
                                        irritated even him. Let us hope he never knew the
                                        insult.</p>
<p>"Only think, old Billy Gazy," said Spriggs, who rejoiced in
                                        greater youth than his brethren, but having fallen into a
                                        fire when drunk, had had one eye burnt out, one cheek burnt
                                        through, and one arm nearly burnt off, and who, therefore,
                                        in regard to personal appearance, was not the most
                                        prepossessing of men; "a hundred a year, and all to spend:
                                        only think, old Billy Gazy;" and he gave a hideous grin that
                                        showed off his misfortunes to their full extent.</p>
<p>Old Billy Gazy was not alive to much enthusiasm —even these
                                        golden prospects did not arouse him to do more than rub his
                                        poor old bleared eyes with the cuff of his bedesman's gown,
                                        and gently mutter; 'he did n't know, not he; he did n't
                                        know.'</p>
<p>"But you'd know, Jonathan," continued Spriggs, turning to the
                                        other friend of Skulpit's, who was sitting on a stool by the
                                        table, gazing vacantly at the petition. Jonathan Crumple was
                                        a meek, mild <pb n="57"/> man, who had known better days;
                                        his means had been wasted by bad children, who had made his
                                        life wretched till he had been received into the hospital,
                                        of which he had not long been a member. Since that day he
                                        had known neither sorrow nor trouble, and this attempt to
                                        fill him with new hopes was, indeed, a cruelty.</p>
<p>"A hundred a year's a nice thing, for sartain, neighbour
                                        Spriggs," said he: "I once had nigh to that myself, but it
                                        did n't do me no good." And he gave a low sigh, as he
                                        thought of the children of his own loins who had robbed
                                        him.</p>
<p>"And shall have again, Joe," said Handy; "and will have some one
                                        to keep it right and tight for you this time."</p>
<p>Crumple sighed again—he had learned the impotency of worldly
                                        wealth, and would have been satisfied, if left untempted, to
                                        have remained happy with one and sixpence a day.</p>
<p>"Come, Skulpit," repeated Handy, getting impatient, "you're not
                                        going to go along with old Bunce in helping that parson to
                                        rob us all. Take the pen, man, and right yourself. Well," he
                                        added, seeing that Skulpit still doubted, "to see a man as
                                        is afraid to stand by hisself, is, to my thinking, the
                                        meanest thing as is."</p>
<pb n="58"/>
<p>"Sink them all for parsons, says I," growled Moody; "hungry
                                        beggars, as never thinks their bellies full till they have
                                        robbed all and every thing."</p>
<p>"Who's to harm you, man?" argued Spriggs: "let them look never so
                                        black at you, they can't get you put out when you're once
                                        in—no, not old Catgut, with Calves to help him!" I am sorry
                                        to say the archdeacon himself was designated by this
                                        scurrilous allusion to his nether person.</p>
<p>"A hundred a year to win, and nothing to lose," continued Handy,
                                        "my eyes!—Well, how a man's to doubt about sich a bit of
                                        cheese as that passes me— but some men is timorous—some men
                                        is born with no pluck in them—some men is cowed at the very
                                        first sight of a gen'leman's coat and waistcoat."</p>
<p>Oh, Mr. Harding, if you had but taken the archdeacon's advice in
                                        that disputed case, when Joe Mutters was this ungrateful
                                        demagogue's rival candidate!</p>
<p>"Afraid of a parson," growled Moody, with a look of ineffable
                                        scorn; "I tell ye what I'd be afraid of— I'd be afraid of
                                        not getting nothing from 'em but just what I could take by
                                        might and right—that's the most I'd be afraid on of any
                                        parson of 'em all."</p>
<p>"But," said Skulpit, apologetically, "Mr. Harding's <pb n="59"/>
                                        not so bad—he did give us twopence a day, didn't he
                                        now?"</p>
<p>"Twopence a day!" exclaimed Spriggs with scorn, opening awfully
                                        the red cavern of his lost eye.</p>
<p>"Twopence a day!" muttered Moody with a curse; "sink his
                                        twopence!"</p>
<p>"Twopence a day!" exclaimed Handy; "and I'm to go, hat in hand,
                                        and thank a chap for twopence a day, when he owes me a
                                        hundred pounds a year: no, thank ye; that may do for you,
                                        but it won't for me. Come, I say Skulpit, are you a going to
                                        put your mark to this here paper, or are you not?"</p>
<p>Skulpit looked round in wretched indecision to his two friends.
                                        "What d'ye think, Billy Gazy?" said he.</p>
<p>But Billy Gazy couldn't think: he made a noise like the bleating
                                        of an old sheep, which was intended to express the agony of
                                        his doubt, and again muttered that 'he did 'nt know.'</p>
<p>"Take hold, you old cripple," said Handy, thrusting the pen into
                                        poor Billy's hand: "there, so—ugh! you old fool, you've been
                                        and smeared it all—there —that'll do for you,—that's as good
                                        as the best name as ever was written:" and a big blotch of
                                        ink was presumed to represent Billy Gazy's acquiescence.</p>
<p>"Now Jonathan," said Handy, turning to Crumple.</p>
<pb n="60"/>
<p>"A hundred a year's a nice thing, for sartain," again argued
                                        Crumple. "Well, neighbour Skulpit, how's it to be?"</p>
<p>"Oh, please yourself," said Skulpit; "please yourself, and you'll
                                        please me."</p>
<p>The pen was thrust into Crumple's hand, and a faint, wandering,
                                        meaningless sign was made, betokening such sanction and
                                        authority as Jonathan Crumple was able to convey.</p>
<p>"Come Joe," said Handy, softened by success, "don't let 'em have
                                        to say that old Bunce has a man like you under his thumb—a
                                        man that always holds his head in the hospital as high as
                                        Bunce himself, though you're never axed to drink wine, and
                                        sneak, and tell lies about your betters, as he does."</p>
<p>Skulpit held the pen, and made little flourishes with it in the
                                        air, but still hesitated.</p>
<p>"And if you'll be said by me," continued Handy, "you'll not-write
                                        your name to it at all, but just put your mark like the
                                        others,"—the cloud began to clear from Skulpit's brow:—"we
                                        all know you can do it if you like, but maybe you would n't
                                        like to seem uppish, you know."</p>
<p>"Well, the mark would be best," said Skulpit: "one name and the
                                        rest marks, wouldn't look well, would it?"</p>
<pb n="61"/>
<p>"The worst in the world," said Handy; "there— there:" and
                                        stooping over the petition, the learned clerk made a huge
                                        cross on the place left for his signature.</p>
<p>"That's the game," said Handy, triumphantly pocketing the
                                        petition; "we're all in a boat now, that is, the nine of us;
                                        and as for old Bunce, and his cronies, they may—" But as he
                                        was hobbling off to the door, with a crutch on one side and
                                        a stick on the other, he was met by Bunce himself.</p>
<p>"Well, Handy, and what may old Bunce do?" said the grey-haired,
                                        upright senior.</p>
<p>Handy muttered something, and was departing; but he was stopped
                                        in the doorway by the huge frame of the new comer.</p>
<p>"You've been doing no good here, Abel Handy," said he, "'t is
                                        plain to see that; and 'tisn't much good, I'm thinking, you
                                        ever do."</p>
<p>"I mind my own business, Master Bunce," muttered the other, "and
                                        do you do the same. It an't nothing to you what I does—and
                                        your spying and poking here won't do no good nor yet no
                                        harm."</p>
<p>"I suppose then, Joe," continued Bunce, not noticing his
                                        opponent, "if the truth must out, you've stuck your name to
                                        that petition of theirs at last."</p>
<pb n="62"/>
<p>Skulpit looked as though he were about to sink into nothing with
                                        shame.</p>
<p>"What is it to you what he signs?" said Handy. "I suppose if we
                                        all wants to ax for our own, we need n't ax leave of you
                                        first, Mr. Bunce, big a man as you are: and as to your
                                        sneaking in here, into Job's room when he's busy, and where
                                        you're not wanted—"</p>
<p>"I've knowed Job Skulpit, man and boy, sixty years," said Bunce,
                                        looking at the man of whom he spoke, "and that's ever since
                                        the day he was born. I knowed the mother that bore him, when
                                        she and I were little wee things, picking daisies together
                                        in the close yonder; and I've lived under the same roof with
                                        him more nor ten years; and after that I may come into his
                                        room without axing leave, and yet no sneaking neither."</p>
<p>"So you can, Mr. Bunce," said Skulpit; "so you can, any hour, day
                                        or night."</p>
<p>"And I'm free also to tell him my mind," continued Bunce, looking
                                        at the one man and addressing the other; "and I tell him now
                                        that he's done a foolish and a wrong thing: he's turned his
                                        back upon one who is his best friend; and is playing the
                                        game of others, who care nothing for him, whether he be poor
                                        or rich, well or ill, alive or dead. A hundred <pb n="63"/>
                                        a year? Are the lot of you soft enough to think that if a
                                        hundred a year be to be given, it's the likes of you that
                                        will get it?"—and he pointed to Billy Gazy, Spriggs, and
                                        Crumple. "Did any of us ever do anything worth half the
                                        money? Was it to make gentlemen of us we were brought in
                                        here, when all the world turned against us, and we could't
                                        longer earn our daily bread? A n't you all as rich in your
                                        ways as he in his?"—and the orator pointed to the side on
                                        which the warden lived. "A n't you getting all you hoped
                                        for, ay, and more than you hoped for? Would't each of you
                                        have given the dearest limb of his body to secure that which
                                        now makes you so unthankful?"</p>
<p>"We wants what John Hiram left us," said Handy; "we wants what's
                                        ourn by law; it don't matter what we expected; what's ourn
                                        by law should be ourn, and by goles we'll have it."</p>
<p>"Law!" said Bunce, with all the scorn he knew how to
                                        command,—"law! Did ye ever know a poor man yet was the
                                        better for law, or for a lawyer? Will Mr. Finney ever be as
                                        good to you, Job, as that man has been? Will he see to you
                                        when you're sick, and comfort you when you're wretched? Will
                                        he—"</p>
<p>"No, nor give you port wine, old boy, on cold <pb n="64"/> winter
                                        nights! he won't do that, will he?" asked Handy: and
                                        laughing at the severity of his own wit, he and his
                                        colleagues retired, carrying with them, however, the now
                                        powerful petition.</p>
<p>There is no help for spilt milk; and Mr. Bunce could only retire
                                        to his own room, disgusted at the frailty of human
                                        nature—Job Skulpit scratched his head—Jonathan Crumple again
                                        remarked, that, 'for sartain, sure a hundred a year was very
                                        nice'— and Billy Gazy again rubbed his eyes, and lowly
                                        muttered that 'he did n't know.'</p>
