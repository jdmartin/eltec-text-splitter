<head>CHAP. VI. THE WARDEN'S TEA PARTY.</head>
<p>After much painful doubting, on one thing only could Mr.
                                        Harding resolve. He determined that at any rate he would
                                        take no offence, and that he would make this question no
                                        cause of quarrel either with Bold or with the bedesmen. In
                                        furtherance of this resolution, he himself wrote a note to
                                        Mr. Bold, the same afternoon, inviting him to meet a few
                                        friends and hear some music on an evening named in the next
                                        week. Had not this little party been promised to Eleanor, in
                                        his present state of mind he would probably have avoided
                                        such gaiety; but the promise had been given, the invitations
                                        were to be written, and when Eleanor consulted her father on
                                        the subject, she was not ill pleased to hear him say, "Oh, I
                                        was thinking of Bold, so I took it into my head to write to
                                        him myself, but you must write to his sister."</p>
<p>Mary Bold was older than her brother, and, at the time of our
                                        story, was just over thirty. She was not an unattractive
                                        young woman, though by no <pb n="86"/> means beautiful. Her
                                        great merit was the kindliness of her disposition. She was
                                        not very clever, nor very animated, nor had she apparently
                                        the energy of her brother; but she was guided by a high
                                        principle of right and wrong; her temper was sweet, and her
                                        faults were fewer in number than her virtues. Those who
                                        casually met Mary Bold thought little of her; but those who
                                        knew her well loved her well, and the longer they knew her
                                        the more they loved her. Among those who were fondest of her
                                        was Eleanor Harding, and though Eleanor had never openly
                                        talked to her of her brother, each understood the other's
                                        feelings about him. The brother and sister were sitting
                                        together when the two notes were brought in.</p>
<p>"How odd," said Mary, "that they should send two notes. Well, if
                                        Mr. Harding becomes fashionable, the world is going to
                                        change."</p>
<p>Her brother understood immediately the nature and intention of
                                        the peace offering; but it was not so easy for him to behave
                                        well in the matter, as it was for Mr. Harding. It is much
                                        less difficult for the sufferer to be generous than for the
                                        oppressor. John Bold felt that he could not go to the
                                        warden's party: he never loved Eleanor better than he did
                                        now; he had never so strongly felt how anxious he was to
                                        make her his wife as now, when so many <pb n="87"/>
                                        obstacles to his doing so appeared in view. Yet here was her
                                        father himself, as it were clearing away those very
                                        obstacles, and still he felt that he could not go to the
                                        house any more as an open friend.</p>
<p>As he sat thinking of these things with the note in his hand, his
                                        sister was waiting for his decision.</p>
<p>"Well," said she, "I suppose we must write separate answers, and
                                        both say we shall be very happy."</p>
<p>"You 'll go, of course, Mary," said he; to which she readily
                                        assented. "I cannot," he continued, looking serious and
                                        gloomy; "I wish I could, with all my heart."</p>
<p>"And why not, John?" said she. She had as yet heard nothing of
                                        the new-found abuse which her brother was about to reform;
                                        at least, nothing which connected it with her brother's
                                        name.</p>
<p>He sat thinking for awhile till he determined that it would be
                                        best to tell her at once what it was that he was about: it
                                        must be done sooner or later.</p>
<p>"I fear I cannot go to Mr. Harding's house any more as a friend,
                                        just at present."</p>
<p>"Oh, John! Why not? Ah, you've quarrelled with Eleanor!"</p>
<p>"No, indeed," said he; "I've no quarrel with her as yet."</p>
<pb n="88"/>
<p>"What is it, John?" said she, looking at him with an anxious,
                                        loving face; for she knew well how much of his heart was
                                        there in that house which he said he could no longer
                                        enter.</p>
<p>"Why," said he at last, "I've taken up the case of these twelve
                                        old men of Hiram's Hospital, and of course that brings me
                                        into contact with Mr. Harding. I may have to oppose him,
                                        interfere with him, perhaps injure him."</p>
<p>Mary looked at him steadily for some time before she committed
                                        herself to reply, and then merely asked him what he meant to
                                        do for the old men.</p>
<p>"Why, it's a long story, and I don't know that I can make you
                                        understand it. John Hiram made a will, and left his property
                                        in charity for certain poor old men, and the proceeds,
                                        instead of going to the benefit of these men, goes chiefly
                                        into the pocket of the warden, and the bishop's
                                        steward."</p>
<p>"And you mean to take away from Mr. Harding his share of it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what I mean yet. I mean to inquire about it. I mean
                                        to see who is entitled to this property. I mean to see, if I
                                        can, that justice be done to the poor of the city of
                                        Barchester generally, who are, in fact, the legatees under
                                        the will. I mean, in short, to put the matter right, if I
                                        can."</p>
<pb n="89"/>
<p>"And why are you to do this, John?"</p>
<p>"You might ask the same question of anybody else," said he; "and
                                        according to that, the duty of righting these poor men would
                                        belong to nobody. If we are to act on that principle, the
                                        weak are never to be protected, injustice is never to be
                                        opposed, and no one is to struggle for the poor!" And Bold
                                        began to comfort himself in the warmth of his own
                                        virtue.</p>
<p>"But is there no one to do this but you, who have known Mr.
                                        Harding so long? Surely, John, as a friend, as a young
                                        friend, so much younger than Mr. Harding—"</p>
<p>"That's woman's logic, all over, Mary. What has age to do with
                                        it? Another man might plead that he was too old; and as to
                                        his friendship, if the thing itself be right, private
                                        motives should never be allowed to interfere. Because I
                                        esteem Mr. Harding, is that a reason that I should neglect a
                                        duty which I owe to these old men? or should I give up a
                                        work which my conscience tells me is a good one, because I
                                        regret the loss of his society?"</p>
<p>"And Eleanor, John?" said the sister, looking timidly into her
                                        brother's face.</p>
<p>"Eleanor, that is, Miss Harding, if she thinks fit— that is, if
                                        her father—or rather, if she—or, indeed, he, —if they find
                                        it necessary—but there is no necessity <pb n="90"/> now to
                                        talk about Eleanor Harding; but this I will say, that if she
                                        has the kind of spirit for which I give her credit, she will
                                        not condemn me for doing what I think to be a duty." And
                                        Bold consoled himself with the consolation of a Roman.</p>
<p>Mary sat silent for awhile, till at last her brother reminded her
                                        that the notes must be answered, and she got up, and placed
                                        her desk before her, took out her pen and her paper, wrote
                                        on it slowly,—</p>
<p>"Pakenham Villas, Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>"My dear Eleanor,</p>
<p>"I—" and then stopped, and looked at her brother.</p>
<p>"Well, Marry, why don't you write it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, John," said she, "dear John, pray think better of this."</p>
<p>"Think better of what?" said he.</p>
<p>"Of this about the hospital,—of all this about Mr. Harding,—of
                                        what you say about those old men. Nothing can call upon
                                        you,—no duty can require you to set yourself against your
                                        oldest, your best friend. Oh, John, think of Eleanor; you'll
                                        break her heart and your own."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, Mary; Miss Harding's heart is as safe as yours."</p>
<pb n="91"/>
<p>"Pray, pray, for my sake, John, give it up. You know how dearly
                                        you love her." And she came and knelt before him on the rug.
                                        "Pray give it up. You are going to make yourself, and her,
                                        and her father miserable: you are going to make us all
                                        miserable. And for what? For a dream of justice. You will
                                        never make those twelve men happier than they now are."</p>
<p>"You don't understand it, my dear girl," said he, smoothing her
                                        hair with his hand.</p>
<p>"I do understand it, John. I understand that this is a chimera—a
                                        dream that you have got. I know well that no duty can
                                        require you to do this mad— this suicidal thing. I know you
                                        love Eleanor Harding with all your heart, and I tell you now
                                        that she loves you as well. If there was a plain, a positive
                                        duty before you, I would be the last to bid you neglect it
                                        for any woman's love; but this—oh, think again, before you
                                        do anything to make it necessary that you and Mr. Harding
                                        should be at variance." He did not answer, as she knelt
                                        there, leaning on his knees, but by his face she thought
                                        that he was inclined to yield. "At any rate let me say that
                                        you will go to this party. At any rate do not break with
                                        them while your mind is in doubt." And she got up, hoping to
                                        conclude her note in the way she desired.</p>
<p>"My mind is not in doubt," at last he said, rising; <pb n="92"/>
                                        "I could never respect myself again, were I to give way now,
                                        because Eleanor Harding is beautiful. I do love her: I would
                                        give a hand to hear her tell me what you have said, speaking
                                        on her behalf; but I cannot for her sake go back from the
                                        task which I have commenced. I hope she may hereafter
                                        acknowledge and respect my motives, but I cannot now go as a
                                        guest to her father's house." And the Barchester Brutus went
                                        out to fortify his own resolution by meditations on his own
                                        virtue.</p>
<p>Poor Mary Bold sat down, and sadly finished her note, saying that
                                        she would herself attend the party, but that her brother was
                                        unavoidably prevented from doing so. I fear that she did not
                                        admire as she should have done the self-devotion of his
                                        singular virtue.</p>
<p>The party went off as such parties do: there were fat old ladies,
                                        in fine silk dresses, and slim young ladies, in gauzy muslin
                                        frocks; old gentlemen stood up with their backs to the empty
                                        fire-place, looking by no means so comfortable as they would
                                        have done in their own armchairs at home; and young
                                        gentlemen, rather stiff about the neck, clustered near the
                                        door, not as yet sufficiently in courage to attack the
                                        muslin frocks, who awaited the battle, drawn up in a
                                        semicircular <pb n="93"/> array. The warden endeavoured to
                                        induce a charge, but failed signally, not having the tact of
                                        a general: his daughter did what she could to comfort the
                                        forces under her command, who took in refreshing rations of
                                        cake and tea, and patiently looked for the coming
                                        engagement: but she herself, Eleanor, had no spirit for the
                                        work; the only enemy whose lance she cared to encounter was
                                        not there, and she and others were somewhat dull.</p>
<p>Loud above all voices was heard the clear sonorous tones of the
                                        archdeacon as he dilated to brother parsons of the danger of
                                        the church, of the fearful rumours of mad reforms even at
                                        Oxford, and of the damnable heresies of Dr. Whiston.</p>
<p>Soon, however, sweeter sounds began timidly to make themselves
                                        audible. Little movements were made in a quarter, notable
                                        for round stools and music stands. Wax candles were arranged
                                        in sconces, big books were brought from hidden recesses, and
                                        the work of the evening commenced.</p>
<p>How often were those pegs twisted and retwisted before our friend
                                        found that he had twisted them enough; how many discordant
                                        scrapes gave promise of the coming harmony! How much the
                                        muslin fluttered and crumpled before Eleanor and another
                                        nymph were duly seated at the piano; how closely <pb n="94"/> did that tall Apollo pack himself against the wall, with
                                        his flute, long as himself, extending high over the heads of
                                        his pretty neighbours; into how small a corner crept that
                                        round and florid little minor canon, and there with skill
                                        amazing found room to tune his accustomed fiddle!</p>
<p>And now the crash begins: away they go in full flow of harmony
                                        together—up hill and down dale— now louder and louder, then
                                        lower and lower: now loud, as though stirring the battle;
                                        then low, as though mourning the slain. In all, through all,
                                        and above all, is heard the violoncello. Ah, not for nothing
                                        were those pegs so twisted and retwisted— listen, listen!
                                        Now alone that saddest of instruments tells its touching
                                        tale. Silent, and in awe, stand fiddle, flute, and piano, to
                                        hear the sorrows of their wailing brother. 'Tis but for a
                                        moment: before the melancholy of those low notes has been
                                        fully realised, again comes the full force of all the
                                        band—down go the pedals, away rush twenty fingers scouring
                                        over the bass notes with all the impetus of passion. Apollo
                                        blows till his stiff neckcloth is no better than a rope, and
                                        the minor canon works both arms till he falls in a syncope
                                        of exhaustion against the wall.</p>
<p>How comes it that now, when all should be silent, <pb n="95"/>
                                        when courtesy, if not taste, should make men listen, —how is
                                        it at this moment the black-coated corps leave their retreat
                                        and begin skirmishing? One by one they creep forth, and fire
                                        off little guns timidly, and without precision. Ah, my men,
                                        efforts such as these will take no cities, even though the
                                        enemy should be never so open to assault. At length a more
                                        deadly artillery is brought to bear; slowly, but with
                                        effect, the advance is made; the muslin ranks are broken,
                                        and fall into confusion; the formidable array of chairs
                                        gives way; the battle is no longer between opposing
                                        regiments, but hand to hand, and foot to foot with single
                                        combatants, as in the glorious days of old, when fighting
                                        was really noble. In corners, and under the shadow of
                                        curtains, behind sofas and half hidden by doors, in retiring
                                        windows, and sheltered by hanging tapestry, are blows given
                                        and returned, fatal, incurable, dealing death.</p>
<p>Apart from this another combat arises, more sober and more
                                        serious. The archdeacon is engaged against two prebendaries,
                                        a pursy full-blown rector assisting him, in all the perils
                                        and all the enjoyments of short whist. With solemn energy do
                                        they watch the shuffled pack, and, all-expectant, eye the
                                        coming trump. With what anxious nicety do they arrange their
                                        cards, jealous of each other's eyes! Why is <pb n="96"/>
                                        that lean doctor so slow—cadaverous man with hollow jaw and
                                        sunken eye, ill beseeming the richness of his mother church!
                                        Ah, why so slow, thou meagre doctor? See how the archdeacon,
                                        speechless in his agony, deposits on the board his cards,
                                        and looks to heaven or to the ceiling for support. Hark, how
                                        he sighs, as with thumbs in his waistcoat pocket he seems to
                                        signify that the end of such torment is not yet even nigh at
                                        hand! Vain is the hope, if hope there be, to disturb that
                                        meagre doctor. With care precise he places every card,
                                        weighs well the value of each mighty ace, each guarded king,
                                        and comfort-giving queen; speculates on knave and ten,
                                        counts all his suits, and sets his price upon the whole. At
                                        length a card is led, and quick three others fall upon the
                                        board. The little doctor leads again, while with lustrous
                                        eye his partner absorbs the trick. Now thrice has this been
                                        done—thrice has constant fortune favoured the brace of
                                        prebendaries, ere the archdeacon rouses himself to the
                                        battle: but at the fourth assault he pins to the earth a
                                        prostrate king, laying low his crown and sceptre, bushy
                                        beard, and lowering brow, with a poor deuce.</p>
<p>"As David did Goliath," says the archdeacon, pushing over the
                                        four cards to his partner. And then a trump is led, then
                                        another trump; then a <pb n="97"/> king—and then an ace—and
                                        then a long ten, which brings down from the meagre doctor
                                        his only remaining tower of strength—his cherished queen of
                                        trumps.</p>
<p>"What, no second club?" says the archdeacon to his partner.</p>
<p>"Only one club," mutters from his inmost stomach the pursy
                                        rector, who sits there red-faced, silent, impervious,
                                        careful, a safe but not a brilliant ally.</p>
<p>But the archdeacon cares not for many clubs, or for none. He
                                        dashes out his remaining cards with a speed most annoying to
                                        his antagonists, pushes over to them some four cards as
                                        their allotted portion, shoves the remainder across the
                                        table to the red-faced rector: calls out "two by cards and
                                        two by honours, and the odd trick last time," marks a treble
                                        under the candle-stick, and has dealt round the second pack
                                        before the meagre doctor has calculated his losses.</p>
<p>And so went off the warden's party, and men and women arranging
                                        shawls and shoes declared how pleasant it had been; and Mrs.
                                        Goodenough, the red-faced rector's wife, pressing the
                                        warden's hand, declared she had never enjoyed herself
                                        better; which showed how little pleasure she allowed herself
                                        in this world, as she had sat the whole evening <pb n="98"/>
                                        through in the same chair without occupation, not speaking,
                                        and unspoken to. And Matilda Johnson, when she allowed young
                                        Dickson of the bank to fasten her cloak round her neck,
                                        thought that two hundred pounds a year and a little cottage
                                        would really do for happiness; besides he was sure to be
                                        manager some day. And Apollo folding his flute into his
                                        pocket, felt that he had acquitted himself with honour; and
                                        the archdeacon pleasantly gingled his gains; but the meagre
                                        doctor went off without much audible speech, muttering ever
                                        and anon as he went "three and thirty points," "three and
                                        thirty points!"</p>
<p>And so they all were gone, and Mr. Harding was left alone with
                                        his daughter.</p>
<p>What had passed between Eleanor Harding and Mary Bold need not be
                                        told. It is indeed a matter of thankfulness that neither the
                                        historian nor the novelist hears all that is said by their
                                        heroes or heroines, or how would three volumes or twenty
                                        suffice! In the present case so little of this sort have I
                                        overheard, that I live in hopes of finishing my work within
                                        300 pages, and of completing that pleasant task—a novel in
                                        one volume; but something had passed between them, and as
                                        the warden blew out the wax candles, and put his instrument
                                        into its <pb n="99"/> case, his daughter stood sad and
                                        thoughtful by the empty fireplace, determined to speak to
                                        her father, but irresolute as to what she would say.</p>
<p>"Well, Eleanor," said he, "are you for bed?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said she, moving, "I suppose so; but, papa—Mr. Bold was
                                        not here to-night: do you know why not?"</p>
<p>"He was asked; I wrote to him myself," said the warden.</p>
<p>"But do you know why he did not come, papa?"</p>
<p>"Well, Eleanor, I could guess; but it's no use guessing at such
                                        things, my dear. What makes you look so earnest about
                                        it?"</p>
<p>"Oh papa, do tell me," she exclaimed, throwing her arms round
                                        him, and looking into his face; "what is it he is going to
                                        do? What is it all about? Is there any—any—any—" she did n't
                                        well know what word to use—"any danger?"</p>
<p>"Danger, my dear, what sort of danger?"</p>
<p>"Danger to you, danger of trouble, and of loss, and of—Oh papa,
                                        why hav'n't you told me of all this before?"</p>
<p>Mr. Harding was not the man to judge harshly of any one, much
                                        less of the daughter whom he now loved better than any
                                        living creature; but still he <pb n="100"/> did judge her
                                        wrongly at this moment. He knew that she loved John Bold; he
                                        fully sympathised in her affection; day after day he thought
                                        more of the matter, and, with the tender care of a loving
                                        father, tried to arrange in his own mind how matters might
                                        be so managed that his daughter's heart should not be made
                                        the sacrifice to the dispute which was likely to exist
                                        between him and Bold. Now, when she spoke to him for the
                                        first time on the subject, it was natural that he should
                                        think more of her than of himself, and that he should
                                        imagine that her own cares, and not his, were troubling
                                        her.</p>
<p>He stood silent before her awhile, as she gazed up into his face,
                                        and then kissing her forehead he placed her on the sofa.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Nelly," he said (he only called her Nelly in his
                                        kindest, softest, sweetest moods, and yet all his moods were
                                        kind and sweet), "tell me, Nelly, do you like Mr.
                                        Bold—much?"</p>
<p>She was quite taken aback by the question. I will not say that
                                        she had forgotten herself, and her own love in thinking
                                        about John Bold, and while conversing with Mary: she
                                        certainly had not done so. She had been sick at heart to
                                        think, that a man of whom she could not but own to herself
                                        that she loved him, of whose regard she had been so proud,
                                                <pb n="101"/> that such a man should turn against
                                        her father to ruin him. She had felt her vanity hurt, that
                                        his affection for her had not kept him from such a course;
                                        had he really cared for her, he would not have risked her
                                        love by such an outrage; but her main fear had been for her
                                        father, and when she spoke of danger, it was of danger to
                                        him and not to herself.</p>
<p>She was taken aback by the question altogether: "Do I like him,
                                        papa?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Nelly, do you like him? Why should n't you like him; but
                                        that's a poor word—do you love him?" She sat still in his
                                        arms without answering him. She certainly had not prepared
                                        herself for an avowal of affection, intending, as she had
                                        done, to abuse John Bold herself, and to hear her father do
                                        so also. "Come, my love," said he, "let us make a clean
                                        breast of it: do you tell me what concerns yourself, and I
                                        will tell you what concerns me and the hospital."</p>
<p>And then, without waiting for an answer, he described to her, as
                                        he best could, the accusation that was made about Hiram's
                                        will, the clains which the old men put forward; what he
                                        considered the strength and what the weakness of his own
                                        position; <pb n="102"/> the course which Bold had taken, and
                                        that which he presumed he was about to take; and then by
                                        degrees, without further question, he presumed on the fact
                                        of Eleanor's love, and spoke of that love as a feeling which
                                        he could in no way disapprove: he apologised for Bold,
                                        excused what he was doing; nay praised him for his energy
                                        and intentions: made much of his good qualities, and harped
                                        on none of his foibles; then, reminding his daughter how
                                        late it was, and comforting her with much assurance which he
                                        hardly felt himself, he sent her to her room, with flowing
                                        eyes and a full heart.</p>
<p>When Mr. Harding met his daughter at breakfast the next morning,
                                        there was no further discussion on the matter, nor was the
                                        subject mentioned between them for some days. Soon after the
                                        party Mary Bold called at the hospital, but there were
                                        various persons in the drawing-room at the time, and she
                                        therefore said nothing about her brother. On the day
                                        following, John Bold met Miss Harding in one of the quiet
                                        sombre shaded walks of the close: he was most anxious to see
                                        her, but unwilling to call at the warden's house, and had in
                                        truth waylaid her in her private haunts.</p>
<p>"My sister tells me," said he, abruptly hurrying on with his
                                        premeditated speech, "my sister tells me <pb n="103"/> that
                                        you had a delightful party the other evening. I was so sorry
                                        I could not be there."</p>
<p>"We were all sorry," said Eleanor, with dignified composure.</p>
<p>"I believe, Miss Harding, you understood why, at this moment—"
                                        And Bold hesitated, muttered, stopped, commenced his
                                        explanation again, and again broke down.</p>
<p>Eleanor would not help him in the least.</p>
<p>"I think my sister explained to you, Miss Harding?"</p>
<p>"Pray don't apologise, Mr. Bold; my father will, I am sure,
                                        always be glad to see you, if you like to come to the house
                                        now as formerly; nothing has occurred to alter his feelings;
                                        of your own views you are, of course, the best judge."</p>
<p>"Your father is all that is kind and generous; he always was so,
                                        but you, Miss Harding, yourself— I hope you will not judge
                                        me harshly, because—"</p>
<p>"Mr. Bold," said she, "you may be sure of one thing; I shall
                                        always judge my father to be right, and those who oppose him
                                        I shall judge to be wrong. If those who do not know him
                                        oppose him, I shall have charity enough to believe that they
                                        are wrong, through error of judgment; but should I see him
                                                <pb n="104"/> attacked by those who ought to know
                                        him, and to love him, and revere him, of such I shall be
                                        constrained to form a different opinion." And then
                                        curtseying low she sailed on, leaving her lover in anything
                                        but a happy state of mind.</p>
