<head>CHAP. IX. THE CONFERENCE.</head>
<p>On the following morning the archdeacon was with his
                                        father betimes, and a note was sent down to the warden
                                        begging his attendance at the palace. Dr. Grantly, as he
                                        cogitated on the matter, leaning back in his brougham as he
                                        journeyed into Barchester, felt that it would be difficult
                                        to communicate his own satisfaction either to his father or
                                        his father-in-law. He wanted success on his own side and
                                        discomfiture on that of his enemies. The bishop wanted peace
                                        on the subject; a settled peace if possible, but peace at
                                        any rate till the short remainder of his own days had spun
                                        itself out; but Mr. Harding required, not only success and
                                        peace, but he also demanded that he might stand justified
                                        before the world.</p>
<p>The bishop, however, was comparatively easy to deal with, and
                                        before the arrival of the other, the dutiful son had
                                        persuaded his father that all was going on well, and then
                                        the warden arrived.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Harding's wont, whenever he spent a <pb n="134"/>
                                        morning at the palace, to seat himself immediately at the
                                        bishop's elbow, the bishop occupying a huge armchair fitted
                                        up with candle-sticks, a reading table, a drawer, and other
                                        paraphernalia, the position of which chair was never moved,
                                        summer or winter; and when, as was very usual, the
                                        archdeacon was there also, he confronted the two elders, who
                                        thus were enabled to fight the battle against him together;
                                        and together submit to defeat, for such was their constant
                                        fate.</p>
<p>Our warden now took his accustomed place, having greeted his
                                        son-in-law as he entered, and then affectionately inquired
                                        after his friend's health. There was a gentleness about the
                                        bishop to which the soft womanly affection of Mr. Harding
                                        particularly endeared itself, and it was quaint to see how
                                        the two mild old priests pressed each other's hands, and
                                        smiled and made little signs of love.</p>
<p>"Sir Abraham's opinion has come at last," began the archdeacon.
                                        Mr. Harding had heard so much, and was most anxious to know
                                        the result.</p>
<p>"It is quite favourable," said the bishop, pressing his friend's
                                        arm. "I am so glad."</p>
<p>Mr. Harding looked at the mighty bearer of the important news for
                                        confirmation of these glad tidings.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the archdeacon, "Sir Abraham has <pb n="135"/> given
                                        most minute attention to the case; indeed, I knew he
                                        would;—most minute attention, and his opinion is—and as to
                                        his opinion on such a subject being correct, no one who
                                        knows Sir Abraham's character, can doubt—his opinion is,
                                        that they hav'n't got a leg to stand on."</p>
<p>"But as how, archdeacon?"</p>
<p>"Why, in the first place:—but you're no lawyer, warden, and I
                                        doubt you won't understand it; the gist of the matter is
                                        this:—Under Hiram's will two paid guardians have been
                                        selected for the hospital; the law will say two paid
                                        servants, and you and I won't quarrel with the name."</p>
<p>"At any rate I will not if I am one of the servants," said Mr.
                                        Harding. "A rose you know—."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," said the archdeacon, impatient of poetry at such a
                                        time. "Well, two paid servants, we'll say; one to look after
                                        the men, and the other to look after the money. You and
                                        Chadwick are these two servants, and whether either of you
                                        be paid too much, or too little, more or less in fact than
                                        the founder willed, it's as clear as daylight that no one
                                        can fall foul of either of you for receiving an allotted
                                        stipend."</p>
<p>"That does seem clear," said the bishop, who had winced visibly
                                        under the words servants and <pb n="136"/> stipend, which,
                                        however, appeared to have caused no uneasiness to the
                                        archdeacon.</p>
<p>"Quite clear," said he, "and very satisfactory. In point of fact,
                                        it being necessary to select such servants for the use of
                                        the hospital, the pay to be given to them must depend on the
                                        rate of pay for such services, according to their market
                                        value at the period in question; and those who manage the
                                        hospital must be the only judges of this."</p>
<p>"And who does manage the hospital?" asked the warden.</p>
<p>"Oh, let them find that out; that's another question; the action
                                        is brought against you and Chadwick, and that's your
                                        defence, and a perfect and full defence it is. Now that I
                                        think very satisfactory."</p>
<p>"Well," said the bishop, looking inquiringly up into his friend's
                                        face, who sat silent awhile, and apparently not so well
                                        satisfied.</p>
<p>"And conclusive," continued the archdeacon; "if they press it to
                                        a jury, which they won't do, no twelve men in England will
                                        take five minutes to decide against them."</p>
<p>"But according to that," said Mr. Harding, "I might as well have
                                        sixteen hundred a year as eight, if the managers choose to
                                        allot it to me; and as I <pb n="137"/> am one of the
                                        managers, if not the chief manager, myself, that can hardly
                                        be a just arrangement."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, all that's nothing to the question; the question is,
                                        whether this intruding fellow, and a lot of cheating
                                        attorneys and pestilent dissenters, are to interfere with an
                                        arrangement which every one knows is essentially just and
                                        serviceable to the church. Pray don't let us be splitting
                                        hairs, and that amongst ourselves, or there'll never be an
                                        end of the cause or the cost."</p>
<p>Mr. Harding again sat silent for awhile, during which the bishop
                                        once and again pressed his arm, and looked in his face to
                                        see if he could catch a gleam of a contented and eased mind;
                                        but there was no such gleam, and the poor warden continued
                                        playing sad dirges on invisible stringed instruments in all
                                        manner of positions: he was ruminating in his mind on this
                                        opinion of Sir Abraham, looking to it wearily and earnestly
                                        for satisfaction, but finding none. At last he said, "Did
                                        you see the opinion, archdeacon?"</p>
<p>The archdeacon said he had not—that was to say, he had—that was,
                                        he had not seen the opinion itself; he had seen what had
                                        been called a copy, but he could not say whether of a whole
                                        or part; nor could he say that what he had seen were the <pb n="138"/>
<hi>ipsissima verba</hi> of the great man himself; but what
                                        he had seen contained exactly the decision which he had
                                        announced, and which he again declared to be to his mind
                                        extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>"I should like to see the opinion," said the warden; "that is, a
                                        copy it."</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose you can if you make a point of it; but I don't
                                        see the use myself; of course it is essential that the
                                        purport of it should not be known, and it is therefore
                                        unadvisable to multiply copies."</p>
<p>"Why should it not be known?" asked the warden.</p>
<p>"What a question for a man to ask!" said the archdeacon, throwing
                                        up his hands in token of his surprise; "but it is like you—a
                                        child is not more innocent than you are in matters of
                                        business. Can't you see that if we tell them that no action
                                        will lie against you, but that one may possibly lie against
                                        some other person or persons, that we shall be putting
                                        weapons into their hands, and be teaching them how to cut
                                        our own throats?"</p>
<p>The warden again sat silent, and the bishop again looked at him
                                        wistfully: "The only thing we have now to do," continued the
                                        archdeacon, "is to remain quiet, hold our peace, and let
                                        them play their own game as they please."</p>
<p>"We are not to make known then," said the <pb n="139"/> warden,
                                        "that we have consulted the attorney-general, and that we
                                        are advised by him that the founder's will is fully and
                                        fairly carried out."</p>
<p>"God bless my soul!" said the archdeacon, "how odd it is that you
                                        will not see that all we are to do is to do nothing: why
                                        should we say anything about the founder's will? We are in
                                        possession; and we know that they are not in a position to
                                        put us out: surely that is enough for the present."</p>
<p>Mr. Harding rose from his seat and paced thoughtfully up and down
                                        the library, the bishop the while watching him painfully at
                                        every turn, and the archdeacon continuing to pour forth his
                                        convictions that the affair was in a state to satisfy any
                                        prudent mind.</p>
<p>"And the Jupiter?" said the warden, stopping suddenly.</p>
<p>"Oh! the Jupiter," answered the other. "The Jupiter can break no
                                        bones. You must bear with that; there is much of course
                                        which it is our bounden duty to bear; it cannot be all roses
                                        for us here," and the archdeacon looked exceedingly moral;
                                        "besides the matter is too trivial, of too little general
                                        interest to be mentioned again in the Jupiter, unless we
                                        stir up the subject:" and the archdeacon again looked
                                        exceedingly knowing and worldly wise.</p>
<p>The warden continued his walk; the hard and <pb n="140"/>
                                        stinging words of that newspaper article, each one of which
                                        had thrust a thorn as it were into his inmost soul, were
                                        fresh in his memory: he had read it more than once, word by
                                        word, and what was worse, he fancied it was as well known to
                                        every one as to himself. Was he to be looked on as the
                                        unjust griping priest he had been there described? Was he to
                                        be pointed at as the consumer of the bread of the poor, and
                                        to be allowed no means of refuting such charges, of clearing
                                        his begrimed name, of standing innocent in the world, as
                                        hitherto he had stood? Was he to bear all this, to receive
                                        as usual his now hated income, and be known as one of those
                                        greedy priests who by their rapacity have brought disgrace
                                        on their church? and why? Why should he bear all this? why
                                        should he die, for he felt that he could not live, under
                                        such a weight of obloquy? As he paced up and down the room
                                        he resolved in his misery and enthusiasm that he could with
                                        pleasure, if he were allowed, give up his place, abandon his
                                        pleasant home, leave the hospital, and live poorly, happily,
                                        and with an unsullied name, on the small remainder of his
                                        means.</p>
<p>He was a man somewhat shy of speaking of himself, even before
                                        those who knew him best, and whom he loved the most; but at
                                        last it burst forth from him, and with a somewhat jerking
                                        eloquence he <pb n="141"/> declared that he could not, would
                                        not, bear this misery any longer.</p>
<p>"If it can be proved," said he at last, "that I have a just and
                                        honest right to this, as God well knows I always deemed I
                                        had; if this salary or stipend be really my due, I am not
                                        less anxious than another to retain it. I have the
                                        well-being of my child to look to. I am too old to miss
                                        without some pain the comforts to which I have been used;
                                        and I am, as others are, anxious to prove to the world that
                                        I have been right, and to uphold the place I have held; but
                                        I cannot do it at such a cost as this. I cannot bear this.
                                        Could you tell me to do so?" and he appealed, almost in
                                        tears, to the bishop, who had left his chair, and was now
                                        leaning on the warden's arm as he stood on the further side
                                        of the table facing the archdeacon. "Could you tell me to
                                        sit there at ease, indifferent, and satisfied, while such
                                        things as these are said loudly of me in the world?"</p>
<p>The bishop could feel for him and sympathise with him, but he
                                        could not advise him, he could only say, "No, no, you shall
                                        be asked to do nothing that is painful; you shall do just
                                        what your heart tells you to be right; you shall do whatever
                                        you think best yourself. Theophilus, don't advise him, pray
                                        don't advise the warden to do anything which is
                                        painful."</p>
<pb n="142"/>
<p>But the archdeacon, though he could not sympathise, could advise;
                                        and he saw that the time had come when it behoved him to do
                                        so in a somewhat peremptory manner.</p>
<p>"Why, my lord," he said speaking to his father: and when he
                                        called his father 'my lord,' the good old bishop shook in
                                        his shoes, for he knew that an evil time was coming. "Why,
                                        my lord, there are two ways of giving advice; there is
                                        advice that may be good for the present day; and there is
                                        advice that may be good for days to come: now I cannot bring
                                        myself to give the former, if it be incompatible with the
                                        other."</p>
<p>"No, no, no, I suppose not," said the bishop, reseating himself,
                                        and shading his face with his hands. Mr. Harding sat down
                                        with his back to the further wall, playing to himself some
                                        air fitted for so calamitous an occasion, and the archdeacon
                                        said out his say standing, with his back to the empty
                                        fireplace.</p>
<p>"It is not to be supposed, but that much pain will spring out of
                                        this unnecessarily raised question. We must all have
                                        foreseen that, and the matter has in no wise gone on worse
                                        than we expected; but it will be weak, yes, and wicked also,
                                        to abandon the cause and own ourselves wrong, because the
                                        inquiry <pb n="143"/> is painful. It is not only ourselves
                                        we have to look to: to a certain extent the interest of the
                                        church is in our keeping. Should it be found that one after
                                        another of those who hold preferment abandoned it whenever
                                        it might be attacked, is it not plain that such attacks
                                        would be renewed till nothing was left us? and, that if so
                                        deserted, the Church of England must fall to the ground
                                        altogether? If this be true of many, it is true of one. Were
                                        you, accused as you now are, to throw up the wardenship, and
                                        to relinquish the preferment which is your property, with
                                        the vain object of proving yourself disinterested, you would
                                        fail in that object, you would inflict a desperate blow on
                                        your brother clergymen, you would encourage every
                                        cantankerous dissenter in England to make a similar charge
                                        against some source of clerical revenue, and you would do
                                        your best to dishearten those who are most anxious to defend
                                        you and uphold your position. I can fancy nothing more weak,
                                        or more wrong. It is not that you think that there is any
                                        justice in these charges, or that you doubt your own right
                                        to the wardenship: you are convinced of your own honesty,
                                        and yet would yield to them through cowardice."</p>
<p>"Cowardice!" said the bishop, expostulating. Mr. Harding sat
                                        unmoved, gazing on his son-in-law.</p>
<pb n="144"/>
<p>"Well, would it not be cowardice? would he not do so because he
                                        is afraid to endure the evil things which will be falsely
                                        spoken of him? Would that not be cowardice? And now let us
                                        see the extent of the evil which you dread. The Jupiter
                                        publishes an article which a great many, no doubt, will
                                        read; but of those who understand the subject how many will
                                        believe the Jupiter? Every one knows what its object is; it
                                        has taken up the case against Lord Guildford and against the
                                        Dean of Rochester, and that against half a dozen bishops;
                                        and does not every one know that it would take up any case
                                        of the kind, right or wrong, false or true, with known
                                        justice or known injustice, if by doing so it could further
                                        its own views? Does not all the world know this of the
                                        Jupiter? Who that really knows you will think the worse of
                                        you for what the Jupiter says? And why care for those who do
                                        not know you? I will say nothing of your own comfort, but I
                                        do say that you could not be justified in throwing up, in a
                                        fit of passion, for such it would be, the only maintenance
                                        that Eleanor has; and if you did so, if you really did
                                        vacate the wardenship, and submit to ruin, what would that
                                        profit you? If you have no future right to the income, you
                                        have had no past right to it; and the very fact of your
                                        abandoning <pb n="145"/> your position, would create a
                                        demand for repayment of that which you have already received
                                        and spent."</p>
<p>The poor warden groaned as he sat perfectly still, looking up at
                                        the hard-hearted orator who thus tormented him, and the
                                        bishop echoed the sound faintly from behind his hands; but
                                        the archdeacon cared little for such signs of weakness, and
                                        completed his exhortation.</p>
<p>"But let us suppose the office to be left vacant, and that your
                                        own troubles concerning it were over; would that satisfy
                                        you? Are your only aspirations in the matter confined to
                                        yourself and family? I know they are not. I know you are as
                                        anxious as any of us for the church to which we belong; and
                                        what a grievous blow would such an act of apostasy give her!
                                        You owe it to the church of which you are a member and a
                                        minister, to bear with this affliction, however severe it
                                        may be: you owe it to my father, who instituted you, to
                                        support his rights: you owe it to those who preceded you to
                                        assert the legality of their position: you owe it to those
                                        who are to come after you, to maintain uninjured for them
                                        that which you received uninjured from others; and you owe
                                        to us all the unflinching assistance of perfect <pb n="146"/> brotherhood in this matter, so that upholding one another
                                        we may support our great cause without blushing and without
                                        disgrace."</p>
<p>And so the archdeacon ceased, and stood self-satisfied, watching
                                        the effect of his spoken wisdom.</p>
<p>The warden felt himself, to a certain extent, stifled; he would
                                        have given the world to get himself out into the open air
                                        without speaking to, or noticing those who were in the room
                                        with him; but this was impossible. He could not leave
                                        without saying something, and he felt himself confounded by
                                        the archdeacon's eloquence. There was a heavy, unfeeling,
                                        unanswerable truth in what he had said; there was so much
                                        practical, but odious common sense in it, that he neither
                                        knew how to assent or to differ. If it were necessary for
                                        him to suffer, he felt that he could endure without
                                        complaint and without cowardice, providing that he was
                                        self-satisfied of the justice of his own cause. What he
                                        could not endure was, that he should be accused by others,
                                        and not acquitted by himself. Doubting, as he had begun to
                                        doubt, the justice of his own position in the hospital, he
                                        knew that his own self-confidence would not be restored
                                        because Mr. Bold had been in error as to some legal form;
                                        nor could he be satisfied to escape, because, through some
                                        legal fiction, he who <pb n="147"/> received the greatest
                                        benefit from the hospital might be considered only as one of
                                        its servants.</p>
<p>The archdeacon's speech had silenced him—stupefied
                                        him—annihilated him; anything but satisfied him. With the
                                        bishop it fared not much better. He did not discern clearly
                                        how things were, but he saw enough to know that a battle was
                                        to be prepared for; a battle that would destroy his few
                                        remaining comforts, and bring him with sorrow to the
                                        grave.</p>
<p>The warden still sat, and still looked at the archdeacon, till
                                        his thoughts fixed themselves wholly on the means of escape
                                        from his present position, and he felt like a bird
                                        fascinated by gazing on a snake.</p>
<p>"I hope you agree with me," said the archdeacon at last, breaking
                                        the dread silence; "my lord, I hope <hi>you</hi> agree with
                                        me."</p>
<p>Oh what a sigh the bishop gave! "My lord, I hope you agree with
                                        me," again repeated the merciless tyrant.</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose so," groaned the poor old man, slowly.</p>
<p>"And you, warden?"</p>
<p>Mr. Harding was now stirred to action—he must speak and move, so
                                        he got up and took one turn before he answered.</p>

                                        will do nothing lightly in the matter, and of whatever I do
                                        I will give you and the bishop notice." And so without
                                        another word he took his leave, escaping quickly through the
                                        palace hall, and down the lofty steps, nor did he breathe
                                        freely till he found himself alone under the huge elms of
                                        the silent close. Here he walked long and slowly, thinking
                                        on his case with a troubled air, and trying in vain to
                                        confute the archdeacon's argument. He then went home,
                                        resolved to bear it all—ignominy, suspense, disgrace,
                                        self-doubt, and heart-burning—and to do as those would have
                                        him, who he still believed were most fit and most able to
                                        counsel him aright.</p>
