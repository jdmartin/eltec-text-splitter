<t:head>CHAPTER III.</t:head>
<t:p>It was late when Rachel reached home. She found her step-mother sitting up for her, rigid,
     amazed y indignant—so indignant, indeed, that though she rated Rachel soundly for her audacity
     in presuming to stay out so long without previous leave obtained, she quite forgot to inquire
     particularly why she had not come home earlier. A series of disasters had been occasioned by
     Rachel's absence; Jane and Mary had quarrelled, Mrs. Gray had been kept an hour waiting for her
     supper, the beer had naturally become flat and worthless, and whilst Mrs. Gray was sleeping—and
     how could she help sleeping, being quite faint and exhausted with her long vigil—puss had got
     up on the table and walked off with Rachel's polony.</t:p>
<t:p>There was a touch of quiet humour in Rachel, and with a demure smile, she internally wondered
     why it was precisely her polony that had been selected by puss, but aloud she merely declared
     that she could make an excellent supper on bread and beer. Mrs. Gray, who held the reins of
     domestic management in their little household, assured her that she had better, for that
     nothing else was she going to get; she sat down heroically determined to eat the whole of her
     polony in order to punish and provoke her step-daughter; but somehow or other the half of that
     dainty had, before the end of the meal, found its way to the plate of Rachel, who, when she
     protested against this act of generosity, was imperiously ordered to hold her tongue, which
     order she did not dare to resist; for if Mrs. Gray's heart was mellow, her temper was
     sufficiently tart.</t:p>
<t:p>The apprentices had long been gone to bed; as soon as supper was over, Mrs. Gray intimated to
     Rachel the propriety of following their example. Rachel ventured to demur meekly.</t:p>
<t:p>"I cannot, mother—I have work to finish."</t:p>
<t:p>"Then better have sat at home and finished it, than have gone gadding about, and nearly got a
     pitch plaster on your mouth," grumbled Mrs. Gray, who was a firm believer in pitch plasters,
     and abductions, and highway robberies, and all sorts of horrors. "Mind you don't set the house
     a fire," she added, retiring.</t:p>
<t:p>"Why, mother," said Rachel, smiling, "you treat me like a child, and I am twenty-six."</t:p>
<t:p>"What about that? when you aint got no more sense than a baby."</t:p>
<t:p>Rachel did not venture to dispute, a proposition so distinctly stated. She remained up, and
     sat sewing until her work was finished; she then took out from some secret repository a small
     end of candle, lit it, and extinguished the long candle, by the light of which she had been
     working. From her pocket she took a small key; it opened a work-box, whence she drew a shirt
     collar finely stitched; she worked until her eyes ached, but she heeded it not, until they
     closed with involuntary fatigue and sleep, and still she would not obey the voice of wearied
     nature; still she stitched for love, like the poor shirtmaker for bread, until, without
     previous warning, her candle end suddenly flickered, then expired in its socket, and left her
     in darkness. Rachel gently opened the window, and partly unclosed the shutter; the moon was
     riding in the sky above the old house opposite, her pale clear light glided over its brown
     walls and the quiet street, down into the silent parlour of Rachel. She looked around her,
     moved at seeing familiar objects under an unusual aspect. In that old chair she had often seen
     her father sitting; on such a moonlight night as this she and Jane, then already declining, had
     sat by the window, and looking at that same sky, had talked with youthful fervour of high and
     eternal things. And now Jane knew the divine secrets she had guessed from afar, and Thomas
     Gray, alas! was a stranger and an alien in his own home.</t:p>
<t:p>"Who knows," thought Rachel, "but he will return some day? Who knows— who can tell? Life is
     long, and hope is eternal. Ah! if he should come back, even though he never looked at me, never
     spoke, blessed, thrice blessed, should ever be held the day…" And a prayer, not framed in
     words, but in deep feelings, gushed like a pure spring from her inmost heart. But, indeed, when
     did she not pray? When was God divided from her thoughts? When did prayer fail to prompt the
     kind, gentle words that fell from her lips, or to lend its daily grace to a pure and blameless
     life?</t:p>
<t:p>For to her, God was not what He, alas! is to so many—an unapproachable Deity, to be
     worshipped from afar, in fear and trembling, or a cold though sublime abstraction. No, Jesus
     was her friend, her counsellor, her refuge. There was familiarity and tenderness in her very
     love for Him; and, though she scarcely knew it herself, a deep and fervent sense of His divine
     humanity of those thirty-three years of earthly life, of toil, of poverty, of trouble, and of
     sorrow which move our very hearts within us, when we look from Bethlehem to Calvary, from the
     lowly birth in the Manger to the bitter death on the Cross.</t:p>
<t:p>We might ask, were these the pages to raise such questions, why Jesus is not more loved
     thus—as a friend, and a dear one, rather than as a cold master to be served, not for love, but
     for wages. But let it rest. Sufficient is it for us to know that not thus did Rachel Gray love
     him, but with a love in which humility and tenderness equally blended.</t:p>
<t:p>After a meditative pause, she quietly put away her things by moonlight, then again closed
     shutter and window, and softly stole up to the room which she shared with her step-mother. She
     soon fell asleep, and dreamed that she had gone to live with her father, who said to her,
     "Rachel! Rachel!" So great was her joy, that she awoke. She found her mother already up, and
     scolding her because she still slept.</t:p>
<t:p>"Mother," asked Rachel, leaning up on one elbow, "was it you who called me, Rachel?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Why aint I been a calling of you this last hour?" asked Mrs. Gray, with much asperity.</t:p>
<t:p>Rachel checked a sigh, and rose.</t:p>
<t:p>"Get up Jane—get up Mary," said Mrs. Gray, rapping soundly at the room door of the two
     apprentices.</t:p>
<t:p>"Let them sleep a little longer, poor young things!" implored Rachel.</t:p>
<t:p>"No, that I won't," replied her mother, with great determination, "lazy little
     creatures."</t:p>
<t:p>And to the imminent danger of her own knuckles, she rapped so pertinaciously, that Jane and
     Mary were unable to feign deafness, and replied, the former acting as spokeswoman, that Mrs.
     Gray needn't be making all that noise; for that they heard her, and were getting up. "I thought
     I'd make them hear me," muttered Mrs. Gray, hobbling down stairs.</t:p>
<t:p>There are some beings who lead lives so calm, that when they look back on years, they seem to
     read the story of a few days; and of these was Rachel Gray. Life for her flowed dull,
     monotonous and quiet, as that of a nun in her cloister. The story of one day was the story of
     the next. A few hopes, a few precious thoughts she treasured in her heart; but outwardly, to
     work, to hear idle gossip, to eat, drink, and sleep, seemed her whole portion, her destiny from
     mom till night, from birth to the grave.</t:p>
<t:p>Like every day passed this day. When it grew so dark that she could see no more to work, she
     put her task by, and softly stole away to a little back room up-stairs.</t:p>
<t:p>It was a very small room indeed, with a bed, where the apprentices slept; a chest of drawers,
     a table, and two chairs:—many a closet is larger. Its solitary window looked out on the little
     yard below; low walls, against which grew Rachel's stocks and wall-flowers, enclosed it. From
     the next house, there came the laughter and the screams too of children, and of babies; and
     from a neighbouring forge, a loud, yet not unmusical clanking, with which now and then, blended
     the rude voices of the men, singing snatches of popular songs. Dimmed by the smoke of the
     forge, and by the natural heaviness of a London atmosphere, the sky enclosed all; yet, even
     through the smoke and haze, fair rosy gleams of the setting sun shone in that London sky, and
     at the zenith there was a space of pure, ethereal blue—soft, and very far from sinful and
     suffering earth, where glittered in calm beauty a large and tranquil star.</t:p>
<t:p>Rachel sat by the window. She listened to earth: she looked at Heaven. Her heart swelled with
     love, and prayer, and tenderness, and hope. Tears of delight filled her eyes; she murmured to
     herself verses from psalms and hymns—all praising God, all telling the beauty of God's
     creation. Oh! pure and beautiful, indeed, would be the story of these your evening musings, if
     we could lightly tell it here, Rachel Gray.</t:p>
<t:p>Reader, if to learn how a fine nature found its way through darkness and mist, and some
     suffering to the highest, and to the noblest of the delights God has granted to man—the
     religious and the intellectual; if, we say, to learn this give you pleasure, you may read on to
     the end of the chapter; if not, pass on at once to the next. These pages were not written for
     you; and even though you should read them, feel and understand them, you never will.</t:p>
<t:p>Our life is twofold; and of that double life, which, like all of us, Rachel bore within her,
     we have as yet said but little. She was now twenty six; a tall, thin, sallow woman, ungraceful,
     of shy manners, and but little speech; but with a gentle face, a broad forehead, and large
     brown eyes. By trade, she was a dress-maker, of small pretensions; her father had forsaken her
     early, and her step-mother had reared her. This much, knew the little world in which moved
     Rachel Gray, this much, and no more. We may add, that this some little world had, in its
     wisdom, pronounced Rachel Gray a fool.</t:p>
<t:p>Her education had been very limited. She knew how to read, and she could write, but neither
     easily nor well. For though God had bestowed on her the rare dower of a fine mind, He had not
     added to it the much more common, though infinitely less precious gift, of a quick intellect.
     She learned slowly, with great difficulty, with sore pain and trouble. Her teachers, one and
     all, pronounced her dull; her step-mother was ashamed of her, and to her dying day thought
     Rachel no better than a simpleton.</t:p>
<t:p>Rachel felt this keenly; but she had no means of self-defence. She had not the least idea of
     how she could prove that she was not an idiot. One of the characteristics of childhood and of
     youth is a painful inability, an entire powerlessness of giving the form of speech to its
     deepest and most fervent feelings. The infirmity generally dies off with years, perhaps because
     also dies off the very strength of those feelings; but even as they were to last for ever with
     Rachel Gray, so was that infirmity destined to endure. Shy, sensitive, and nervous, she was a
     noble book, sealed to all save God.</t:p>
<t:p>At eleven, her education, such as it was, was over. Rachel had to work, and earn her bread.
     She was reared religiously, and hers was a deeply religious nature. The misapplication of
     religion narrows still more a narrow mind, but religion, taken in its true sense, enlarges a
     noble one. Yet, not without strife, not without suffering, did Rachel make her way. She was
     ignorant, and she was alone; how to ask advice she knew not, for she could not explain herself.
     Sometimes she seemed to see the most sublime truths, plain as in a book; at other times, they
     floated dark and clouded before her gaze, or vanished in deep obscurity, and left her alone and
     cast down. She suffered years, until, from her very sufferings, perfect faith was born, and
     from faith unbounded trust in God, after which her soul sank in deep and blessed peace.</t:p>
<t:p>And now, when rest was won, there came the want for more. Religion is love. Rachel wanted
     thought, that child of the intellect, as love is the child of the heart. She did not know
     herself what it was that she needed, until she discovered and possessed it—until she could read
     a book, a pamphlet, a scrap of verse, and brood over it, like a bird over her young, not for
     hours, not for days, but for weeks—blest in that silent meditation. Her mind was tenacious, but
     slow; she read few books—many would have disturbed her. Sweeter and pleasanter was it to Rachel
     to think over what she did read, and to treasure it up in the chambers of her mind, than to
     fill those chambers with heaps of knowledge. Indeed for knowledge Rachel cared comparatively
     little. In such as displayed more clearly the glories of God's creation she delighted; but
     man's learning, man's science, touched her not. To think was her delight; a silent, solitary,
     forbidden pleasure, in which Rachel had to indulge by stealth.</t:p>
<t:p>For all this time, and especially since the death of her sister, she suffered keenly from
     home troubles, from a little domestic persecution, painful, pertinacious, and irritating. Mrs.
     Gray vaguely felt that her daughter was not like other girls, and not knowing that she was in
     reality very far beyond most; feeling, too, that Rachel was wholly unlike herself, and
     jealously resenting the fact, she teased her unceasingly, and did her best to interrupt the
     fits of meditation, which she did not scruple to term "moping." When her mind was most haunted
     with some fine thought, Rachel had to talk to her step-mother, to listen to her, and to take
     care not to reply at random; if she failed in any of these obligations, half-an-hour's lecture
     was the least penalty she could expect. Dear to her, for this reason; were the few moments of
     solitude she could call her own; dear to her was that little room, where she could steal away
     at twilight time and think in peace.</t:p>
<t:p>Very unlike her age was this ignorant dress-maker of the nineteenth century. Ask the men and
     women of the day to read volumes; why, there is not a season but they go through the Herculean
     labour of swallowing down histories written faster than time flies, novels by the dozen,
     essays, philosophic and political, books of travels, of science, of statistics, besides the
     nameless host of reviews, magazines, and papers, daily and weekly. Ask them to study: why, what
     is there they do not know, from the most futile accomplishment to the most abstruse science?
     Ask them too, if you like, to enter life, to view it under all its aspects; why, they have
     travelled over the whole earth; and life, they know from the palace down to the hovel; but bid
     them think! They stare aghast: it is the task of Sisyphus—the labour of the Danaide; as fast as
     thought enters their mind, it goes out again. Bid them commune, one day with God and their own
     hearts—they reply dejectedly that they cannot; for their intellect is quick and brilliant, but
     their heart is cold. And thought springs from the heart, and in her heart had Rachel Gray found
     it.</t:p>
<t:p>The task impossible to them was to her easy and delightful. Time wore on; deeper and more
     exquisite grew what Rachel quaintly termed to herself "the pleasure of thinking." And oh! she
     thought sometimes, and it was a thought that made her heart bum, "Oh! that people only knew the
     pleasures of thinking! Oh! if people would only think!" And mom, and noon, and night, and
     bending over her work, or sitting at peaceful twilight time in the little back room, Rachel
     thought; and thus she went on through life, between those two fair sisters, Thought and
     Prayer.</t:p>
<t:p>Reader, hare you known many thinkers? We confess that we hare known many men and women of
     keen and great intellect, some geniuses; but only one real thinker have we known, only one who
     really thought for thought's own sake, and that one was Rachel Gray.</t:p>
<t:p>And now, if she moves through this story, thinking much and doing little, you know why.</t:p>
