<l>'Sail forth into the sea, thou ship,</l>

<p>Tranquillity only lasted until Mr. Ernescliffe found it necessary to understand on
      what terms he was to stand. Everyone was tender of conscience, anxious to do right, and
      desirous to yield to the opinion that nobody could, or would give. While Alan begged for a
      positive engagement, Margaret scrupled to exchange promises that she might never be able to
      fulfil, and both agreed to leave all to her father, who, in every way, ought to have the best
      ability to judge whether there was unreasonable presumption in such a betrothal; but this very
      ability only served to perplex the poor Doctor more and more. It is far easier for a man to
      decide when he sees only one bearing of a case, than when, like Dr. May, he not only sees them,
      but is rent by them in his inmost heart. Sympathizing in turn with each lover, bitterly
      accusing his own carelessness as the cause of all their troubles, his doubts contending with
      his hopes, his conviction clashing with Sir Matthew Fleet's opinion, his conscientious
      sincerity and delicacy conflicting with his affection and eagerness, he was perfectly
      incapable of coming to a decision, and suffered so cruelly, that Margaret was doubly
      distressed for his sake, and Alan felt himself guilty of having rendered everybody
      miserable.</p>
<pb n="300"/>
<p>Dr. May could not conceal his trouble, and rendered Ethel almost as unhappy as himself,
      after each conversation with her, though her hopes usually sprang up again, and she had a
      happy conviction that this was only the second volume of the novel. Flora was not often called
      into his councils; confidence never came spontaneously from Dr. May to her; there was
      something that did not draw it forth towards her, whether it resided in that half-sarcastic
      corner of her steady blue eye, or in the grave common sense of her gentle voice. Her view of
      the case was known to be that there was no need for so much perplexity—why should not Alan be
      the best judge of his own happiness? If Margaret were to be delicate for life, it would be
      better to have such a home to look to; and she soothed and comforted Margaret, and talked in a
      strain of unmixed hope and anticipation that often drew a smile from her sister, though she
      feared to trust to it.</p>
<p>Flora's tact and consideration in keeping the children away, when the lovers could best be
      alone, and letting them in, when the discussion was becoming useless and harassing, her
      cheerful smiles, her evening music that covered all sounds, her removal of all extra
      annoyances, were invaluable, and Margaret appreciated them, as, indeed, Flora took care that
      she should.</p>
<p>Margaret begged to know her eldest brother's judgment, but had great difficulty in dragging
      it out. Diffidently as it was proposed, it was clear and decided. He thought that his father
      had better send Sir Matthew Fleet a statement of Margaret's present condition, and abide by
      his answer as to whether her progress warranted the hope of her restoration.</p>
<p>Never was Richard more surprised than by the gratitude with which his suggestion was hailed,
      simple as it was, so that it seemed obvious that others should have already thought of it.
      After the tossings of uncertainty, it was a positive relief to refer the question to some
      external voice, and only Ethel and Norman expressed strong dislike to Sir Matthew becoming the
      arbitrer of Margaret's fate, and were scarcely pacified by Dr. May's assurance, that he had
      not revealed the occasion of his inquiry. The letter was sent, and repose returned, but hearts
      beat high on the morning when the answer was expected.</p>
<p>Dr. May watched the moment when his daughter was alone, carried the letter to her, and
      kissing her, said, with an oppressed voice, 'I give you joy, my dear.'</p>
<p>She read with suspended breath and palpitating heart. Sir Matthew thought her improvement
      sure, though slow, and had barely a doubt, that, in a year, she would have regained her full
      strength and activity.</p>
<pb n="301"/>
<p>'You will show it to Alan,' said Dr. May, as Margaret lifted her eyes to his face
      inquiringly.</p>
<p>'Will not you?' she said.</p>
<p>'I cannot,' he answered. 'I wish I was more helpful to you, my child,' he added, wistfully,
      'but you will rest on him, and be happy together while he stays, will you not?'</p>
<p>'Indeed I will, dear papa.'</p>
<p>Mr. Ernescliffe was with her as the Doctor quitted her. She held the letter to him, 'But,'
      she said, slowly, 'I see that papa does not believe it.'</p>
<p>'You promised to abide by it!' he exclaimed, between entreaty and authority.</p>
<p>'I do; if you choose so to risk your hopes.'</p>
<p>'But,' cried he, as he glanced hastily over the letter, 'there can be no doubt! These words
      are as certain as language can make them. Why will you not trust them?'</p>
<p>'I see that papa does not.'</p>
<p>'Despondency and self-reproach make him morbidly anxious. Believe so, my Margaret! You know
      he is no surgeon!'</p>
<p>'His education included that line,' said Margaret. 'I believe he has all but the manual
      dexterity. However, I would fain have faith in Sir Matthew,' she added, smiling, 'and perhaps
      I am only swayed by the habit of thinking that papa must know best.'</p>
<p>'He does in indifferent cases; but it is an old axiom, that a medical man should not
      prescribe for his own family; above all, in such a case, where it is but reasonable to believe
      an unprejudiced stranger, who alone is cool enough to be relied on. I absolutely depend on
      him!'</p>
<p>Margaret absolutely depended on the bright cheerful look of conviction. 'Yes,' she said, 'we
      will try to make papa take pleasure in the prospect. Perhaps I could do more if I made the
      attempt.'</p>
<p>'I am sure you could, if you would let me give you more support. If I were but going to
      remain with you!'</p>
<p>'Don't let us be discontented,' said Margaret, smiling, 'when so much more has been granted
      than I dare to hope. Be it as it may, let us be happy in what we have.'</p>
<p>'It makes you happy?' said he, archly reading her face to draw out the avowal, but he only
      made her hide it, with a mute caress of the hand that held hers. She was glad enough to rest
      in the present, now that everything concurred to satisfy her conscience in so doing, and come
      what might, the days now spent together would be a possession of joy for ever.</p>
<pb n="302"/>
<p>Captain Gordon contrived to afford his lieutenant another fortnight's leave, perhaps because
      he was in dread of losing him altogether, for Alan had some doubts, and many longings to
      remain. Had it been possible to marry at once, he would have quitted the navy immediately; and
      he would have given worlds to linger beside Margaret's couch, and claim her the first moment
      possible, believing his care more availing than all. He was, however, so pledged to Captain
      Gordon, that, without strong cause, he would not have been justified in withdrawing; besides,
      Harry was under his charge, and Dr. May and Margaret both thought, with the captain, that an
      active life would be a better occupation for him than watching her. He would never be able to
      settle down at his new home comfortably without her, and he would be more in the way of duty
      while pursuing his profession, so Margaret nerved herself against using her influence to
      detain him, and he thanked her for it.</p>
<p>Though hope and affection could not at once repair an injured spine, they had wonderful
      powers in inciting Margaret to new efforts. Alan was as tender and ready of hand as Richard,
      and more clever and enterprising; and her unfailing trust in him prevented all alarms and
      misgivings, so that wonders were effected, and her father beheld her standing with so little
      support, looking so healthful and so blithe, that his forebodings melted away, and he talked
      joyously of the future.</p>
<p>The great achievement was taking her round the garden. She could not bear the motion of
      wheels, but Alan adopted the hammock principle, and, with the aid of Richard and his crony,
      the carpenter, produced a machine in which no other power on earth could have prevailed on her
      to trust herself, but in which she was carried round the garden so successfully, that there
      was even a talk of next Sunday, and of the Minster.</p>
<p>It was safely accomplished, and tired as she was, Margaret felt, as she whispered to Alan,
      that he had now crowned all the joy that he had brought to her.</p>
<p>Ethel used to watch them, and think how beautiful their countenances were, and talk them
      over with her father, who was quite happy about them now. She gave assistance, which Alan
      never once called unhandy, to all his contrivances, and often floundered in upon his
      conferences with Margaret, in a way that would have been very provoking, if she had not always
      blushed and looked so excessively discomfited, that they had only to laugh and reassure
      her.</p>
<p>Alan was struck by finding that the casual words spoken on the way from Cocksmoor had been
      so strenuously acted on, and he brought on himself a whole torrent of Ethel's confused
      narratives,
      <pb n="303"/> which Richard and Flora would fain have checked; but Margaret let them continue,
      as she saw him a willing listener, and was grateful to him for comprehending the ardent
      girl.</p>
<p>He declared himself to have a share in the matter, reminding Ethel of her appeal to him to
      bind himself to the service of Cocksmoor. he sent a sovereign at once, to aid in a case of the
      sudden death of a pig; and when securely established in his brotherly right, he begged Ethel
      to let him know what would help her most. She stood colouring, twisting her hands, and
      wondering what to say, whereupon he relieved her by a proposal to leave an order for ten
      pounds, to be yearly paid into her hands, as a fixed income for her school.</p>
<p>A thousand a year could hardly have been so much to Ethel. 'Thank you! Oh, this is charming!
      We could set up a regular school! Cherry Elwood is the very woman! Alan, you have made our
      fortune! Oh! Margaret! Margaret! I must go and tell Ritchie and Mary!' This is the first real
      step to our Church and all!'</p>
<p>'May I do it?' said Alan, turning to Margaret, as Ethel frantically burst out of the room;
      'perhaps I should have asked leave?'</p>
<p>'I was going to thank you,' said Margaret. 'It is the very kindest thing you could have done
      by dear Ethel! the greatest comfort to us. She will be at peace now, when anything hinders her
      from going to Cocksmoor.'</p>
<p>'I wonder,' said Alan, musing, 'whether we shall ever be able to help her more
      substantially. I cannot do anything hastily, for you know Maplewood is still in the hands of
      the executors, and I cannot tell what claims there may be upon me; but-by-and-by, when I
      return, if I find no other pressing duty, might not a Church at Cocksmoor be a thankoffering
      for all I have found here?'</p>
<p>'Oh! Alan, what joy it would be!</p>
<p>'It is a long way off,' he said, sadly; 'and perhaps her force of perseverance will have
      prevailed alone.'</p>
<p>'I suppose I must not tell her, even as a vision.'</p>
<p>'It is too uncertain; I do not know the wants of the Maplewood people, and I must provide
      for Hector. I would not let these vague dreams interfere with her resolute work; but,
      Margaret, what a vision it is! I can see you laying the first stone on that fine heathy
      brow.'</p>
<p>'Oh! your godchild should lay the first stone!'</p>
<p>'She shall, and you shall lead her. And there shall be Ethel's sharp face full of
      indescribable things as she marshals her children, and Richard shall be Curate, and read in
      his steady soft tone, and your father shall look sunny with his boys around him, and you—'</p>
<pb n="304"/>
<p>'Oh! Alan!' said Margaret, who had been listening with a smile, 'it is, indeed, a long way
      off!'</p>
<p>'I shall look to it as the haven where I would be,' said the sailor.</p>
<p>They often spoke together of this scheme, ever decking it in brighter colours. The topic
      seemed to suit them better than their own future, for there was no dwelling on that without an
      occasional misgiving, and the more glad the anticipation, the deeper the sigh that followed on
      Margaret's part, till Mr. Ernescliffe followed her lead, and they seldom spoke of these
      uncertainties, but outwardly smiled over the present, inwardly dwelt on the truly certain
      hopes. There were readings shared together, made more precious than all, by the conversations
      that ensued.</p>
<p>The hour for parting came at last. Ethel never knew what passed in the drawing-room, whence
      everyone was carefully excluded. Dr. May wandered about, keeping guard over the door, and
      watching the clock, till, at the last moment, he knocked, and called in a trembling voice,
      'Ernescliffe! Alan! It is past the quarter! You must not stay!'</p>
<p>The other farewells were hurried; Alan seemed voiceless, only nodding in reply to Mary's
      vociferous messages to Harry, and huskily whispering to Ethel, 'Good luck to Cocksmoor!'</p>
<p>The next moment the door had shut on him, and Dr. May and Flora had gone to her sister, whom
      she found not tearful, but begging to be left alone.</p>
<p>When they saw her again, she was cheerful; she kept up her composure and animation without
      flagging, nor did she discontinue her new exertions, but seemed decidedly the happier for all
      that had passed.</p>
<p>Letters came every day for her, and presents to everyone. Ethel had a gold chain and
      eye-glass, which, it was hoped, might cure her of frowning and stooping, though her various
      ways of dangling her new possession, caused her to be so much teazed by Flora and Norman,
      that, but for regard to Margaret's feelings, she would not have worn it for three days.</p>
<p>To Mary was sent a daguerreotype of Harry, her glory and delight. Say, who would, that it
      had pig's eyes, a savage frown, a pudding chin, there were his own tight rings of hair, his
      gold-banded cap, his bright buttons, how could she prize it enough? She exhibited it to the
      little ones ten times a day, she kissed it night and morning, and registered her vow always to
      sleep with it under her 'pilow,' in a letter of thanks, which Margaret defended and
      despatched, in spite of Miss Winter's horrors at its disregard of orthography.</p>
<pb n="305"/>
<p>It was nearly the last letter before the Alcestis was heard of at Spithead. Then she sailed;
      she sent in her letters to Plymouth, and her final greetings by a Falmouth cutter—poor Harry's
      wild scrawl in pencil, looking very sea-sick.</p>
<p>'Dear papa and all, good-bye. We are out of sight of land. Three years, and keep up a good
      heart. I shall soon be all right.</p>
<p>Your <hi>H. May.'</hi></p>
<p>It was inclosed in Mr. Ernescliffe's envelope, and with it came tidings that Harry's brave
      spirit was not failing, even under untoward circumstances, but he had struggled on deck, and
      tried to write, when all his contemporaries had given in; in fact, he was a fine
      fellow—everyone liked him, and Captain Gordon, though chary of commendation, had held him up
      to the other youngsters as an example of knowing what a sailor was meant to be like.</p>
<p>Margaret smiled, and cried over the news when she imparted it— but all serenely—and though
      she was glad to be alone, and wrote journals for Alan, when she could not send letters, she
      exerted herself to be the same sister as usual to the rest of the household, and not to give
      way to her wandering musings.</p>
<p>From one subject her attention never strayed. Ethel had never found any lack of sympathy in
      her for her Cocksmoor pursuits; but the change now showed, that where once Margaret had been
      interested, merely as a kind sister, she now had a personal concern, and she threw herself
      into all that related to it as her own chief interest and pursuit—becoming the foremost in
      devising plans, and arranging the best means of using Mr. Ernescliffe's benefaction.</p>
<p>The Elwood family had grown in the good opinion of the Mays. Charity had hobbled to Church,
      leaning on her father's arm, and being invited to dinner in the kitchen, the acquaintance had
      been improved, and nurse herself had pronounced her such a tidy, good sort of body, that it
      was a pity she had met with such a misfortune. If Miss Ethel brought in nothing but the like
      of her, they should be welcome—poor thing, how tired she was!</p>
<p>Nurse's opinions were apt to be sagacious, especially when in the face of her prejudices,
      and this gave Margaret confidence. Cherry proved to have been carefully taught by a good
      Clergyman and his wife, and to be of very different stamp from the persons to whom the girls
      were accustomed. They were charmed with her, and eagerly offered to supply her with
      books—respecting her the more when they found that Mr. Hazlewood had already lent her their
      chief favourites. Other and greater needs they had no power to fill up.</p>
<p>'It is so lone without the Church bells, you see, Miss,' said Mrs. Elwood. 'Our tower had a
      real fine peal, and my man was
      <pb n="306"/> one of the ringers. I seems quite lost without them, and there was Cherry, went
      a'most every day with the children.'</p>
<p>'Every day!' cried Mary, looking at her with respect.</p>
<p>'It was so near,' said Cherry, 'I could get there easy, and I got used to it when I was at
      school.'</p>
<p>'Did it not take up a great deal of time?' said Ethel.</p>
<p>'Why, you see, Ma'am, it came morning and night, out of working times, and I can't be
      stirring much.'</p>
<p>'Then you miss it sadly?' said Ethel.</p>
<p>'Yes, Ma'am, it made the day go on well like, and settled a body's mind, when I fretted for
      what could not be helped. But I try not to fret after it now, and Mr. Hazlewood said, if I did
      my best wherever I was, the Lord would still join our prayers together.'</p>
<p>Mr. Hazlewood was recollected by Mr. Wilmot as an old College friend, and a correspondence
      with him fully confirmed the favourable estimate of the Elwoods, and was decisive in
      determining that the day-school, with Alan's ten pounds as salary, and a penny a week from
      each child, should be offered to Cherry.</p>
<p>Mr. Hazlewood answered for her sound excellence, and aptitude for managing little children,
      though he did not promise genius, such as should fulfil the requirements of modern days. With
      these Cocksmoor could dispense at present; Cherry was humbly gratified, and her parents
      delighted with the honour and profit; there was a kitchen which afforded great facilities, and
      Richard and his carpenter managed the fitting to admiration; Margaret devised all manner of
      useful arrangements, settled matters with great earnestness, saw Cherry frequently, discussed
      plans, and learnt the history and character of each child, as thoroughly as Ethel herself. Mr.
      Ramsden himself came to the opening of the school, and said so much of the obligations of
      Cocksmoor to the young ladies, that Ethel would not have known which way to look, if Flora had
      not kindly borne the brunt of his compliments.</p>
<p>Everyone was pleased, except Mrs. Green, who took upon herself to set about various
      malicious reports of Cherry Elwood; but nobody cared for them, except Mrs. Elwood, who flew
      into such passions, that Ethel was quite disappointed in her, though not in Cherry, who meekly
      tried to silence her mother, begged the young ladies not to be vexed, and showed a quiet
      dignity that soon made the shafts of slander fall inoffensively.</p>
<p>All went well; there was a school instead of a hubbub, clean faces instead of dirty, shining
      hair instead of wild elf-locks, orderly children instead of little savages. The order and
      obedience that Ethel could not gain in six months, seemed impressed in six days by Cherry; the
      neat work made her popular with the mothers, her
      <pb n="307"/> firm gentleness won the hearts of the children, and the kitchen was filled not
      only with boys and girls from the quarry, but with some little ones from outlying cottages of
      Fordholm and Abbotstoke, and there was even a smart little farmer, who had been unbearable at
      home.</p>
<p>Margaret's unsuccessful Bath chair was lent to Cherry, and in it her scholars drew her to
      Stoneborough every Sunday, and slowly began to redeem their character with the ladies, who
      began to lose the habit of shrinking out of their way—the Stoneborough children did so
      instead; and Flora and Ethel were always bringing home stories of injustice to their scholars,
      fancied or real, and of triumphs in their having excelled any national school girl. The most
      stupid children at Cocksmoor always seemed to them wise in comparison with the Stoneborough
      girls, and the Sunday-school might have become to Ethel a school of rivalry, if Richard had
      not opened her eyes by a quiet observation, that the town girls seemed to fare as ill with
      her, as the Cocksmoor girls did with the town ladies. Then she caught herself up, tried to be
      candid, and found that she was not always impartial in her judgments. Why would competition
      mingle even in the best attempts?</p>
<p>Cherry did not so bring forward her scholars, that Ethel could have many triumphs of this
      dangerous kind. Indeed, Ethel was often vexed with her; for though she taught needlework
      admirably, and enforced correct reading, and reverent repetition, her strong provincial
      dialect was a stumbling-block; she could not put questions without book, and nothing would
      teach her Ethel's rational system of arithmetic. That she was a capital dame, and made the
      children very good, was allowed; but now and then, when mortified by hearing what was done at
      Stoneborough, Fordholm, or Abbotstoke, Ethel would make vigorous efforts, which resulted only
      in her coming home fuming at Cherry's 'outrageous dullness.'</p>
<p>These railings always hurt Margaret, who had made Cherry almost into a friend, and generally
      liked to have a visit from her during the Sunday, when she always dined with the servants.
      Then school questions, Cocksmoor news, and the tempers of the children, were talked over, and
      Cherry was now and then drawn into home reminiscences, and descriptions of the ways of her
      former school. There was no fear of spoiling her—notice from her superiors was natural to her,
      and she had the lady-likeness of womanly goodness, so as never to go beyond her own place. She
      had had many trials too, and Margaret learnt the true history of them, as she won Cherry's
      confidence, and entered into them, feeling their likeness, yet dissimilarity, to her own.</p>
<p>Cherry had been a brisk happy girl in a good place, resting in
      <pb n="308"/> one of the long engagements that often extend over half the life of a servant,
      enjoying the nod of her baker as he left his bread, and her walk from Church with him on
      alternate Sundays. But poor Cherry had been exposed to the perils of window cleaning; and,
      after a frightful fall, had wakened to find herself in a hospital, and her severe sufferings
      had left her a cripple for life.</p>
<p>And the baker had not been an Alan Ernescliffe! She did not complain of him—he had come to
      see her, and had been much grieved, but she had told him she could never be a useful wife; and
      before she had used her crutches, he was married to her pretty fellow-servant.</p>
<p>Cherry spoke very simply; she hoped it was better for Long, and believed Susan would make
      him a good wife. Ethel would have thought she did not feel, but Margaret knew better.</p>
<p>She stroked the thin slight fingers, and gently said, 'Poor Cherry!' and Cherry wiped away a
      tear, and said, 'Yes, Ma'am, thank you, it is best for him. I should not have wished him to
      grieve for what cannot be helped.'</p>
<p>'Resignation is the great comfort.'</p>
<p>'Yes, Ma'am. I have a great deal to be thankful for. I don't blame no one, but I do see how
      some, as are married, seem to get to think more of this world; and now and then I fancy I can
      see how it is best for me as it is.'</p>
<p>Margaret sighed, as she remembered certain thoughts before Alan's return.</p>
<p>'Then, Ma'am, there has been such goodness! I did vex at being a poor helpless thing,
      nothing but a burthen on father; and when we had to go from home, and Mr. and Mrs. Hazlewood
      and all, I can't tell you how bad it was, Ma'am.'</p>
<p>'Then you are comforted now?'</p>
<p>'Yes, Ma'am,' said Cherry, brightening. 'It seems as if He had given me something to do, and
      there are you and Mr. Richard, and Miss Ethel, to help. I should like, please God, to be of
      some good to those poor children.'</p>
<p>'I am sure you will, Cherry; I wish I could do as much.'</p>
<p>Cherry's tears had come again. 'Ah! Ma'am, you—' and she stopped short, and rose to depart.
      Margaret held out her hand to wish her good-bye. 'Please, Miss, I was thinking how Mr.
      Hazlewood said that God fits our place to us, and us to our place.'</p>
<p>'Thank you, Cherry, you are leaving me something to remember.'</p>
<p>And Margaret lay questioning with herself, whether the school-mistress had not been the most
      self-denying of the two; but withal gazing on the hoop of pearls which Alan had chosen as the
      ring of betrothal.</p>
<pb n="309"/>
<p>'The Pearl of great price,' murmured she to herself; 'if we hold that, the rest will soon
      matter but little! It remaineth that both they that have wives, be as they that have none, and
      they that weep, as though they wept not, and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not!
      If ever Alan and I have a home together upon earth, may all too confident joy be tempered by
      the fears that we have begun with! I hope this probation may make me less likely to be taken
      up with the cares and pleasures of his position, than I might have been last year. He is one
      who can best help the mind to go truly upward! But, oh! that voyage!'</p>
