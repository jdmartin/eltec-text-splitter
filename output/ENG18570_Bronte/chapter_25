<t:head>CHAPTER XXV.</t:head>
<t:p>IN two months more Frances had fulfilled the time of mourning for her aunt. One January
     morning—the first of the new year holidays—I went in a fiacre, accompanied only by M.
     Vandenhuten, to the Rue Notre Dame aux Neiges, and having alighted alone and walked upstairs, I
     found Frances apparently waiting for me, dressed in a style scarcely appropriate to that cold,
     bright, frosty day. Never till now had I seen her attired in any other than black or
     sad-coloured stuff; and there she stood by the window, clad all in white, and white of a most
     diaphanous texture; her array was very simple, to be sure, but it looked imposing and festal
     because it was so clear, full, and floating; a veil shadowed her head, and hung below her knee;
     a little wreath of pink flowers fastened it to her thickly tressed Grecian plait, and thence it
     fell softly on each side of her face. Singular to state, she was, or had been crying; when I
     asked her if she were ready, she said “Yes, monsieur,” with something very like a checked sob;
     and when I took a shawl, which lay on the table, and folded it round her, not only did tear
     after tear course unbidden down her cheek, but she shook to my ministration like a reed. I said
     I was sorry to see her in such low spirits, and requested to be allowed an insight into the
     origin thereof. She only said, “It was impossible to help it,” and then voluntarily, though
     hurriedly, putting her hand into mine, accompanied me out of the room, and ran downstairs with
     a quick, uncertain step, like one who was eager to get some formidable piece of business over.
     I put her into the fiacre. M. Vandenhuten received her, and seated her beside himself; we drove
     all together to the Protestant chapel, went through a certain service in the Common Prayer
     Book, and she and I came out married. M. Vandenhuten had given the bride away.</t:p>
<t:p>We took no bridal trip; our modesty, screened by the peaceful obscurity of our station, and
     the pleasant isolation of our circumstances, did not exact that additional precaution. We
     repaired at once to a small house I had taken in the faubourg nearest to that part of the city
     where the scene of our avocations lay.</t:p>
<t:p>Three or four hours after the wedding ceremony, Frances, divested of her bridal snow, and
     attired in a pretty lilac gown of warmer materials, a piquant black silk apron, and a lace
     collar with some finishing decoration of lilac ribbon, was kneeling on the carpet of a neatly
     furnished though not spacious parlour, arranging on the shelves of a chiffoniere some books,
     which I handed to her from the table. It was snowing fast out of doors; the afternoon had
     turned out wild and cold; the leaden sky seemed full of drifts, and the street was already
     ankle-deep in the white downfall. Our fire burned bright, our new habitation looked brilliantly
     clean and fresh, the furniture was all arranged, and there were but some articles of glass,
     china, books, etc., to put in order. Frances found in this business occupation till
     tea-time, and then, after I had distinctly instructed her how to make a cup of tea in rational
     English style, and after she had got over the dismay occasioned by seeing such an extravagant
     amount of material put into the pot, she administered to me a proper British repast, at which
     there wanted neither candles nor urn, firelight nor comfort.</t:p>
<t:p>Our week’s holiday glided by, and we readdressed ourselves to labour. Both my wife and I
     began in good earnest with the notion that we were working people, destined to earn our bread
     by exertion, and that of the most assiduous kind. Our days were thoroughly occupied; we used to
     part every morning at eight o’clock, and not meet again till five P.M.; but into what sweet
     rest did the turmoil of each busy day decline! Looking down the vista of memory, I see the
     evenings passed in that little parlour like a long string of rubies circling the dusky brow of
     the past. Unvaried were they as each cut gem, and like each gem brilliant and burning.</t:p>
<t:p>A year and a half passed. One morning (it was a <t:hi>fête</t:hi>, and we had the day to
     ourselves) Frances said to me, with a suddenness peculiar to her when she had been thinking
     long on a subject, and at last, having come to a conclusion, wished to test its soundness by
     the touchstone of my judgment:—</t:p>
<t:p>“I don’t work enough.”</t:p>
<t:p>“What now?” demanded I, looking up from my coffee, which I had been deliberately stirring
     while enjoying, in anticipation, a walk I proposed to take with Frances, that fine summer day
     (it was June), to a certain farmhouse in the country, where we were to dine. “What now?” and I
     saw at once, in the serious ardour of her face, a project of vital importance.</t:p>
<t:p>“I am not satisfied,” returned she; “you are now earning eight thousand francs a year” (it
     was true; my efforts, punctuality, the fame of my pupils’ progress, the publicity of my
     station, had so far helped me on), “while I am still at my miserable twelve hundred francs. I
      <t:emph>can</t:emph> do better, and I <t:emph>will</t:emph>.”</t:p>
<t:p>“You work as long and as diligently as I do, Frances.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes, monsieur, but I am not working in the right way, and I am convinced of it.”</t:p>
<t:p>“You wish to change—you have a plan for progress in your mind; go and put on your bonnet;
     and, while we take our walk, you shall tell me of it.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes, monsieur.”</t:p>
<t:p>She went—as docile as a well-trained child; she was a curious mixture of tractability and
     firmness: I sat thinking about her, and wondering what her plan could be, when she
     re-entered.</t:p>
<t:p>“Monsieur, I have given Minnie” (our bonne) “leave to go out too, as it is so very fine; so
     will you be kind enough to lock the door, and take the key with you?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Kiss me, Mrs. Crimsworth,” was my not very apposite reply; but she looked so engaging in her
     light summer dress and little cottage bonnet, and her manner in speaking to me was then, as
     always, so unaffectedly and suavely respectful, that my heart expanded at the sight of her, and
     a kiss seemed necessary to content its importunity.</t:p>
<t:p>“There, monsieur.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Why do you always call me ‘Monsieur’? Say, ‘William.’”</t:p>
<t:p>“I cannot pronounce your W; besides, ‘Monsieur’ belongs to you; I like it best.”</t:p>
<t:p>Minnie having departed in clean cap and smart shawl, we, too, set out, leaving the house
     solitary and silent—silent, at least, but for the ticking of the clock. We were soon clear of
     Brussels; the fields received us, and then the lanes, remote from carriage-resounding
      <t:hi>chaussées</t:hi>. Ere long we came upon a nook, so rural, green, and secluded, it might have
     been a spot in some pastoral English province; a bank of short and mossy grass, under a
     hawthorn, offered a seat too tempting to be declined; we took it, and when we had admired and
     examined some English-looking wild-flowers growing at our feet, I recalled Frances’ attention
     and my own to the topic touched on at breakfast.</t:p>
<t:p>“What was her plan?” A natural one—the next step to be mounted by us, or, at least, by her,
     if she wanted to rise in her profession. She proposed to begin a school. We already had the
     means for commencing on a careful scale, having lived greatly within our income. We possessed,
     too, by this time, an extensive and eligible connection, in the sense advantageous to our
     business; for, though our circle of visiting acquaintance continued as limited as ever, we were
     now widely known in schools and families as teachers. When Frances had developed her plan, she
     intimated, in some closing sentences, her hopes for the future. If we only had good health and
     tolerable success, me might, she was sure, in time realize an independency; and that, perhaps,
     before we were too old to enjoy it; then both she and I would rest; and what was to hinder us
     from going to live in England? England was still her Promised Land.</t:p>
<t:p>I put no obstacle in her way; raised no objection; I knew she was not one who could live
     quiescent and inactive, or even comparatively inactive. Duties she must have to fulfil, and
     important duties; work to do—and exciting, absorbing, profitable work; strong faculties stirred
     in her frame, and they demanded full nourishment, free exercise: mine was not the hand ever to
     starve or cramp them; no, I delighted in offering them sustenance, and in clearing them wider
     space for action.</t:p>
<t:p>“You have conceived a plan, Frances,” said I, “and a good plan; execute it; you have my free
     consent, and wherever and whenever my assistance is wanted, ask and you shall have.”</t:p>
<t:p>Frances’ eyes thanked me almost with tears; just a sparkle or two, soon brushed away; she
     possessed herself of my hand too, and held it for some time very close clasped in both her own,
     but she said no more than “Thank you, monsieur.”</t:p>
<t:p>We passed a divine day, and came home late, lighted by a full summer moon.</t:p>
<t:p>Ten years rushed now upon me with dusty, vibrating, unresting wings; years of bustle, action,
     unslacked endeavour; years in which I and my wife, having launched ourselves in the full career
     of progress, as progress whirls on in European capitals, scarcely knew repose, were strangers
     to amusement, never thought of indulgence, and yet, as our course ran side by side, as we
     marched hand in hand, we neither murmured, repented, nor faltered. Hope indeed cheered us;
     health kept us up; harmony of thought and deed smoothed many difficulties, and finally, success
     bestowed every now and then encouraging reward on diligence. Our school became one of the most
     popular in Brussels, and as by degrees we raised our terms and elevated our system of
     education, our choice of pupils grew more select, and at length included the children of the
     best families in Belgium. We had too an excellent connection in England, first opened by the
     unsolicited recommendation of Mr. Hunsden, who having been over, and having abused me for my
     prosperity in set terms, went back, and soon after sent a leash of young ——shire heiresses—his
     cousins; as he said “to be polished off by Mrs. Crimsworth.”</t:p>
<t:p>As to this same Mrs. Crimsworth, in one sense she was become another woman, though in another
     she remained unchanged. So different was she under different circumstances. I seemed to possess
     two wives. The faculties of her nature, already disclosed when I married her, remained fresh
     and fair; but other faculties shot up strong, branched out broad, and quite altered the
     external character of the plant. Firmness, activity, and enterprise, covered with grave
     foliage, poetic feeling and fervour; but these flowers were still there, preserved pure and
     dewy under the umbrage of later growth and hardier nature: perhaps I only in the world knew the
     secret of their existence, but to me they were ever ready to yield an exquisite fragrance and
     present a beauty as chaste as radiant.</t:p>
<t:p>In the daytime my house and establishment were conducted by Madame the directress, a stately
     and elegant woman, bearing much anxious thought on her large brow; much calculated dignity in
     her serious mien: immediately after breakfast I used to part with this lady; I went to my
     college, she to her schoolroom; returning for an hour in the course of the day, I found her
     always in class, intently occupied; silence, industry, observance, attending on her presence.
     When not actually teaching, she was overlooking and guiding by eye and gesture; she then
     appeared vigilant and solicitous. When communicating instruction, her aspect was more animated;
     she seemed to feel a certain enjoyment in the occupation. The language in which she addressed
     her pupils, though simple and unpretending, was never trite or dry; she did not speak from
     routine formulas—she made her own phrases as she went on, and very nervous and impressive
     phrases they frequently were; often, when elucidating favourite points of history, or
     geography, she would wax genuinely eloquent in her earnestness. Her pupils, or at least the
     elder and more intelligent amongst them, recognized well the language of a superior mind; they
     felt too, and some of them received the impression of elevated sentiments; there was little
     fondling between mistress and girls, but some of Frances’ pupils in time learnt to love her
     sincerely, all of them beheld her with respect; her general demeanour towards them was serious;
     sometimes benignant when they pleased her with their progress and attention, always
     scrupulously refined and considerate. In cases where reproof or punishment was called for she
     was usually forbearing enough; but if any took advantage of that forbearance, which sometimes
     happened, a sharp, sudden and lightning-like severity taught the culprit the extent of the
     mistake committed. Sometimes a gleam of tenderness softened her eyes and manner, but this was
     rare; only when a pupil was sick, or when it pined after home, or in the case of some little
     motherless child, or of one much poorer than its companions, whose scanty wardrobe and mean
     appointments brought on it the contempt of the jewelled young countesses and silk-clad misses.
     Over such feeble fledglings the directress spread a wing of kindliest protection: it was to
     their bedside she came at night to tuck them warmly in; it was after them she looked in winter
     to see that they always had a comfortable seat by the stove; it was they who by turns were
     summoned to the salon to receive some little dole of cake or fruit—to sit on a footstool at the
     fireside—to enjoy home comforts, and almost home liberty, for an evening together—to be spoken
     to gently and softly, comforted, encouraged, cherished—and when bedtime came, dismissed with a
     kiss of true tenderness. As to Julia and Georgiana G——, daughters of an English baronet, as to
     Mdlle. Mathilde de ——, heiress of a Belgian count, and sundry other children of patrician race,
     the directress was careful of them as of the others, anxious for their progress, as for that of
     the rest—but it never seemed to enter her head to distinguish them by a mark of preference; one
     girl of noble blood she loved dearly—a young Irish baroness—lady Catherine ——; but it was for
     her enthusiastic heart and clever head, for her generosity and her genius, the title and rank
     went for nothing.</t:p>
<t:p>My afternoons were spent also in college, with the exception of an hour that my wife daily
     exacted of me for her establishment, and with which she would not dispense. She said that I
     must spend that time amongst her pupils to learn their characters, to be <t:hi>au courant</t:hi>
     with everything that was passing in the house, to become interested in what interested her, to
     be able to give her my opinion on knotty points when she required it, and this she did
     constantly, never allowing my interest in the pupils to fall asleep, and never making any
     change of importance without my cognizance and consent. She delighted to sit by me when I gave
     my lessons (lessons in literature), her hands folded on her knee, the most fixedly attentive of
     any present. She rarely addressed me in class; when she did it was with an air of marked
     deference; it was her pleasure, her joy to make me still the master in all things.</t:p>
<t:p>At six o’clock P.M. my daily labours ceased. I then came home, for my home was my heaven;
     ever at that hour, as I entered our private sitting-room, the lady-directress vanished from
     before my eyes, and Frances Henri, my own little lace-mender, was magically restored to my
     arms; much disappointed she would have been if her master had not been as constant to the tryst
     as herself, and if his truthfull kiss had not been prompt to answer her soft, “Bon soir,
     monsieur.”</t:p>
<t:p>Talk French to me she would, and many a punishment she has had for her wilfulness. I fear the
     choice of chastisement must have been injudicious, for instead of correcting the fault, it
     seemed to encourage its renewal. Our evenings were our own; that recreation was necessary to
     refresh our strength for the due discharge of our duties; sometimes we spent them all in
     conversation, and my young Genevese, now that she was thoroughly accustomed to her English
     professor, now that she loved him too absolutely to fear him much, reposed in him a confidence
     so unlimited that topics of conversation could no more be wanting with him than subjects for
     communion with her own heart. In those moments, happy as a bird with its mate, she would show
     me what she had of vivacity, of mirth, of originality in her well-dowered nature. She would
     show, too, some stores of raillery, of “malice,” and would vex, tease, pique me sometimes about
     what she called my “bizarreries anglaises,” my “caprices insulaires,” with a wild and witty
     wickedness that made a perfect white demon of her while it lasted. This was rare, however, and
     the elfish freak was always short: sometimes when driven a little hard in the war of words—for
     her tongue did ample justice to the pith, the point, the delicacy of her native French, in
     which language she always attacked me—I used to turn upon her with my old decision, and arrest
     bodily the sprite that teased me. Vain idea! no sooner had I grasped hand or arm than the elf
     was gone; the provocative smile quenched in the expressive brown eyes, and a ray of gentle
     homage shone under the lids in its place. I had seized a mere vexing fairy, and found a
     submissive and supplicating little mortal woman in my arms. Then I made her get a book, and
     read English to me for an hour by way of penance. I frequently dosed her with Wordsworth in
     this way, and Wordsworth steadied her soon; she had a difficulty in comprehending his deep,
     serene, and sober mind; his language, too, was not facile to her; she had to ask questions, to
     sue for explanations, to be like a child and a novice, and to acknowledge me as her senior and
     director. Her instinct instantly penetrated and possessed the meaning of more ardent and
     imaginative writers. Byron excited her; Scott she loved; Wordsworth only she puzzled at,
     wondered over, and hesitated to pronounce an opinion upon.</t:p>
<t:p>But whether she read to me, or talked with me; whether she teased me in French, or entreated
     me in English; whether she jested with wit, or inquired with deference; narrated with interest,
     or listened with attention; whether she smiled at me or on me, always at nine o’clock I was
     left abandoned. She would extricate herself from my arms, quit my side, take her lamp, and be
     gone. Her mission was upstairs; I have followed her sometimes and watched her. First she opened
     the door of the dortoir (the pupils’ chamber), noiselessly she glided up the long room between
     the two rows of white beds, surveyed all the sleepers; if any were wakeful, especially if any
     were sad, spoke to them and soothed them; stood some minutes to ascertain that all was safe and
     tranquil; trimmed the watch-light which burned in the apartment all night, then withdrew,
     closing the door behind her without sound. Thence she glided to our own chamber; it had a
     little cabinet within; this she sought; there, too, appeared a bed, but one, and that a very
     small one; her face (the night I followed and observed her) changed as she approached this tiny
     couch; from grave it warmed to earnest; she shaded with one hand the lamp she held in the
     other; she bent above the pillow and hung over a child asleep; its slumber (that evening at
     least, and usually, I believe) was sound and calm; no tear wet its dark eyelashes; no fever
     heated its round cheek; no ill dream discomposed its budding features. Frances gazed, she did
     not smile, and yet the deepest delight filled, flushed her face; feeling pleasurable, powerful,
     worked in her whole frame, which still was motionless. I saw, indeed, her heart heave, her lips
     were a little apart, her breathing grew somewhat hurried; the child smiled; then at last the
     mother smiled too, and said in low soliloquy, “God bless my little son!” She stooped closer
     over him, breathed the softest of kisses on his brow, covered his minute hand with hers, and at
     last started up and came away. I regained the parlour before her. Entering it two minutes later
     she said quietly as she put down her extinguished lamp—</t:p>
<t:p>“Victor rests well: he smiled in his sleep; he has your smile, monsieur.”</t:p>
<t:p>The said Victor was of course her own boy, born in the third year of our marriage: his
     Christian name had been given him in honour of M. Vandenhuten, who continued always our trusty
     and well-beloved friend.</t:p>
<t:p>Frances was then a good and dear wife to me, because I was to her a good, just, and faithful
     husband. What she would have been had she married a harsh, envious, careless man—a profligate,
     a prodigal, a drunkard, or a tyrant—is another question, and one which I once propounded to
     her. Her answer, given after some reflection, was—</t:p>
<t:p>“I should have tried to endure the evil or cure it for awhile; and when I found it
     intolerable and incurable, I should have left my torturer suddenly and silently.”</t:p>
<t:p>“And if law or might had forced you back again?”</t:p>
<t:p>“What, to a drunkard, a profligate, a selfish spendthrift, an unjust fool?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I would have gone back; again assured myself whether or not his vice and my misery were
     capable of remedy; and if not, have left him again.”</t:p>
<t:p>“And if again forced to return, and compelled to abide?”</t:p>
<t:p>“I don’t know,” she said, hastily. “Why do you ask me, monsieur?”</t:p>
<t:p>I would have an answer, because I saw a strange kind of spirit in her eye, whose voice I
     determined to waken.</t:p>
<t:p>“Monsieur, if a wife’s nature loathes that of the man she is wedded to, marriage must be
     slavery. Against slavery all right thinkers revolt, and though torture be the price of
     resistance, torture must be dared: though the only road to freedom lie through the gates of
     death, those gates must be passed; for freedom is indispensable. Then, monsieur, I would resist
     as far as my strength permitted; when that strength failed I should be sure of a refuge. Death
     would certainly screen me both from bad laws and their consequences.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Voluntary death, Frances?”</t:p>
<t:p>“No, monsieur. I’d have courage to live out every throe of anguish fate assigned me, and
     principle to contend for justice and liberty to the last.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I see you would have made no patient Grizzle. And now, supposing fate had merely assigned
     you the lot of an old maid, what then? How would you have liked celibacy?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Not much, certainly. An old maid’s life must doubtless be void and vapid—her heart strained
     and empty. Had I been an old maid I should have spent existence in efforts to fill the void and
     ease the aching. I should have probably failed, and died weary and disappointed, despised and
     of no account, like other single women. But I’m not an old maid,” she added quickly. “I should
     have been, though, but for my master. I should never have suited any man but Professor
     Crimsworth—no other gentleman, French, English, or Belgian, would have thought me amiable or
     handsome; and I doubt whether I should have cared for the approbation of many others, if I
     could have obtained it. Now, I have been Professor Crimsworth’s wife eight years, and what is
     he in my eyes? Is he honourable, beloved ——?” She stopped, her voice was cut off, her eyes
     suddenly suffused. She and I were standing side by side; she threw her arms round me, and
     strained me to her heart with passionate earnestness: the energy of her whole being glowed in
     her dark and then dilated eye, and crimsoned her animated cheek; her look and movement were
     like inspiration; in one there was such a flash, in the other such a power. Half an hour
     afterwards, when she had become calm, I asked where all that wild vigour was gone which had
     transformed her ere-while and made her glance so thrilling and ardent—her action so rapid and
     strong. She looked down, smiling softly and passively:—</t:p>
<t:p>“I cannot tell where it is gone, monsieur,” said she, “but I know that, whenever it is
     wanted, it will come back again.”</t:p>
<t:p>Behold us now at the close of the ten years, and we have realized an independency. The
     rapidity with which we attained this end had its origin in three reasons:— Firstly, we worked
     so hard for it; secondly, we had no incumbrances to delay success; thirdly, as soon as we had
     capital to invest, two well-skilled counsellors, one in Belgium, one in England, viz.
     Vandenhuten and Hunsden, gave us each a word of advice as to the sort of investment to be
     chosen. The suggestion made was judicious; and, being promptly acted on, the result proved
     gainful—I need not say how gainful; I communicated details to Messrs. Vandenhuten and Hunsden;
     nobody else can be interested in hearing them.</t:p>
<t:p>Accounts being wound up, and our professional connection disposed of, we both agreed that, as
     mammon was not our master, nor his service that in which we desired to spend our lives; as our
     desires were temperate, and our habits unostentatious, we had now abundance to live
     on—abundance to leave our boy; and should besides always have a balance on hand, which,
     properly managed by right sympathy and unselfish activity, might help philanthropy in her
     enterprises, and put solace into the hand of charity.</t:p>
<t:p>To England we now resolved to take wing; we arrived there safely; Frances realized the dream
     of her lifetime. We spent a whole summer and autumn in travelling from end to end of the
     British islands, and afterwards passed a winter in London. Then we thought it high time to fix
     our residence. My heart yearned towards my native county of ——shire; and it is in ——shire I now
     live; it is in the library of my own home I am now writing. That home lies amid a sequestered
     and rather hilly region, thirty miles removed from X——; a region whose verdure the smoke of
     mills has not yet sullied, whose waters still run pure, whose swells of moorland preserve in
     some ferny glens that lie between them the very primal wildness of nature, her moss, her
     bracken, her blue-bells, her scents of reed and heather, her free and fresh breezes. My house
     is a picturesque and not too spacious dwelling, with low and long windows, a trellised and
     leaf-veiled porch over the front door, just now, on this summer evening, looking like an arch
     of roses and ivy. The garden is chiefly laid out in lawn, formed of the sod of the hills, with
     herbage short and soft as moss, full of its own peculiar flowers, tiny and starlike, imbedded
     in the minute embroidery of their fine foliage. At the bottom of the sloping garden there is a
     wicket, which opens upon a lane as green as the lawn, very long, shady, and little frequented;
     on the turf of this lane generally appear the first daisies of spring—whence its name—Daisy
     Lane; serving also as a distinction to the house.</t:p>
<t:p>It terminates (the lane I mean) in a valley full of wood; which wood—chiefly oak and
     beech—spreads shadowy about the vicinage of a very old mansion, one of the Elizabethan
     structures, much larger, as well as more antique than Daisy Lane, the property and residence of
     an individual familiar both to me and to the reader. Yes, in Hunsden Wood—for so are those
     glades and that grey building, with many gables and more chimneys, named—abides Yorke Hunsden,
     still unmarried; never, I suppose, having yet found his ideal, though I know at least a score
     of young ladies within a circuit of forty miles, who would be willing to assist him in the
     search.</t:p>
<t:p>The estate fell to him by the death of his father, five years since; he has given up trade,
     after having made by it sufficient to pay off some incumbrances by which the family heritage
     was burdened. I say he abides here, but I do not think he is resident above five months out of
     the twelve; he wanders from land to land, and spends some part of each winter in town: he
     frequently brings visitors with him when he comes to ——shire, and these visitors are often
     foreigners; sometimes he has a German metaphysician, sometimes a French savant; he had once a
     dissatisfied and savage-looking Italian, who neither sang nor played, and of whom Frances
     affirmed that he had “tout l’air d’un conspirateur.”</t:p>
<t:p>What English guests Hunsden invites, are all either men of Birmingham or Manchester—hard men,
     seemingly knit up in one thought, whose talk is of free trade. The foreign visitors, too, are
     politicians; they take a wider theme—European progress—the spread of liberal sentiments over
     the Continent; on their mental tablets, the names of Russia, Austria, and the Pope, are
     inscribed in red ink. I have heard some of them talk vigorous sense—yea, I have been present at
     polyglot discussions in the old, oak-lined dining-room at Hunsden Wood, where a singular
     insight was given of the sentiments entertained by resolute minds respecting old northern
     despotisms, and old southern superstitions: also, I have heard much twaddle, enounced chiefly
     in French and Deutsch, but let that pass. Hunsden himself tolerated the drivelling theorists;
     with the practical men he seemed leagued hand and heart.</t:p>
<t:p>When Hunsden is staying alone at the Wood (which seldom happens) he generally finds his way
     two or three times a week to Daisy Lane. He has a philanthropic motive for coming to smoke his
     cigar in our porch on summer evenings; he says he does it to kill the earwigs amongst the
     roses, with which insects, but for his benevolent fumigations, he intimates we should certainly
     be overrun. On wet days, too, we are almost sure to see him; according to him, it gets on time
     to work me into lunacy by treading on my mental corns, or to force from Mrs. Crimsworth
     revelations of the dragon within her, by insulting the memory of Hofer and Tell.</t:p>
<t:p>We also go frequently to Hunsden Wood, and both I and Frances relish a visit there highly. If
     there are other guests, their characters are an interesting study; their conversation is
     exciting and strange; the absence of all local narrowness both in the host and his chosen
     society gives a metropolitan, almost a cosmopolitan freedom and largeness to the talk. Hunsden
     himself is a polite man in his own house: he has, when he chooses to employ it, an
     inexhaustible power of entertaining guests; his very mansion too is interesting, the rooms look
     storied, the passages legendary, the low-ceiled chambers, with their long rows of diamond-paned
     lattices, have an old-world, haunted air: in his travels he has collected stores of articles of
      <t:hi>vertu</t:hi>, which are well and tastefully disposed in his panelled or tapestried rooms: I
     have seen there one or two pictures, and one or two pieces of statuary which many an
     aristocratic connoisseur might have envied.</t:p>
<t:p>When I and Frances have dined and spent an evening with Hunsden, he often walks home with us.
     His wood is large, and some of the timber is old and of huge growth. There are winding ways in
     it which, pursued through glade and brake, make the walk back to Daisy Lane a somewhat long
     one. Many a time, when we have had the benefit of a full moon, and when the night has been mild
     and balmy, when, moreover, a certain nightingale has been singing, and a certain stream, hid in
     alders, has lent the song a soft accompaniment, the remote church-bell of the one hamlet in a
     district of ten miles, has tolled midnight ere the lord of the wood left us at our porch.
     Free-flowing was his talk at such hours, and far more quiet and gentle than in the day-time and
     before numbers. He would then forget politics and discussion, and would dwell on the past times
     of his house, on his family history, on himself and his own feelings—subjects each and all
     invested with a peculiar zest, for they were each and all unique. One glorious night in June,
     after I had been taunting him about his ideal bride and asking him when she would come and
     graft her foreign beauty on the old Hunsden oak, he answered suddenly—</t:p>
<t:p>“You call her ideal; but see, here is her shadow; and there cannot be a shadow without a
     substance.”</t:p>
<t:p>He had led us from the depth of the “winding way” into a glade from whence the beeches
     withdrew, leaving it open to the sky; an unclouded moon poured her light into this glade, and
     Hunsden held out under her beam an ivory miniature.</t:p>
<t:p>Frances, with eagerness, examined it first; then she gave it to me—still, however, pushing
     her little face close to mine, and seeking in my eyes what I thought of the portrait. I thought
     it represented a very handsome and very individual-looking female face, with, as he had once
     said, “straight and harmonious features.” It was dark; the hair, raven-black, swept not only
     from the brow, but from the temples—seemed thrust away carelessly, as if such beauty dispensed
     with, nay, despised arrangement. The Italian eye looked straight into you, and an independent,
     determined eye it was; the mouth was as firm as fine; the chin ditto. On the back of the
     miniature was gilded “Lucia.”</t:p>
<t:p>“That is a real head,” was my conclusion.</t:p>
<t:p>Hunsden smiled.</t:p>
<t:p>“I think so,” he replied. “All was real in Lucia.”</t:p>
<t:p>“And she was somebody you would have liked to marry—but could not?”</t:p>
<t:p>“I should certainly have liked to marry her, and that I <t:emph>have</t:emph> not done so is a
     proof that I <t:emph>could</t:emph> not.”</t:p>
<t:p>He repossessed himself of the miniature, now again in Frances’ hand, and put it away.</t:p>
<t:p>“What do <t:emph>you</t:emph> think of it?” he asked of my wife, as he buttoned his coat over
     it.</t:p>
<t:p>“I am sure Lucia once wore chains and broke them,” was the strange answer. “I do not mean
     matrimonial chains,” she added, correcting herself, as if she feared mis-interpretation, “but
     social chains of some sort. The face is that of one who has made an effort, and a successful
     and triumphant effort, to wrest some vigorous and valued faculty from insupportable constraint;
     and when Lucia’s faculty got free, I am certain it spread wide pinions and carried her higher
     than—” she hesitated.</t:p>
<t:p>“Than what?” demanded Hunsden.</t:p>
<t:p>“Than ‘les convenances’ permitted you to follow.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I think you grow spiteful—impertinent.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Lucia has trodden the stage,” continued Frances. “You never seriously thought of marrying
     her; you admired her originality, her fearlessness, her energy of body and mind; you delighted
     in her talent, whatever that was, whether song, dance, or dramatic representation; you
     worshipped her beauty, which was of the sort after your own heart: but I am sure she filled a
     sphere from whence you would never have thought of taking a wife.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Ingenious,” remarked Hunsden; “whether true or not is another question. Meantime, don’t you
     feel your little lamp of a spirit wax very pale, beside such a girandole as Lucia’s?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Candid, at least; and the Professor will soon be dissatisfied with the dim light you
     give?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Will you, monsieur?”</t:p>
<t:p>“My sight was always too weak to endure a blaze, Frances,” and we had now reached the
     wicket.</t:p>
<t:p>I said, a few pages back, that this is a sweet summer evening; it is—there has been a series
     of lovely days, and this is the loveliest; the hay is just carried from my fields, its perfume
     still lingers in the air. Frances proposed to me, an hour or two since, to take tea out on the
     lawn; I see the round table, loaded with china, placed under a certain beech; Hunsden is
     expected—nay, I hear he is come—there is his voice, laying down the law on some point with
     authority; that of Frances replies; she opposes him of course. They are disputing about Victor,
     of whom Hunsden affirms that his mother is making a milksop. Mrs. Crimsworth retaliates:—</t:p>
<t:p>“Better a thousand times he should be a milksop than what he, Hunsden, calls ‘a fine lad;’
     and moreover she says that if Hunsden were to become a fixture in the neighbourhood, and were
     not a mere comet, coming and going, no one knows how, when, where, or why, she should be quite
     uneasy till she had got Victor away to a school at least a hundred miles off; for that with his
     mutinous maxims and unpractical dogmas, he would ruin a score of children.”</t:p>
<t:p>I have a word to say of Victor ere I shut this manuscript in my desk—but it must be a brief
     one, for I hear the tinkle of silver on porcelain.</t:p>
<t:p>Victor is as little of a pretty child as I am of a handsome man, or his mother of a fine
     woman; he is pale and spare, with large eyes, as dark as those of Frances, and as deeply set as
     mine. His shape is symmetrical enough, but slight; his health is good. I never saw a child
     smile less than he does, nor one who knits such a formidable brow when sitting over a book that
     interests him, or while listening to tales of adventure, peril, or wonder, narrated by his
     mother, Hunsden, or myself. But though still, he is not unhappy—though serious, not morose; he
     has a susceptibility to pleasurable sensations almost too keen, for it amounts to enthusiasm.
     He learned to read in the old-fashioned way out of a spelling-book at his mother’s knee, and as
     he got on without driving by that method, she thought it unnecessary to buy him ivory letters,
     or to try any of the other inducements to learning now deemed indispensable. When he could
     read, he became a glutton of books, and is so still. His toys have been few, and he has never
     wanted more. For those he possesses, he seems to have contracted a partiality amounting to
     affection; this feeling, directed towards one or two living animals of the house, strengthens
     almost to a passion.</t:p>
<t:p>Mr. Hunsden gave him a mastiff cub, which he called Yorke, after the donor; it grew to a
     superb dog, whose fierceness, however, was much modified by the companionship and caresses of
     its young master. He would go nowhere, do nothing without Yorke; Yorke lay at his feet while he
     learned his lessons, played with him in the garden, walked with him in the lane and wood, sat
     near his chair at meals, was fed always by his own hand, was the first thing he sought in the
     morning, the last he left at night. Yorke accompanied Mr. Hunsden one day to X——, and was
     bitten in the street by a dog in a rabid state. As soon as Hunsden had brought him home, and
     had informed me of the circumstance, I went into the yard and shot him where he lay licking his
     wound: he was dead in an instant; he had not seen me level the gun; I stood behind him. I had
     scarcely been ten minutes in the house, when my ear was struck with sounds of anguish: I
     repaired to the yard once more, for they proceeded thence. Victor was kneeling beside his dead
     mastiff, bent over it, embracing its bull-like neck, and lost in a passion of the wildest woe:
     he saw me.</t:p>
<t:p>“Oh, papa, I’ll never forgive you! I’ll never forgive you!” was his exclamation. “You shot
     Yorke—I saw it from the window. I never believed you could be so cruel—I can love you no
     more!”</t:p>
<t:p>I had much ado to explain to him, with a steady voice, the stern necessity of the deed; he
     still, with that inconsolable and bitter accent which I cannot render, but which pierced my
     heart, repeated—</t:p>
<t:p>“He might have been cured—you should have tried—you should have burnt the wound with a hot
     iron, or covered it with caustic. You gave no time; and now it is too late—he is dead!”</t:p>
<t:p>He sank fairly down on the senseless carcase; I waited patiently a long while, till his grief
     had somewhat exhausted him; and then I lifted him in my arms and carried him to his mother,
     sure that she would comfort him best. She had witnessed the whole scene from a window; she
     would not come out for fear of increasing my difficulties by her emotion, but she was ready now
     to receive him. She took him to her kind heart, and on to her gentle lap; consoled him but with
     her lips, her eyes, her soft embrace, for some time; and then, when his sobs diminished, told
     him that Yorke had felt no pain in dying, and that if he had been left to expire naturally, his
     end would have been most horrible; above all, she told him that I was not cruel (for that idea
     seemed to give exquisite pain to poor Victor), that it was my affection for Yorke and him which
     had made me act so, and that I was now almost heart-broken to see him weep thus bitterly.</t:p>
<t:p>Victor would have been no true son of his father, had these considerations, these reasons,
     breathed in so low, so sweet a tone—married to caresses so benign, so tender—to looks so
     inspired with pitying sympathy—produced no effect on him. They did produce an effect: he grew
     calmer, rested his face on her shoulder, and lay still in her arms. Looking up, shortly, he
     asked his mother to tell him over again what she had said about Yorke having suffered no pain,
     and my not being cruel; the balmy words being repeated, he again pillowed his cheek on her
     breast, and was again tranquil.</t:p>
<t:p>Some hours after, he came to me in my library, asked if I forgave him, and desired to be
     reconciled. I drew the lad to my side, and there I kept him a good while, and had much talk
     with him, in the course of which he disclosed many points of feeling and thought I approved of
     in my son. I found, it is true, few elements of the “good fellow” or the “fine fellow” in him;
     scant sparkles of the spirit which loves to flash over the wine cup, or which kindles the
     passions to a destroying fire; but I saw in the soil of his heart healthy and swelling germs of
     compassion, affection, fidelity. I discovered in the garden of his intellect a rich growth of
     wholesome principles—reason, justice, moral courage, promised, if not blighted, a fertile
     bearing. So I bestowed on his large forehead, and on his cheek—still pale with tears—a proud
     and contented kiss, and sent him away comforted. Yet I saw him the next day laid on the mound
     under which Yorke had been buried, his face covered with his hands; he was melancholy for some
     weeks, and more than a year elapsed before he would listen to any proposal of having another
     dog.</t:p>
<t:p>Victor learns fast. He must soon go to Eton, where, I suspect, his first year or two will be
     utter wretchedness: to leave me, his mother, and his home, will give his heart an agonized
     wrench; then, the fagging will not suit him—but emulation, thirst after knowledge, the glory of
     success, will stir and reward him in time. Meantime, I feel in myself a strong repugnance to
     fix the hour which will uproot my sole olive branch, and transplant it far from me; and, when I
     speak to Frances on the subject, I am heard with a kind of patient pain, as though I alluded to
     some fearful operation, at which her nature shudders, but from which her fortitude will not
     permit her to recoil. The step must, however, be taken, and it shall be; for, though Frances
     will not make a milksop of her son, she will accustom him to a style of treatment, a
     forbearance, a congenial tenderness, he will meet with from none else. She sees, as I also see,
     a something in Victor’s temper—a kind of electrical ardour and power—which emits, now and then,
     ominous sparks; Hunsden calls it his spirit, and says it should not be curbed. I call it the
     leaven of the offending Adam, and consider that it should be, if not <t:emph>whipped</t:emph> out
     of him, at least soundly disciplined; and that he will be cheap of any amount of either bodily
     or mental suffering which will ground him radically in the art of self-control. Frances gives
     this something in her son’s marked character no name; but when it appears in the grinding of
     his teeth, in the glittering of his eye, in the fierce revolt of feeling against
     disappointment, mischance, sudden sorrow, or supposed injustice, she folds him to her breast,
     or takes him to walk with her alone in the wood; then she reasons with him like any
     philosopher, and to reason Victor is ever accessible; then she looks at him with eyes of love,
     and by love Victor can be infallibly subjugated; but will reason or love be the weapons with
     which in future the world will meet his violence? Oh, no! for that flash in his black eye—for
     that cloud on his bony brow—for that compression of his statuesque lips, the lad will some day
     get blows instead of blandishments—kicks instead of kisses; then for the fit of mute fury which
     will sicken his body and madden his soul; then for the ordeal of merited and salutary
     suffering, out of which he will come (I trust) a wiser and a better man.</t:p>
<t:p>I see him now; he stands by Hunsden, who is seated on the lawn under the beech; Hunsden’s
     hand rests on the boy’s collar, and he is instilling God knows what principles into his ear.
     Victor looks well just now, for he listens with a sort of smiling interest; he never looks so
     like his mother as when he smiles—pity the sunshine breaks out so rarely! Victor has a
     preference for Hunsden, full as strong as I deem desirable, being considerably more potent,
     decided, and indiscriminating, than any I ever entertained for that personage myself. Frances,
     too, regards it with a sort of unexpressed anxiety; while her son leans on Hunsden’s knee, or
     rests against his shoulder, she roves with restless movement round, like a dove guarding its
     young from a hovering hawk; she says she wishes Hunsden had children of his own, for then he
     would better know the danger of inciting their pride end indulging their foibles.</t:p>
<t:p>Frances approaches my library window; puts aside the honeysuckle which half covers it, and
     tells me tea is ready; seeing that I continue busy she enters the room, comes near me quietly,
     and puts her hand on my shoulder.</t:p>
<t:p>“Monsieur est trop applique.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I shall soon have done.”</t:p>
<t:p>She draws a chair near, and sits down to wait till I have finished; her presence is as
     pleasant to my mind as the perfume of the fresh hay and spicy flowers, as the glow of the
     westering sun, as the repose of the midsummer eve are to my senses.</t:p>
<t:p>But Hunsden comes; I hear his step, and there he is, bending through the lattice, from which
     he has thrust away the woodbine with unsparing hand, disturbing two bees and a butterfly.</t:p>
<t:p>“Crimsworth! I say, Crimsworth! take that pen out of his hand, mistress, and make him lift up
     his head.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Well, Hunsden? I hear you—”</t:p>
<t:p>“I was at X—— yesterday! your brother Ned is getting richer than Croesus by railway
     speculations; they call him in the Piece Hall a stag of ten; and I have heard from Brown. M.
     and Madame Vandenhuten and Jean Baptiste talk of coming to see you next month. He mentions the
     Pelets too; he says their domestic harmony is not the finest in the world, but in business they
     are doing ‘on ne peut mieux,’ which circumstance he concludes will be a sufficient consolation
     to both for any little crosses in the affections. Why don’t you invite the Pelets to ——shire,
     Crimsworth? I should so like to see your first flame, Zoraide. Mistress, don’t be jealous, but
     he loved that lady to distraction; I know it for a fact. Brown says she weighs twelve stones
     now; you see what you’ve lost, Mr. Professor. Now, Monsieur and Madame, if you don’t come to
     tea, Victor and I will begin without you.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Papa, come!”</t:p>
