<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p>LESLIE’S anger and despair carried him to the end of three days, and when those were
     elapsed, the mild image of Elinor began to break through his stormy passions like present
     moonlight in a sky thick with black clouds. His own harshness, exercised upon so delicate a
     feature, shocked himself; her fear, her courage when she laid her soft hand upon him, her utter
     bereavement when he left her in the deep wood alone, wounded his heart. He believed in all the
     faults which he had believed at that moment, but he began to think they were immeasurably
     punished by him; he felt himself the greater sufferer under that punishment, and when his
     spirit revolted from the idea of receiving again the broken vows which she had once made him, he
     <pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7194-267"/> yet felt impelled to implore her pardon for the manner in
     which he had resented her perfidy.</p>
<p>When he had persuaded himself that such was the object which made him long to see her again,
     he at once gave way to his desire to do so, and a very short time saw him again in the
     neighbourhood of Chanson Wood, haunting every spot where he could hope to meet with Elinor. But
     it was all in vain, the cold weather caused all the shutters to be closed with declining
     daylight, so that he had no such chance as the summer had afforded him of investigating the
     dwellers of the rooms. No old favourite haunt was visited by her footstep, no morning or
     evening hour brought her out to behold its beauty.</p>
<p>Leslie wandered about for four and twenty hours, and then made his way to the house itself,
     and inquired for Mr. Chanson. He was not yet come home.</p>
<p>“Miss Chanson?” She was walking in the flower‐garden. He had not words to ask for Elinor, but
     followed the servant
     <pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7194-268"/> silently into the garden, dreading more than wishing that
     the two ladies might be together. But no; Laura only was there. While the servant was within
     hearing, Leslie’s tone and manner preserved their common‐place, but they were no sooner alone
     than he broke out eagerly,</p>
<p>“Can I see Miss Ladylift?” Laura hesitated. “What! she cannot forgive me?”</p>
<p>“Could <emph>you</emph> forgive her?”</p>
<p>“A man has always a right to forgive a woman. Where is she?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Leslie ...... don’t you know?”</p>
<p>“My God!” cried Leslie; “I have killed her!” and his wild eyes searched and commanded Laura’s
     face for the fearful words he expected.</p>
<p>“Not so,” said Laura; “but she is not here. Before I could communicate with my brother,
     before I could reflect what to do, she insisted on setting out for her convent.”</p>
<p>“Her convent?”</p>
<p>“After you were all gone, and I returned to her room, she had already made her
     <pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7194-269"/> preparations, and no efforts of mine could detain her. I did
     what I could; I sent to Mr. Roundel, you know him, my brother’s man of business, and requested
     him to take charge of her on her journey, which he did.”</p>
<p>“Tell me,” said Leslie, laying hold of Miss Chanson’s arm, and speaking in a very low voice;
     “was she willing that he should go with her?”</p>
<p>“Why?” said Laura.</p>
<p>“Was there not another whom she expected to join her.”</p>
<p>Laura’s colour rose to scarlet in‐her face.</p>
<p>“It never occurred to me till now,” she said; and in truth, Leslie had suggested an event in
     the plot which Laura had overlooked in contriving it.</p>
<p>“Where is the companion you gave her?” cried Leslie.</p>
<p>“He returns to‐morrow; but surely if what you fear had occurred, I should have heard it from
     him.”</p>
<p>“I can’t tell,” said Leslie, as if unable to
     <pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7194-270"/> argue, able only to fear and suffer. “I shall see him the
     moment he comes home. Farewell! Ours has been a troubled intercourse, Miss Chanson,” he said,
     offering his hand; “forgive me much that you have against me, and which you will forget when I
     no longer darken your happy home.” So saying, he turned away and walked up the garden, Laura
     pursuing him with stedfast eyes.</p>
<p>“Does he think to leave me thus?” she said to herself; “is all over between us, does he
     suppose? and he goes without a look behind, unconscious that there is a spell upon him, and of
     necessity he must return.” Then as she saw him ascend the steps of the terrace, her eye could
     not but mark that he did so with a step very unlike the decided strong movement of his general
     pace. “He is ill,” she said to herself; “I may lose him even in trying to win him. Better even
     that, than that he should belong to another.”</p>
<p>The day was by this time dark, and Laura, whose general habits were luxu‐
     <pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7194-271"/> rious, and who was to be found on cold evenings in her
     lounging‐chair at the side of a bright fire, her feet upon the warm hearth, abundance of wax
     light on her marqueterie table, her book, her work, her dress all in keeping, on this night
     muffled her person in a gray cloak, and going herself to the stables, at the time of the hall
     supper, when she knew one lad only would be left there, caused this boy to prepare her pony
     carriage with uncompromising haste, and, with him to drive her, set off in cold and darkness
     for Cantleton, the town where Mr. Roundel lived. She had readily answered Leslie that he would
     return to‐morrow, her instinct being on all occasions to gain time; but she was perfectly aware
     herself, that he had already been back a whole day, having in fact received from him the
     assurance that he had conducted Elinor to the convent whither all Laura’s skill and power had
     been exerted to make her fly. She had, however, felt in a moment that she must see him before
     Leslie could do so, and had gained twenty‐four hours by her ready lie.</p>
<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7194-272"/>
<p>It was ten o’clock before she reached the town; she had a humiliating part to play,
      <emph>that</emph> she felt, but at least she would do it in a grand, unquestionable way, and
     would come out of the house quite beyond being assailed in person by any remarks which might be
     made by its indwellers when she should be gone. Besides, she had brought a sum of money, so
     considerable (under the name of paying Mr. Roundel’s expenses on his journey) that the
     acceptance of it—and she was quite sure it would be accepted—would constitute an acknowledgment
     that further services must be rendered in return. Still, while she waited for him in his
     parlour, where the fire was out, and the chairs all set back against the wall, she had uneasy
     beatings at her heart which kept her standing; and which she thought to subdue when he came in,
     by taking a seat with as much dignity as if she were in her usual position of command. She did
     not begin with any reference to the strange lateness of the visit, for the cause of it would
     soon, she knew, seem stranger than the visit
     <pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7194-273"/> itself, but without apology or explanation opened her
     business.</p>
<p>“You have done me a service, Mr. Roundel,” Laura began, “in conveying that young lady back to
     France.”</p>
<p>“Since it was for your interest, as I understand,” began Mr. Roundel.</p>
<p>“For her own, I beg it to be understood,” said Laura.</p>
<p>“Oh! certainly, certainly.”</p>
<p>“Did she seem delighted at returning to the convent?”</p>
<p>“I can hardly say delighted,” answered Mr. Roundel.</p>
<p>“Indeed! I am surprised at that. What could then make her wish so much to return? Did anybody
     come to welcome her?”</p>
<p>“A maid‐servant answered the bell when ......”</p>
<p>“No; before you reached the convent? In fact, Mr. Roundel, I have cause to suspect that her
     eagerness for the journey—for the trouble of which, by the by, allow me to offer you this
     note”—Mr. Roundel looked at it, and began to understand that his answers
     <pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7194-274"/> must take some shape which he did not as yet perceive—“her
     eagerness must be connected with the departure of ...... you knew my cousin, Sir Peter?”</p>
<p>Mr. Roundel bowed assent.</p>
<p>“You must be aware that her fancy for this gentleman could never be encouraged by us; but it
     is possible that infatuation on his part ......”</p>
<p>“Very possible,” said Mr. Roundel.</p>
<p>“What, you had reason to suspect?”</p>
<p>“Nay, I cannot deny I had my suspicion,” said Mr. Roundel, thinking that expression would
     suit whatever came next.</p>
<p>“Indeed! and what followed?”</p>
<p>“What followed?” said Mr. Roundel. “Well, to tell the truth, nothing very particular.”</p>
<p>“You trifle, sir; if that young man gave you cause to suspect intentions which she favoured,
     I conclude that you were unable to conduct your charge safely to the convent.”</p>
<p>“I assure you,” answered Mr. Roundel,
     <pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7194-275"/> hastily, “I safely delivered Miss Ladylift into the hands of
     the Superior; what might happen afterwards, I cannot say.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, Mr. Roundel, I fear that <emph>I</emph> can.”</p>
<p>“Is it possible?” said Mr. Roundel. “At all events, I discharged my duty.”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, there is no fault of yours; but however distressing to myself to speak upon
     such a subject, I feel it my painful task to mention to you, that should any one inquire about
     her from you, you had better put an end at once to any interest taken in her, by stating that,
     on too good authority, you know her to be unworthy of it.”</p>
<p>“Upon my soul!” said Mr. Roundel; “and if particulars are asked, I can refer ......”</p>
<p>“It is not probable that I should enter upon such subjects,” said Laura, in the most
     dignified manner; “I have already said, perhaps, too much; and when I came to you, I did so as
     to a friend, who, I trusted, would relieve me from the necessity of saying more.”</p>
<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7194-276"/>
<p>Mr. Roundel bowed, and Laura, rising, prepared to depart.</p>
<p>“But if I am asked where I left the young lady,” said he, “what must I say?”</p>
<p>“The truth, sir,” said Laura, very loftily. “What you yourself know to have been true as to
     her arrival, and what you understand from me to have been true with respect to her subsequent
     departure.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” said Mr. Roundel, in a very low voice. Laura’s eyes met his; then, in a grand
     way, she requested his pardon for disturbing him at this late hour, and bidding him good‐night,
     sailed out of the house, Mr. Roundel following her to the pony carriage, and when she was gone
     shrugging his shoulders, and muttering an epithet I will not repeat.</p>
<p>The next morning, Leslie, who had passed the night in walking about a bedroom of the inn in
     the town, wandered forth, dragging through the time till he might inquire when Mr. Rounder’s
     return was likely to take place.</p>
<p>“Master was already at home,” the maid
     <pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7194-277"/> answered, and Leslie and he soon stood face to face. Mr.
     Roundel had thought over the matter, and had resolved in his own mind that the rich and
     powerful Miss Chanson was the injured person in this, to him, obscure history, and that, on the
     whole, in adopting her views of it, he should best consult his own interests, as well as her
     wishes. He therefore scrupled not to give Leslie the version Laura had taught him.</p>
<p>Leslie received the story so calmly, and so much as a matter‐of‐fact, that Mr. Roundel became
     almost persuaded that he himself had been telling the truth.</p>
<p>“A very fine young man,” said he to himself, when, after thanking and wishing him good
     morning, Leslie disappeared down the street. “A fine man, and takes the result of his
     adventures quietly;” and with that Mr. Roundel turned back to his office.</p>
<p>Leslie meantime reached the inn, and wished to inquire what public conveyance would first
     start on the road to his own place; but the words which he found him‐
     <pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7194-278"/> self using were not those which bore the meaning he wished
     to convey. He tried to frame the name of the town nearest to his own house, and spoke as slowly
     as he could in order to fasten the sound and the idea together; but even then he failed, and
     perceiving that he had done so, he turned away by a great exertion, and forced his limbs to
     carry him a few step’s; then a great dizziness came over everything, and stumbling forward upon
     a seat which he just descried, he there lost consciousness of himself and everything else.</p>
<p>He was known at the inn as the guest of Mr. Chanson, and when the doctor had seen him, and
     declared him dangerously ill with brain fever, and when it became apparent how desirable the
     presence of some responsible person might become, the landlord sent information to Chanson Wood
     of what had happened. Mr. Chanson had returned the evening before, and his hospitable nature
     led him at once to the desire of receiving his sick friend, and to have him nursed under his
     own roof. Laura se‐
     <pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7194-279"/> conded him, and looked upon all as the favourable working of
     her fate, which was relieving her own brain from the necessity of forming further devices for
     the achievement of her scheme.</p>
<p>A carriage fitted up for bearing an invalid, was despatched with a handy footman. Mr. Chanson
     went on horseback to the inn, and before the end of the day, the unconscious Leslie was
     conveyed to Chanson Wood; and lay there helpless, like one entangled of old in the meshes of a
     corrupt and beautiful enchantress.</p>
<p>The struggle between life and death was more severe and more solemn than Laura had
     anticipated. It lasted very long, and sometimes forced upon her the real probability of that
     which she had hitherto put to herself in words only, namely, that Leslie would die. “If he
     should die?” she said to herself, believing it, and trembling at what it implied, but she threw
     off the image, for it was in disagreement with all, the web she had been weaving, and whatever
     unfavourable report was brought her,
     <pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7194-280"/> attributed its worst gloom to mistake or ignorance, which
     falsely represented the real state of things.</p>
<p>But it was very long before the demon of the fever could be cast out of Leslie’s frame, and
     when at last it was expelled, it left him shattered, exhausted, and so utterly devoid of the
     strong sense of life he had hitherto enjoyed, that it seemed to him impossible ever to be again
     the free, careless, powerful being he was accustomed to be; rather, he felt that he had only
     escaped the death of fever to go down more slowly, and as surely, into the grave, where all
     things are dark and at rest. His mind had begun under the auspices of the pure love with which
     Elinor had at last inspired him, to have healthier feelings than were habitual to it, of
     happiness and of virtue; but the disappointment of his newly‐born faith and hope had swept away
     all the better feelings which grew up with them, and a more gloomy scepticism as to whatever
     was just and good never darkened any human
     <pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7194-281"/> bosom than that with which he got up from his long
     illness.</p>
<p>It was now five months since he had fallen down unconscious in the inn at Cantleton, and been
     conveyed by Mr. Chanson to his own house. He had just become able to walk about, and his only
     desire was to go home and die there. He felt the burthen of his obligations to Mr. Chanson and
     Laura, and heartily wished they had left him to perish when he fell ill, and have neither
     tormented him with a second long process of dying, nor with a debt to them, which nothing he
     could do was able to pay. He made efforts beyond his present strength in order to get away the
     sooner, and the re‐action when he was alone piled over his spirit the mountain weight of its
     oppression.</p>
<p>Laura watched him; and it seemed to her the moment was coming when she might finish her
     enchantment, and prove whether the spell had been woven strong enough or not. She did not
     deceive herself as to the fact that he loved her not; he was obliged,
     <pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7194-282"/> but not grateful; he was waiting impatiently to leave her,
     though there was no one whose society he would seek in exchange. She could not talk so as to
     interest him now; though he did his best to renew the easy gossip of bygone days. Still she had
     strong hold on him, and knew it. She had kept the secret of his engagement to Elinor
     inviolable; and he was thankful that it had never reached Mr. Chanson. She had falsely
     insinuated to him that her own name had been coupled with his through the county, and that the
     result was injurious to her hitherto sacred reputation; he had believed her; and though he said
     to himself the fault was hers, and so must be the penalty, yet it was difficult to feel himself
     in no degree committed; and, finally, his fixed expectation of death and his disenchantment
     with all faith in happiness, persuaded her that he would be indifferent to one scheme of life
     almost as much as to another.</p>
<p>It was one early April day that she proposed to him to walk for ten minutes in the
     <pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7194-283"/> garden; and he, eager to prove himself strong and
     independent again, complied. Laura knew how weak was his frame, and wondered that he could
     force himself to pass and repass so often up and down the dry gravel walk; at last, she
     proposed to rest under a bower which kept off the active breeze of April and the bright
     sunbeam, and Leslie consenting, they sate down side by side.</p>
<p>“This short walk is long for me,” said Leslie, “but my ability to perform it reminds me that
     I am able at last to relieve you of a burthen which you have so kindly supported. To‐morrow I
     will find my way home.”</p>
<p>“If you have resolved upon a thing,” said Laura, “you will do it; remonstrance is
     useless.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Leslie; “but it is a kindness in you to speed me thus.”</p>
<p>“The kindness of letting you free yourself from my society without useless contradiction? you
     cannot say yes to that; social
     <pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7194-284"/> forms forbid you; but honesty forbids you to say no.”</p>
<p>“Not so much honesty,” said Leslie, “as the conviction that I am a dying man. I cannot fence
     with words at this time; I have strength for nothing but the bare truth, and I allow that to
     die in a dark corner at home, is what remains of my ambition.”</p>
<p>“Alas!” said Laura, “since you say those cruel words, I know that you mean them; I too have a
     meaning,” she went on.</p>
<p>“Nay, do not tell me,” said Leslie, for he felt she had a scene in store, and he shrank from
     the trouble of it. “There is no meaning, no purpose which has anything to do with me, or in
     which I have a part to bear.”</p>
<p>“I mean,” said Laura, suddenly, “that in your death, more die than you.”</p>
<p>“By no means. I was a pleasant fellow enough last year, but this one, I am a mere curtain, a
     drop‐scene; when I am pulled away, all the stage will be bright again.”</p>
<p>“And all this for the sake of one who is
     <pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7194-285"/> unworthy to be remembered!” ejaculated Laura.</p>
<p>“One,” said Leslie, shuddering, “whose name must not be a sound again, for God’s sake.
     Unspoken as it is, it galvanizes life back to my heart.”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, Leslie, I am grieved to have said it.”</p>
<p>“Forgive!” he answered, <corr>“</corr>there is much of that needed on all sides—not by you,
     however. These are idle words.”</p>
<p>“No, not idle,” said Laura, “I am not without need of forgiveness, though others want it
     more.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say so, for you do not mean it, nor have I wit or strength to unravel your feigned
     humility. In my best days I always was idle about contradicting those who spoke ill of
     themselves.”</p>
<p>“You are hard,” said Laura, “and oblige me to look very narrowly to my judgment of myself.
     Perhaps you are right; though I may have done a wrong thing, still it is possible that, like
     Othello, I was not the most guilty.”</p>
<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7194-286"/>
<p>“‘More sinned against, than sinning,’” said Leslie; “I told you so.”</p>
<p>Laura paused, she thought he would ask in what she had been sinned against, but he said
     nothing, and she was obliged herself to make use of the opportunity she had opened. After a
     minute’s silence, therefore she resumed.</p>
<p>“Society makes crimes out of things which are innocent by Nature. When man is in prosperity a
     woman is obliged to deny that his good or evil destiny can interest her, but when fortune has
     forsaken him, when he is unhappy, ill, lonely, is it unwomanly then to say she feels for
     him?”</p>
<p>“Alas!” said Leslie, “I am not deserving of one kind feeling. I tell you truly that I cannot
     rouse one in return, for any human creature. Who could, when his grave was dug, his shroud
     making?”</p>
<p>“Do not talk thus, Leslie; even were it true, a woman, were she friend, sister, wife, would
     know no comfort, except to watch and support every step which remained of his earthly career to
     one in such trouble.”</p>
<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7194-287"/>
<p>“I am no judge of that,” said Leslie, smiling; “I think, however for my own part, that I am
     like an unsociable lion, who stalks into the wilderness to die, and leaves the lionesses to
     enjoy themselves in the world again, when he is gone.”</p>
<p>“The world,” said Laura, forcing back conversation to a grave tone, “looks to
      <emph>you</emph> for its opinion of me.”</p>
<p>“Nay,” said Leslie, “it cannot be so unjust.”</p>
<p>“Cannot be!” cried Laura; “why use that vain phrase when nothing is more certain than that it
      <emph>is</emph>? But heed it not. It is fair, I know that the woman who has ventured to feel
     unasked should learn to the uttermost how she has offended the pride of man.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary,” said Leslie, “our manly phrase is that we are much flattered by such
     generosity.”</p>
<p>“And your meaning is that, you despise it.”</p>
<p>“That depends upon whether it gives pleasure. For my part,” he went on, “she
     <pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7194-288"/> whom I loved is dead, she is as if dead, and that deadness
     has spread over me, so that I am already a mere citizen of that quiet country, from returning
     to which I have been unblessed with a short respite. Let us talk no more.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I must say what I have to say; I am wrong to do so, but your desolate words wring it
     from me. I liked you prosperous, I love you miserable; answer what you will, these are plain
     words—I cannot deceive.”</p>
<p>“Oh no! I can never be deceived again, I can never feel again. I tell you truly, those words
     of yours leave me unmoved, therefore unsay them. I can easily forget.”</p>
<p>“No, Leslie, they are as true as that they have been spoken.”</p>
<p>“They have a meaning, certainly,” said Leslie, “but hardly that which they bear at first
     sight. Let us understand each other: do you believe that busy bodies would respect you more if
     you bore my name? A dying man’s name is not much to give.”</p>
<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7194-289"/>
<p>“Leslie, can you think, that even if the world has been so unjust, (and so it may have been),
     such selfish thoughts can prompt me in what I say?”</p>
<p>“Call them by some other title than selfish thoughts, and they seem a fair motive enough.
     Only be honest with yourself; confess to yourself that you are moved by some such motive, and
     that you know I am so indifferent to the whole world that I cannot love nor esteem any member
     of it; nay, that kind words, such as you have used, pain or annoy me, more than any amount of
     indifference.”</p>
<p>“You hate me for them,” said Laura.</p>
<p>“No, I cannot hate, I cannot love; it is to me as if you said my name could be useful to you,
     and as if I hesitated whether to give it or not. Can you still wish it?”</p>
<p>“Can I do otherwise?” said Laura.</p>
<p>“Yet reflect: should you not buy too dear the suppression of certain rumours which you say
     exist, if to attain that end, you must undertake to walk by a dying man to his grave?”</p>
<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7194-290"/>
<p>“Leslie, you know me, or affect to know me very little. I have said the word which once you
     almost said to me, I have truly said it; you knew long since, that you were dear to me—you
     forget it—it was indifferent to you. It was not <emph>I</emph> who forgot it, and now, when all
     forsake you, I say again, I love you.”</p>
<p>“Remember, even those words leave my heart unmoved. Laura forgive me, but I seem to myself
     like the statue of stone, upon taking whose hand we have all seen such unpleasant consequences
     ensue at the opera.”</p>
<p>“Can you jest?” said Laura.</p>
<p>“No, I will not—I will calculate. I hear those strange words of yours comparing them with
     scenes which I confess remain in my memory. I reflect on the evil you say the world has cast on
     you. I repeat that I feel nothing, and that what I do, or what I forbear is indifferent to me.
     And after that—if you will—<emph>be</emph> my wife.”</p>
<p>Laura held out her hand, he took it; not
     <pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7194-291"/> as a friend takes his friend’s, not as a lover grasps that
     of his mistress; but he laid his palm upon the back of her hand, and rising, led her silently
     towards the house.</p>
<p>Pale, unanimated, uncongenial, these two went slowly along the walk, while the clouds of a
     suddenly overcast spring sky veiled the light of the day. It was like Adam and Eve wandering
     through the world after they were cast out of Paradise.</p>
<p>Next day Leslie told Mr. Chanson of his engagement with Laura, and departed to his own house.
     All approach to tenderness on the part of Laura, he treated as if it aid not exist, and Mr.
     Chanson, a matter‐of‐fact man, was completely puzzled. But Laura was contented. The project
     which had seemed almost impossible was executed; and when she pondered over the situation in
     which she found herself, she shut her eyes upon the fact that Leslie’s misery was her own
     creation, and dwelt upon that of attaching herself to an un‐
     <pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7194-292"/> happy and suffering man, till she believed that she was both
     generous and unselfish in so doing.</p>
<p>Leslie meantime reached the Tower in a state of perfect exhaustion, and he thought with
     pleasure that the next tidings Laura would receive of her bridegroom, would be in the formal
     style, and on the formal deep‐edged paper of the undertaker. He sank into a stupified sleep, at
     the length of which the few servants in his house were too uninterested in their master to
     wonder, and probably did him the best service in their power by neglect. He woke and wondered
     that he did so, and now without rule and without physic, proceeded to live or die, just as day
     by day might determine. His time was passed in the most absolute solitude, so that through the
     twenty‐four hours he would sometimes not find occasion to utter a word; he would lie at length
     on an easy chair, his gloomy eyes fixed on one spot, or wander into the air, and out of sight,
     nobody knew whether afar off, or just hidden by the first
     <pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7194-293"/> great tree, or projecting buttress of the old wall; and here
     suffering his ideas to come or go as they would, the gloom of his mind seemed to settle thicker
     and thicker, as weary day was added to weary day. To himself he appeared drifting into that
     dark chaos, which, as he believed surrounded on all sides the brief light of conscious being;
     and the impression was the stronger, because he had lost entirely the activity of those mental
     faculties which had hitherto been his pride and pleasure. He never read, never composed, never
     remembered the images with which former reading had stored his mind. Nature was uninteresting.
     There was sound without music; forms, but no beauty; actions, but no crime, and no virtue. Even
     the bitter past was not enough to account for his total shipwreck; he was convinced as fully as
     if it had been matter‐of‐fact, that the near approach of dissolution it was which thus covered
     him over with shadow.</p>
<p>In this mental condition, he wrote several times to Laura, to break off the engagement
     <pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7194-294"/> she had taken on herself. To him it was a matter of
     indifference, but to her it would plainly be mere misery. Laura, however, heeded no more what
     he said about himself than she had heeded the evil reports of the physician, when he was ill at
     Chanson Wood. She had her own intemperate hallucination about Leslie, which had begun in fancy,
     went on in jealousy, and was confirmed by the measures into which she had thrown her
     conscience, and her very soul, to secure him. It was not likely that she should stop now. If a
     thing could be done twice, it would very seldom be done the second time. But the girl who
     marries for money must reach the enjoyment of coaches, respect, and fine clothes before—if it
     were to be done again—she would <emph>not</emph> do it; the man who sets his fancy on power,
     must have possessed the pride of governing, and the homage of the multitude, before he can tell
     whether the sacrifices made for it were worth while. In the same way, Laura, with a mind
     incapable of self‐control or self‐sacrifice, acknow‐
     <pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7194-295"/> ledged no alternative except being the wife of Leslie; and
     thus, under gloomy auspices, their marriage was privately celebrated in the drawing‐room of
     Chanson Wood, during the month of November of this year.</p>
