<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>The conversation, which was at a high pitch of animation when Silas approached
            the door of the Rainbow, had, as usual, been slow and intermittent when the company
            first assembled. The pipes began to be puffed in a silence which had an air of severity;
            the more important customers, who drank spirits and sat nearest the fire, staring at
            each other as if a bet were depending on the first man who winked; while the
            beer-drinkers, chiefly men in fustian jackets and smock-frocks, kept their eyelids down
            and rubbed their hands across their mouths, as if their draughts of beer were a funereal
            duty attended with embarrassing sadness. At last, Mr Snell, the landlord, a man of a
            neutral disposition, accustomed to stand aloof from human differences as those of beings
            who were all alike in need of liquor, broke silence, by saying in a doubtful tone to his
            cousin the butcher,—</p>
<pb n="87"/>
<p>"Some folks 'ud say that was a fine beast you druv in yesterday, Bob?"</p>
<p>The butcher, a jolly, smiling, red-haired man, was not disposed to answer rashly. He
            gave a few puffs before he spat and replied, "And they wouldn't be fur wrong, John."</p>
<p>After this feeble delusive thaw, the silence set in as severely as before.</p>
<p>"Was it a red Durham?" said the farrier, taking up the thread of discourse after the
            lapse of a few minutes.</p>
<p>The farrier looked at the landlord, and the landlord looked at the butcher, as the
            person who must take the responsibility of answering.</p>
<p>"Red it was," said the butcher, in his goodhumoured husky treble—"and a Durham it
            was."</p>
<p>"Then you needn't tell <hi>me</hi> who you bought it of," said the farrier, looking
            round with some triumph; "I know who it is has got the red Durhams o' this country-side.
            And she'd a white star on her brow, I'll bet a penny?" The farrier leaned forward with
            his hands on his knees as he put this question, and his eyes twinkled knowingly.</p>
<p>"Well; yes—she might," said the butcher, <pb n="88"/> slowly, considering that he was
            giving a decided affirmative. "I don't say contrairy."</p>
<p>"I knew that very well," said the farrier, throwing himself backward again, and
            speaking defiantly; "if <hi>I</hi> don't know Mr Lammeter's cows, I should like to know
            who does—that's all. And as for the cow you've bought, bargain or no bargain, I've been
            at the drenching of her—contradick me who will."</p>
<p>The farrier looked fierce, and the mild butcher's conversational spirit was roused a
            little.</p>
<p>"I'm not for contradicking no man," he said; "I'm for peace and quietness. Some are for
            cutting long ribs—I'm for cutting 'em short, myself; but <hi>I</hi> don't quarrel with
            'em. All I say is, it's a lovely carkiss—and anybody as was reasonable, it 'ud bring
            tears into their eyes to look at it."</p>
<p>"Well, it's the cow as I drenched, whatever it is," pursued the farrier, angrily; "and
            it was Mr Lammeter's cow, else you told a lie when you said it was a red Durham."</p>
<p>"I tell no lies," said the butcher, with the same mild huskiness as before; "and I
            contradick none—not if a man was to swear himself <pb n="89"/> black: he's no meat o'
            mine, nor none o' my bargains. All I say is, it's a lovely carkiss. And what I say, I'll
            stick to; but I'll quarrel wi' no man."</p>
<p>"No," said the farrier, with bitter sarcasm, looking at the company generally; "and
            p'rhaps you aren't pig-headed; and p'rhaps you didn't say the cow was a red Durham; and
            p'rhaps you didn't say she'd got a star on her brow— stick to that, now you're at
            it."</p>
<p>"Come, come," said the landlord; "let the cow alone. The truth lies atween you: you're
            both right and both wrong, as I allays say. And as for the cow's being Mr Lammeter's, I
            say nothing to that; but this I say, as the Rainbow's the Rainbow. And for the matter o'
            that, if the talk is to be o' the Lammeters, <hi>you</hi> know the most upo' that head,
            eh, Mr Macey? You remember when first Mr Lammeter's father come into these parts, and
            took the Warrens?"</p>
<p>Mr Macey, tailor and parish-clerk, the latter of which functions rheumatism had of late
            obliged him to share with a small-featured young man who sat opposite him, held his
            white head on one side, and twirled his thumbs <pb n="90"/> with an air of complacency,
            slightly seasoned with criticism. He smiled pityingly, in answer to the landlord's
            appeal, and said—</p>
<p>"Ay, ay; I know, I know; but I let other folks talk. I've laid by now, and gev up to
            the young uns. Ask them as have been to school at Tarley: they've learnt pernouncing;
            that's come up since my day."</p>
<p>"If you're pointing at me, Mr Macey," said the deputy-clerk, with an air of anxious
            propriety, "I'm nowise a man to speak out of my place. As the psalm says— 'I know what's
            right, nor only so, But also practise what I know."' </p>
<p>"Well, then, I wish you'd keep hold o' the tune when it's set for you; if you're for
              <hi>practising</hi> , I wish you'd <hi>practise</hi> that," said a large
            jocose-looking man, an excellent wheel-wright in his week-day capacity, but on Sundays
            leader of the choir. He winked, as he spoke, at two of the company, who were known
            officially as the "bassoon" and "the key-bugle," in the confidence that he was
            expressing the sense of the musical profession in Raveloe.</p>
<p>Mr Tookey, the deputy-clerk, who shared <pb n="91"/> the unpopularity common to
            deputies, turned very red, but replied, with careful moderation —"Mr Winthrop, if you'll
            bring me any proof as I'm in the wrong, I'm not the man to say I won't alter. But
            there's people set up their own ears for a standard, and expect the whole choir to
            follow 'em. There may be two opinions, I hope."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay," said Mr Macey, who felt very well satisfied with this attack on youthful
            presumption: "you're right there, Tookey: there's allays two 'pinions; there's the
            'pinion a man has of himsen, and there's the 'pinion other folks have on him. There'd be
            two 'pinions about a cracked bell, if the bell could hear itself."</p>
<p>"Well, Mr Macey," said poor Tookey, serious amidst the general laughter, "I undertook
            to partially fill up the office of parish-clerk by Mr Crackenthorp's desire, whenever
            your infirmities should make you unfitting; and it's one of the rights thereof to sing
            in the choir—else why have you done the same yourself?"</p>
<p>"Ah! but the old gentleman and you are two folks," said Ben Winthrop. "The old
            gentleman's got a gift. Why, the Squire used <pb n="92"/> to invite him to take a glass,
            only to hear him sing the 'Red Rovier;' didn't he, Mr Macey? It's a nat'ral gift.
            There's my little lad Aaron, he's got a gift—he can sing a tune off straight, like a
            throstle. But as for you, Master Tookey, you'd better stick to your 'Amens:' your voice
            is well enough when you keep it up in your nose. It's your inside as isn't right made
            for music: it's no better nor a hollow stalk."</p>
<p>This kind of unflinching frankness was the most piquant form of joke to the company at
            the Rainbow, and Ben Winthrop's insult was felt by everybody to have capped Mr Macey's
            epigram.</p>
<p>"I see what it is plain enough," said Mr Tookey, unable to keep cool any longer.
            "There's a consperacy to turn me out o' the choir, as I shouldn't share the Christmas
            money —that's where it is. But I shall speak to Mr Crackenthorp; I'll not be put upon by
            no man."</p>
<p>"Nay, nay, Tookey," said Ben Winthrop. "We'll pay you your share to keep out of it—
            that's what we'll do. There's things folks 'ud pay to be rid on, besides varmin."</p>
<pb n="93"/>
<p>"Come, come," said the landlord, who felt that paying people for their absence was a
            principle dangerous to society; "a joke's a joke. We're all good friends here, I hope.
            We must give and take. You're both right and you're both wrong, as I say. I agree wi' Mr
            Macey here, as there's two opinions; and if mine was asked, I should say they're both
            right. Tookey's right and Winthrop's right, and they've only got to split the difference
            and make themselves even."</p>
<p>The farrier was puffing his pipe rather fiercely, in some contempt at this trivial
            discussion. He had no ear for music himself, and never went to church, as being of the
            medical profession, and likely to be in requisition for delicate cows. But the butcher,
            having music in his soul, had listened with a divided desire for Tookey's defeat, and
            for the preservation of the peace.</p>
<p>"To be sure," he said, following up the landlord's conciliatory view, "we're fond of
            our old clerk; it's nat'ral, and him used to be such a singer, and got a brother as is
            known for the first fiddler in this country-side. Eh, it's a pity but what Solomon lived
            in our village, <pb n="94"/> and could give us a tune when we liked; eh, Mr Macey? I'd
            keep him in liver and lights for nothing—that I would."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay," said Mr Macey, in the height of complacency; "our family's been known for
            musicianers as far back as anybody can tell. But them things are dying out, as I tell
            Solomon every time he comes round; there's no voices like what there used to be, and
            there's nobody remembers what we remember, if it isn't the old crows."</p>
<p>"Ay, you remember when first Mr Lammeter's father came into these parts, don't you, Mr
            Macey?" said the landlord.</p>
<p>"I should think I did," said the old man, who had now gone through that complimentary
            process necessary to bring him up to the point of narration; "and a fine old gentleman
            he was —as fine, and finer nor the Mr Lammeter as now is. He came from a bit north'ard,
            so far as I could ever make out. But there's nobody rightly knows about those parts:
            only it couldn't be far north'ard, nor much different from this country, for he brought
            a fine breed o' sheep with him, so there must be pastures there, and everything
            reasonable. We heared tell as he'd <pb n="95"/> sold his own land to come and take the
            Warrens, and that seemed odd for a man as had land of his own, to come and rent a farm
            in a strange place. But they said it was along of his wife's dying; though there's
            reasons in things as nobody knows on—that's pretty much what I've made out; though some
            folks are so wise, they'll find you fifty reasons straight off, and all the while the
            real reason's winking at 'em in the corner, and they niver see't. Howsomever, it was
            soon seen as we'd got a new parish'ner as know'd the rights and customs o' things, and
            kep a good house, and was well looked on by everybody. And the young man —that's the Mr
            Lammeter as now is, for he'd niver a sister—soon begun to court Miss Osgood, that's the
            sister o' the Mr Osgood as now is, and a fine handsome lass she was—eh, you can't
            think—they pretend this young lass is like her, but that's the way wi' people as don't
            know what come before 'em. <hi>I</hi> should know, for I helped the old rector, Mr
            Drumlow as was, I helped him marry 'em."</p>
<p>Here Mr Macey paused; he always gave his narrative in instalments, expecting to be
            questioned according to precedent.</p>
<pb n="96"/>
<p>"Ay, and a partic'lar thing happened, didn't it, Mr Macey, so as you were likely to
            remember that marriage?" said the landlord, in a congratulatory tone.</p>
<p>"I should think there did—a <hi>very</hi> partic'lar thing," said Mr Macey, nodding
            sideways. "For Mr Drumlow—poor old gentleman, I was fond on him, though he'd got a bit
            confused in his head, what wi' age and wi' taking a drop o' summat warm when the service
            come of a cold morning. And young Mr Lammeter, he'd have no way but he must be married
            in Janiwary, which, to be sure, 's a unreasonable time to be married in, for it isn't
            like a christening or a burying, as you can't help; and so Mr Drumlow—poor old
            gentleman, I was fond on him—but when he come to put the questions, he put 'em by the
            rule o' contrairy, like, and he says, 'Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded wife?' says
            he, and then he says, 'Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded husband?' says he. But
            the partic'larest thing of all is, as nobody took any notice on it but me, and they
            answered straight off 'yes,' like as if it had been me saying 'Amen' i' the right place,
            without listening to what went before."</p>
<pb n="97"/>
<p>"But <hi>you</hi> knew what was going on well enough, didn't you, Mr Macey? You were
            live enough, eh?" said the butcher.</p>
<p>"Lor bless you!" said Mr Macey, pausing, and smiling in pity at the impotence of his
            hearers' imagination—"why, I was all of a tremble: it was as if I'd been a coat pulled
            by the two tails, like; for I couldn't stop the parson, I couldn't take upon me to do
            that; and yet I said to myself, I says, 'Suppose they shouldn't be fast married, 'cause
            the words are contrairy?' and my head went working like a mill, for I was allays
            uncommon for turning things over and seeing all round 'em; and I says to myself, 'Is't
            the meanin' or the words as makes folks fast i' wedlock?' For the parson meant right,
            and the bride and bridegroom meant right. But then, when I come to think on it, meanin'
            goes but a little way i' most things, for you may mean to stick things together and your
            glue may be bad, and then where are you? And so I says to mysen, 'It isn't the meanin',
            it's the glue.' And I was worreted as if I'd got three bells to pull at once, when we
            got into the vestry, and they begun to sign their names. But where's the o' talking? <pb n="98"/> —you can't think what goes on in a 'cute man's inside."</p>
<p>"But you held in for all that, didn't you, Mr Macey?" said the landlord.</p>
<p>"Ay, I held in tight till I was by mysen wi' Mr Drumlow, and then I out wi' everything,
            but respectful, as I allays did. And he made light on it, and he says, 'Pooh, pooh,
            Macey, make yourself easy,' he says, 'it's neither the meaning nor the words—it's the
              <hi>regester</hi> does it—that's the glue.' So you see he settled it easy; for parsons
            and doctors know everything by heart, like, so as they aren't worreted wi' thinking
            what's the rights and wrongs o' things, as I'n been many and many's the time. And sure
            enough the wedding turned out all right, on'y poor Mrs Lammeter—that's Miss Osgood as
            was—died afore the lasses were growed up; but for prosperity and everything respectable,
            there's no family more looked on."</p>
<p>Every one of Mr Macey's audience had heard this story many times, but it was listened
            to as if it had been a favourite tune, and at certain points the puffing of the pipes
            was momentarily suspended, that the listeners might give their whole minds to the
            expected words. But there <pb n="99"/> was more to come; and Mr Snell, the landlord,
            duly put the leading question.</p>
<p>"Why, old Mr Lammeter had a pretty fortin, didn't they say, when he come into these
            parts?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes," said Mr Macey; "but I daresay it's as much as this Mr Lammeter's done to
            keep it whole. For there was allays a talk as nobody could get rich on the Warrens:
            though he holds it cheap, for it's what they call Charity Land."</p>
<p>"Ay, and there's few folks know so well as you how it come to be Charity Land, eh, Mr
            Macey?" said the butcher.</p>
<p>"How should they?" said the old clerk, with some contempt. "Why, my grandfather made
            the grooms' livery for that Mr Cliff as came and built the big stables at the Warrens.
            Why, they're stables four times as big as Squire Cass's, for he thought o' nothing but
            hosses and hunting, Cliff didn't—a Lunnon tailor, some folks said, as had gone mad wi'
            cheating. For he couldn't ride; lor bless you! they said he'd got no more grip o' the
            hoss than if his legs had been cross sticks: my grandfather heared old Squire Cass say
            so <pb n="100"/> many and many a time. But ride he would, as if old Harry had been
            a-driving him; and he'd a son, a lad o' sixteen; and nothing would his father have him
            do, but he must ride and ride—though the lad was frighted, they said. And it was a
            common saying as the father wanted to ride the tailor out o' the lad, and make a
            gentleman on him—not but what I'm a tailor myself, but in respect as God made me such,
            I'm proud on it, for 'Macey, tailor,''s been wrote up over our door since afore the
            Queen's heads went out on the shillings. But Cliff, he was ashamed o' being called a
            tailor, and he was sore vexed as his riding was laughed at, and nobody o' the
            gentlefolks hereabout could abide him. Howsomever, the poor lad got sickly and died, and
            the father didn't live long after him, for he got queerer nor ever, and they said he
            used to go out i' the dead o' the night, wi' a lantern in his hand, to the stables, and
            set a lot o' lights burning, for he got as he couldn't sleep; and there he'd stand,
            cracking his whip and looking at his hosses; and they said it was a mercy as the stables
            didn't get burnt down wi' the poor dumb creaturs in 'em. But at last he died raving, and
            they found as he'd <pb n="101"/> left all his property, Warrens and all, to a Lunnon
            Charity, and that's how the Warrens come to be Charity land; though, as for the stables,
            Mr Lammeter never uses 'em—they're out o' all charicter—lor bless you! if you was to set
            the doors a-banging in 'em, it 'ud sound like thunder half o'er the parish."</p>
<p>"Ay, but there's more going on in the stables than what folks see by daylight, eh, Mr
            Macey?" said the landlord.</p>
<p>"Ay, ay; go that way of a dark night, that's all," said Mr Macey, winking mysteriously,
            "and then make believe, if you like, as you didn't see lights i' the stables, nor hear
            the stamping o' the hosses, nor the cracking o' the whips, and howling, too, if it's
            tow'rt daybreak. 'Cliff's Holiday' has been the name of it ever sin' I were a boy;
            that's to say, some said as it was the holiday Old Harry gev him from roasting, like.
            That's what my father told me, and he was a reasonable man, though there's folks
            nowadays know what happened afore they were born better nor they know their own
            business."</p>
<p>"What do you say to that, eh, Dowlas?" said the landlord, turning to the farrier, who
            was <pb n="102"/> swelling with impatience for his cue. "There's a nut for <hi>you</hi>
            to crack."</p>
<p>Mr Dowlas was the negative spirit in the company, and was proud of his position.</p>
<p>"Say? I say what a man <hi>should</hi> say as doesn't shut his eyes to look at a
            finger-post. I say, as I'm ready to wager any man ten pound, if he'll stand out wi' me
            any dry night in the pasture before the Warren stables, as we shall neither see lights
            nor hear noises, if it isn't the blowing of our own noses. That's what I say, and I've
            said it many a time; but there's nobody 'ull ventur a ten-pun' note on their ghos'es as
            they make so sure of."</p>
<p>"Why, Dowlas, that's easy betting, that is," said Ben Winthrop. "You might as well bet
            a man as he wouldn't catch the rheumatise if he stood up to's neck in the pool of a
            frosty night. It 'ud be fine fun for a man to win his bet as he'd catch the rheumatise.
            Folks as believe in Cliff's Holiday aren't agoing to ventur near it for a matter o' ten
            pound."</p>
<p>"If Master Dowlas wants to know the truth on it," said Mr Macey, with a sarcastic
            smile, tapping his thumbs together, "he's no call to lay any bet—let him go and stan' by
            himself— <pb n="103"/> there's nobody 'ull hinder him; and then he can let the
            parish'ners know if they're wrong."</p>
<p>"Thank you! I'm obliged to you," said the farrier, with a snort of scorn. "If folks are
            fools, it's no business o' mine. <hi>I</hi> don't want to make out the truth about
            ghos'es: I know it a'ready. But I'm not against a bet—everything fair and open. Let any
            man bet me ten pound as I shall see Cliff's Holiday, and I'll go and stand by myself. I
            want no company. I'd as lief do it as I'd fill this pipe."</p>
<p>"Ah, but who's to watch you, Dowlas, and see you do it? That's no fair bet," said the
            butcher.</p>
<p>"No fair bet?" replied Mr Dowlas, angrily. "I should like to hear any man stand up and
            say I want to bet unfair. Come now, Master Lundy, I should like to hear you say it."</p>
<p>"Very like you would," said the butcher. "But it's no business o' mine. You're none o'
            my bargains, and I aren't a-going to try and 'bate your price. If anybody 'll bid for
            you at your own vallying, let him. I'm for peace and quietness, I am."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what every yapping cur is, when you hold a stick up at him," said the <pb n="104"/> farrier. "But I'm afraid o' neither man nor ghost, and I'm ready to lay a
            fair bet— <hi>I</hi> aren't a turn-tail cur."</p>
<p>"Ay, but there's this in it, Dowlas," said the landlord, speaking in a tone of much
            candour and tolerance. "There's folks, i' my opinion, they can't see ghos'es, not if
            they stood as plain as a pike-staff before 'em. And there's reason i' that. For there's
            my wife, now, can't smell, not if she'd the strongest o' cheese under her nose. I never
            see'd a ghost myself, but then I says to myself, 'Very like I haven't got the smell for
            'em.' I mean, putting a ghost for a smell, or else contrairiways. And so, I'm for
            holding with both sides; for, as I say, the truth lies between 'em. And if Dowlas was to
            go and stand, and say he'd never seen a wink o' Cliff's Holiday all the night through,
            I'd back him; and if anybody said as Cliff's Holiday was certain sure, for all that, I'd
            back <hi>him</hi> too. For the smell's what I go by."</p>
<p>The landlord's analogical argument was not well received by the farrier—a man intensely
            opposed to compromise.</p>
<p>"Tut, tut," he said, setting down his glass with refreshed irritation; "what's the
            smell got <pb n="105"/> to do with it? Did ever a ghost give a man a black eye? That's
            what I should like to know. If ghos'es want me to believe in 'em, let 'em leave off
            skulking i' the dark and i' lone places —let 'em come where there's company and
            candles."</p>
<p>"As if ghos'es 'ud want to be believed in by anybody so ignirant!" said Mr Macey, in
            deep disgust at the farrier's crass incompetence to apprehend the conditions of ghostly
            phenomena.</p>
