<t:head>CHAPTER XVIII.</t:head>
<t:head>ROBERT RECEIVES A VISITOR WHOM HE HAD SCARCELY EXPECTED.</t:head>
<t:p>Eleven o'clock struck the next morning, and found Mr. Robert Audley still lounging over the
     well ordered little breakfast table, with one of his dogs at each side of his arm-chair,
     regarding him with watchful eyes and opened mouths, awaiting the expected morsel of ham or
     toast. Robert had a county paper on his knees, and made a feeble effort now and then to read
     the first page, which was filled with advertisements of farming stock, quack medicines, and
     other interesting matter.</t:p>
<t:p>The weather had changed, and the snow, which had for the last few days been looming blackly
     in the frosty sky, fell in great feathery flakes against the windows, and lay piled in the
     little bit of garden-ground without.</t:p>
<t:p>The long, lonely road leading toward Audley seemed untrodden by a footstep, as Robert Audley
     looked out at the wintry landscape.</t:p>
<t:p>"Lively," he said, "for a man used to the fascinations of Temple Bar."</t:p>
<t:p>As he watched the snow-flakes falling every moment thicker and faster upon the lonely road,
     he was surprised by seeing a brougham driving slowly up the hill.</t:p>
<t:p>"I wonder what unhappy wretch has too restless a spirit to stop at home on such a morning as
     this," he muttered, as he returned to the arm-chair by the fire.</t:p>
<t:p>He had only reseated himself a few moments when Phoebe Marks entered the room to announce
     Lady Audley.</t:p>
<t:p>"Lady Audley! Pray beg her to come in," said Robert; and then, as Phoebe left the room to
     usher in this unexpected visitor, he muttered between his teeth—"A false move, my lady, and one
     I never looked for from you."</t:p>
<t:p>Lucy Audley was radiant on this cold and snowy January morning. Other people's noses are
     rudely assailed by the sharp fingers of the grim ice-king, but not my lady's; other people's
     lips turn pale and blue with the chilling influence of the bitter weather, but my lady's pretty
     little rosebud of a mouth retained its brightest coloring and cheeriest freshness.</t:p>
<t:p>She was wrapped in the very sables which Robert Audley had brought from Russia, and carried a
     muff that the young man thought seemed almost as big as herself.</t:p>
<t:p>She looked a childish, helpless, babyfied little creature; and Robert looked down upon her
     with some touch of pity in his eyes, as she came up to the hearth by which he was standing, and
     warmed her tiny gloved hands at the blaze.</t:p>
<t:p>"What a morning, Mr. Audley!" she said, "what a morning!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, indeed! Why did you come out in such weather?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Because I wished to see you—particularly."</t:p>
<t:p>"Indeed!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes," said my lady, with an air of considerable embarrassment, playing with the button of
     her glove, and almost wrenching it off in her restlessness—"yes, Mr. Audley, I felt that you
     had not been well treated; that—that you had, in short, reason to complain; and that an apology
     was due to you."</t:p>
<t:p>"I do not wish for any apology, Lady Audley."</t:p>
<t:p>"But you are entitled to one," answered my lady, quietly. "Why, my dear Robert, should we be
     so ceremonious toward each other? You were very comfortable at Audley; we were very glad to
     have you there; but, my dear, silly husband must needs take it into his foolish head that it is
     dangerous for his poor little wife's peace of mind to have a nephew of eight or nine and twenty
     smoking his cigars in her boudoir, and, behold! our pleasant little family circle is broken
     up."</t:p>
<t:p>Lucy Audley spoke with that peculiar childish vivacity which seemed so natural to her, Robert
     looking down almost sadly at her bright, animated face.</t:p>
<t:p>"Lady Audley," he said, "Heaven forbid that either you or I should ever bring grief or
     dishonor upon my uncle's generous heart! Better, perhaps, that I should be out of the
     house—better, perhaps, that I had never entered it!"</t:p>
<t:p>My lady had been looking at the fire while her nephew spoke, but at his last words she lifted
     her head suddenly, and looked him full in the face with a wondering expression—an earnest,
     questioning gaze, whose full meaning the young barrister understood.</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, pray do not be alarmed, Lady Audley," he said, gravely. "You have no sentimental
     nonsense, no silly infatuation, borrowed from Balzac or Dumas <t:hi>fils</t:hi>, to fear from me.
     The benchers of the Inner Temple will tell you that Robert Audley is troubled with none of the
     epidemics whose outward signs are turn-down collars and Byronic neckties. I say that I wish I
     had never entered my uncle's house during the last year; but I say it with a far more solemn
     meaning than any sentimental one."</t:p>
<t:p>My lady shrugged her shoulders.</t:p>
<t:p>"If you insist on talking in enigmas, Mr. Audley," she said, "you must forgive a poor little
     woman if she declines to answer them."</t:p>
<t:p>Robert made no reply to this speech.</t:p>
<t:p>"But tell me," said my lady, with an entire change of tone, "what could have induced you to
     come up to this dismal place?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Curiosity."</t:p>
<t:p>"Curiosity?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes; I felt an interest in that bull-necked man, with the dark-red hair and wicked gray
     eyes. A dangerous man, my lady—a man in whose power I should not like to be."</t:p>
<t:p>A sudden change came over Lady Audley's face; the pretty, roseate flush faded out from her
     cheeks, and left them waxen white, and angry flashes lightened in her blue eyes.</t:p>
<t:p>"What have I done to you, Robert Audley," she cried, passionately—"what have I done to you
     that you should hate me so?"</t:p>
<t:p>He answered her very gravely:</t:p>
<t:p>"I had a friend, Lady Audley, whom I loved very dearly, and since I have lost him I fear that
     my feelings toward other people are strangely embittered."</t:p>
<t:p>"You mean the Mr. Talboys who went to Australia?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, I mean the Mr. Talboys who I was told set out for Liverpool with the idea of going to
     Australia."</t:p>
<t:p>"And you do not believe in his having sailed for Australia?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I do not."</t:p>
<t:p>"But why not?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Forgive me, Lady Audley, if I decline to answer that question."</t:p>
<t:p>"As you please," she said, carelessly.</t:p>
<t:p>"A week after my friend disappeared," continued Robert, "I posted an advertisement to the
     Sydney and Melbourne papers, calling upon him if he was in either city when the advertisement
     appeared, to write and tell me of his whereabouts, and also calling on any one who had met him,
     either in the colonies or on the voyage out, to give me any information respecting him. George
     Talboys left Essex, or disappeared from Essex, on the 6th of September last. I ought to receive
     some answer to this advertisement by the end of this month. To-day is the 27th; the time draws
     very near."</t:p>
<t:p>"And if you receive no answer?" asked Lady Audley.</t:p>
<t:p>"If I receive no answer I shall think that my fears have been not unfounded, and I shall do
     my best to act."</t:p>
<t:p>"What do you mean by that?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Ah, Lady Audley, you remind me how very powerless I am in this matter. My friend might have
     been made away with in this very inn, and I might stay here for a twelvemonth, and go away at
     the last as ignorant of his fate as if I had never crossed the threshold. What do we know of
     the mysteries that may hang about the houses we enter? If I were to go to-morrow into that
     commonplace, plebeian, eight-roomed house in which Maria Manning and her husband murdered their
     guest, I should have no awful prescience of that bygone horror. Foul deeds have been done under
     the most hospitable roofs; terrible crimes have been committed amid the fairest scenes, and
     have left no trace upon the spot where they were done. I do not believe in mandrake, or in
     bloodstains that no time can efface. I believe rather that we may walk unconsciously in an
     atmosphere of crime, and breathe none the less freely. I believe that we may look into the
     smiling face of a murderer, and admire its tranquil beauty."</t:p>
<t:p>My lady laughed at Robert's earnestness.</t:p>
<t:p>"You seem to have quite a taste for discussing these horrible subjects," she said, rather
     scornfully; "you ought to have been a detective police officer."</t:p>
<t:p>"I sometimes think I should have been a good one."</t:p>
<t:p>"Why?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Because I am patient."</t:p>
<t:p>"But to return to Mr. George Talboys, whom we lost sight of in your eloquent discussion. What
     if you receive no answer to your advertisements?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I shall then consider myself justified in concluding my friend is dead."</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, and then—?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I shall examine the effects he left at my chambers."</t:p>
<t:p>"Indeed! and what are they? Coats, waistcoats, varnished boots, and meerschaum pipes, I
     suppose," said Lady Audley, laughing.</t:p>
<t:p>"No; letters—letters from his friends, his old schoolfellows, his father, his brother
     officers."</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Letters, too, from his wife."</t:p>
<t:p>My lady was silent for some few moments, looking thoughtfully at the fire.</t:p>
<t:p>"Have you ever seen any of the letters written by the late Mrs. Talboys?" she asked
     presently.</t:p>
<t:p>"Never. Poor soul! her letters are not likely to throw much light upon my friend's fate. I
     dare say she wrote the usual womanly scrawl. There are very few who write so charming and
     uncommon a hand as yours, Lady Audley."</t:p>
<t:p>"Ah, you know my hand, of course."</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, I know it very well indeed."</t:p>
<t:p>My lady warmed her hands once more, and then taking up the big muff which she had laid aside
     upon a chair, prepared to take her departure.</t:p>
<t:p>"You have refused to accept my apology, Mr. Audley," she said; "but I trust you are not the
     less assured of my feelings toward you."</t:p>
<t:p>"Perfectly assured, Lady Audley."</t:p>
<t:p>"Then good-by, and let me recommend you not to stay long in this miserable draughty place, if
     you do not wish to take rheumatism back to Figtree Court."</t:p>
<t:p>"I shall return to town to-morrow morning to see after my letters."</t:p>
<t:p>"Then once more good-by."</t:p>
<t:p>She held out her hand; he took it loosely in his own. It seemed such a feeble little hand
     that he might have crushed it in his strong grasp, had he chosen to be so pitiless.</t:p>
<t:p>He attended her to her carriage, and watched it as it drove off, not toward Audley, but in
     the direction of Brentwood, which was about six miles from Mount Stanning.</t:p>
<t:p>About an hour and a half after this, as Robert stood at the door of the inn, smoking a cigar
     and watching the snow falling in the whitened fields opposite, he saw the brougham drive back,
     empty this time, to the door of the inn.</t:p>
<t:p>"Have you taken Lady Audley back to the Court?" he said to the coachman, who had stopped to
     call for a mug of hot spiced ale.</t:p>
<t:p>"No, sir; I've just come from the Brentwood station. My lady started for London by the 12.40
     train."</t:p>
<t:p>"For town?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, sir."</t:p>
<t:p>"My lady gone to London!" said Robert, as he returned to the little sitting-room. "Then I'll
     follow her by the next train; and if I'm not very much mistaken, I know where to find her."</t:p>
<t:p>He packed his portmanteau, paid his bill, fastened his dogs together with a couple of
     leathern collars and a chain, and stepped into the rumbling fly kept by the Castle Inn for the
     convenience of Mount Stanning. He caught an express that left Brentwood at three o'clock, and
     settled himself comfortably in a corner of an empty first-class carriage, coiled up in a couple
     of railway rugs, and smoking a cigar in mild defiance of the authorities.</t:p>
