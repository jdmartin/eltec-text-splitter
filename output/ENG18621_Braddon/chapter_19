<t:head>CHAPTER XIX.</t:head>
<t:head>THE WRITING IN THE BOOK.</t:head>
<t:p>It was exactly five minutes past four as Mr. Robert Audley stepped out upon the platform at
     Shoreditch, and waited placidly until such time as his dogs and his portmanteau should be
     delivered up to the attendant porter who had called his cab, and undertaken the general conduct
     of his affairs, with that disinterested courtesy which does such infinite credit to a class of
     servitors who are forbidden to accept the tribute of a grateful public.</t:p>
<t:p>Robert Audley waited with consummate patience for a considerable time; but as the express was
     generally a long train, and as there were a great many passengers from Norfolk carrying guns
     and pointers, and other paraphernalia of a critical description, it took a long while to make
     matters agreeable to all claimants, and even the barrister's seraphic indifference to mundane
     affairs nearly gave way.</t:p>
<t:p>"Perhaps, when that gentleman who is making such a noise about a pointer with liver-colored
     spots, has discovered the particular pointer and spots that he wants—which happy combination of
     events scarcely seems likely to arrive—they'll give me my luggage and let me go. The designing
     wretches knew at a glance that I was born to be imposed upon; and that if they were to trample
     the life out of me upon this very platform, I should never have the spirit to bring an action
     against the company."</t:p>
<t:p>Suddenly an idea seemed to strike him, and he left the porter to struggle for the custody of
     his goods, and walked round to the other side of the station.</t:p>
<t:p>He heard a bell ring, and looking at the clock, had remembered that the down train for
     Colchester started at this time. He had learned what it was to have an earnest purpose since
     the disappearance of George Talboys; and he reached the opposite platform in time to see the
     passengers take their seats.</t:p>
<t:p>There was one lady who had evidently only just arrived at the station; for she hurried on to
     the platform at the very moment that Robert approached the train, and almost ran against that
     gentleman in her haste and excitement.</t:p>
<t:p>"I beg your pardon," she began, ceremoniously; then raising her eyes from Mr. Audley's
     waistcoat, which was about on a level with her pretty face, she exclaimed, "Robert, you in
     London already?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, Lady Audley; you were quite right; the Castle Inn is a dismal place, and—"</t:p>
<t:p>"You got tired of it—I knew you would. Please open the carriage door for me: the train will
     start in two minutes."</t:p>
<t:p>Robert Audley was looking at his uncle's wife with rather a puzzled expression of
     countenance.</t:p>
<t:p>"What does it mean?" he thought. "She is altogether a different being to the wretched,
     helpless creature who dropped her mask for a moment, and looked at me with her own pitiful
     face, in the little room at Mount Stanning, four hours ago. What has happened to cause the
     change?"</t:p>
<t:p>He opened the door for her while he thought this, and helped her to settle herself in her
     seat, spreading her furs over her knees, and arranging the huge velvet mantle in which her
     slender little figure was almost hidden.</t:p>
<t:p>"Thank you very much; how good you are to me," she said, as he did this. "You will think me
     very foolish to travel upon such a day, without my dear darling's knowledge too; but I went up
     to town to settle a very terrific milliner's bill, which I did not wish my best of husbands to
     see; for, indulgent as he is, he might think me extravagant; and I cannot bear to suffer even
     in his thoughts."</t:p>
<t:p>"Heaven forbid that you ever should, Lady Audley," Robert said, gravely.</t:p>
<t:p>She looked at him for a moment with a smile, which had something defiant in its
     brightness.</t:p>
<t:p>"Heaven forbid it, indeed," she murmured. "I don't think I ever shall."</t:p>
<t:p>The second bell rung, and the train moved as she spoke. The last Robert Audley saw of her was
     that bright defiant smile.</t:p>
<t:p>"Whatever object brought her to London has been successfully accomplished," he thought. "Has
     she baffled me by some piece of womanly jugglery? Am I never to get any nearer to the truth,
     but am I to be tormented all my life by vague doubts, and wretched suspicions, which may grow
     upon me till I become a monomaniac? Why did she come to London?"</t:p>
<t:p>He was still mentally asking himself this question as he ascended the stairs in Figtree
     Court, with one of his dogs under each arm, and his railway rugs over his shoulder.</t:p>
<t:p>He found his chambers in their accustomed order. The geraniums had been carefully tended, and
     the canaries had retired for the night under cover of a square of green baize, testifying to
     the care of honest Mrs. Maloney. Robert cast a hurried glance round the sitting-room; then
     setting down the dogs upon the hearth-rug, he walked straight into the little inner chamber
     which served as his dressing-room.</t:p>
<t:p>It was in this room that he kept disused portmanteaus, battered japanned cases, and other
     lumber; and it was in this room that George Talboys had left his luggage. Robert lifted a
     portmanteau from the top of a large trunk, and kneeling down before it with a lighted candle in
     his hand, carefully examined the lock.</t:p>
<t:p>To all appearance it was exactly in the same condition in which George had left it, when he
     laid his mourning garments aside and placed them in this shabby repository with all other
     memorials of his dead wife. Robert brushed his coat sleeve across the worn, leather-covered
     lid, upon which the initials G. T. were inscribed with big brass-headed nails; but Mrs.
     Maloney, the laundress, must have been the most precise of housewives, for neither the
     portmanteau nor the trunk were dusty.</t:p>
<t:p>Mr. Audley dispatched a boy to fetch his Irish attendant, and paced up and down his
     sitting-room waiting anxiously for her arrival.</t:p>
<t:p>She came in about ten minutes, and, after expressing her delight in the return of "the
     master," humbly awaited his orders.</t:p>
<t:p>"I only sent for you to ask if anybody has been here; that is to say, if anybody has applied
     to you for the key of my rooms to-day—any lady?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Lady? No, indeed, yer honor; there's been no lady for the kay; barrin' it's the
     blacksmith."</t:p>
<t:p>"The blacksmith!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes; the blacksmith your honor ordered to come to-day."</t:p>
<t:p>"I order a blacksmith!" exclaimed Robert. "I left a bottle of French brandy in the cupboard,"
     he thought, "and Mrs. M. has been evidently enjoying herself."</t:p>
<t:p>"Sure, and the blacksmith your honor tould to see to the locks," replied Mrs. Maloney. "It's
     him that lives down in one of the little streets by the bridge," she added, giving a very lucid
     description of the man's whereabouts.</t:p>
<t:p>Robert lifted his eyebrows in mute despair.</t:p>
<t:p>"If you'll sit down and compose yourself, Mrs. M.," he said—he abbreviated her name thus on
     principle, for the avoidance of unnecessary labor—"perhaps we shall be able by and by to
     understand each other. You say a blacksmith has been here?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Sure and I did, sir."</t:p>
<t:p>"To-day?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Quite correct, sir."</t:p>
<t:p>Step by step Mr. Audley elicited the following information. A locksmith had called upon Mrs.
     Maloney that afternoon at three o'clock, and had asked for the key of Mr. Audley's chambers, in
     order that he might look to the locks of the doors, which he stated were all out of repair. He
     declared that he was acting upon Mr. Audley's own orders, conveyed to him by a letter from the
     country, where the gentleman was spending his Christmas. Mrs. Maloney, believing in the truth
     of this statement, had admitted the man to the chambers, where he stayed about half an
     hour.</t:p>
<t:p>"But you were with him while he examined the locks, I suppose?" Mr. Audley asked.</t:p>
<t:p>"Sure I was, sir, in and out, as you may say, all the time, for I've been cleaning the stairs
     this afternoon, and I took the opportunity to begin my scouring while the man was at work."</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, you were in and out all the time. If you <t:hi>could</t:hi> conveniently give me a plain
     answer, Mrs. M., I should be glad to know what was the longest time that you were <t:hi>out</t:hi>
     while the locksmith was in my chambers?"</t:p>
<t:p>But Mrs. Maloney could not give a plain answer. It might have been ten minutes; though she
     didn't think it was as much. It might have been a quarter of an hour; but she was sure it
     wasn't more. It didn't <t:hi>seem</t:hi> to her more than five minutes, but "thim stairs, your
     honor;" and here she rambled off into a disquisition upon the scouring of stairs in general,
     and the stairs outside Robert's chambers in particular.</t:p>
<t:p>Mr. Audley sighed the weary sigh of mournful resignation.</t:p>
<t:p>"Never mind, Mrs. M.," he said; "the locksmith had plenty of time to do anything he wanted to
     do, I dare say, without your being any the wiser."</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Maloney stared at her employer with mingled surprise and alarm.</t:p>
<t:p>"Sure, there wasn't anything for him to stale, your honor, barrin' the birds and the
     geran'ums, and—"</t:p>
<t:p>"No, no, I understand. There, that'll do, Mrs. M. Tell me where the man lives, and I'll go
     and see him."</t:p>
<t:p>"But you'll have a bit of dinner first, sir?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I'll go and see the locksmith before I have my dinner."</t:p>
<t:p>He took up his hat as he announced his determination, and walked toward the door.</t:p>
<t:p>"The man's address, Mrs. M?"</t:p>
<t:p>The Irishwoman directed him to a small street at the back of St. Bride's Church, and thither
     Mr. Robert Audley quietly strolled, through the miry slush which simple Londoners call
      <t:hi>snow</t:hi>.</t:p>
<t:p>He found the locksmith, and, at the sacrifice of the crown of his hat, contrived to enter the
     low, narrow doorway of a little open shop. A jet of gas was flaring in the unglazed window, and
     there was a very merry party in the little room behind the shop; but no one responded to
     Robert's "Hulloa!" The reason of this was sufficiently obvious. The merry party was so much
     absorbed in its own merriment as to be deaf to all commonplace summonses from the outer world;
     and it was only when Robert, advancing further into the cavernous little shop, made so bold as
     to open the half-glass door which separated him from the merry-makers, that he succeeded in
     obtaining their attention.</t:p>
<t:p>A very jovial picture of the Teniers school was presented to Mr. Robert Audley upon the
     opening of this door.</t:p>
<t:p>The locksmith, with his wife and family, and two or three droppers-in of the female sex, were
     clustered about a table, which was adorned by two bottles; not vulgar bottles of that colorless
     extract of the juniper berry, much affected by the masses; but of <t:hi>bona fide</t:hi> port and
     sherry—fiercely strong sherry, which left a fiery taste in the mouth, nut-brown sherry—rather
     unnaturally brown, if anything—and fine old port; no sickly vintage, faded and thin from
     excessive age: but a rich, full-bodied wine, sweet and substantial and high colored.</t:p>
<t:p>The locksmith was speaking as Robert Audley opened the door.</t:p>
<t:p>"And with that," he said, "she walked off, as graceful as you please."</t:p>
<t:p>The whole party was thrown into confusion by the appearance of Mr. Audley, but it was to be
     observed that the locksmith was more embarrassed than his companions. He set down his glass so
     hurriedly, that he spilt his wine, and wiped his mouth nervously with the back of his dirty
     hand.</t:p>
<t:p>"You called at my chambers to-day," Robert said, quietly. "Don't let me disturb you, ladies."
     This to the droppers-in. "You called at my chambers to-day, Mr. White, and—"</t:p>
<t:p>The man interrupted him.</t:p>
<t:p>"I hope, sir, you will be so good as to look over the mistake," he stammered. "I'm sure, sir,
     I'm very sorry it should have occurred. I was sent for to another gentleman's chambers, Mr.
     Aulwin, in Garden Court; and the name slipped my memory; and havin' done odd jobs before for
     you, I thought it must be you as wanted me to-day; and I called at Mrs. Maloney's for the key
     accordin'; but directly I see the locks in your chambers, I says to myself, the gentleman's
     locks ain't out of order; the gentleman don't want all his locks repaired."</t:p>
<t:p>"But you stayed half an hour."</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, sir; for there was <t:hi>one</t:hi> lock out of order—the door nighest the staircase—and I
     took it off and cleaned it and put it on again. I won't charge you nothin' for the job, and I
     hope as you'll be as good as to look over the mistake as has occurred, which I've been in
     business thirteen years come July, and—"</t:p>
<t:p>"Nothing of this kind ever happened before, I suppose," said Robert, gravely. "No, it's
     altogether a singular kind of business, not likely to come about every day. You've been
     enjoying yourself this evening I see, Mr. White. You've done a good stroke of work to-day, I'll
     wager—made a lucky hit, and you're what you call 'standing treat,' eh?"</t:p>
<t:p>Robert Audley looked straight into the man's dingy face as he spoke. The locksmith was not a
     bad-looking fellow, and there was nothing that he need have been ashamed of in his face, except
     the dirt, and that, as Hamlet's mother says, "is common;" but in spite of this, Mr. White's
     eyelids dropped under the young barrister's calm scrutiny, and he stammered out some apologetic
     sort of speech about his "missus," and his missus' neighbors, and port wine and sherry wine,
     with as much confusion as if he, an honest mechanic in a free country, were called upon to
     excuse himself to Robert Audley for being caught in the act of enjoying himself in his own
     parlor.</t:p>
<t:p>Robert cut him short with a careless nod.</t:p>
<t:p>"Pray don't apologize," he said; "I like to see people enjoy themselves. Good-night, Mr.
     White good-night, ladies."</t:p>
<t:p>He lifted his hat to "the missus," and the missus' neighbors, who were much fascinated by his
     easy manner and his handsome face, and left the shop.</t:p>
<t:p>"And so," he muttered to himself as he went back to his chambers, "'with that she walked off
     as graceful as you please.'Who was it that walked off; and what was the story which the
     locksmith was telling when I interrupted him at that sentence? Oh, George Talboys, George
     Talboys, am I ever to come any nearer to the secret of your fate? Am I coming nearer to it now,
     slowly but surely? Is the radius to grow narrower day by day until it draws a dark circle
     around the home of those I love? How is it all to end?"</t:p>
<t:p>He sighed wearily as he walked slowly back across the flagged quadrangles in the Temple to
     his own solitary chambers.</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Maloney had prepared for him that bachelor's dinner, which, however excellent and
     nutritious in itself, has no claim to the special charm of novelty. She had cooked for him a
     mutton-chop, which was soddening itself between two plates upon the little table near the
     fire.</t:p>
<t:p>Robert Audley sighed as he sat down to the familiar meal, remembering his uncle's cook with a
     fond, regretful sorrow.</t:p>
<t:p>"Her cutlets a la Maintenon made mutton seem more than mutton; a sublimated meat that could
     scarcely have grown upon any mundane sheep," he murmured sentimentally, "and Mrs. Maloney's
     chops are apt to be tough; but such is life—what does it matter?"</t:p>
<t:p>He pushed away his plate impatiently after eating a few mouthfuls.</t:p>
<t:p>"I have never eaten a good dinner at this table since I lost George Talboys," he said. "The
     place seems as gloomy as if the poor fellow had died in the next room, and had never been taken
     away to be buried. How long ago that September afternoon appears as I look back at it—that
     September afternoon upon which I parted with him alive and well; and lost him as suddenly and
     unaccountably as if a trap-door had opened in the solid earth and let him through to the
     antipodes!"</t:p></t:div>
