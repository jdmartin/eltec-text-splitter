<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p>Months slipped by; the trees in Burton Crescent had long been all bare; the summer cries of
     itinerant vegetable dealers and flower sellers had vanished out of the quiet street.—The three
     sisters almost missed them, sitting in that one dull parlor from morning till night, in the
     intense solitude of people who, having neither heart nor money to spend in gayeties, live
     forlorn in London lodgings, and knowing nobody, have nobody to visit, nobody to visit them.</p>
<p>Except Mr. Ascott, who still called, and occasionally stayed to tea. The hospitalities,
     however, were all on their side. The first entertainment—to which Selina insisted upon going,
     and Johanna thought Hilary and Ascott had better go too—was splendid enough, but they were the
     only ladies present; and though Mr. Ascott did the honors with great magnificence, putting Miss
     Selina at the head of his table, where she looked exceedingly well, still the sisters agreed it
     was better that all further invitations to Russell Square should be declined. Miss Selina
     herself said it would be more dignified and decorous.</p>
<p>Other visitors they had none. Ascott never offered to bring any of his friends; and gradually
     they saw very little of him. He was frequently out, especially at meal times, so that his aunts
     gave up the struggle to make the humble dinners better and more to his liking, and would even
     have hesitated to take the money which he was understood to pay for his board, had he ever
     offered it, which he did not. Yet still whenever he did happen to remain with them a day, or an
     evening, he was good and affectionate, and always entertained them with descriptions of all he
     would do as soon as he got into practice.</p>
<p>Meantime they kept house as economically as possible upon the little ready money they had,
     hoping that more would come in—that Hilary would get pupils.</p>
<p>But Hilary never did. To any body who knows London this will not be surprising.—The wonder
     was in the Misses Leaf being so simple as to imagine that a young country lady, settling
     herself in lodgings in an obscure metropolitan street, without friends or introduction, could
     ever expect such a thing. No thing but her own daring, and the irrepressible well-spring of
     hope that was in her healthy youth, could have sustained her in what, ten years after, would
     have appeared to her, as it certainty was, downright insanity. But Heaven takes care of the
     mad, the righteously and unselfishly mad, and Heaven took care of poor Hilary.</p>
<p>The hundred labors she went through—weariness of body and travail of soul, the risks she ran,
     the pitfalls she escaped—what need to record here? Many have recorded the like, many more have
     known them, and acknowledged that when such histories are reproduced in books how utterly
     imagination fades before reality. Hilary never looked back-upon that time herself without a
     shuddering wonder how she could have dared all and gone through all. Possibly she never could,
     but for the sweet old face, growing older yet sweeter every day, which smiled upon her the
     minute she opened the door of that dull parlor, and made even No. 15 look like home.</p>
<p>When she told, sometimes gayly, sometimes with burning, bursting tears, the tale of her day's
     efforts and day's failures, it was always comfort to feel Johanna's hand on her hair Johanna's
     voice whispering over her, "Never mind, my child, all will come right in time All happens for
     good."</p>
<p>And the face, withered and worn, yet calm as a summer sea, full of the "peace which passeth
     all understanding," was a living comment on the truth of these words.</p>
<p>Another comfort Hilary had—Elizabeth.—During her long days of absence, wandering from one end
     of London to the other, after advertisements that she had answered, or governess institutions
     that she had applied to the domestic affairs fell almost entirely into the hands of Elizabeth.
     It was she who bought in, and kept a jealous eye, not unneeded, over provisions; she who cooked
     and waited, and sometimes even put a helping hand, coarse, but willing, into the family sewing
     and mending. This had now become so vital a necessity that it was fortunate Miss Leaf had no
     other occupation, and Miss Selina no other entertainment, than stitch, stitch, stitch, at the
     ever-beginning, never-ending wardrobe wants which assail decent poverty every where, especially
     in London.</p>
<p>"Clothes seem to wear out frightfully fast," said Hilary one day, when she was putting on her
     oldest gown, to suit a damp, foggy day, when the streets were slippery with the mud of settled
     rain.</p>
<p>"I saw such beautiful merino dresses in a shop in Southampton Row," insinuated Elizabeth; but
     her mistress shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, no; my old black silk will do capitally, and I can easily put on two shawls. Nobody
     knows me; and people may wear what they like in London. Don't look so grave, Elizabeth. What
     does it signify if I can but keep myself warm? Now, run away."</p>
<p>Elizabeth obeyed, but shortly reappeared with a bundle—a large, old fashioned thick
     shawl.</p>
<p>"Mother gave it me; her mistress gave it her; but we've never worn it, and never shall. If
     only you didn't mind putting it on, just this once—this terrible soaking day!"</p>
<p>The scarlet face, the entreating tones—there was no resisting them. One natural pang Hilary
     felt—that in her sharp poverty she had fallen so low as to be indebted to her servant, and then
     she too blushed, less for shame at accepting the kindness than for her own pride that could not
     at once receive it as such.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Elizabeth," she said, gravely and gently, and let herself be wrapped in the thick
     shawl. Its gorgeous reds and yellows would, she knew, make her noticeable, even though "people
     might wear any thing in London." Still, she put it on with a good grace, and all through her
     peregrinations that day it warmed not only her shoulders, but her heart.</p>
<p>Coming home, she paused wistfully before a glittering shoe shop; her poor little feet were so
     soaked and cold. Could she possibly afford a new pair of boots? It was not a matter of
     vanity—she had passed that. She did not care now how ugly and shabby looked the "wee feet" that
     had once been praised; but she felt it might be a matter of health and prudence. Suppose she
     caught cold—fell ill—died: died, leaving Johanna to struggle alone; died before Robert Lyon
     came home. Both thoughts struck sharp. She was too young still, or had not suffered enough,
     calmly to think of death and dying.</p>
<p>"It will do no harm to inquire the price. I might stop it out in omnibuses."</p>
<p>For this was the way that every new article of dress had to be procured—"stopping it cut" of
     something else.</p>
<p>After trying several pairs-with a fierce, bitter blush at a small hole which the day's
     walking had worn in her well darned stockings, and which she was sure the shopman saw, as well
     as an old lady who sat opposite—Hilary bought the plainest and stoutest of boots. The bill
     overstepped her purse by six pence, but she promised that sum on delivery, and paid the rest.
     She had got into a nervous horror of letting any account stand over for a single day.</p>
<p>Look tenderly, reader, on this picture of struggles so small, of sufferings so uninteresting
     and mean. I paint it not because it is original, but because it is so awfully true. Thousands
     of women, well born, well reared, know it to be true—burned into them by the cruel conflict of
     their youth; happy they if it ended in their youth, while mind and body had still enough
     vitality and elasticity to endure! I paint it, because it accounts for the accusation sometimes
     made—especially by men—that women are naturally stingy. Possibly so: but in many instances may
     it not have been this petty struggle with petty wants this pitiful calculating of penny against
     penny, how best to save here and spend there, which narrows a woman's nature in spite of
     herself? It sometimes takes years of comparative ease and freedom from pecuniary cares to
     counteract the grinding, lowering effects of a youth of poverty.</p>
<p>And I paint this picture, too, literally, and not on its picturesque side—it, indeed, poverty
     has a picturesque side—in order to show another side which it really has—high, heroic, made up
     of dauntless endurance, self sacrifice, and self control Also, to indicate that blessing which
     narrow circumstances alone bestow, the habit of looking more to the realities than to the shows
     of things, and of finding pleasure in enjoyments mental rather than sensuous, inward rather
     than external. When people can truly recognize this they cease either to be afraid or ashamed
     of poverty.</p>
<p>Hilary was not ashamed:—not even now, when hers smote sharper and harder than it had ever
     done at Stowbury. She felt it a sore thing enough; but it never humiliated nor angered her.
     Either she was too proud or not proud enough; but her low estate always seemed to her too
     simply external a thing to affect her relations with the world outside. She never thought of
     being annoyed with the shopkeeper, who, though he trusted her with the sixpence, carefully took
     down her name and address: still less to suspecting the old lady opposite, who sat and listened
     to the transaction—apparently a well-to-do customer, clad in a rich black silk and handsome
     sable furs—of looking down upon her and despising her. She herself never despised any body,
     except for wickedness.</p>
<p>So she waited contentedly, neither thinking of herself, nor of what others thought of her;
     but with her mind quietly occupied by the two thoughts, which in any brief space of rest always
     recurred, calming down all annoyances, and raising her above the level of petty pains—Johanna
     and Robert Lyon. Under the influence of these her tired face grew composed, and there was a
     wishful, far away, fond look in her eyes, which made it not wonderful that the said old
     lady—apparently an acute old soul in her way—should watch her, as we do occasionally watch
     strangers in whom we have become suddenly interested.</p>
<p>There is no accounting for these interests, or to the events to which they give rise.
     Sometimes they are pooh-pooh-ed as "romantic," "unnatural," "like a bit in a novel;" and yet
     they are facts continually occurring, especially to people of quick intuition, observation, and
     sympathy. Nay, even the most ordinary people have known or heard of such, resulting in
     mysterious, life-long loves; firm friendships; strange yet often wonderful happy marriages;
     sudden revolutions of fortune and destiny: things utterly unaccountable for, except by the
     belief in the inscrutable Providence which</p>
<p>    "Shapes our ends,      Rough-how them as we will." </p>
<p>When Hilary left the shop she was startled by a voice at her elbow.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, but if your way lies up Southampton Row, would you object to give an old
     woman a share of that capital umbrella of yours?"</p>
<p>"With pleasure," Hilary answered, though the oddness of the request amused her. And it was
     granted really with pleasure; for the old lady spoke with those "accents of the mountain
     tongue" which this foolish Hilary never recognized without a thrill at the heart.</p>
<p>"May be you think an old woman ought to take a cab, and not be intruding upon strangers; but
     I am hale and hearty, and being only a streets length from my own door, I dislike to waste
     unnecessary shillings."</p>
<p>"Certainly," acquiesced Hilary, with a half sigh: shillings were only too precious to
     her.</p>
<p>"I saw you in the boot shop, and you seemed the sort of young lady who would do a kindness to
     an old body like me; so I said to myself, 'Ill ask her.'"</p>
<p>"I am glad you did." Poor girl! she felt unconsciously pleased at finding herself still able
     to show a kindness to any body.</p>
<p>They walked on and on—it was certainly a long street's length—to the stranger's door, and it
     took Hilary a good way round from hers; but she said nothing of this, concluding, of course,
     that her companion was unaware of where she lived; in which she was mistaken. They stopped at
     last before a respectable house near Brunswick Square, bearing a brass plate, with the words
     "Miss Balquidder."</p>
<p>"That is my name, and very much obliged to you, my dear. How it rains! Ye're just
     drenched."</p>
<p>Hilary smiled and shook her damp shawl. "I shall take no harm. I am used to go out in all
     weathers."</p>
<p>"Are you a governess?" The question was so direct and kindly, that it hardly seemed an
     impertinence.</p>
<p>"Yes; but I have no pupils, and I fear I shall never get any."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"I suppose, because I know nobody here. It seems so very hard to get teaching in London. But
     I beg your pardon."</p>
<p>"I beg yours," said Miss Balquidder—not without a certain dignity—"for asking questions of a
     stranger. But I was once a stranger here myself, and had a 'sair fecht,' as we say in Scotland,
     before I could earn even my daily bread. Though I wasn't a governess, still I know pretty well
     what the sort of life is, and if I had daughters who must work for their bread, the one thing I
     would urge upon them should be—'Never become a governess.' "</p>
<p>"Indeed. For what reason?"</p>
<p>"I'll not tell you now, my dear, standing with all your wet clothes on; but as I said, if you
     will do me the favor to call."</p>
<p>"Thank you!" said Hilary, not sufficiently initiated in London caution to dread making a new
     acquaintance. Besides, she liked the rough hewn, good natured face; and the Scotch accent was
     sweet to her ear.</p>
<p>Yet when she reached home she was half shy of telling her sisters the engagement she had
     made. Selina was extremely shocked, and considered it quite necessary that the London
     Directory, the nearest clergyman, or, perhaps, Mr. Ascott, who living in the parish, must
     know—should be consulted as to Miss Balquidder's respectability.</p>
<p>"She has much more reason to question ours," recollected Hilary, with some amusement; for I
     never told her my name or address. She does not know a single thing about me.</p>
<p>Which fact, arguing the matter energetic ally two days after, the young lady might not have
     been so sure of, could she have penetrated the ceiling overhead. In truth, Miss Balquidder, a
     prudent person, who never did things by halves, and, like most truly generous people, was
     cautious even in her extremist fits of generosity, at that very moment was sitting in Mrs.
     Jones's first floor, deliberately discovering every single thing possible to be learned about
     the Leaf family.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, owing to Selina's indignant pertinacity, Hilary's own hesitation, and a dim
     hope of a pupil which rose up and faded like the rest, the possible acquaintance lay dormant
     for two or three weeks; till, alas! the fabulous wolf actually came to the door; and the
     sisters, after paying their week's rent, looked aghast at one another, not knowing where in the
     wide world the next week's rent was to come from.</p>
<p>"Thank God, we don't owe any thing: not a penny!" gasped Hilary.</p>
<p>"No; there is comfort in that," said Johanna. And the expression of her folded hands and
     upward face was not despairing, even though that of the poor widow, when her barrel of meal was
     gone, and her cruse of oil spent, would hardly have been sadder.</p>
<p>"I am sure we have wasted nothing, and cheated nobody;—surely God will help us."</p>
<p>"I know He will, my child."</p>
<p>And the two sisters, elder and younger, kissed one another, cried a little, and then sat down
     to consider what was to be done.</p>
<p>Ascott must be told how things were with them. Hitherto they had not troubled him much with
     their affairs: indeed, he was so little at home. And after some private consultation, both
     Johanna and Hilary decided that it was wisest to let the lad come and go as he liked; not
     attempting—as he once indignantly expressed it—"to tie him to their apron strings." For
     instinctively these maiden ladies felt that with men, and, above all, young men, the only way
     to bind the wandering heart was to leave it free, except by trying their utmost that home
     should be always a pleasant home.</p>
<p>It was touching to see their efforts, when Ascott came in of evenings, to enliven for his
     sake the dull parlor at No. 15. How Johanna put away her mending, and Selina ceased to grumble,
     and Hilary began her lively chat, that never failed to brighten and amuse the household. Her
     nephew even sometimes acknowledged that wherever he went, he met nobody so "clever" as Aunt
     Hilary.</p>
<p>So, presuming upon her influence with him, on this night, after the rest were gone to bed,
     she, being always the boldest to do any unpleasant thing, said to him.</p>
<p>"Ascott, how are your business affairs progressing? When do you think you will be able to get
     into practice?"</p>
<p>"Oh, presently. There's no hurry."</p>
<p>"I am not so sure of that. Do you know, my dear boy"—and she opened her purse, which
     contained a few shillings—"this is all the money we have in the world."</p>
<p>"Nonsense," said Ascott, laughing. "I beg your pardon," he added, seeing it was with her no
     laughing matter; "but I am so accustomed to be hard up that I don't seem to care. It always
     comes right somehow—at least with me."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't exactly know; but it does. Don't fret, Aunt Hilary. I'll lend you a pound or
     two."</p>
<p>She drew back. These poor, proud, fond women, who, if their boy, instead of a fine gentleman,
     had been a helpless invalid, would have tended him, worked for him, nay, begged for
     him—cheerfully, oh, how cheerfully! wanting nothing in the whole world but his love—they could
     not ask him for his money. Even now, offered thus, Hilary felt as if to take it would be
     intolerable.</p>
<p>Still the thing must be done.</p>
<p>"I wish, Ascott"—and she nerved herself to say what somebody ought to say to him—"I would you
     would not lend but pay us the pound a week you said you could so easily spare."</p>
<p>"To be sure I will. What a thoughtless fellow I have been! But—but—I fancied you would have
     asked me if you wanted it. Never mind, you'll get it all in a lump. Let me see—how much will it
     come to? You are the best head going for arithmetic, Aunt Hilary. Do reckon it all up?" She did
     so; and the sum total made Ascott open his eyes wide.</p>
<p>"Upon my soul I had no idea it was so much. I'm very sorry, but I seem fairly cleaned out
     this quarter—only a few sovereigns left to keep the mill going. You shall have them, or half of
     them, and I'll owe you the rest. Here!"</p>
<p>He emptied on the table, without counting, four or five pounds. Hilary took two, asking him
     gravely "If he was sure he could spare so much? She did not wish to inconvenience him."</p>
<p>"Oh, not at all; and I wouldn't mind if it did; you have been good aunts to me."</p>
<p>He kissed her, with a sudden fit of compunction, and bade her good-night, looking as if he
     did not care to be "bothered" any more.</p>
<p>Hilary retired, more sad, more hopeless about him than if he had slammed the door in her
     face, or scolded her like a trooper. Had he met her seriousness in the same spirit, even though
     it had been a sullen or angry spirit—and little as she said he must have felt she wished him to
     feel—that his aunts were displeased with him; but that utterly unrepressible light-heartedness
     of his—there was no doing any thing with it. There was so to speak, "no catching hold" of
     Ascott. He meant no harm. She repeated over and over again that the lad meant no harm. He had
     no evil ways; was always pleasant, good-natured, and affectionate, in his own careless fashion;
     but was no more to be relied on than a straw that every wind blows hither and thither; or, to
     use a common simile, a butterfly that never sees any thing farther than the nearest flower. His
     was, in short, the pleasure-loving temperament, not positively sinful or sensual, but still
     holding pleasure as the greatest good; and regarding what deeper natures call "duty," and find
     therein their strong-hold and consolation, as a mere bugbear or a sentimental theory, or an
     impossible folly.</p>
<p>Poor lad! and he had the world to fight with; how would it use him? Even if no heavy sorrows
     for himself or others smote him, his handsome face would have to grow old, his strong frame to
     meet sickness—death.—How would he do it? That is the thought which always recurs. What is the
     end of such men as these? Alas! the answer would come from hospital wards, alms-houses and
     work-houses, debtors' prisons and lunatic asylums.</p>
<p>To apprehensions like this—except the last, happily it was as yet too far off—Hilary had been
     slowly and sadly arriving about Ascott for weeks past; and her conversation with him to-night
     seemed to make them darken down upon her with added gloom. As she went up stairs she set her
     lips together hard.</p>
<p>"I see there is nobody to do any thing except me. But I must not tell Johanna." </p>
<p>She lay long awake, planning every conceivable scheme for saving money; till at length, her
     wits sharpened by the desperation of the circumstances, there flashed upon her an idea that
     came out of a talk she had had with Elizabeth that morning. True, it was a perfectly new and
     untried chance—and a mere chance; still it was right to overlook nothing. She would not have
     ventured to tell Selina of it for the world, and even to Johanna, she only said—finding her as
     wakeful as herself—said it in a careless manner, as if it had relation to nothing, and she
     expected nothing from it— "I think, as I have nothing else to do, I will go and see Miss
     Balquidder to-morrow morning."</p>
