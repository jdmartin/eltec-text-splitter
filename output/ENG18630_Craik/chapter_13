<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<p>Miss Balquidder's house was a handsome one, handsomely furnished, and a neat little to
     aid-servant showed Hilary at once into the dining-parlor, where the mistress sat before a
     business-like writing-table, covered with letters, papers, etc., all arranged with that careful
     order in disorder which indicates, even in the smallest things, the possession of an accurate,
     methodical mind, than which there are few greater possessions, either to its owner or to the
     world at large.</p>
<p>Miss Balquidder was not a personable woman; she had never been so even in youth; and age had
     told its tale upon those large, strong features—"thoroughly Scotch features," they would have
     been called by those who think all Scotchwomen are necessarily big, raw-boned, and ugly; and
     have never seen that wonderfully noble beauty—not prettiness, but actual beauty in its highest
     physical as well as spiritual development—which is not seldom found across the Tweed.</p>
<p>But while there was nothing lovely, there was nothing unpleasant or uncomely in Miss
     Balquidder. Her large figure, in its plain black silk dress; her neat white cap, from under
     which peeped the little round curls of flaxen hair, neither gray nor snowy, but real
     "lint-white locks" still; and her good-humored, motherly look—motherly rather than
     old-maidish—gave an impression which may be best described by the word "comfortable."—She was a
     "comfortable" woman. She had that quality—too rarely, alas! in all people, and rarest in women
     going solitary down the hill of life—of being able, out of the deep content of her own nature,
     to make other people the same.</p>
<p>Hilary was cheered in spite of herself: it always conveys hope to the young, when in sore
     trouble, if they see the old looking happy.</p>
<p>"Welcome, my dear! I was afraid you had forgotten your promise."</p>
<p>"Oh no," said Hilary, responding heartily to the hearty clasp of a hand large as a man's, but
     soft as a woman's.</p>
<p>"Why did you not come sooner?"</p>
<p>More than one possible excuse flashed thro' Hilary's mind, but she was too honest to give it.
     She gave none at all. Nor did she like to leave the impression that this was merely a visit,
     when she knew she had only come from secondary and personal motives.</p>
<p>"May I tell you why I came to-day?—Because I want advice and help, and I think you can give
     it, from something I heard about you yesterday."</p>
<p>"Indeed! From whom?"</p>
<p>"In rather a roundabout way; from Mrs. Jones, who told our maid-servant."</p>
<p>"The same girl I met on the staircase at your bones? I beg your pardon, but I know where you
     live, Miss Leaf; your landlady happens to be an acquaintance of mine."</p>
<p>"So she said: and she told our Elizabeth that you were a rich and benevolent woman, who took
     a great interest in helping other women; not in money"—blushing scarlet at be idea—"I don't
     mean that, but in procuring them work. I want work—oh! so terribly. If you only knew—"</p>
<p>"Sit down, my dear;" for Hilary was rambling much, her voice breaking, and her eyes filling,
     in spite of all her self-command.</p>
<p>Miss Balquidder—who seemed accustomed to wait upon herself—went out of the room, and returned
     with cake and glasses; then she took the wine from the side-board, poured some oat for herself
     and Hilary, and began to talk.</p>
<p>"It is nearly my luncheon-time, and I am a great friend to regular eating and drinking. I
     never let any thing interfere with my own meals, or other folks' either, if I can help it. I
     would as soon expect that fire to keep itself up without coals, as my mind to go on working if
     I don't look after my body. You understand? You seem to have good health, Miss Leaf. I hope you
     are a prudent girl, and take care of it."</p>
<p>"I think I do;" and Hilary smiled. "At any rate my sister does for me, and also
     Elizabeth."</p>
<p>"Ah, I liked the look of that girl. If families did but know that the most useful patent of
     respectability they can carry about with them is their maid-servant! That is how I always judge
     my new acquaintances."</p>
<p>"There's reason in it, too," said Hilary, amused and drawn out of herself by the frank manner
     and the cordial voice—I use the adjective advisedly; none the less sweet because its good terse
     English had a decided Scotch accent, with here and there a Scotch word. Also there was about
     Miss Balquidder a certain dry humor essentially Scotch—neither Irish "wit" nor English "fun,"
     but Scotch humor; a little ponderous perhaps, yet sparkling: like the sparkles from a large
     lump of coal, red-warm at the heart, and capable of warming a whole household. As many a time
     it had warmed the little household at Stowbury—for Robert Lyon had it in perfection. Like a
     waft as from old times, it made Hilary at once feel at home with Miss Balquidder. Equally, Miss
     Balquidder might have seen something in this girl's patient, heroic, forlorn youth which
     reminded her of her own. Unreasoning as these sudden attractions appear, there is often a
     hidden something beneath which in reality makes them both natural and probable, as was the case
     here. In half an hour these two women were sitting talking like old friends; and Hilary had
     explained her present position, needs and desires. They ended in the one cry—familiar to how
     many thousands more of helpless young women!—"I want work!"</p>
<p>Miss Balquidder listened thoughtfully. Not that it was a new story—alas! she heard it every
     day; but there was something new in the telling of it; such extreme directness and simplicity,
     such utter want of either false pride or false shame, No asking of favors, and yet no shrinking
     from well-means kindness; the poor woman speaking freely to the rich one, recognizing the
     common womanhood of both, and never supposing for an instant that mere money or position could
     make any difference between them.</p>
<p>The story ended, both turned, as was the character of both, to the practical application of
     it—what it was exactly that Hilary needed, and what Miss Balquidder could supply.</p>
<p>The latter said, after a turn or two up and down the room, with her hands behind her—the only
     masculine trick she had—</p>
<p>"My dear, before going further, I ought to tell you one thing—I am not a lady."</p>
<p>Hilary looked at her in no little bewilderment.</p>
<p>"That is," explained Miss Balquidder, laughing, "not an educated gentlewoman like you. I made
     my money myself—in trade. I kept an outfitter's shop."</p>
<p>"You must have kept it uncommonly well," was the involuntary reply, which, in its extreme
     honesty and naivete, was perhaps the best thing that Hilary could have said.</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps I did," and Miss Balquidder laughed her hearty laugh, betraying one of her few
     weaknesses—a consciousness of her own capabilities as a woman of business, and a pleasure at
     her own deserved success.</p>
<p>"Therefore, you see. I can not help you as a governess. Perhaps I would not if I could, for,
     so far as I see, a good clearance of one half the governesses into honest trades would be for
     their own benefit, and greatly to the benefit of the other half. But that's not my affair. I
     only meddle with things I understand. Miss Leaf, would you be ashamed of keeping a shop?"</p>
<p>It is no reflection upon Hilary to confess that this point-blank question startled her.—Her
     bringing up had been strictly among the professional class; and in the provinces sharper than
     even in London is drawn the line between the richest tradesman who "keeps a shop," and the
     poorest lawyer, doctor, or clergyman who ever starved in decent gentility. It had been often a
     struggle for Hilary Leaf's girlish pride to have to teach A B C to little boys and girls whose
     parents stood behind counters; but as she grew older she grew wiser, and intercourse with
     Robert Lyon had taught her much. She never forgot, one day, when Selina asked him something
     about his grandfather or great-grandfather, and he answered quickly, smiling, "Well, I suppose
     I had one, but I really never heard." Nevertheless it takes long to conquer entirely the class
     prejudices of years, nay, more, of generations. In spite of her will Hilary felt herself wince,
     and the color rush all over her face, at Miss Balquidder's question.</p>
<p>"Take time to answer, and speak out, my dear. Don't be afraid. You'll not offend me."</p>
<p>The kindly cheerful tone made Hilary recover her balance immediately.</p>
<p>"I never thought of it before; the possibility of such a thing did not occur to me; but I
     hope I should not be ashamed of any honest work for which I was competent. Only—to serve in a
     shop—to want upon strangers—I am so horribly shy of strangers." And again the sensitive color
     rushed in a perfect tide over checks and forehead.</p>
<p>Miss Balquidder looked, half amused, compassionately at her.</p>
<p>"No, my dear, you would not make a good shop-woman, at least there are many who are better
     fitted for it than you; and it is my maxim that people should try to find out, and to do, only
     that which they are best fitted for. If they did we might not have so many cases of proud
     despair and ambitious failure in the world. It looks very grand and interesting sometimes to
     try and do what you can't de, and then tear your hair, and think the world has ill-used
     you—very grand, but very silly: when all the while, perhaps, there is something else you can do
     thoroughly well; and the world will be exceedingly obliged to you for doing it, and not doing
     the other thing.—As doubtless the world was to me, when, instead of being a mediocre musician,
     as I once wished to be—it's true, my dear—I took to keeping one of the best ladies' outfitting
     warehouses in London."</p>
<p>While she talked her companion had quite recovered herself, and Miss Balquidder then went on
     to explain, what I will tell more briefly, if less graphically, than the good Scotchwoman, who,
     like all who have had a hard struggle in their youth, liked a little to dilate upon it in easy
     old age. Hard as it was, however, it had ended early, for at fifty she found herself a woman of
     independent property, without kith or kin, still active, energetic, and capable of enjoying
     life. She applied her mind to find out what she could best do with herself and her money.</p>
<p>"I might have bought a landed estate to be inherited by—nobody; or a house in Belgravia, and
     an opera-box, to be shared by—nobody. We all have our pet luxuries; none of these were exactly
     mine."</p>
<p>"No," assented Hilary, somewhat abstractedly. She was thinking—if she could make a fortune,
     and—and give it away!—if, by any means, any honorable, upright heart could be made to
     understand that it did not signify, in reality, which side the money came from; that it
     sometimes showed deeper, the very deepest attachment, when a proud, poor man had self-respect
     and courage enough to say to a woman, "I love you, and I will marry you; I am not such a coward
     as to be afraid of your gold."</p>
<p>But, oh! what a ridiculous dream!—and she sat there, the penniless Hilary Leaf, listening to
     Miss Balquidder, the rich lady, whose life seemed so easy. For the moment, perhaps, her own
     appeared hard. But she had hope, and she was young. She knew nothing of the years and years
     that had had to be lived through before those kind eyes looked as clear and cloudless as now;
     before the voice had gained the sweet evenness of tone which she liked to listen to, and felt
     that it made her quiet and "good," almost like Johanna's.</p>
<p>"You see, my dear," said Miss Balquidder, "when one has no duties, one must just make them;
     when we have nobody to care for us, we must take to caring for every body. I suppose"—here a
     slight pause indicated that this life, like all women's lives, had had its tale, now long, long
     told—"I suppose I was not meant to be a wife; but I am quite certain I was meant to be a
     mother. And"—with her peculiar, bright, humorous look—"you'd be astonished, Miss Leaf, if you
     knew what lots of 'children' I have in all parts of the world."</p>
<p>Miss Balquidder then went on to explain, that finding, from her own experience, how great was
     the number, and how sore the trial of young women who nowadays are obliged to work—obliged to
     forget that there is such a thing as the blessed privilege of being worked for—she had set
     herself, in her small way, to try and help them. Her pet project was to induce educated women
     to quit the genteel starvation of governesships for some good trade thereby bringing higher
     intelligence into a class which needed, not the elevation of the work itself, which was
     comparatively easy and refined, but of the workers. She had therefore invested sum after sum of
     her capital in setting up various small shops in the environs of London, in her own former
     line, and others—stationers, lace-shops, etc.—trades which could be well carried on by
     women.—Into the management of these she put as many young girls as she could find really fitted
     for it, or willing to learn, paying them regular salaries, large or small, according to their
     deserts.</p>
<p>"Fair work, fair pay; not one penny more or less; I never do it; it would not be honest. I
     overlook each business myself, and it is carried on in my name. Sometimes it brings me in a
     little profit; sometimes not. Of course," she added, smiling. "I would rather have profits than
     losses; still, I balance one against the other, and it leaves me generally a small interest for
     my money—two or three per cent., which is all I care about. Thus, you see. I and my young
     people make a fair bargain on both sides; it's no charity. I don't believe in charity."</p>
<p>"No," said Hilary, feeling her spirit rise. She was yet young enough, yet enough unworn by
     the fight to feel the deliciousness of work—honest work for honest pay. "I think I could do
     it," she added. "I think, with a little practice, I really could keep a shop."</p>
<p>"At all events, perhaps you could do what I find more difficult to get done, and well done,
     for it requires a far higher class of women than generally apply: you could keep the accounts
     of a shop; you should be the head, and it would be easy to find the hands, Let me see; there is
     a young lady, she has managed my stationer's business at Kensington these two years, and now
     she is going to be married. Are you good at figures; do you understand book-keeping?"</p>
<p>And suddenly changing into the woman of business, and one who was evidently quite accustomed
     both to arrange and command, Miss Balquidder put Hilary through a sort of extempore
     arithmetical catechism, from which she came off with flying colors.</p>
<p>"I only wish there were more like you. I wish there were more young ladies brought up
     like—"</p>
<p>"Like boys!" said Hilary, laughing, "for I always used to say that was my case."</p>
<p>"No, I never desire to see young women made into men." And Miss Balquidder seemed a little
     scandalized. "But I do wish girls were taught fewer accomplishments, and more reading, writing,
     and arithmetic; were made as accurate, orderly, and able to help themselves as boys are. But to
     business. Will you take the management of my stationer's shop?"</p>
<p>Hilary's breath came hard and fast. Much as she had longed for work, to get this sort of
     work—to keep a stationer's shop? What would her sisters say? what would he say! But she dared
     not think of that just now.</p>
<p>"How much should I be able to earn, do you think?"</p>
<p>Miss Balquidder considered a moment, and then said, rather shortly, for it was not exactly
     acting on her own principles; she knew the pay was above the work. "I will give you a hundred a
     year."</p>
<p>A hundred a year! actually certain, and over and above any other income. It seemed a fortune
     to poor Hilary.</p>
<p>"Will you give me a day or two to think about it and consult my sisters?"</p>
<p>She spoke quietly, but Miss Balquidder could see how agitated she was; how she evidently
     struggled with many feelings that would be best struggled with alone. The good old lady
     rose.</p>
<p>"Take your own time, my dear; I will keep the situation open for you for one week from this
     date. And now I must send you away, for I have a great deal to do."</p>
<p>They parted quite like friends; and Hilary went out, walking quickly, feeling neither the
     wind nor the rain. Yet when she reached No. 15 she could not bring herself to enter, but took
     another turn or two round the Crescent, trying to be quite sure of her own mind before she
     opened the matter to her sisters.—</p>
<p>And there was one little battle to be fought which the sisters did know.</p>
<p>It was perhaps foolish, seeing she did not belong to him in any open way, and he had no
     external right over her life or her actions, that she should go back and back to the question,
     "What would Robert Lyon say?"</p>
<p>He knew she earned her daily bread; sometimes this had seemed to vex and annoy him, but it
     must be done; and when a thing was inevitable, it was not Mr. Lyon's way to say much about it.
     But being a governess was an accredited and customary mode of a young lady's earning her
     livelihood. This was different. If he should think it too public, too unfeminine: he had such a
     horror of a woman's being any thing but a woman, as strong and brave as she could, but in a
     womanly way; doing any thing, however painful, that she was obliged to do, but never out of
     choice or bravado, or the excitement of stepping out of her own sphere into man's. Would Robert
     Lyon think less of her, Hilary, because she had to earn to take care of herself, to protect
     herself, and to act in so many ways for herself, contrary to the natural and right order of
     things? That old order—God forbid it should ever change!—which ordained that the women should
     be "keepers at home;" happy rulers of that happy little world, which seemed as far off as the
     next world from this poor Hilary.</p>
<p>"What if he should look down upon me? What if he should return and find me different from
     what he expected?"</p>
<p>And bitter tears burned in her eyes, as she walked rapidly and passionately along the
     deserted street. Then a revulsion came.</p>
<p>"No; love is worth nothing that is not worth every thing, and to be trusted through every
     thing. If he could forget me—could love any one better than me—me myself, no matter what I
     was—ugly or pretty, old or young, rich or poor—I would not care for his love. It would not be
     worth my having; I'd let it go. Robert, though it broke my heart, I'd let you go."</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed; her poor little hand clenched itself under her shawl; and then, as a half
     reproach, she heard in fancy the steady loving voice—which could have calmed her wildest
     paroxysm of passion and pain—"You must trust me, Hilary."</p>
<p>Yes, he was a man to be trusted. No doubt very much like other men, and by no means such a
     hero to the world at large as this fond girl made him out to be; but Robert Lyon had, with all
     people, and under all circumstances, the character of reliableness. He had also—you might read
     it in his face—a quality equally rare, faithfulness. Not merely sincerity, but faithfulness;
     the power of conceiving one clear purpose, or one strong love—in unity of strength—and of not
     only keeping true to it at the time, but of holding fast to it with a single-minded persistency
     that never even takes in the idea of voluntary change, as long as persistency is right or
     possible.</p>
<p>"Robert, Robert!" sobbed this forlorn girl, as if slowly waking up to a sense of her
     forlorness, and of the almost universal fickleness, not actual falseness, but fickleness, which
     prevails in the world and among mankind. "O Robert, be faithful! faithful to yourself—faithful
     to me!"</p>
