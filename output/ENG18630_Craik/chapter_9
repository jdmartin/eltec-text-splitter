<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p>The day of the Grand Hegira came.</p>
<p>"I remember," said Miss Leaf, as they rumbled for the last time through the empty morning
     streets of poor old Stowbury: "I remember my grandmother telling me that when my grandfather
     was courting her, and she out of coquetry refused him, he set off on horseback to London, and
     she was so wretched to think of all the dangers he ran on the journey, and in London itself,
     that she never rested till she got him back, and then immediately married him."</p>
<p>"No such catastrophe is likely to happen to any of us, except, perhaps, to Elizabeth," said
     Miss Hilary, trying to get up, a little feeble mirth, any thing to pass away the time and
     lessen the pain of parting, which was almost too much for Johanna. "What do you say? Do you
     mean to get married in London, Elizabeth?"</p>
<p>But Elizabeth could make no answer, even to kind Miss Hilary. They had not imagined she felt
     the leaving her native place so much. She had watched intently the last glimpse of Stowbury
     church tower, and now sat with reddened eyes, staring blankly out of the carriage window,</p>
<p>"Silent as a stone."</p>
<p>Once or twice a large slow tear gathered on each of her eyes, but it was shaken off angrily
     from the high check bones, and never settled into absolute crying. They thought it best to take
     no notice of her. Only, when reaching the new small station, where the "resonant steam eagles"
     were, for the first time, beheld by the innocent Stowbury ladies, there arose a discussion as
     to the manner of traveling. Miss Leaf said, decidedly "Second class; and then we can keep
     Elizabeth with us." Upon which Elizabeth's mouth melted into something between a quiver and a
     smile.</p>
<p>Soon it was all over, and the little house-hold was compressed into the humble second class
     carriage, cheerless and cushionless, whirling through indefinite England in a way that
     confounded all their geography and topography. Gradually as the day darkened into heavy, chilly
     July rain, the scarcely kept up spirits of the four passengers began to sink. Johanna grew very
     white and worn, Selina became, to use Ascott's phrase, "as cross as two sticks," and even
     Hilary, turning her eyes from the gray sodden looking landscape without, could find no spot of
     comfort to rest on within the carriage, except that round rosy face of Elizabeth Hand's.</p>
<p>Whether it was from the spirit of contradiction existing in most such natures, which,
     especially in youth, are more strong than sweet, or from a better feeling, the fact was
     noticeable, that when every one else's spirits went down Elizabeth's went up. Nothing could
     bring her out of a "grumpy" fit so satisfactorily as her mistresses falling into one. When Miss
     Selina now began to fidget hither and thither, each tone of her fretful voice seeming to go
     through her eldest sister's every nerve, till even Hilary said, impatiently, "Oh, Selina, can't
     you be quiet?" then Elizabeth rose from the depth of her gloomy discontent up to the surface
     immediately.</p>
<p>She was only a servant; but Nature bestows that strange vague thing that we term "force of
     character" independently of position. Hilary often remembered afterward, how much more
     comfortable the end of the journey was than she had expected—how Johanna lay at ease, with her
     feet in Elizabeth's lap, wrapped in Elizabeth's best woolen shawl; and how, when Selina's whole
     attention was turned to an ingenious contrivance with a towel and fork and Elizabeth's basket,
     for stopping the rain out of the carriage roof—she became far less disagreeable, and even a
     little proud of her own cleverness. And so there was a temporary lull in Hilary's cares, and
     she could sit quiet, with her eyes fixed on the rainy landscape, which she did not see, and her
     thoughts wandering toward that unknown place and unknown life into which they were sweeping, as
     we all sweep, ignorantly, unresistingly, almost unconsciously, into new destinies. Hilary, for
     the first time, began to doubt of theirs. Anxious as she had been to go to London, and wise as
     the proceeding appeared, now that the die was cast and the cable cut, the old simple, peaceful
     life at Stowbury grew strangely dear.</p>
<p>"I wonder if we shall ever go back again, or what is to happen to us before we do go back,"
     she thought, and turned, with a half defined fear, toward her eldest sister, who looked so old
     and fragile beside that sturdy, healthful servant girl. "Elizabeth!" Elizabeth, rubbing Miss
     Leaf's feet, started at the unwonted sharpness of Miss Hilary's tone.</p>
<p>"There; I'll do that for my sister. Go and look out of the window at London." </p>
<p>For the great smoky cloud which began to rise in the rainy horizon was indeed London. Soon
     through the thickening nebula of houses they converged to what was then the nucleus of all
     railway traveling, the Euston Terminus, and were hustled on to the platform, and jostled
     helplessly to and fro these poor country ladies! Anxiously they scanned the crowd of strange
     faces for the one only face they knew in the great metropolis—which did not appear.</p>
<p>"It is very strange; very wrong of Ascott. Hilary, you surely told him the hour correctly.
     For once, at least, he might have been in time"</p>
<p>So chafed Miss Selina, while Elizabeth, who by some miraculous effort of intuitive genius,
     had succeeded in collecting the luggage, was now engaged in defending it from all comers,
     especially porters, and making of it a comfort able seat for Miss Leaf.</p>
<p>"Nay, have patience, Selina. We will give him just five minutes more, Hilary." </p>
<p>And Johanna sat down, with her sweet, calm, long suffering face turned upward to that younger
     one, which was, as youth is apt to be, hot, and worried, and angry. And so they waited till the
     terminus was almost deserted, and the last cab had driven off, when, suddenly, dashing up the
     station yard out of another, came Ascott.</p>
<p>He was so sorry, so very sorry, downright grieved, at having kept his aunts waiting. But his
     watch was wrong—some fellows at dinner detained him—the train was before its time surely. In
     fact, his aunts never quite made out what the excuse was; but they looked into his bright
     handsome face, and their wrath melted like clouds before the sun. He was so gentlemanly, so
     well dressed—much better dressed than even at Stowbury—and he seemed so unfeignedly glad to see
     them. He handed them all into the cab—even Elizabeth. though whispering meanwhile to his Aunt
     Hilary, "What on earth did you bring her for?" and their was just going to leap on to the box
     himself, when he stopped to ask "Where he should tell cabby to drive to?"</p>
<p>"Where to?" repeated his aunts in undisguised astonishment. They had never thought of any
     thing but of being taken home at once by their boy.</p>
<p>"You see," Ascott said, in a little confusion, "you wouldn't be comfortable with me. A young
     fellow's lodgings are not like a house of one's own, and, besides—"</p>
<p>"Besides, when a young fellow is ashamed of his old aunts, he can easily find reasons."</p>
<p>"Hush, Selina!" interposed Miss Leaf. "My dear boy, your old aunts would never let you
     inconvenience yourself for them. Take us to an inn for the night, and to morrow we will find
     lodgings for ourselves."</p>
<p>Ascott looked greatly relieved.</p>
<p>"And you are not vexed with me, Aunt Johanna?" said he, with something of his old childish
     tone of compunction, as he saw—he could not help seeing—the utter weariness which Johanna tried
     so hard to hide.</p>
<p>"No, my dear, not vexed. Only I wish we had known this a little sooner that we might have
     made arrangements. Now, where shall we go?"</p>
<p>Ascott mentioned a dozen hotels, but they found he only knew them by name. At last Miss Leaf
     remembered one, which her father used to go to, on his frequent journeys to London, and whence,
     indeed, he had been brought home to die. And though all the recollections about it were sad
     enough, still it felt less strange than the rest, in this dreariness of London. So she proposed
     going to the "Old Bell," Holborn.</p>
<p>"A capital place!" exclaimed Ascott, eagerly. "And I'll take and settle you there: and we'll
     order supper, and make a jolly night of it. All right. Drive on, cabby."</p>
<p>He jumped on the box, and then looked in mischievously, flourishing his lit cigar and shaking
     his long hair—his Aunt Selina's two great abominations—right in her indignant face: but withal
     looking so merry and good tempered that she shortly softened into a smile.</p>
<p>"How handsome the boy is growing!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Johanna, with a slight sigh; "and did you notice? how exceedingly like his—"</p>
<p>The sentence was left unfinished. Alas! if every young man, who believes his faults and
     follies injure himself alone, could feel what it must be, years afterward, to have his nearest
     kindred shrink from saying as the saddest, most ominous thing they could say of his son, that
     the lad is growing "so like his father!"</p>
<p>It might have been—they assured each other that it was—only the incessant roll, roll of the
     street sounds below their windows, which kept the Misses Leaf awake half the night of this
     their first night in London. And when they sat down to breakfast—having waited an hour vainly
     for their nephew—it might have been only the gloom of the little parlor which cast a slight
     shadow over them all. Still the shadow was there.</p>
<p>It deepened despite the sunshiny morning into which the last night's rain had brightened till
     Holborn Bars looked cheerful, and Holborn pavement actually clean, so that, as Elizabeth said,
     "you might eat your dinner off it;" which was the one only thing she condescended to approve in
     London. She had sat all evening mute in her corner, for Miss Leaf would not send her away into
     the terra incognita of a London hotel. Ascott, at first considerably annoyed at the presence of
     what he called a "skeleton at the feast," had afterward got over it; and run on with a mixture
     of childish glee and mannish pomposity about his plans and intentions—how he meant to take a
     house, he thought, in one of the squares, or a street leading out of them: how he would put up
     the biggest of brass plates, with "Mr. Leaf, surgeon." and soon get an extensive practice, and
     have all his aunts to live with him. And his aunts had smiled and listened, forgetting all
     about the silent figure in the corner, who perhaps had gone to sleep, or had also listened.</p>
<p>"Elizabeth, come and look out at London."</p>
<p>So she and Miss Hilary whiled away another heavy three quarters of an hour in watching and
     commenting on the incessantly shifting crowd which swept past Holborn Bars. Miss Selina
     sometimes looked out too, but more often sat fidgeting and wondering why Ascott did not come;
     while Miss Leaf, who never fidgeted, became gradually more and more silent. Her eyes were fixed
     on the door, with an expression which, if Hilary could have remembered so far back, would have
     been to her something not painfully new, but still more painfully old—a look branded into her
     face by many an anxious hour's listening for the footstep that never came, or only came to
     bring distress. It was the ineffaceable token of that long, long struggle between affection and
     conscience, pity and scarcely repressible contempt, which, for more than one generation, had
     been the appointed burden of this family—at least the women of it—till sometimes it seemed to
     hang over them almost like a fate.</p>
<p>About noon Miss Leaf proposed calling for the hotel bill. Its length so alarmed the country
     ladies that Hilary suggested not staying to dine, but going immediately in search of
     lodgings.</p>
<p>"What, without a gentleman! Impossible! I always understood ladies could go nowhere in London
     without a gentleman!"</p>
<p>"We shall come very ill off then, Selina. But any how I mean to try. You know the region
     where, we have heard, lodgings are cheapest and best—that is, best for us. It can not be far
     from here. Suppose I start at once?"</p>
<p>"What, alone?" cried Johanna, anxiously.</p>
<p>"No, dear, I'll take the map with me, and Elizabeth. She is not afraid."</p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled, and rose, with that air of dogged devotedness with which she would have
     prepared to follow Miss Hilary to the North Pole, if necessary. So, after a few minutes of
     arguing with Selina, who did not press her point overmuch, since she herself had not to commit
     the impropriety of the expedition. After a few minutes more of hopeless lingering about—till
     even Miss Leaf said they had better wait no longer—mistress and maid took a farewell nearly as
     pathetic as if they had been really Arctic voyagers, and plunged right into the dusty glare and
     hurrying crowd of the "sunny side" of Holborn in July.</p>
<p>A strange sensation, and yet there was something exhilarating in it. The intense solitude
     that there is in a London crowd these country girls—for Miss Hilary herself was no more than a
     girl—could not as yet realize. They only felt the life of it; stirring, active, incessantly
     moving life; even though it was of a kind that they knew as little of it as the crowd did of
     them. Nothing struck Hilary more than the self-absorbed look of passers-by: each so busy on his
     own affairs, that, in spite of Selina's alarm, for all notice taken of them, they might as well
     be walking among the cows and horses in Stowbury field.</p>
<p>Poor old Stowbury! They felt how far away they were from it when a ragged, dirty, vicious
     looking girl offered them a moss rose bud for "one penny, only one penny;" which Elizabeth,
     lagging behind, bought, and found it only a broken off bud stuck on to a bit of wire.</p>
<p>"That's London ways, I suppose," said she, severely, and became so misanthropic that she
     would hardly vouchsafe a glance to the hand some square they turned into, and merely observed
     of the tall houses, taller than any Hilary had ever seen, that she "wouldn't fancy running up
     and down them stairs."</p>
<p>But Hilary was cheerful in spite of all. She was glad to be in this region, which,
     theoretically, she knew by heart—glad to find herself in the body, where in the spirit she had
     come so many a time. The mere consciousness of this seemed to refresh her. She thought she
     would be much happier in London; that in the long years to come that must be borne, it would be
     good for her to have something to do as well as to hope for; something to fight with as well as
     to endure. Now more than ever came pulsing in and out of her memory a line once repeated in her
     hearing, with an observation of how "true" it was. And though originally it was applied by a
     man to a woman, and she smiled sometimes to think how "unfeminine" some people—Selina for
     instance—would consider her turning it the other way, still she did so. She believed that, for
     woman as for man, that is the purest and noblest love which is the most self-existent, most
     independent of love returned; and which can say, each to the other equally on both sides, that
     the whole solemn purpose of life is, under God's service,</p>
<p>"If not to win, to feel more worthy thee."</p>
<p>Such thoughts made her step firmer and her heart lighter; so that she hardly noticed the
     distance they must have walked till the close London air began to oppress her, and the smooth
     glaring London pavements made her Stowbury feet ache sorely.</p>
<p>"Are you tired, Elizabeth? Well, we'll rest soon. There must be lodgings near here. Only I
     can't quite make out—"</p>
<p>As Miss Hilary looked up to the name of the street the maid noticed what a glow came into her
     mistress's face, pale and tired as it was. Just then a church clock struck the quarter
     hour.</p>
<p>"That must be St. Pancras. And this—yes, this is Burton Street, Burton Crescent." </p>
<p>"I'm sure Missis wouldn't like to live there;" observed Elizabeth, eyeing uneasily the gloomy
     rez de-chaussee, familiar to many a generation of struggling respectability, where, in the
     decadence of the season, every second house bore the announcement "apartments furnished."</p>
<p>"No," Miss Hilary replied, absently. Yet she continued to walk up and down the whole length
     of the street; then passed out into the dreary, deserted looking Crescent, where the trees were
     already beginning to fade; not, however, into the bright autumn tint of country woods, but into
     a premature withering, ugly and sad to behold.</p>
<p>"I am glad he is not here—glad, glad!" thought Hilary, as she realized the unutterable
     dreariness of those years when Robert Lyon lived and studied in his garret from month's end to
     month's end—these few dusty trees being the sole memento of the green country life in which he
     had been brought up, and which she knew he so passionately loved. Now she could understand,
     that "calenture" which he had sometimes jestingly alluded to, as coming upon him at times, when
     he felt literally sick for the sight of a green field or a hedge full of birds. She wondered
     whether the same feeling would ever come upon her in this strange desert of London, the
     vastness of which grew upon her every hour.</p>
<p>She was glad he was away; yes, heart glad! And yet, if this minute she could only have seen
     him coming round the Crescent, have met his smile, and the firm, warm clasp of his hand—</p>
<p>For an instant there rose up in her one of those wild, rebellious outcries against fate, when
     to have to waste years of this brief life of ours, in the sort of semi-existence that living
     is, apart from the treasure of the heart and delight of the eyes, seems so cruelly, cruelly
     hard!</p>
<p>"Miss Hilary."</p>
<p>She started, and "put herself under lock and key" immediately. "Miss Hilary; you do look so
     tired!" </p>
<p>"Do I? Then we will go and sit down in this baker's shop, and get rested and fed. We cannot
     afford to wear ourselves out, you know. We have a great deal to do to-day."</p>
<p>More indeed, than she calculated, for they walked up one street and down another,
     investigating at least twenty lodgings before any appeared which seemed fit for them. Yet some
     place must be found where Johanna's poor, tired head could rest that night. At last, completely
     exhausted, with that oppressive exhaustion which seems to crush mind as well as body after a
     day's wandering in London. Hilary's courage began to ebb. Oh for an arm to lean on, a voice to
     listen for, a brave heart to come to her side, saying, "Do not be afraid, there are two of us!"
     And she yearned, with an absolutely sick yearning such as only a woman who now and then feels
     the utter helplessness of her womanhood can know, for the only arm she cared to lean on, the
     only voice dear enough to bring her comfort, the only heart that she felt she could trust.</p>
<p>Poor Hilary! And yet why pity her? To her three alternatives could but happen: were Robert
     Lyon true to her she would be his entirely and devotedly, to the end of her days; did he
     forsake her, she would forgive him should he die, she would be faithful to him eternally. Love
     of this kind may know anguish, but not the sort of anguish that lesser and weaker loves do. If
     it is certain of nothing else, it can always be certain of itself.</p>
<p>    "Its will is strong;     'It suffers; but it can not suffer long." </p>
<p>And even in its utmost pangs is an underlying peace which often approaches to absolute
     joy.</p>
<p>Hilary roused herself, and bent her mind steadily on lodgings till she discovered one from
     the parlor of which you could see the trees of Burton Crescent and hear the sound of Saint
     Pancras's clock.</p>
<p>"I think we may do here—at least for a while," said she cheerfully; and then Elizabeth heard
     her inquiring if an extra bedroom could be had if necessary.</p>
<p>There was only one small attic. "Ascott never could put up with that," said Hilary, half to
     herself. Then suddenly—"I think I will see Ascott before I decide. Elizabeth, will you go with
     me, or remain here?"</p>
<p>"I'll go with you, if you please, Miss Hilary."</p>
<p>"If you please," sounded not unlike, "if I please," and Elizabeth had gloomed over a little.
     "Is Mr. Ascott to live with us?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so."</p>
<p>No more words were interchanged till they reached Gower street, when Miss Hilary observed,
     with evident surprise, what a handsome street it was.</p>
<p>"I must have made some mistake. Still we will find out Mr. Ascott's number, and inquire."</p>
<p>No, there was no mistake. Mr. Ascott Leaf had lodged there for three months, but had given up
     his rooms that very morning.</p>
<p>"Where had he gone to?"</p>
<p>The servant—a London lodging house servant all over—didn't know; but she fetched the
     landlady, who was after the same pattern of the dozen London landladies with whom Hilary had
     that day made acquaintance, only a little more Cockney, smirking, dirty, and tawdrily fine.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Leaf had gone, and he hadn't left no address. Young College gentlemen often found
     it convenient to leave no address. P'raps he would if he'd known there would be a young lady a
     calling to see him."</p>
<p>"I am Mr. Leaf's aunt," said Hilary, turning as hot as fire.</p>
<p>"Oh, in-deed," was the answer, with civil incredulousness.</p>
<p>But the woman was sharp of perception—as often-cheated London landladies learn to be. After
     looking keenly at mistress and maid, she changed her tone; nay, even launched out into praises
     of her late lodger: what a pleasant gentleman he was; what good company he kept, and how he had
     promised to recommend her apartments to his friends.</p>
<p>"And as for the little some'at of rent, Miss—tell him it makes no matter, he can pay me when
     he likes. If he don't call soon p'raps I might make bold to send his trunk and his books over
     to Mr. Ascott's of—dear me, I forget the number and the square."</p>
<p>Hilary unsuspiciously supplied both.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it—the old gen'leman as Mr. Leaf went to dine with every other Sunday, a very
     rich old gentleman, who, he says, is to leave him all his money. Maybe a relation of yours,
     Miss?"</p>
<p>"No," said Hilary; and adding something about the landlady's hearing from Mr. Leaf very soon,
     she hurried out of the house, Elizabeth following.</p>
<p>"Won't you be tired if you walk so fast, Miss Hilary?"</p>
<p>Hilary stopped, choking. Helplessly she looked up and down the forlorn, wide, glaring, dusty
     street; now sinking into the dull shadow of a London afternoon.</p>
<p>"Let us go home!" And at the word a sob burst out—just one passionate pent up sob. No more.
     She could not afford to waste strength in crying.</p>
<p>"As you say, Elizabeth, I am getting tired, and that will not do. Let me see; something must
     be decided." And she stood still, passing her hand over her hot brow and eyes. "I will go back
     and take the lodgings, leave you there to make all comfortable, and then fetch my sisters from
     the hotel. But stay first, I have forgotten something."</p>
<p>She returned to the house in Gower Street, and wrote on one of her cards an address—the only
     permanent address she could think of—that of the city broker who was in the habit of paying
     them their yearly income of Ł50.</p>
<p>"If any creditors inquire for Mr. Leaf, give them this. His friends may always hear of him at
     the London University."</p>
<p>"Thank you, ma'am," replied the now civil landlady. "Indeed, I wasn't afraid of the young
     gentleman giving us the slip. For though he was careless in his bills he was every inch the
     gentleman. And I wouldn't object to take him in again. Or p'raps you yourself, ma'am, might be
     a-wanting rooms."</p>
<p>"No, I thank you. Good morning." And Hilary hurried away.</p>
<p>Not a word did she say to Elizabeth, or Elizabeth to her, till they got into the dull, dingy
     parlor—henceforth, to be their sole apology for "home:" and then she only talked about domestic
     arrangements—talked fast and eagerly, and tried to escape the affectionate eyes which she knew
     were so sharp and keen. Only to escape them—not to blind them; she had long ago found out that
     Elizabeth was too quick-witted for that, especially in any thing that concerned "the family."
     She felt convinced the girl had heard every syllable that passed at Ascott's lodgings: that she
     knew all that was to be known, and guessed what was to be feared as well as Hilary herself.</p>
<p>"Elizabeth"—she hesitated long, and doubted whether she should say the thing before she did
     say it—"remember we are all strangers in London, and family matters are best kept within the
     family. Do not mention either in writing home, or to any body here, about—about—"</p>
<p>She could not name Ascott; she felt so horribly ashamed.</p>
