<t:head>CHAPTER X</t:head>
<t:p>THEY got to the wounded captain and raised him: he revived a little; and, the moment he
     caught sight of Mr. Sharpe, he clutched him, and cried, “Stunsels!”</t:p>
<t:p>“Oh, captain,” said Sharpe, “let the ship go; it is you we are anxious for now.”</t:p>
<t:p>At this Dodd lifted up his hands and beat the air impatiently, and cried again in the thin,
     querulous voice of' a wounded man, but eagerly, “STUNSELS! STUNSELS!”</t:p>
<t:p>On this, Sharpe gave the command.</t:p>
<t:p>“Make sail. All hands set stunsels 'low and aloft!”</t:p>
<t:p>While the unwounded hands swarmed into the rigging, the surgeon came aft in all haste; but
     Dodd declined him till all his men should have been looked to: meantime he had himself carried
     to the poop and laid on a mattress, his bleeding head bound tight with a wet cambric
     handkerchief, and his pale face turned towards the hostile schooner astern. She had to hove to,
     and was picking up the survivors of her blotted-out consort. The group on the <t:hi>Agra's</t:hi>
     quarter-deck watched her to see what she would do next; flushed with immediate success, the
     younger officers crowed their fears she would not be game to attack them again. Dodd's fears
     ran the other way: he said, in the weak voice to which he was now reduced, “They are taking a
     wet blanket aboard; that crew of blackguards we swamped won't want any more of us: it all
     depends on the pirate captain: if he is not drowned, then blow wind, rise sea, or there's
     trouble ahead for us.”</t:p>
<t:p>As soon as the schooner had picked up the last swimmer, she hoisted foresail, mainsail, and
     jib with admirable rapidity, and bore down in chase.</t:p>
<t:p>The <t:hi>Agra</t:hi> had, meantime, got a start of more than a mile, and was now running before
     a stiff breeze with studding sails alow and aloft.</t:p>
<t:p>In an hour the vessels ran nearly twelve miles, and the pirate had gained half a mile.</t:p>
<t:p>At the end of the next hour they were out of sight of land, wind and sea rising, and the
     pirate only a quarter of a mile astern.</t:p>
<t:p>The schooner was now rising and falling on the waves; the ship only nodding, and firm as a
     rock.</t:p>
<t:p>“Blow wind, rise sea!” faltered Dodd.</t:p>
<t:p>Another half-hour passed without perceptibly altering the position of the vessels. Then
     suddenly the wounded captain laid aside his glass, after a long examination, and rose unaided
     to his feet in great excitement, and found his manly voice for a moment: he shook his fist at
     the now pitching schooner and roared, “Good-bye! ye Portuguese
     lubber—outfought—outmanoeuvred—AND OUTSAILED!”</t:p>
<t:p>It was a burst of exultation rare for him; he paid for it by sinking faint and helpless into
     his friend's arms; and the surgeon, returning soon after, insisted on his being taken to his
     cabin and kept quite quiet.</t:p>
<t:p>As they were carrying him below, the pirate captain made the same discovery, that the ship
     was gaining on him: he hauled to the wind directly and abandoned the chase.</t:p>
<t:p>When the now receding pirate was nearly hull down, the sun began to set. Mr. Tickell looked
     at him and said, “Hallo! old fellow, what are <t:hi>you</t:hi> about? Why, it isn't two
     o'clock.”</t:p>
<t:p>The remark was quite honest: he really feared, for a moment, that orb was mistaken and would
     get himself—and others—into trouble. However, the middy proved to be wrong, and the sun right
     to a minute: Time flies fast fighting.</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Beresford came on deck with brat and poodle: Fred, a destructive child, clapped his
     hands with glee at the holes in the canvas: Snap toddled about smelling the blood of the slain,
     and wagging his tail by halves, perplexed. “Well, gentlemen,” said Mrs. Beresford, “I hope you
     have made noise enough over one's head: and what a time you did take to beat that little bit of
     a thing. Freddy, be quiet; you worry me; where is your bearer? Will anybody oblige me by
     finding Ramgolam?”</t:p>
<t:p>“I will,” said Mr. Tickell hastily, and ran off for the purpose; but he returned after some
     time with a long face. No Ramgolam to be found.</t:p>
<t:p>Fullalove referred her—with humour-twinkling eye—to Vespasian. “I have a friend here who says
     he can tell you something about him.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Can you, my good man?” inquired the lady, turning haughtily towards the negro.</t:p>
<t:p>“Iss, Missy,” said Vespasian, showing his white teeth in a broad grin, “dis child knows where
     to find dat ar niggar, widout him been and absquatulated since.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Then go and fetch him directly.”</t:p>
<t:p>Vespasian went off with an obedient start.</t:p>
<t:p>This annoyed Fullalove; interfered with his system: “Madam,” said he gravely, “would you
     oblige me by bestowing on my friend a portion of that courtesy with which you favour me, and
     which becomes you so gracefully?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Certainly not,” replied Mrs. Beresford. “Mr. Fullalove, I am out of patience with you: the
     idea of a sensible intelligent gentleman like you calling that creature your friend! And you an
     American, where they do nothing but whip them from morning till night. Who ever heard of making
     friends with a black?—Now what is the meaning of this? I detest practical jokes.” For the
     stalwart negro had returned, bringing a tall bread-bag in his arms: he now set it up before
     her, remarking, “Dis yar bag white outside, but him 'nation black inside.” To confirm his
     words, he drew off the bag, and revealed Ramgolam, his black skin powdered with meal. The
     good-natured negro then blew the flour off his face, and dusted him a bit: the spectators
     laughed heartily, but Ramgolam never moved a muscle: not a morsel discomposed at what would
     have made an European miserably ashamed, even in a pantomime—the Caucasian darkie retained all
     his dignity while the African one dusted him; but, being dusted, he put on his obsequiousness,
     stepped forward, joined his palms together to Mrs. Beresford—like medieval knights and modern
     children at their devotions—and addressed her thus:—</t:p>
<t:p>“Daughter of light, he who basks in your beams said to himself, 'The pirates are upon us,
     those children of blood, whom Sheitan their master blast for ever! They will ravish the Queen
     of Sunshine and the ayahs, and throw the sahibs and sailors into the sea; but, bread being the
     staff of existence, these foxes of the water will not harm it, but keep it for their lawless
     appetites; therefore Ramgolam, son of Chittroo, son of Soonarayan, will put the finger of
     silence on the lip of discretion, and be bread in the day of adversity: the sons of Sheitan
     will peradventure return to dry land and close the eye of watchfulness; then will I emerge like
     the sun from a cloud, and depart in peace.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Oh, very well,” said Mrs. Beresford; “then you are an abominable egotist, that is all, and a
     coward: and thank Heaven Freddy and I were defended by English and Americans, and—hem!—their
     friends, and not by Hindoos.” She added charmingly, “This shows me my first words on coming
     here ought to have been to offer my warmest thanks to the brave men who have defended me and my
     child;” and swept them so queenly a curtesy, that the men's hats and caps flew off in an
     instant “Mr. Black,” said she, turning with a voice of honey to Vespasian, but aiming obliquely
     at Fullalove's heart, <t:hi>“would</t:hi> you oblige me by kicking that dog a <t:hi>little:</t:hi> he
     is always smelling what does not belong to him—why, it is blood; oh!” and she turned pale in a
     moment.</t:p>
<t:p>Sharpe thought some excuse necessary. “You see, ma'am, we haven't had time to clean the decks
     since.”</t:p>
<t:p>“It is the blood of men—of the poor fellows who have defended us so nobly,” faltered the
     lady, trembling visibly.</t:p>
<t:p>“Well, ma'am,” said Sharpe, still half apologetically, “you know a ship can't fight all day
     long without an accident or two.” He added, with nautical simplicity and love of cleanliness,
     “However, the deck will be cleaned and holy-stoned to-morrow, long before you turn out.”</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Beresford was too much overcome to explain how much deeper her emotion was than a
     dislike to stained floors. She turned faint, and on getting the better of that, went down to
     her cabin crying. Thence issued a royal order that the wounded were to have wine and every
     luxury they could fancy, without limit or stint—at her expense.</t:p>
<t:p>The next day a deep gloom reigned in the ship; the crew were ranged in their Sunday clothes
     and bare-headed; a grating was rigged; Sharpe read the burial service; and the dead, each man
     sewed up in his hammock with a 32-lb. shot, glided off the grating into the sea with a sullen
     plunge; while their shipmates cried so that the tears dripped on the deck.</t:p>
<t:p>With these regrets for the slain, too violent to last, was mingled a gloomy fear that Death
     had a heavier blow in store. The surgeon's report of Captain Dodd was most alarming; he had
     become delirious about midnight, and so continued.</t:p>
<t:p>Sharpe commanded the ship; and the rough sailors stepped like cats over that part of the deck
     beneath which their unconscious captain lay. If two men met on the quarter-deck, a look of
     anxious, but not hopeful, inquiry was sure to pass between them.</t:p>
<t:p>Among the constant inquirers was Ramgolam. The grave Hindoo often waylaid the surgeon at the
     captain's door, to get the first intelligence This marked sympathy with a hero in extremity was
     hardly expected from a sage who at the first note of war's trumpet had vanished in a meal-bag.
     However, it went down to his credit. One person, however, took a dark view of this innocent
     circumstance But then that hostile critic was Vespasian, a rival in matters of tint. He
     exploded in one of those droll rages darkies seem liable to: “Massa cunnel,” said he, “what for
     dat yar niggar always prowling about the capn's door? What for he ask so many stupid questions?
     Dat ole fox arter no good: him heart so black as um skin: dam ole niggar!”</t:p>
<t:p>Fullalove suggested slily that a person with a dark skin might have a grateful heart: and the
     colonel, who dealt little in innuendo, said, “Come, don't you be so hard on jet, you
     ebony!”</t:p>
<t:p>“Bery well, gemmen,” replied Vespasian ceremoniously, and with seeming acquiescence. Then,
     with sudden ire, “Because Goramighty made you white, you tink you bery wise without any more
     trouble. Dat ar niggar am an abominable egotisk.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Pray what does that mean?” inquired Kenealy innocently.</t:p>
<t:p>“What him mean? what him mean? Yah! yah!”</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes. What does it mean?”</t:p>
<t:p>“What him mean? Yah! What didn't you hear Missy Besford miscall him an abominable
     egotisk?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes,” said Fullalove, winking to Kenealy; “but we don't know what it means. Do you,
     sir?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Iss, sar. Dat ar expression he signify a darned old cuss dat says to dis child, 'My lord
     Vespasium, take benevolence on your insidious slave, and invest me in a bread-bag,' instead of
     fighting for de ladies like a freenindependum citizen. Now you two go fast asleep; dis child
     lie shut one eye and open de oder bery wide open on dat ar niggar.” And with this mysterious
     threat he stalked away.</t:p>
<t:p>His contempt for a black skin, his ebullitions of unexpected ire, his turgid pomposity, and
     love of long terms, may make the reader smile; but they could hardly amuse his friends just
     then; everything that touched upon Dodd was too serious now. The surgeon sat up with him nearly
     all night: in the daytime those two friends sat for hours in his cabin, watching sadly, and
     silently moistening his burning brow and his parched lips.</t:p>
<t:p>At length, one afternoon, there came a crisis, which took an unfavourable turn. Then the
     surgeon, speaking confidentially to these two staunch friends, inquired if they had asked
     themselves what should be done with the body? “Why I ask,” said he, “is because we are in a
     very hot latitude; and if you wish to convey it to Barkington, the measures ought to be taken
     in time: in fact, within an hour or two after death.”</t:p>
<t:p>The poor friends were shocked and sickened by this horrible piece of foresight. But Colonel
     Kenealy said, with tears, in his eyes, that his old friend should never be buried like a
     kitten.</t:p>
<t:p>“Then you had better ask Sharpe to give me an order for a barrel of spirits,” said the
     surgeon.</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes, yes, for two if you like. Oh, don't die, Dodd, my poor old fellow. How shall I ever
     face his wife—I remember her, the loveliest girl you ever saw—with such a tale as this? She
     will think it a cruel thing I should come out of it without a scratch, and a ten times better
     man to be dead: and so it is; it is cruel, it is unjust, it is monstrous; him to be lying
     there, and we muffs to be sitting croaking over him and watching for his last breath like three
     cursed old ravens.” And the stout colonel groaned aloud.</t:p>
<t:p>When the surgeon left them, they fell naturally upon another topic, the pledge they had given
     Dodd about the 14,000l.. They ascertained it was upon him, next his skin; but it seemed as
     unnecessary as it was repugnant to remove it from his living person. They agreed, however, that
     instantly on his decease they would take possession of it, note the particulars, seal it up,
     and carry it to Mrs. Dodd, with such comfort as they could hope to give her by relating the
     gallant act in which his precious life was lost.</t:p>
<t:p>At 9 P.M. the surgeon took his place by Dodd's bedside; and the pair, whom one thing after
     another had drawn so close together, retired to Kenealy's cabin.</t:p>
<t:p>Many a merry chat they had had there, and many a gaseonade, being rival hunters; but now they
     were together for physical companionship in sorrow rather than for conversation. They smoked
     their cigars in moody silence, and at midnight shook hands with a sigh and parted. That sigh
     meant to say that in the morning all would be over.</t:p>
<t:p>They turned in; but, ere either of them was asleep, suddenly the captain's cabin seemed to
     fill with roars and shrieks of wild beasts, that made the whole ship ring in the silent night
     The savage cries were answered on deck by shouts of dismay and many pattering feet making for
     the companion ladder; but the nearest persons to the cabin, and the first to reach it, were
     Kenealy and Fullalove, who burst in, the former with a drawn sword, the latter with a revolver,
     both in their nightgowns; and there saw a sight that took their breath away.</t:p>
<t:p>The surgeon was not there; and two black men, one with a knife, and one with his bare claws,
     were fighting and struggling and trampling all over the cabin at once, and the dying man
     sitting up in his cot, pale, and glaring at them.</t:p>
