<t:head>CHAPTER XXII</t:head>
<t:p>To return to the bank. Skinner came back from the Dodds' that miserable afternoon in a state
     of genuine agitation and regret. He was human, and therefore mixed, and their desolation had
     shocked him.</t:p>
<t:p>The footman told him Mr. Hardie was not at home; gone to London, he believed. Skinner walked
     away dejected. What did this mean? Had he left the country?</t:p>
<t:p>He smiled at his fears, and felt positive Mr. Hardie had misled the servants, and was quietly
     waiting for him in the bank parlour.</t:p>
<t:p>It was now dusk: he went round to that little dark nook of the garden the parlour window
     opened on, and tapped: there was no reply; the room looked empty. He tried the sash: it
     yielded. Mr. Hardie had been too occupied with embezzling another's property to take common
     precautions in defence of his own; never in his life before had he neglected to fasten the iron
     shutters with his own hand, and to-day he had left the very window unfastened. This augured
     ill. “He is off: he has done me along with the rest,” thought Skinner. He stepped into the
     room, found a lucifer-box, shut the shutters, lighted a candle, and went peering about amongst
     the banker's papers, to see if he could find a clue to his intentions; and, as he pottered and
     peered, he quaked as well: a detector by dishonest means feels thief-like, and is what he
     feels. He made some little discoveries that guided him in his own conduct; he felt more and
     more sure his employer would outwit him if he could, and resolved it should be diamond cut
     diamond.</t:p>
<t:p>The church clock struck one.</t:p>
<t:p>He started at the hour, crept out and closed the window softly, then away by the garden
     gate.</t:p>
<t:p>A light was still burning in Alfred's room, and at this Skinner had another touch of
     compunction. “There is one won't sleep this night along of our work,” thought he.</t:p>
<t:p>At three next afternoon Mr. Hardie reappeared.</t:p>
<t:p>He had gone up to town to change the form of the deposit:—He took care to think of it as a
     deposit still, the act of deposit having been complete, the withdrawal incomplete, and by no
     fault of his, for he had offered it back; but Fate and Accident had interposed. He had
     converted the notes into gold direct, and the bills into gold through notes; this was like
     going into the river to hide his trail. Next process: he turned his gold into 500l. notes, and
     came flying home with them.</t:p>
<t:p>His return was greeted by Skinner with a sigh of relief. Hardie heard it, interpreted it
     aright, and sent for him into the parlour, and there told him with a great affectation of
     frankness what he had done, then asked significantly if there was any news at Albion Villa.</t:p>
<t:p>Skinnier in reply told Mr. Hardie of the distress he had witnessed up at Albion Villa: “And,
     sir,” said he, lowering his voice, “Mr. Alfred helped carry the body upstairs. It is a nice
     mess altogether, sir, when you come to think.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Ah! all the better,” was the cool reply: “he will be useful to let us know what we want; he
     will tell Jane, and Jane me. You don't think he will live, do you?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Live! no: and then who will know the money is here?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Who should know? Did not he say he had just landed, and been shipwrecked? Shipwrecked men do
     not bring fourteen thousand pounds ashore.” The speaker's eyes sparkled: Skinner watched him
     demurely. “Skinner,” said he solemnly, “I believe my daughter Jane is right, and that
     Providence really interferes sometimes in the affairs of this world. You know how I have
     struggled to save my family from disgrace and poverty: those struggles have failed in a great
     degree: but Heaven has seen them, and saved this money from the sea, and dropped it into my
     very hands to retrieve my fortunes with. I must be grateful: spend a portion of it in charity,
     and rear a noble fortune on the rest. Confound it all!”</t:p>
<t:p>And his crestfallen countenance showed some ugly misgiving had flashed on him quite
     suddenly.</t:p>
<t:p>“What sir? what?” asked Skinner eagerly.</t:p>
<t:p>“The receipt!”</t:p>
