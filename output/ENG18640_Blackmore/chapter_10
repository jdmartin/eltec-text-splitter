<p>Thus was I, and, what mattered much more, my mother, reduced quite
                            suddenly from a position of rank and luxury, and a prospective income of
                            £15,000 a-year (so much had the land increased in value) to a revenue of
                            nothing, and no home. Even to me it was a heavy blow, but what could my
                            poor mother do?</p>
<p>We were assured by counsel that a legal struggle could end in expense
                            alone, and advised by the family lawyers to throw ourselves on the good
                            feeling and appeal to the honour of Mr. Edgar Vaughan. Mr. Vaughan he
                            must henceforth be called. I cannot well understand, still less can I
                            explain, small and threadbare technicalities (motes, which too often are
                            the beam of Justice), but the circumstances which robbed me of my
                            father's home were somewhat as follows:—</p>
<p>By the will of my father's grandfather, Hubert Vaughan, who died in the
                            year 1782, the whole of the family property was devised to his son,
                            Vaughan Powis Vaughan, for life, and after his decease, to his sons
                            successively <hi rend="italic">in tail male</hi>, failing these to his
                            right heirs in general. This will was said to have been prepared in
                            haste: it was, in fact, drawn by a country attorney, when the testator
                            was rapidly sinking. It was very brief, and by no means accurately
                            worded; neither did it contain those powers to meet family exigencies,
                            which I am told a proper practitioner would have inserted.</p>
<p>There was no reason to suppose that the testator had contemplated
                            anything more than a strict settlement of the usual kind, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> a common estate entail, expectant upon a
                            life-interest; and under which I should have succeeded my father, as his
                            heiress, in the ordinary course. But it is the chief fault of smatterers
                            in the law (and country attorneys at that time were no better) that they
                            will attempt to be too definite. The country lawyer in this case,
                            grossly ignorant of his profession, and caught by the jangle of the
                            words <hi rend="italic">tail male</hi>, had inserted them at hazard,
                            possibly not without some idea that they would insure a stricter
                            succession than a common entail would do.</p>
<p>When my father became of age, measures were taken for barring the entail
                            created by the will of Hubert Vaughan; and at the time it was believed
                            that these were quite effectual, and therefore that my father was now
                            entitled in fee-simple, and could dispose of the property.</p>
<p>Upon his marriage with my mother, she, with worthy pride, refused most
                            firmly to accept a jointure charged on his estates, alleging that as she
                            brought no fortune into the family, she would not incumber the family
                            property, which had but recently been relieved of incumbrances. More
                            than this—she had even insisted upon expressly abandoning, by her
                            marriage settlement, all claim to dower. This unusual course she had
                            adopted, because of some discontent expressed by relatives of my father
                            at his marriage with a portionless bride, whereby her self-respect had
                            been deeply wounded. So nothing was settled upon her, except her own
                            little estate in Devonshire, which was secured to her separate use.</p>
<p>My father had never permitted this excess of generosity on her part, but
                            that he was by nature careless upon such subjects, and hoped to provide
                            amply for her interests by his will: moreover he was hot to remove all
                            obstacles to their marriage. But it was now discovered that he had no
                            power to charge the real estate for her benefit, in the manner his will
                            imported; that he had never been more than a tenant in tail, and that
                            entail such that I could not inherit. Neither, of course, could I take
                            under his will, as he possessed no power of disposition. One quarter of
                            all that has been written upon the subject I never could understand; and
                            even as to the simplest points, sometimes I seem to apprehend them
                            clearly, and then I feel that I do not. My account of the matter is
                            compressed from what I remember of the legal opinions.</p>
<p>The leading fact, at any rate, and the key to all the mischief, was, that
                            the entail had never been barred at all: the legal process (called a
                            "recovery") which was to have had that effect, being null and void
                            through some absurd informality. They told me something about a tenant
                            to a precipice, but they must have made a mistake, for there was no
                            precipice on the estate, unless some cliffs near the church could be
                            called so, and they were never let.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, my father's will was declared to be waste paper,
                            except as regarded what they called the personalty, or, in good English,
                            the money he had to bequeath. And of this there was very little, for,
                            shortly before his death, he had spent large sums in drainage,
                            farm-buildings, and other improvements. Furthermore, he had always
                            maintained a profuse hospitality, and his charity was most lavish. The
                            lawyers told us that, under the circumstances (a favourite expression of
                            theirs when they mean some big robbery), a court of equity would perhaps
                            consider our application to be "recupped," as they called it, out of the
                            estate, for the money laid out in improvements under a false impression.
                            But we had been cupped enough already. Grossly plundered by legal
                            jargon, robbed by statute, and scourged by scriveners' traditions, we
                            flung away in disgust the lint the bandits offered, and left them "all
                            estate, right, title, interest, and claim, whether at law or in equity,
                            in to or out of" the licking of our blood.</p>
<p>But now my long suspicions, and never-discarded conviction of my
                            guardian's guilt, were, by summary process, not only revived, but
                            redoubled. This arose partly from the discovery of the stake he had on
                            my father's life, and partly, perhaps, from a feeling of hatred towards
                            our supplanter. That he knew not till now the flaw in our title, and his
                            own superior claim, was more than I could believe. I felt sure that he
                            had gained this knowledge while in needy circumstances and sharp legal
                            practice, brought, as he then most probably was, into frequent contact
                            with the London agents who had the custody of the documents.</p>
<p>To be in the same room with him, was now more than I could bear, and it
                            became impossible that we should live any longer in the same house. He,
                            indeed, wished, or feigned to wish, that we should remain there, and
                            even showed some reluctance to urge his unrighteous rights. But neither
                            my mother (who bore the shock with strange resignation) nor myself would
                            hear of any compromise, or take a farthing at his hands, and he was too
                            proud and stern to press upon us his compunctions.</p>
<p>Statements of our case had been prepared and submitted to three most
                            eminent conveyancers, and the three opinions had been found to agree,
                            except upon some trivial points. More than two months had been thus
                            consumed, and it was now once more the anniversary of my father's death.
                            I had spent the time in narrowly watching my ex-guardian's conduct,
                            though keeping aloof, as much as possible, from any intercourse with
                            him.</p>
<p>One night, I stole into the room which he called his study, and where
                            (with a child's simplicity) I believed him to keep his private
                            documents. Through Thomas Kenwood, to whom I now confided almost
                            everything, and whose suspicions were even stronger than mine, I
                            obtained clandestine possession of the keys of the large bureau. As I
                            stood before that massive repository in the dead of night, the struggle
                            within me was intense and long. What letters, what journals, documents,
                            or momentous relics of a thousand kinds, might be lurking here, waiting
                            only for a daughter's hand to turn the lock, and cast the light she bore
                            on the death-warrant of her father! How easy then to snatch away the
                            proof, clutching it, though it should burn the hand or bosom, to wave
                            it, with a triumph wilfully prolonged, before the eyes of justice's
                            dull-visioned ministers; and then to see, without a shudder or a thrill
                            of joy, but with the whole soul gazing, the slow, struggling, ghastly
                            expiation. As this thought came crawling through my heart, lighting up
                            its depth as would a snake of fire, the buhl before me grew streaks of
                            blood, and the heavy crossbars a gallows. I lifted my hand to open the
                            outer lock. Already the old cruciform key was trembling in the silver
                            scutcheon. I raised the lamp in my left hand to show the lunette guard
                            which curved above the hole, when a heavy mass all cold and dark fell
                            across my eyes. I started, and thought for the moment, in my strong
                            excitement, that it was my father's hand. One instant more, and, through
                            the trembling of my senses, I saw that it was only a thick fold of my
                            long black hair, shaken down on the face by my bending and quivering
                            posture. But the check was enough. A Vaughan, and that the last one of
                            so proud and frank a race, to be prowling meanly, with a stolen tool, to
                            violate confidence, and pry through letters! No suspicion, however
                            strong, nothing short of certainty (if even that) could warrant it.
                            Driven away by shame combined with superstition, I glided from the cold
                            silent room, and restored the keys to my faithful friend, whom I had
                            left in the passage, ordering him at once to replace them, and never
                            touch them again.</p>
<p>"Well, miss," he whispered, with a smile, "I knew you couldn't do it,
                            because I seemed, somehow, it wasn't like a Vaughan."</p>
<p>We were already preparing to quit the house, no longer ours, when our
                            dismissal became abrupt, through another act of mine. What drove me to
                            such a wild deed I can scarcely tell. Shame, perhaps, for the furtive
                            nature of my last attempt hurried me into the other extreme; and now I
                            was so shaken by conflicting impulse, that nothing was too mad for
                            me.</p>
<p>On the seventh anniversary of my father's death, and the last which I was
                            likely ever to spend beneath that roof, I passed the whole day in
                            alternate sadness and passion, in the bedroom where he died. All the
                            relics I possessed, both of his love and of his death, I brought
                            thither; and spread them out, and wept upon the one, and prayed upon the
                            other. I also brought my choicest histories of murder and revenge, and
                            pored over them by the waning daylight and the dull lamp, and so on
                            through the night, until my mind became the soul's jetsam.</p>
<p>Then I procured four very large wax candles, and lit them at the head of
                            the bed, two on each side, and spread a long white cloth between, as if
                            my father were lying in state; and hung a row of shorter lights above,
                            to illuminate the letters of blood. Then I took a small alarum clock,
                            given me by dear father, that I might rise for early walks with him, and
                            set it upon a chest by the door, and fixed it so as to ring five minutes
                            before the hour at which the murder befell. A cold presentiment crawled
                            through me that, at the fatal time, I should see the assassin. After all
                            these arrangements I took my volume again, and sat in the shade of the
                            curtain, with a strong light on the page. I was deep in some horrible
                            record, and creeping with terror and hope, when the clear bell rang a
                            long and startling peal. I leaped up, like one shot through the heart,
                            and what I did was without design or purpose. My glance fell on the
                            dagger; I caught it up, and snatched the lamp, and hurried down corridor
                            and staircase, straight to my guardian's private room.</p>
<p>He was sitting at the table, for he never passed that night in bed. At
                            the sound of the lock he leaped up, and pointed a pistol, then hid it.
                            Straight up to him I went, as swiftly and quietly as a spirit, and
                            spoke:</p>
<p>"Seven years ago, at this very moment, my father was killed. Do you know
                            this dagger?" He started back, as if I had stabbed him with it, then
                            covered his eyes with both hands.</p>
<p>"You know it, then?" I said, with a triumph chill all over me. "It was
                            your hand that used it."</p>
<p>Another moment, and I should have struck him with it. I lifted it in my
                            frenzy; when he looked at me by some wonderful effort, calmly, steadily,
                            even coldly. "Yes," he said, "I have seen that weapon before. Alas my
                            poor dear brother!"</p>
<p>Whether it was true feeling that made his voice so low and deep, or only
                            fierce self-control, I knew not then, nor tried to think.</p>
<p>"You know who owned it?" I asked, with my life upon his answer.</p>
<p>"Yes. I know who owned it once; but many years ago. And I know not in the
                            least what is become of him now."</p>
<p>The baffled fury and prostrate hope—for at the moment I fully believed
                            him—were too much for my reeling brain and fasting body. For one
                            minute's command of my faculties, I would have sold them for ever; but I
                            felt them ebbing from me, as the life does from a wound. The hemispheres
                            of my brain were parting one from the other, and a grey void spreading
                            between them. I tried to think, but could not. I strove to say <hi rend="italic">anything</hi>, but failed. Fainter and fainter grew
                            the room, the lamp, the ceiling, the face at which I tried to look.
                            Things went to and fro with a quicker quiver, like flame in the wind,
                            then, round and round like whirling water; my mouth grew stiff, and the
                            tongue between my teeth felt like a glove; and with a rush of sound in
                            my brain and throat, and a scream pent up, yet bursting, I fell, as I
                            thought, through the earth. I was only on the floor, in a fit.</p>
<p>When I came to myself, I was in my own bed, and my own dear mother
                            bending over me, pale, and haggard, and full of tears. The broad
                            daylight was around us, and the faint sunshine on her face. She had been
                            with me ever since. In my weakness, I looked up at her with a pang of
                            self-reproach, to think how little I had valued her love; and I vowed to
                            myself to make up for it by future care and devotion.</p>
<p>That violent convulsion, and the illness after it, changed me not a
                            little both in mind and body.</p>
