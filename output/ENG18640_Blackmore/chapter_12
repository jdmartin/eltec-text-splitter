<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p>No need to recount my bitter farewell to all the scenes and objects I had
                            loved so long, to all which possessed a dark yet tender interest, and
                            most of all to my father's grave. That some attention might still be
                            paid to this, I entrusted it to the care of an old housekeeper of ours,
                            who was living in the village. My last visit was in the moonlight, and
                            dear mother was there. I carried rather than led her away. Slight as my
                            knowledge has been of lightsome and happy love, I am sure that a sombre
                            affection is far the stronger and sweeter.</p>
<p>As we began our journey, a crowd of the villagers met us beyond the
                            lodge, and lined the Gloucester road as far as the old oak-tree. While
                            our hired conveyance passed between them, the men stood mute with their
                            hats in their hands, the women sobbed and curtseyed, and blessed us, and
                            held up their children to look at us.</p>
<p>Our refuge was the small estate or farm in Devonshire, which I have
                            mentioned as my mother's property. This, which produced £45 a-year, was
                            all that now remained to us, except a sum of £1,000 left to me by a
                            godfather, and of which I could not touch the principal. The residue of
                            the personalty, and the balance at the banker's, we had refused to take,
                            being assured that legally we were responsible to Mr. Vaughan, even for
                            the back rents of the Gloucestershire estate. Of course we had plenty of
                            jewellery, some of it rather valuable, but the part most precious was
                            heirloom, and that we had left behind. Most of our own had been my
                            father's gift, and therefore we could not bear to sell it.</p>
<p>As regarded myself, this comparative poverty was not of very great
                            moment, except as impairing my means of search; but for my mother's sake
                            I was cut to the heart, and lost in perplexity. She had so long been
                            accustomed to much attention and many luxuries, which her weak health
                            had made indispensable to her. Thomas Henwood and poor Ann Maples
                            insisted on following our fortunes, at one third of their previous
                            wages. My mother thought it beyond our means to keep them even so; but
                            for her sake I resolved to try. I need not say that I carried all my
                            relics, difficult as it was to hide them from my mother.</p>
<p>When we reached our new home, late in the evening of the second day, a
                            full sense of our privation for the first time broke upon us. It was
                            mid-winter, and in the gloom of a foggy night, and after the weariness
                            of a long journey, our impressions were truly dismal. Jolted endlessly
                            up and down by ruts a foot deep and slaty stones the size of
                            coal-scuttles, entombed alive betwixt grisly hedges which met above us
                            like the wings of night, then obliged to walk up treadmill hills while
                            the rickety fly crawled up behind; then again plunging and lurching down
                            some corkscrew steep to the perpetual wood and rushing stream at the
                            bottom; at length and at last along a lane so narrow that it scraped us
                            on both sides as we passed, a lane which zig-zagged every thirty yards
                            with a tree-bole jutting at every corner, at length and at last we came
                            to the farmyard gate. It was not far from the lonely village of
                            Trentisoe, which lies some six miles to the west of Lynmouth. This part
                            is little known to London tourists, though it possesses scenery of a
                            rarer kind than Lynmouth itself can show.</p>
<p>Passing through an outer court, with a saw-pit on one side and what they
                            call a "linhay" on the other, and where a slop of straw and "muck"
                            quelched under the wheels, we came next to the farmyard proper, and so
                            (as the flyman expressed it) "home to ouze." The "ouze" was a low
                            straggling cottage, jag-thatched, and heavy-eaved, and reminded me
                            strongly of ragged wet horse-cloths on a rack. The farmer was not come
                            home from Ilfracombe market, but his wife, Mrs. Honor Huxtable, soon
                            appeared in the porch, with a bucket in one hand and a candle stuck in a
                            turnip in the other. In the cross-lights, we saw a stout short woman,
                            brisk and comely, with an amazing cap, and cheeks like the apples which
                            they call in Devonshire "hoary mornings."</p>
<p>"A massy on us, Zuke," she called into the house, "if here bain't the
                            genelvolks coom, and us be arl of a muck! Hum, cheel, hum for thee laife
                            to the calves' ouze, and toorn out both the pegs, and take the pick to
                            the strah, and gie un a veed o' wets."</p>
<p>Having thus provided for our horse, she advanced to us.</p>
<p>"So, ye be coom at last! I be crule glad to zee e, zure enough. Baint e
                            starved amost! An unkid place it be for the laikes of you."</p>
<p>So saying, she hurried us into the house, and set us before a wood-fire
                            all glowing upon the ground, beneath an enormous chimney podded with
                            great pots and crocks hung on things like saws. These pots, like
                            Devonshire hospitality, were always boiling and chirping. The kitchen
                            was low, and floored with lime and sand, which was worn into pits such
                            as boys use for marbles; but the great feature was the ceiling. This was
                            divided by deep rafters into four compartments lengthwise. Across some
                            of these, battens of wood were nailed, forming a series of racks,
                            wherein reposed at least a stye-ful of bacon. Herbs and stores of many
                            kinds, and ropes of onions dangled between.</p>
<p>Mrs. Huxtable went to the dresser, and got a large dish, and then turned
                            round to have a good look at us.</p>
<p>"Poor leddy," she said gently, "I sim her's turble weist and low. But
                            look e zee, there be a plenty of bakken yanner, and us'll cut a peg's
                            drort to-morrow, and Varmer Badcock 'll zend we a ship, by rason ourn be
                            all a'lambing." Then she turned to me.</p>
<p>"Whai, Miss, you looks crule unkid tu. Do e love zider?"</p>
<p>"No, Mrs. Huxtable. Not very much. I would rather have water."</p>
<p>"Oh drat that wash, e shan't have none of thiccy. Us has got a brown
                            gearge of beer, and more nor a dizzen pans of mulk and crame."</p>
<p>Her chattering warmth soon put us at our ease; and as soon as the parlour
                            fire burnt up, she showed us with many apologies, and "hopping no
                            offence" the room which was thenceforth to be ours.</p>
<p>After tea, I put my dear mother to bed as soon as possible, and sat by
                            the dying fire to muse upon our prospects. Not the strangeness of the
                            place, the new ideas around me, not even my weariness after railroad,
                            coach, and chaise, could keep my mind from its one subject. In fact, its
                            colour had now become its form.</p>
<p>To others indeed, all hope of ever detecting and bringing to justice the
                            man, for whose death I lived, might seem to grow fainter and fainter.
                            Expelled from that place, and banished from those recollections, where,
                            and by which alone, I could well expect ever to wind up my clue, robbed
                            of all means of moving indifferent persons and retaining strong ones;
                            and, more than this, engrossed (as I must henceforth be) in keeping debt
                            at bay, and shielding my mother from care—what prospect was there, nay
                            what possibility, that I a weak unaided girl, led only by set will and
                            fatalism, should ever overtake and grasp a man of craft, and power, and
                            desperation?</p>
<p>It mattered not: let other things be doubtful, unlikely, or impossible;
                            let the hands of men be clenched against me, and the ears of heaven be
                            stopped; let the earth be spread with thick darkness, as the waters are
                            spread with earth, and the murderer set Sahara between us, or turn
                            hermit on the Andes; happen what would, so God were still above us, and
                            the world beneath our feet—I was as sure that I should send that man
                            from the one to the throne of the other, as he was sure to be dragged
                            away thence, to fire, and chains, and gnashing of teeth.</p>
