<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>The farmer, his wife, and little Sally were now all I had to love. Poor
                            Ann Maples, though thoroughly honest and faithful, was of a nature so
                            dry and precise that I respected rather than loved her. I am born to
                            love and hate with all my heart and soul, although a certain pride
                            prevents me from exhibiting the better passion, except when strongly
                            moved. That other feeling, sown by Satan, he never allows me to
                            disguise.</p>
<p>To leave the only three I loved was a bitter grief, to tell them of my
                            intention, a sore puzzle. But, after searching long for a good way to
                            manage it, the only way I found was to tell them bluntly, and not to cry
                            if it could be helped. So when Mrs. Huxtable came in full glory to try
                            upon me a pair of stockings of the brightest blue ever seen, which she
                            had long been knitting on the sly, for winter wear, I thanked her
                            warmly, and said:</p>
<p>"Dear me, Mrs. Huxtable, how they will admire these in London."</p>
<p>"In Lonnon, cheel!" she always called me her child, since I had lost my
                            mother—"they'll never see the likes of they in Lonnon, without they gits
                            one of them there long glaskies, same as preventive chaps has, and then
                            I reckon there'll be Hexymoor between, and Dartmoor too, for out I know,
                            and ever so many church-towers and milestones."</p>
<p>"Oh yes, they will. I shall be there in a week."</p>
<p>"In Lonnon in a wake! Dear heart alaive, cheel, dont'e tell on so!"</p>
<p>She thought my wits were wandering, as she had often fancied of late, and
                            set off for the larder, which was the usual course of her prescriptions.
                            But I stopped her so calmly that she could not doubt my sanity.</p>
<p>"Yes, dear Mrs. Huxtable, I must leave my quiet home, where all of you
                            have been so good and kind to me; and I have already written to take
                            lodgings in London."</p>
<p>"Oh, Miss Clerer, dear, I can't belave it nohow! Come and discoorse with
                            farmer about it. He knows a power more than I do, though I says it as
                            shouldn't. But if so be he hearkens to the like of that, I'll comb him
                            with the toasting iron."</p>
<p>Giving me no time to answer, she led me to the kitchen. The farmer, who
                            had finished his morning's work, was stamping about outside the
                            threshold, wiping his boots most carefully with a pitchfork and a rope
                            of twisted straw. This process, to his great discomfort, Mrs. Huxtable
                            had at length enforced by many scoldings; but now she snatched the
                            pitchfork from him, and sent it flying into the court.</p>
<p>"Wun't thee never larn, thee girt drummedary, not to ston there an hour,
                            mucking arl the place?"</p>
<p>"Wull, wull," said the farmer, looking at the pitchfork first, and then
                            at me, "Reckon the old mare's dead at last."</p>
<p>"Cas'n thee drame of nothing but bosses and asses, thee girt mule? Here's
                            Miss Clerer, as was like a cheel of my own, and now she'm gooin awai,
                            and us'll niver zee her no more."</p>
<p>"What dost thee mane, 'ooman?" asked the farmer, sternly, "hast thee
                            darr'd to goo a jahing of her, zame as thee did Zuke?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, farmer!" I answered, quickly, "Mrs. Huxtable never gave me an
                            unkind word in her life. But I must leave you all, and go to live in
                            London."</p>
<p>The farmer looked as if he had lost something, and began feeling for it
                            in all his pockets. Then, without a word, he went to the fire, and
                            unhung the crock which was boiling for the family dinner. This done, he
                            raked out the embers on the hearthstone, and sat down heavily on the
                            settle with his back towards us. Presently we heard him say to himself,
                            "If any cheel of mine ates ever a bit of bakkon to-day, I'll bile him in
                            that there pot. And to zee the copy our Sally wrote this very
                            morning!"</p>
<p>"Wonnerful! wonnerful!" cried Mrs. Huxtable, "and now her'll not know a p
                            from a pothook. And little Jack can spell zider, zame as 'em does in
                            Lonnon town!"</p>
<p>"Dang Lonnon town," said the farmer, savagely, "and arl as lives there,
                            lave out the Duke of Wellington. It's where the devil lives, and 'em
                            catches his braath in lanterns. My faather tould me that, and her niver
                            spak a loi. But it hain't for the larning I be vexed to lose my
                            dearie."</p>
<p>That last word he dwelt upon so tenderly and sadly, that I could stop no
                            longer, but ran up to him bravely with the tears upon my face. As I sat
                            low before him, on little Sally's stool, he laid his great hand on my
                            head, with his face turned toward the settle, and asked if I had any one
                            to see me righted in the world but him.</p>
<p>I told him, "None whatever;" and the answer seemed at once to please and
                            frighten him.</p>
<p>"Then don't e be a-gooin', my dear heart, don't e think no more of gooin.
                            If it be for the bit and drap thee ates and drinks, doesn't thee know by
                            this time, our own flash and blood bain't no more welcome to it! And us
                            has a plenty here, and more nor a plenty. And if us hadn't, Jan Huxtable
                            hisself, and Honor Huxtable his waife, wud live on pegmale (better nor
                            they desarves) and gie it arl to thee, and bless thee for ating of
                            it."</p>
<p>"Ay, that us wud, ees fai," answered Mrs. Huxtable, coming forward.</p>
<p>"And if it be for channge, and plaisure, and zeeing of the warld, I've
                            zeen a dale in my time, axing your pardon, Miss, for convarsing so to
                            you. And what hath it been even at Coom market, with the varmers I've
                            a-knowed from little chillers up? No better nor a harrow dill for a
                            little coolt to zuck. I'd liefer know thee was a-gooin' to Trentisoe
                            churchyard, where little Jane and Winny be, than let thee goo to Lonnon
                            town, zame as this here be. And what wud thy poor moother zay, if so be
                            her could hear tell of it?"</p>
<p>At this moment, when I could say nothing, being thoroughly convicted of
                            ingratitude, and ashamed before natures far better than my own, dear
                            little Sally, who had been rolling on the dairy floor, recovered from
                            the burst of childish grief enough to ask whether it had any cause. Up
                            to me she ran, with great pearl tears on the veining of her cheeks, and
                            peeping through the lashes of her violet-blue eyes, she gave me one long
                            reproachful look, as if she began to understand the world, and to find
                            it disappointment; then she buried her flaxen head in the homespun apron
                            I had lately taken to wear, and sobbed as if she had spoiled a dozen
                            copies. What happened afterwards I cannot tell. Crying I hate, but there
                            are times when nothing else is any good. I only know that, as the farmer
                            left the house to get, as he said, "a little braze," these ominous words
                            came back from the court:</p>
<p>"'Twud be a bad job for Tom Grundy, if her coom'd acrass me now."</p>
