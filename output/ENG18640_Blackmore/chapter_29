<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p>In spite of the arnica, my cuts were not healed for a month; not enough,
                            I mean, for me to handle a pencil. Mr. Cutting, when he came, according
                            to promise, told me something to quiet me, because I was so feverish.
                            Whether he believed it, or only acted medically, was more than I could
                            decide. The opinion he gave me, or the substance of it, was this.</p>
<p>That the deed was done, not for money, or worldly advantage in any way,
                            but for revenge. Here I thought of Mrs. Daldy. What wrong the revenge
                            was wreaked for, he could not even guess, or at any rate would not hint
                            to me.</p>
<p>That the straightest clue to the mystery was to be sought in Italy, where
                            my guardian's track should be followed carefully. The idea of forcing,
                            or worming, the truth from him was rejected at once through my
                            description of his character; although the Inspector quite agreed with
                            me, that, even if guiltless of the crime, Mr. Edgar Vaughan knew all
                            about it now.</p>
<p>That no importance should be attached to the anonymous letter from
                            London; in accordance with my promise to Mrs. Elton, I did not mention
                            the Polish lady's name; and Mr. Cutting did not press me to do so, for
                            he firmly believed from what I said that she had made a mistake in the
                            address she gave, and would not help us now, even if we could find her.
                            That nevertheless a strict watch should be kept in London, whither flock
                            nine-tenths of the foreigners who ever set foot in this country. London
                            moreover was likely, ere long, to draw nearly all the migratory
                            strangers to the business or pleasure of next year's "Great Exhibition,"
                            provided only that it should prove successful, as the Inspector thought
                            it would.</p>
<p>As for my enemy being attracted by works of industry, it seemed to me
                            quite against nature that a base assassin should care for art or
                            science, or any national progress. But the remembrance of several cases,
                            among the dark annals I used to delight in, soon proved to me my error;
                            while the long experience of a man, versed from his youth in criminal
                            ways, convicted me of presumption.</p>
<p>To put myself more on a level with fraud, and stealth, and mystery, I did
                            a thing for which I felt guilty to myself and my mother. I changed my
                            name. But, in spite of Inspector Cutting, I did not travel out of the
                            family. My father's second name was "Valentine," taken from his mother.
                            This name I assumed in a shorter form, becoming "Clara Valence;" it
                            saved change of initials and a world of trouble, and I felt warmer in
                            it, because it seemed to have been my father's. In the neighbourhood I
                            knew no one except Mrs. Elton, to whom (as I grew intimate with her) I
                            partly explained my reasons. As for Mrs. Shelfer, she was delighted at
                            the change. She said that her Uncle John had christened me, that it
                            sounded much prettier, and would always remind her of Valentines.
                            Nevertheless I longed for the day when I might call myself "Clara
                            Vaughan" once more.</p>
<p>By the time I was able to go about freely again and use my hand as of
                            old, it was the middle of November. The first use I made of my pencil
                            was to copy most carefully all that Inspector Cutting required. He
                            promised to keep these drawings, and indeed the whole matter, most
                            jealously to himself; by which term he meant, as I afterwards found,
                            Inspector Cutting and those to whom he was bound to report.</p>
<p>What I now wanted was money, to send an adroit inquirer throughout the
                            North of Italy, and other parts where my guardian's shifting abode had
                            been. I knew that he dwelt awhile at Pisa, Genoa, and Milan, also at an
                            obscure little village named "Calva," which I could not find in the
                            maps. All I had learned of his rovings was from the lessons my father
                            would give me sometimes, when he used to say, "Now, Tooty, put your
                            finger on Uncle Edgar." To every one, but myself, it seemed a strange
                            thing that after so many wanderings, Mr. Edgar Vaughan had brought no
                            valet, major domo, or courier, no dependant or retainer of any kind, and
                            not even a foreign friend to England, or at any rate to Vaughan
                            Park.</p>
<p>But now for the needful resources—the only chance of procuring them lay
                            in my young and partly self-tutored art. I braced myself with the
                            remembrance, that while none of my family ever laid claim to genius, the
                            limner's faculty had never been wanting among them. Inferior gifts are
                            often as heirlooms in the blood, though high original power follows no
                            vein except its own. The latter none of us ever possessed; but taste and
                            the knack of adaptation had seldom been alienated. Observation too, in a
                            small way, and the love of nature seemed inborn in us all. My father's
                            drawings were perfect, but for the one thing wanted; and in sketches
                            from outdoor nature that want was less perceived. My grandfather had
                            been known among the few amateurs of the day as a skilful colourist. As
                            to habits of observation, a little tale handed down in our family will
                            show that they had existed in one of its members seven generations
                            ago.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1651, when King Charles was stealing along from Colonel
                            Wyndham's house to the coast of Hampshire and Sussex, the little band
                            was overtaken by nightfall, somewhere near the New Forest. It was
                            shortly after the narrow escape of the King from that observant
                            blacksmith, who saw that his horse was shod with North-country iron.
                            Though he was taking it easily, his three trusty friends knew well that
                            a Roundhead Squadron was near, and that his last chance depended on
                            speed and night travel. What could they do now in the tempestuous
                            darkness? They were in a tract thinly inhabited, half woodland, half
                            heather, and the road was hopelessly lost. No rain fell as yet it was
                            true, and the wind was waiting for rain, but the lightning came fitfully
                            from the horizon all round. The King alone was on horseback, his three
                            companions afoot. They stood still in doubt and terror, for they could
                            not tell north from south. Suddenly Major Cecil Vaughan espied a faint
                            gleam familiar to him of old in the waste land round Vaughan Park. To an
                            accurate eye there could be little doubt as to the source of the lambent
                            light—flame it could not be called. It played in a pale yet constant
                            stream on a certain kind of moss, known to botanists, not to me, for the
                            waste lands have been reclaimed. This light is to be seen at no time,
                            except when the air is surcharged with electricity.</p>
<p>"Follow me all; I know the way!" cried Major Vaughan, right cheerily.</p>
<p>"And if you do, man," said the King, "your eyes are made of dashers."</p>
<p>[What this meant, I used as a child to wonder; but now I know.]</p>
<p>For six dark miles the Major led them without default, until they came to
                            a lonely heathman's house, where they slept in safety. He never told
                            them how he did it; being apt, I suppose, as men of the second order
                            are, to hug superior knowledge. But it was a most simple thing. That
                            strangely sensitive moss follows the course of the sun, and therefore
                            the lambent light can only be seen from the west. So all the time he
                            could see it—the others never saw it at all—he knew that they were
                            wending from west to east, which was their proper course.</p>
<p>To return to myself. I put the finishing touch to a view of rock and
                            woodland scenery, north-west of Tossil's Barton, and set off to try my
                            fortune with it. Some young ladies, born to my position, would have
                            thought this errand one of much degradation, but it did not appear so to
                            me. So I walked briskly—for I hate an omnibus, and could ill afford a
                            cab—to the shop of a well-known dealer in pictures, not far from the
                            Haymarket. It was my first venture into the heart of London, but I found
                            the way very easily, having jotted it down from a map. The day was dark
                            and drizzly; the pavement grimy and slimy, and hillocked with mud at the
                            joints of the flags. It was like walking on a peeled kneading-trough
                            with dollops of paste left in it. Along the far reach of the streets,
                            and the gardens in the squares, wisps of fog were crawling, and almost
                            every one was coughing.</p>
<p>The dealer received me politely. Too politely in fact: for it seemed to
                            savour of kindness, which I did not want from him. What I wanted was
                            business, and nothing else. He took my poor drawing, done only in
                            water-colours, and set it up in a square place made perhaps for the
                            purpose, where the brown flaw fell upon it from a skylight formed like a
                            Devonshire chimney. Then he drew back and clasped his hands, then shaded
                            his eyes with them, as if the light were too strong, whereas the whole
                            place was like a well turned upside down. He seemed uneasy because I did
                            not care to follow him throughout all this little performance.</p>
<p>"And now," I said, for my foolish pride was up, and I spoke as I would
                            have done to the porter at our lodge, not with the least contempt—I was
                            never so low as that—but with a long perspective, "Now, Mr. Oxgall, it
                            will soon be dark. What will you give me for it?"</p>
<p>"Allow me, Miss; allow me one moment. The light is a leetle too strong.
                            Ah, the mark of the brush comes out. Strong touch, but indiscreet. A
                            year of study required. Shade too broad and massive. A want of tone in
                            the background. Great feeling of nature, but inexperienced rendering.
                            More mellowness desiderated. Full however of promise. All the faults on
                            the right side. Most energetic handling; no weak stippling here. But
                            water-colours are down just now; a deal depends on the weather and time
                            of year."</p>
<p>"How so, Mr. Oxgall?"</p>
<p>"Hot sun, and off they go. Fog and murk and frost, and the cry is all for
                            oil. Excuse me, Miss—a thousand pardons, your name escaped me, you did
                            not pronounce it strongly."</p>
<p>"Miss Valence!" I said, with an emphasis that startled him out of his
                            mincing.</p>
<p>"Miss Valence, you think me very long. All young ladies do. But my object
                            is to do them justice, and if they show any power, to encourage
                            them."</p>
<p>"Thank you, I want no encouragement. I know I can draw a little; and
                            there it is. The fog is thickening. I have far to go. Your price, if you
                            please?"</p>
<p>I went up many steps in his opinion, by reason of my curtness and
                            independence.</p>
<p>"Miss Valence, I will give you three guineas, although no doubt I shall
                            be a loser."</p>
<p>"Then don't give it," said I in pure simplicity.</p>
<p>I went up several steps more. How utterly men of the world are puzzled by
                            plain truth!</p>
<p>"Miss Valence, if you will forgive the observation, I would beg to remark
                            that your conversation as well as your painting is crisp. I will take
                            this little piece at all hazards, because it is full of character. Will
                            you forgive me for one word of advice?"</p>
<p>"There is nothing to forgive. I shall thank you heartily for it."</p>
<p>"It is simply this:—The worst part of your work is the perspective. And
                            figure-drawing will be of service to you. Study at a school of design,
                            if you have one near you; and be not above drawing stiff and unsightly
                            objects. Houses are the true guides to perspective. I cannot paint or
                            even draw; but I am so much with great artists, that I know well how to
                            advise."</p>
<p>"Thank you. Can you kindly suggest anything more?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Your touch is here and there too harsh. Keep your hand light though
                            bold, and your brush just a leetle wetter. But you have the grand things
                            quite unattainable, when not in the grain. I mean, of course, freedom of
                            handling and an artist's eye."</p>
<p>"Do you think I could do any good in oils?"</p>
<p>"I have no doubt you could, but not for a long time. If fame is your
                            object, take to oils. If speedy returns, stick to water-colours. Leave
                            me your address, if you have no objection; and bring me your next work.
                            If I do well with this, I will try to give you more."</p>
<p>He took from a desk three new sovereigns and three new shillings, wrapped
                            them neatly in silver paper, and handed them to me. I never imagined I
                            could be so proud of money.</p>
<p>Light of heart I left the shop, not that I had made my fortune yet, but
                            what was greater happiness, I thought myself likely to make it.</p>
<p>Soon I perceived, with some alarm, how thick and murky the air had grown.
                            The fog was stooping heavily down, and was now become like a wash of
                            gamboge and lamp-black. All the street-lamps were lit, though they could
                            not see one another, and every shop-keeper had his little jet. The
                            pavement was no longer slippery, but sticky and dry; and a cold, that
                            pierced to the bones, was stealing along. Already it had begun to
                            freeze; and I, so familiar both with white and black frost, observed
                            with no small interest the grey or fog-frost, which was new to me. How
                            different from the pure whiteness when the stars are sparkling, and the
                            earth is gleaming, and the spirit of man so buoyant! This grey fog-frost
                            is rather depressing to most natures, and a chilly damp creeps to the
                            core of all things. Thick encrusting rime comes with it, and sometimes a
                            freezing rain.</p>
<p>Before I reached the New Road, the fog had grown so dense and dark, that
                            I was much inclined to take a cab, for fear of losing my way. But I
                            could not see one, and finding myself at last in a main thoroughfare
                            called the Hampstead Road, I walked on briskly and bravely till I
                            reached Camden Town, when I knew what course to pursue.</p>
<p>Slowly wending up College Street, for I was getting tired and the fog
                            thicker than ever, indeed every step seemed a thrust into an ochred
                            wall, I heard a plaintive, and rather musical, voice chanting, much as
                            follows:—</p>
<p>"Christian friends, and sisters in the Lord, all who own a heart that
                            feels for undeserved distress, aid, I implore you, a bereaved wife and
                            mother, who has this very moment seven small lovely children, starving
                            in a garret, three of them upon a bed of sickness, and the inhuman
                            landlord, for the sake of a few shillings about to turn them this bitter
                            night into the flinty streets. Christian friends, may you never know
                            what it is to be famished as I and my seven darlings are this very
                            night, in the midst of plenty. From Plymouth in Devonshire, I walked two
                            hundred and fifty miles afoot all the way to join my beloved husband in
                            London. When I came to this Christian city—Georgiana, pick up that
                            halfpenny—he had been ordered off in the transport ship Hippopotamus, to
                            shed his blood for his Queen and country; and I who have known the
                            smiles of plenty in my happy rustic home, I am compelled for the sake of
                            my children to the degradation of publicly soliciting alms. The smallest
                            trifle, even an old pair of shoes or a left off garment will be received
                            with the heartfelt gratitude of the widow and orphan. My eldest child,
                            ma'am, the oldest of seven, bad in the whooping cough. Georgiana,
                            curtsey to the pretty lady, and show her your broken chilblains."</p>
<p>"No thank you," I said: I could just see her through the fog. She looked
                            like one who had seen better days, and the thought of my own
                            vicissitudes opened my heart towards her. How could I show my gratitude
                            better for the money I had just earned, than by bestowing a share in
                            charity upon worthy objects? So I took out my purse, an elegant little
                            French one given me by dear mother, and placed my three new shillings in
                            the poor creature's hand, as she stood in the gutter. She was
                            overpowered with gratitude, and could not speak for a moment. Then she
                            came nearer, to bless me.</p>
<p>"Sweet lady, in the name of seven famishing innocents, whom you have
                            saved from death this night, may He who guards the fatherless and the
                            widow from His mercy-seat above, may He shower his richest
                            blessings—"</p>
<p>Snap—she had got my purse and was out of sight in the fog. Georgiana's
                            red heels were the last thing I saw. For an instant I could not believe
                            it; but thought that the fog had affected my sight. Then I darted across
                            the road, almost under the feet of a horse, and down a place called
                            "Pratt Street." It was hopeless, utterly hopeless; and not only my three
                            pounds were gone, but half besides of all I had in the world. I had
                            taken that money with me, because I meant, if fortunate with my
                            landscape, to buy a large box of colours in Rathbone-place; but the fog
                            had deterred me. She had snatched my purse while I tried to clasp it,
                            for my glove had first got in the way. All was gone, dear mother's gift,
                            my first earnings, and all. More than all I felt sore at heart from the
                            baseness of the robbery. Nothing is so bitterly grievous to youth as a
                            blow to faith in one's species.</p>
<p>I am not ashamed to confess that feeling all alone in the fog, I leaned
                            against some iron railings and cried away like a child. Child I was
                            still at heart, despite all my trials and spirit; and more so perhaps
                            than girls who have played out their childhood. In the full flow of my
                            passion, for I was actually sobbing aloud, ashamed of myself all the
                            while, I felt an arm steal round my waist, and starting in fear of
                            another thief, confronted the loveliest face that human eyes ever looked
                            on. With soft caresses, and sweetest smiles, it drew close to my own
                            stormy and bitter countenance.</p>
<p>"Are you better now, dear? Oh don't cry so. You'll break your poor little
                            heart. Do tell me what it is, that's a dear. I'll do anything to help
                            you."</p>
<p>"You can't help me:" I exclaimed through my sobs: "Nobody can help me! I
                            was born to ill luck, and shall have nothing else till I die."</p>
<p>"Don't say so dear. You mustn't think of it. My father, who never is
                            wrong, says there's no such thing as luck."</p>
<p>"I know that well enough. People always say that who have it on their
                            side."</p>
<p>"Ah, I never thought of that. But I hope you are wrong. But tell me,
                            dear, what is the matter with you. I'm sure you have done no harm, and
                            dear papa says no one can be unhappy who has not injured any one."</p>
<p>"Can't they though? Your papa is a moralist. Now I'll just tell you
                            facts." And to prove my point, I told her of this new trouble, hinted at
                            previous ones and my many great losses, of which money was the least.
                            Even without the controversial spirit, I must have told her all. There
                            was no denying anything to such a winning loving face.</p>
<p>"Dear me!" she cried very thoughtfully, with her mites of hands out of
                            her muff—she had the prettiest set of fur I ever beheld, and how it
                            became her!—"Dear me! she couldn't have meant it, I feel quite sure she
                            couldn't. You'll come to my opinion when you have time to consider,
                            dear"—this was said so sagely that I could have kissed her all over like
                            a duck of a baby. "To steal from you who had just given her more than
                            you could afford! Now come with me, dear, you shall have all the money I
                            have got; though I don't think it's anything like the nine pounds you
                            have lost, and I'm sure it is not new money. Only I haven't got it with
                            me. I never carry money. Do you know why, dear?"</p>
<p>"No. How should I?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't mind telling you. Because then I can't spend it, or give
                            it away. I don't care a bit about money. What good is it to me? Why, I
                            can never keep it, somehow or other. But papa says if I can show five
                            pounds on Christmas-day, he will put five more on the top of it, and
                            then do you know what I'll do? I'll give away five, and spend the rest
                            for Pappy and Conrad." And the lively little thing clapped her hands at
                            the prospect, quite forgetting that she had just offered me all her
                            store. Presently this occurred to her.</p>
<p>"No. Now I come to think of it, I won't have the five pounds on
                            Christmas-day. As the girls at the College say, I'll just sell the old
                            Pappy. That will be better fun still. He will find a good reason for it.
                            He always does for everything. You shall have every bit of it. Come home
                            with me now, that's a dear. You are better now, you know. Come, that's a
                            love. I am sure I shall love you with all my heart, and you are so
                            terribly unlucky."</p>
<p>I yielded at once. She was so loving and natural, I could not resist her.
                            She broke upon me like soft sunshine through the fog, laughing, smiling,
                            dancing, her face all light and warmth, yet not a shallow light, but one
                            that played up from the fount of tears. Her deep rich violet eyes seldom
                            used their dark lashes, except when she was asleep. She was life itself,
                            quick, playful, loving life, feeling for and with all life around;
                            pitying, trusting, admiring all things; yet true as the hearth to
                            household ties. I never found another such nature: it was the perfection
                            of maiden womanhood, even in its unreason. And therefore nobody could
                            resist her. With me, of ten times her strength of will, and power of
                            mind—small though it be—she could do in a moment exactly as she liked; I
                            mean of course in trivial matters. It was impossible to be offended with
                            her.</p>
<p>When she had led me a few steps towards her home—for I went with her
                            (not, of course, to take her money, but to see her safe), she turned
                            round suddenly:—</p>
<p>"Oh I forgot, dear; I must not take you to our house. We have had new
                            orders. But where do you live? I will bring you my little bag to-morrow.
                            They won't let me out again to-night. Now I know you will oblige me. I
                            am so sorry that I mustn't see you safe home, dear." This she said with
                            the finest air of protection imaginable.</p>
<p>I gave her my name and address, and asked for hers.</p>
<p>"My name is Isola Ross, I am seventeen and a half, and my papa is
                            Professor at the College. I ran away from old Cora. It seemed such fun
                            to be all alone in the fog. What trouble I shall get into! But they
                            can't be angry with me long. Kiss me, darling. Mind, to-morrow!"</p>
<p>Off she danced through the fog; and I went sadly home, yet thinking more
                            of her, than of my serious and vexatious loss.</p>
