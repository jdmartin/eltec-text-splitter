<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<p>Meanwhile old Christmas was come, and all I was worth in the world was
                            change for half a sovereign. True, my lodgings were paid for, a
                            fortnight in advance, because good Mrs. Shelfer wanted to treat all her
                            pets to a Christmas dinner; but as for my own Christmas dinner—though I
                            can't say I cared much for it—if I got one at all, it must be upon
                            credit, since my drawing would not be finished for another week. Credit,
                            of course, I would not think of. Any day in the week or year, I would
                            rather starve than owe money. However, I was not going to cry about
                            plum-pudding, though once or twice it made me hungry to think of the
                            dinner in the great hall at Vaughan Park on the Christmas eve; a much
                            more elaborate matter in the old time, than the meal served in the
                            dining-room next day.</p>
<p>Now I sat in my little room this dreary Christmas eve; and do what I
                            would, I could not help thinking a little. It was a gusty evening, cold
                            and damp, with scuds of sleet and snow, as yet it had not made up its
                            mind whether to freeze or thaw. Nevertheless, the streets were full of
                            merry laughing parties, proud of their bargains for the Christmas cheer;
                            and as they went by, the misletoe and the holly glistened in the
                            flickering gaslight.</p>
<p>For old recollection's sake, I had made believe to dress my little room
                            with some few sprigs of laurel and unberried holly; the sceptre branch,
                            all cobbed with coral beads, was too expensive for me. Misletoe I wanted
                            not. Who was there now to kiss me?</p>
<p>From the sheer craving of human nature for a word of kindness, I had
                            called, that afternoon, upon Mrs. Elton. But good as she was and sweet
                            to me, she had near relatives coming; and I saw or fancied, that I
                            should be in the way. Yet I thought that her mother heart yearned toward
                            me as she said "Good bye," and showed me out by the Christmas tree, all
                            trembling to be lighted.</p>
<p>Now I sat alone and lonely by the flickering of three pennyworth of wood
                            which I had bought recklessly for the sake of the big ash-tree that used
                            to glow with the lichen peeling round it on the old Christmas hearth,
                            where I was believed the heiress. The little spark and sputter of my
                            sallow billet (chopped by the poor old people at St. Pancras workhouse)
                            led me back through eight sad years to the last merry time when my
                            father was keeping his latest Christmas, and I his pride and hope was
                            prouder than all, at being just ten years old.</p>
<p>How he carved and ladled the gravy; how he flourished his knife and fork
                            with a joke all hot for every one; how he smiled when the thrice-helped
                            farmers sent for another slice, and laughed when the crow-boy was nearly
                            choked with plum-pudding; how he patted me on the head and caught me for
                            a kiss, when I, dressed up as head-waitress, with my long hair all tied
                            back, pulled his right arm and pointed to widow Hiatt's plate—the speech
                            he made after dinner, when I was amazed at his eloquence and clapped my
                            little hands, and the way he made me stand up on a chair and drink the
                            Queen's health first—then the hurrahs of the tenants and servants, and
                            how they kissed me outside—all this goes through my memory as the smoke
                            of the billet goes up the chimney, and the tears steal under my
                            eyelids.</p>
<p>Then I see the long hall afterwards, with the tables cleared away and the
                            lights hung round the tapestry, and the yule log roaring afresh; my
                            father (a type of the true English gentleman, not of the past but the
                            present century), holding the hand of his wife (a lady of no
                            condescending airs, but true womanly warmth and love)—both dressed for
                            the tenants' ball as if for the lord-lieutenant's; both eager to lead
                            off the country dance, and beating their feet to the music. Next them, a
                            laughing child in a little white frock and pink slip (scarce to be known
                            for myself), hand-in-hand with my brave chevalier, Master Roderick
                            Blount, accounted by Cooky and both lady's-maids, and most of all by
                            himself, my duly affianced lord.</p>
<p>Then the housekeeper, starched beyond measure, yet not too stiff to
                            smile, and open for the nonce even to jokes about courtship, yielding
                            her gracious hand for the dance to the senior tenant, a man with great
                            calves, red face, and snow-white hair. After them come—</p>
<p>Hark! a loud knock and a ring. It is just in time before I begin the
                            palinode. Who can want me to-night? I want no one but those I cannot
                            have, whom the fire has now restored me, though the earth has hidden
                            them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelfer is hard at work in the kitchen, preparing a wonderful supper
                            for Charley, who has promised to come home. She has canvassed the chance
                            of his keeping this promise fifty times in the day. Hope cries "yes;"
                            experience whispers "no." At any rate the knock is not his, for he
                            always carries a latch-key.</p>
<p>She calls up the stairs "Miss Valence!" before she goes to the door, for
                            who knows but she might be murdered in the midst of her Christmas
                            pudding? I come out to prove my existence and stand in the dark on the
                            landing. She draws back the bolt; I hear a gruff voice as if it came
                            through a hat.</p>
<p>"Young 'ooman by the name of Clara Waun live here?"</p>
<p>"Yes to be sure; Miss Valence you mean, my good friend."</p>
<p>"The name on this here ticket ain't Walence, but Waun."</p>
<p>"All right, my good friend. All right. It's just the same."</p>
<p>"Hor, I don't know that though. Jim, the name of the party here ain't
                            Waun after all. It be Walence. And three blessed days us has been all
                            over London!"</p>
<p>Jim, from the top of the van, suggests that, after all, Walence and Waun
                            be much of a muchness. For his part, he'll be blessed if he'll go any
                            further with it. Let him and Ben look at the young lady, and see if she
                            be like the card. Meanwhile, of course, I come forward and claim the
                            parcel, whatever it is. Mrs. Shelfer redoubles her assurances, and calls
                            the man a great oaf, which has more effect than anything.</p>
<p>"Why, Jim, this must be Charley's missus; Charley Shelfer's missus! Him
                            as beat you so at skittles last week, you know."</p>
<p>"Ah, he did so. And I'd like to back him again you, Ben, for a quart all
                            round."</p>
<p>This fact is decisive. Who can doubt any more? But for all that, the book
                            must be signed in the name of "Waun," with which of course I comply.
                            When the two strong men have, with much difficulty (of which they made
                            much more), lowered the enormous package from the van, Ben stands wiping
                            his forehead. "Lor, how hot it be to-night to be sure! And the job us
                            has had with this big lump sure*ly*! Both the handles come off long ago.
                            I wish my missus had got a featherbed half the weight of that.
                            Five-and-twenty year I've been along of this company, man and boy, but I
                            never see such a direction as that there in all my born days. Did ever
                            you, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Well," replies Jim, "I've seed a many queer ones, but none as could come
                            up to that. And who'd a thought after all their trouble—for I'm blessed
                            if they wrote that there under a week—who'd a' thought they'd a put
                            'Waun' on it when they meant 'Walence.' But the young lady is awaiting
                            for us to drink her health, Ben, and a merry Christmas to her."</p>
<p>"How much is the carriage?" I ask, trembling for my change of the
                            half-sovereign.</p>
<p>"Nothing, miss. Only eightpence for delivery. It be paid to Paddington,
                            and if ever our Company airned eightpence, I'm blessed if they haven't
                            airned it now. Thank you, Miss, and werry handsome on you, and us hopes
                            the contents will prove to your liking, Miss, and make you a merry
                            Christmas."</p>
<p>Away they go with the smoking horses, after carrying into the little
                            kitchen the mighty maun, which Mrs. Shelfer, with my assistance, could
                            not stir.</p>
<p>"Bless me, Miss Valence, what a direction!" cries Mrs. Shelfer, when the
                            full light falls upon it.</p>
<p>The direction was written in round hand upon a strip of parchment, about
                            four inches wide and at least eight feet in length. It came from the
                            bottom all up over the cover and down upon the other side, so that no
                            one could open the basket without breaking it asunder. It was as
                            follows:—</p>
<p>"Miss Clara Vaughan lodges at number seven in Prince Albert Street in
                            London town near Windsor Castle in Gloucestershire the daughter of Mr.
                            Henry Valentine Vaughan Esquire a nice tall young lady her always wears
                            black things and walks very peart pale with a little red on her cheeks
                            when they lets her alone can't be no mistake without it be done a
                            purpose If so be this here little maun hain't brought to her safe and
                            sweet and wholesome will be prosecuted with the <hi rend="italic">utmost
                                rigour of the law</hi> signed John Huxtable his mark x witness
                            Timothy Badcock his'n X."</p>
<p>I wondered much whether Mr. Beany Dawe had been called in to achieve this
                            masterpiece of manuscript, which was all in large round hand, but
                            without any stops. It seemed beyond poor Sally's art, yet were some
                            loops and downstrokes that must be dear little Sally's. I took it off
                            with much trouble—the parchment was joined in four places—and I have it
                            now.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Shelfer was dancing around it, neglecting her supper in
                            the wonder of this gigantic hamper. "Let me get a chopper, Miss, you'll
                            never get it open. Why it's sewed as tight as an oyster."</p>
<p>However, I did get it open at last, and never shall I forget the
                            contents. There was a month's food for a family of twelve. First came
                            hay, such as I never smelt out of Devonshire; then eighteen rolls of
                            butter, each with a snowy cloth around it; the butter so golden even at
                            that time of year, that Mrs. Shelfer compared it to the yolk of an egg
                            looking out of the white. Then a storey of clotted cream and beautiful
                            lard and laver, which they knew I loved. Then a floor of hay. Below it a
                            pair of guinea fowls, two large turkeys, and most carefully wrapped from
                            the rest a fine hare filled with dried sweet herbs. Below these a flitch
                            of bacon, two wood-smoked hams, a pair of tongues, a leg of Exmoor
                            mutton, and three bottles of best elder wine. Then a brown paper parcel
                            containing Sally's last copy-book (I had set her copies for half a year
                            to come) and a long letter, the first I had ever received from Tossil's
                            Barton.</p>
<p>When all was out at last, after the greatest delight and laughter as each
                            thing appeared, I fell back in utter dismay at the spectacle before me.
                            Mrs. Shelfer sat on the floor unable to find her way out, she was so
                            flounced and tippeted with good things. When I came to her relief, she
                            did nothing but go round and round what was left of the little room,
                            humming a Catholic hymn, and pressing both hands to her side.</p>
<p>But something must be done at once. Waste is wickedness; how could we
                            stave it off? Everything would depend upon the weather. At present all
                            was beautifully fresh, thanks to the skilful packing and the frost,
                            albeit the mighty package had made the round of all the Albert Streets
                            in London. Mrs. Shelfer would have looked at it for a month, and at
                            intervals exclaimed, "Bless me, my good friend, that beats Charley's
                            pockets. How they must eat in Devonshire!"</p>
<p>"Come, Mrs. Shelfer, what good are you at housekeeping? You don't help me
                            at all. Let us put most of it out of doors at once. You have no cellar,
                            and I suppose they have none in London. At least we can give it the
                            chance of the open air, and it is not snowing now."</p>
<p>"Oh, but the cats, Miss!"</p>
<p>"Well, I must find some plan for them before we go to bed. Now come and
                            help, that's a good little creature, and I'll give you some elder wine
                            when we have done."</p>
<p>So we got all that was taintable into the little yard, while Tom, who
                            never stole, except when quite sure of impunity, looked on very sagely.
                            There we fixed it all up to the wall secure, except from cats, of whom a
                            roving band serenaded me every night. I presented Mrs. Shelfer at once
                            with a turkey—a specimen of natural history not found by the roadside,
                            even on Mr. Shelfer's Sabbath journey—also a ham, and three rolls of
                            butter. As to the rest, I would think what to do with it afterwards.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelfer kept off the cats until midnight, after which I held them at
                            bay by the following means. With one of my mineral paints mingled with
                            some phosphorus, I drew upon a black board a ferocious terrier, the size
                            of life, with fangs unsheathed, bristles erect, and eyes starting out of
                            his head. We tried the effect in the dark on poor Tom, who arched his
                            back, and sputtered with the strongest execration, then turned and fled
                            ignobly, amid roars of laughter from Mr. Shelfer, who by this time was
                            come home. This one-headed Cerberus being hung so as to oscillate in the
                            wind, right across the cat-leap, I felt quite safe, so long as my
                            chemical mixture should continue luminous.</p>
