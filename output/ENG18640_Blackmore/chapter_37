<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>In the morning I dreamed of Isola. Across a broad black river, I saw her
                            lovely smile. Thick fog rose from the water, in which two swans were
                            beating a dog, and by snatches only could I see my darling. She waved
                            her little hand to me, and begged me, with that coaxing smile which bent
                            cast iron and even gold, to come across to Isola. In vain I looked for a
                            boat, even in my dream I knew that I could not swim, and if I could, the
                            lead upon my eyelids would have sunk me. So I called to her to come to
                            me, and with that cry awoke.</p>
<p>It was striking ten—my own little clock which my father gave me. I
                            counted every stroke. What was Mrs. Shelfer doing, that she had not
                            called me yet? What was I doing, that I lay there so late; for I always
                            get up early? And what was the sun about, that no light came into the
                            room? I knew it was ten in the morning.</p>
<p>I felt all round. I was in my little bed, the splinter at the side of the
                            head-board ran into my finger as usual. There I was, and nowhere else.
                            Was it a tremendous fog? If it was, they should have told me, for they
                            knew that I liked fogs. At least they thought so, from the interest I
                            felt.</p>
<p>I groped for the little bell-pull, a sleezy worsted cord, which meant to
                            break every time, but was not strong enough to do it. I jerked with all
                            my strength, which seemed very little somehow. What a pleasure! The bell
                            rang like a fire-peal. I fell back on the pillow, exhausted, but
                            determined to have it out with Mrs. Shelfer. I put my hands up to
                            arrange my hair, to look a little more like Clara Vaughan, when the
                            light should enter, and to frighten Mrs. Shelfer.</p>
<p>There was something on my head. I never wear a night-cap; my long black
                            hair would scorn it. Am I in a madhouse, is this put to keep me cool?
                            Cold it is, and my brain so hot. All Wenham lake on Dives, and he will
                            only hiss. While I am pulling at it, and find it streaming wet, in
                            comes—I know her step—Mrs. Shelfer. But there is no light from the
                            passage!</p>
<p>"Mrs. Shelfer, what do you mean by this?"</p>
<p>"By what, my dear good soul? I have done all the blessed things I was
                            told to do for you. You might have put a ostrich feather or a marabout
                            to my mouth, Miss Valence, and tucked me up, and a headstone, and none
                            the wiser, when Uncle John brought you home last night."</p>
<p>"I suppose I am dreaming. But I am sure I rang the bell."</p>
<p>"Miss Valence, you did so, and no mistake. Bless me! I started in my
                            shoes. A good job, Shelfer wasn't home, he's so nervous. He'd have gone
                            for gin straightways. Now get up, that's a dear good soul, and when you
                            have had some breakfast, we'll talk over it, Miss Valence. Let me see
                            how your eyes are. Uncle John said they was bad, and I was to keep them
                            covered. I expects him here every minute. Now turn them up to the light.
                            What large eyes you have, to be sure. Bless me! Where are your long
                            black lashes?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Shelfer, there is some strange mistake. Let the light into the
                            room."</p>
<p>I had risen in the bed, and her breath was on my forehead.</p>
<p>"Light, dear child, I can't let more. The sun is on your face."</p>
<p>I fell back upon my pillow, and could rise no more. The truth had been
                            tingling through me, all the time she talked. I was stone-blind. I flung
                            the bandage from me, and wished my heart would break. Mrs. Shelfer tried
                            some comfort. She seemed to grieve for my eyelashes, more than for my
                            eyes; and addressed her comfort more to my looks than sight. Of course,
                            I did not listen. When would the creature be gone, and let me try to
                            think?</p>
<p>Poor little thing! I was very sorry; what fault was it of hers? Who and
                            what am I, blind I, to find fault with any one who means me well? I drop
                            my eyelids, I can feel them fall; I lift them, I can feel them rise; a
                            full gaze, a side gaze, a half gaze; with both eyes, with one; it is all
                            the same; gaze there may be, but no sight. Henceforth I want no
                            eyelids.</p>
<p>The sun is on my face. I can feel his winter rays, though my cheeks are
                            wet. What use is he to me?</p>
<p>I have the dagger somewhere by which my father died. Let me find it, if I
                            can.</p>
<p>I could have sworn that the box was in that corner carefully concealed. I
                            strike against a washing-stand. Ah, now I have it; the box is locked, my
                            keys are in the top-drawer. I bear the box to the bed, and go groping
                            for the chest of drawers. Already I can tell by the sun-warmth on my
                            face, which way I am going. Surely, if I wait, I shall have the instinct
                            of the blind.</p>
<p>What care I for that? The coward love of life suggested that poor solace.
                            Now I have the keys. Quick unlock the box.</p>
<p>At length I throw the cover back. The weapon handle is to the right. I
                            stoop to seize it. I grasp a square of colour. Pretty instinct this! I
                            have got my largest drawing box.</p>
<p>Oh paints, my paints, so loved but yesterday, that ape the colours I
                            shall never see, my hot tears make you water-colours indeed! If God has
                            robbed my eyes of sight, He has not dried my tears.</p>
<p>The gushing flood relieves me. What right have I to die? Even without
                            asking if my case be hopeless! Who knows but what these lovely tints may
                            glow for me again? May I not once more intone the carmine damask of the
                            rose, the gauzy green of April's scarf? Softening scenes before me rise.
                            I lay my box of colours by, and creep into my bed for warmth.</p>
<p>Presently the doctor comes. Inspector Cutting has chosen him, and chosen
                            well. From his voice I know that he is a gentleman, from his words and
                            touch instinctively I feel that he understands the case.</p>
<p>When he has finished the examination he sees me trembling for the answer
                            which I dare not seek.</p>
<p>"Young lady, I have hopes, strong hopes. It is quite impossible to say
                            what course the inflammation may pursue. All depends on that. At present
                            there is a film over the membrane, but the cornea is uninjured. Perfect
                            quiet, composure, so far as in such a case is possible, cold
                            applications, and the exclusion of light, are the simple remedies. All
                            the rest must be left to nature. Avoid excitement of any kind. Diet as
                            low as possible. Do not admit your dearest friends, unless they will
                            keep perfect silence. Even so, they are better away, unless you pine at
                            loneliness."</p>
<p>"Oh no. I am quite accustomed to that."</p>
<p>"That is well. I shall make a point of calling daily, but shall not
                            examine your eyes every time. The excitement and the effort would strain
                            the optic nerve. Our object is to keep the inflammation from striking
                            inwards. I should not tell you all this, but I see that you have much
                            self-command. On that and your constitution, under Providence, the cure
                            depends. One question. I am not a professed ophthalmist, would you
                            prefer to have one?"</p>
<p>"Oblige me with your opinion."</p>
<p>"It is a delicate point for me. There is no operation to perform. It is a
                            medical, not a surgical case. I have dealt with such before. Were you my
                            own child I would call in no ophthalmist, but as you are a stranger to
                            me, I wish you to decide for yourself."</p>
<p>"Then, I will have none. I have perfect confidence in you."</p>
<p>He seemed gratified, and took his leave. "Please God, Miss Valence, you
                            shall look me in the face ere long."</p>
