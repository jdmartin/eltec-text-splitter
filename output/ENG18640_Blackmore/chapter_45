<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p>When Isola had told Mrs. Shelfer everything, and a little more than
                            everything (for her imagination was lively), the dominant feeling in the
                            little woman's bosom was not indignation, as we had expected, but
                            terror. Terror of two evils; the first and chief evil, the possibility
                            of Charley catching cold; the other, the probability that he would crush
                            Conrad, and tread him into the earth, at the earliest opportunity. I
                            assured her warmly that Mr. Conrad could well defend himself, even if
                            Shelfer should dare to meddle with him.</p>
<p>"Oh, my good friend, you have no idea what a terrible fellow Charley is.
                            Why he broke the head of the skittleman at the "Load of Hay." So he told
                            me himself. Ah, he's a terrible fellow, when he's put out."</p>
<p>"But you forget, Mrs. Shelfer, he hasn't been put out this time; he was
                            put in." That Isola always loved small jokes.</p>
<p>"Put in, Miss Idols?" Mrs. Shelfer never understood any joke but her
                            own—"oh yes, put into the water you mean. True, true, and serve him
                            right (so long as he don't take cold) for calling me, his lawful wife
                            who keeps him together, 'the old gal at home!' But Charley's a terrible
                            fellow, terrible."</p>
<p>"Terrible coward more likely," I cried, "or he would never have dared his
                            low insolence to me. I am sorry for it, Mrs. Shelfer, utterly as I scorn
                            him, because it compels me to leave your house; and you have been truly
                            good and kind to me." I thought of Mrs. Huxtable; but how different was
                            the fibre of her kindness!</p>
<p>"Leave my house, Miss Valence! No, no, my good friend, that will never
                            do, not to be thought of, and us so used to you and all, and Tom, and
                            the blackbird, and the new squirrel! A likely story, my good friend, and
                            with your eyelashes coming! And do you know who would come instead of
                            you?"</p>
<p>"Of course not, Mrs. Shelfer."</p>
<p>"Why a nasty stinking hussy, that would steal the feathers out of my best
                            bed again, the same as they did before. My very best bed, Miss Idols, as
                            dear Miss Minto left me by her will, not a better bed in London, unless
                            it's the Queen's, and so I used to tell her when I helped to shake it
                            up. My mouth watered over it so, that she said one day, and the
                            knife-boy heard her on the stairs, 'Patty, you've been a good girl to
                            me, and you deserves it, and you shall have it, when I am tucked up for
                            good and all.' And so I did, very honourable, and all above board. Yes,
                            yes; I had a commercial gent one time, a wonderful heavy man to be sure,
                            and he stayed with me three year for the sake of that same bed. And he
                            knew what beds was, and no mistake. It was bootiful to see when he was a
                            getting up. It began to rise up, up, the same as Tom's back, when he see
                            your dog, Miss Idols."</p>
<p>"Come, Mrs. Shelfer, I fear we can hardly wait."</p>
<p>"'Twas like dough put afore the fire, Miss. There's no such Dantzic now.
                            You couldn't put your fist into one side of it, but out it would come
                            the other. Oh Lor, I could cry; that nasty sly minx, she was softer than
                            parsnips, you'd say, and one leg more than the other. I couldn't think
                            why it was she would always make her own bed. 'Thank you, Mrs.
                            Shelfer'—with her lips sucked in like a button-hole—'thank you, you are
                            too kind. It doesn't at all fatigue me, and my doctor pronounces the
                            exercise good for my chest and arms.' Thank God, she got some exercise
                            good for her legs as well. Six months on the treadmill. Charley got me
                            an order, and it did my heart good to see her. But my twenty pounds of
                            best feathers never came back again, and that wasn't the worst of it
                            neither."</p>
<p>"Oh dear no," says Idols, "the worst of it was the sin, Mrs.
                            Shelfer."</p>
<p>"The worst of it was that she stuffed it with sawdust, and oakum, and
                            jovanna, I do believe, by the smell of it."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Mrs. Shelfer?"</p>
<p>"Lor, Miss Valence, don't you know jovanna that the kingfishers lays on
                            the top of the sea, and the gardeners make water with it?"</p>
<p>"And what did she do with your feathers?"</p>
<p>"Sneaked them out of the house in the crown of her bonnet, and sold them
                            at eightpence a pound, and they worth three and sixpence, every flue of
                            them. But the rag and bottleman got two months, thank God for it. Ah, it
                            will never be a bed again under 5*l.* at least."</p>
<p>"Is it the one I sleep on, Mrs. Shelfer?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my good friend, the very same."</p>
<p>"And you have put me to sleep on guano! Well, I thought it smelt very
                            odd."</p>
<p>"No, no, my good friend, wait a bit. We got most of that out again, and
                            gave it to our geraniums. She stole it out of a sack as Charley kept in
                            the washhouse. There was feathers in it. That put it into her head, I
                            suppose. But as for your going, Miss Valence, that will never do. Never,
                            never. Will it now, Miss Idols? And to see her dress, to be sure, that
                            baggage! Why, my best tarlatan, as dear Miss Minto give me to be married
                            in, wasn't good enough for her to sweep the stairs in. Sweep the
                            stairs—yes, yes, she did sweep the stairs when I see her last; and she
                            had afore, I know; she was so clever at it; and that was why one leg was
                            so much more than the other."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Shelfer, do you expect us to listen to you all night?"</p>
<p>"True, my good friend, quite true. But when I thinks of my feathers,
                            something comes over me, I must out with my troubles, or burst. But you
                            musn't go, Miss Valence. That will never do, never; ask Miss Idols now."
                            And she turned to Isola, who was quite ready to be turned to.</p>
<p>"Of course it won't, Mrs. Shelfer. You are quite right, my good friend. I
                            won't hear of it for a moment. Why Mr. Shelfer was drunk. I know it by
                            the way he held his pipe. Quite 'drunk and incapable,' you know. And he
                            will be so sorry, and he'll never do it again. And he did not mean to be
                            drunk at all, but the frost was very hard, and the cold got into his
                            head. I am sure it would into mine, if I had stayed much longer; and he
                            didn't understand brandy-balls, as we do at College—you could not expect
                            it, you know."</p>
<p>The pure good faith of this last was too much for me. I laughed outright,
                            having no husband concerned in it. As for the dry little woman, she
                            actually cried. I had never seen a tear in her quick, shy eyes before,
                            though the feather-bed nearly brought them, and so did the death of the
                            elder Sandy, the squirrel. She turned away. She was always ashamed of
                            emotion.</p>
<p>"Bless your innocent heart, Miss Idols, if you don't marry a king! Not
                            one of us is good enough to tie your shoes as you talked of, you are
                            that simple and good of heart."</p>
<p>Is there any goodness more touching to a veteran than a soft young
                            nature's disbelief in evil? But for bitter experience, I might have been
                            sweet as Isola. Thank God, that in spite of all vinegar, the ailment is
                            still infectious. Isola could not make it all out.</p>
<p>"To-morrow morning, Miss Valence," began Mrs. Shelfer again, "to-morrow
                            morning, after I have wigged him well all night, and then given him a
                            good breakfast, he'll come and beg your pardon like a child, and be
                            ashamed to look any higher than your flounces; and I know you'll forgive
                            him."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Shelfer, I have forgiven him long ago. I cannot bear enmity against
                            such people"—these last three words had better been away—"for such
                            little wrongs. And I owe you a great deal for all your kindness to me.
                            The only question is, whether self-respect and prudence allow me to stay
                            here. I will leave the decision to Miss Isola. Young as she is, and
                            innocent and confiding, she cannot be wrong on a question of delicacy.
                            As for prudence, she knows more of London than I do."</p>
<p>Hereon I sat down with a womanly air. But I could hardly help laughing
                            when the senior sophist jumped up, proud to deliver judgment. To look
                            taller, she shook her flounces down, threw back her plump white
                            shoulders—her bonnet and cloak were off—drew her rich flowing hair down
                            the pearly curve of her ears and, scarcely satisfied yet, thought of
                            mounting a stool, then took her foot off the too convictive bema. After
                            all these anabolisms, she began with much solemnity. She was thinking of
                            the College, and her father in the rostrum.</p>
<p>"Miss Valence and Mrs. Shelfer, since you have honoured my weak judgment
                            by appointing me umpire, and as I am led to believe without any right of
                            appeal, I will do my utmost to be discreet and impartial. In the first
                            place I award that Miss Valence remain in this house, forget and forgive
                            her wrongs. In the second place I recommend (in such a matter I will not
                            presume to command) that till Mr. Shelfer has made a humble apology and
                            promised faithfully never to be intoxicated again, however cold the
                            weather is, Mrs. Shelfer shall not permit him to have a single kiss, nor
                            a single bit of hot dinner. Now I have delivered my decree."</p>
<p>"Lor, Miss Idols, you are too soft for the Old Bailey. He never kiss me,
                            unless it is when he knows I have got some money. But he do like a good
                            hot dinner. Right enough there, my good friend."</p>
<p>So this knotty point was settled; and Giudice, who was very loth to leave
                            me, escorted Miss Idols home, Before going, he made another solemn
                            deposit of his great jowl in my hand, and looked at me with an air so
                            tutelary and encouraging, that I could not help laughing; at which he
                            felt hurt, but condoned it. Isola told me that when he was put in charge
                            of her, he felt the responsibility so strongly that he would not stir
                            from her side, not even to speak to the most colloquially gifted dog;
                            though at other times he would stay gossiping near a lamp-post for five
                            minutes together. One evening when he was thus commissioned, a rude
                            fellow pushed between them, and said something to Isola. Giudice had him
                            down in an instant, and stood over him, like a tawny thundercloud, with
                            growlings so fearful and such flashing eyes, that two policemen felt it
                            wiser not to act as conductors. Idols herself was obliged, at the
                            entreaty of her prostrate foe, to coax the great dog off; but when the
                            ungrateful man got up, he insisted on giving Giudice into charge, and
                            having him dragged to the Station. "Very good, Sir," said the policeman,
                            "we'll enter the charge when you bring him there; let him go, Miss, for
                            the Gent to collar him." The "Gent" was away in no time, and Giudice and
                            his mistress walked off amid loud hurrahs from all the boys of the
                            neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Conrad called with his sister the day after Mr. Shelfer's ducking, to
                            reassure himself as to my nerves, which were never better. He looked
                            over some of my drawings, and without seeming to give, but rather to
                            seek information, afforded me many a hint, which I afterwards found most
                            useful. I now learned what his profession was; and it gave me pleasure
                            to find that he was not, as I had feared, a mere lounger upon town.
                            Instead of that, he was working very hard, being (as he told me) nothing
                            more or less than a journeyman sculptor. Though, as himself admitted, by
                            no means a novice, he was going through the regular course of study and
                            hand-labour under an eminent artist. But Isola told me, and no doubt it
                            was true, that he could beat his master out and out, and that for any
                            choice design, where original power and taste were needed, they always
                            came to him. Of late the frosts had lightened his tasks; for warm the
                            room as they would, the weather always affected the material; and they
                            feared to attempt the more delicate parts of the work during the rigours
                            of winter. So when the thaw came, he must lose the pleasure of seeing me
                            for a while, unless dear Isola wished to be escorted home on a Sunday;
                            if, indeed, I allowed her to come on that day. Why, that was the very
                            day when I could best indulge in a walk with my gentle friend, after
                            going to church; and I was sure her society did me more good than the
                            sermons. On her part, Isola found that the services always made her so
                            nervous (her nerves were as good as mine), and that she did not much
                            like walking about with a big dog on Sundays, and Cora was always cross
                            all the day after mass, so Conrad must promise upon his honour always to
                            come for her, rain, hail, or shine, on a Sunday. This he promised so
                            readily, that, for a moment, I fancied it had all been preconcerted.
                            Then I despised myself for the suspicion. The trick would have been not
                            out of the compass of Isola, but very unworthy of Conrad.</p>
