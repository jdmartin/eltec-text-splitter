<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>London! London! was still the cry of my heart; and was I not summoned
                            thither by duty long ago? What might become, during all this time, of
                            the man whom I was bound to watch at every turn, and whom I was now in a
                            better condition to deal with? My first visit, every morning, was to my
                            parents' graves, and neither of them would be there but for his ruthless
                            hand. As I sat there how lonely I felt! how sadly forlorn in the world,
                            be my lot wealth or poverty, victory or defeat!</p>
<p>One morning as I sat there my spirit was moved by dreams of the night
                            before, and I vowed, in that bodily but invisible presence, that none,
                            except one whose name I whispered, should ever kneel on that turf hand
                            in hand with me.</p>
<p>Borne out of my usual vein by the deed myself had done, I entered the
                            ancient church, always left open for me, and, kneeling at the
                            altar-rails, with many a Vaughan supine in prayer, pennons, helms, and
                            trophies round me, stately dames in marble white, and old crusaders
                            clutching still the cross—there I made my vow upon the knee-cupped
                            stones, that if he claimed me not, the race should end with me.</p>
<p>It was a presumptuous and unholy act, with all around me quelled by time,
                            with ages laid aside in dust, with many a stouter heart and larger mind
                            than mine, helpless even to superintend the wasting of his tenement,
                            with all his bygone bliss and woe, stanchest love and deadliest hate,
                            less eloquent now than the fly whom the spider has caught in his
                            skull.</p>
<p>Returning across the park, after a warm interview with "Tulip," who
                            insisted mainly upon having his ears well scratched, I found my uncle in
                            his snug wheel-chair, waiting near the side-door for me to help and
                            accompany him forth. This was our best way to take him out, because of
                            the steps at the front-door. He had not yet been in the open air since
                            his terrible illness, but, judging by my own experience, I thought that
                            he pined for the breeze, and, after long council, it was resolved to
                            trust him forth this day. With all his heart he was longing to be out;
                            but, instead of expressing impatience, smiled gratefully at me. I now
                            observed that he had a sweet and winning smile—a gift bestowed not
                            rarely on faces of a sombre cast.</p>
<p>In return for it I kissed him, and we sailed smoothly out. How he
                            revelled, to be sure, in the first clear breath from the lips of heaven!
                            Stretching one poor arm forth—the other he could not move—he tried to
                            spread himself like a flower to the sun. Then he drew long draughts of
                            liquid freedom, and was for a time as one intoxicated. In the glorious
                            crystal bath he seemed to float away from earth. Coming to himself at
                            length, he looked at me, and said, "Now John may go, if he pleases." A
                            year ago he would have said, "Go, John," and no more. But illness is a
                            great refiner. When John was out of sight he allowed free vent to the
                            tears of joy and gratitude, whereof, in my opinion, he had no call to be
                            ashamed. I kissed him many times. My warm impassioned nature always felt
                            for and delighted in any touch like this. Then he placed his better hand
                            on the cold and rigid one, lifting this with that, and poured forth
                            silent thanks to the Giver of all things.</p>
<p>"Clara, darling," at length he said, "how can I ever show you a
                            thousandth part of my gratitude for all the lovingkindness you have
                            heaped on me? Coals of fire, indeed! and they have warmed my selfish
                            heart. With loathsome death before your face, in all the pride and bloom
                            of early youth and richest—"</p>
<p>I will not repeat his words, because it would not become me; but I am
                            forced by all that has happened to show what his feelings were.</p>
<p>"And all this for me—me who have been your bitterest enemy, who have
                            turned you out of your father's house, and caused your mother's death!"
                            Here I stopped him, lest he should be overcome.</p>
<p>"Dear uncle, talk no more of this—never even think of it. The fault was
                            all my own. You know I would not stop, often as you asked me. There
                            always was a bar between us, and it was my obstinacy."</p>
<p>"No, it was my pride. Clara, in my better mind I loved you all along. How
                            could I help admiring your truth and courage and devotion to your
                            father? Although I own that you were very bitter against me, yet, if I
                            had only used the proper means, I might have got the better of it. If I
                            had told you all my story, you would have pitied more even than
                            condemned me. But my pride forbade, and I made the common mistake of
                            regarding you as a child, because you were that in years. I forgot to
                            allow for the forcing powers of grief. Even now, pulled down as I am,
                            and humbled by the wisdom of Heaven, I cannot tell you my strange
                            history without the acutest pain."</p>
<p>"Then I am sure, uncle, I will never let you do it."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is my duty, and the sooner done the better. Rescued though I am,
                            for the present, by your wonderful courage and skill, I feel that one
                            more blow, even a slight one now, and time for me is ended. But if it
                            were God's will to cut me off to-morrow, I should die in happiness,
                            having made my peace, and won your kind forgiveness."</p>
<p>"You shall not tell me now at any rate. And I won't have you talk so,
                            uncle. Mind, I am head-nurse still. Now come and see how lovely the
                            ranunculus are getting."</p>
<p>I began to wheel him over the grass and gather flowers (which "he played
                            with like a child), to change, if possible, the current of his thoughts.
                            Stupid thing! I took the wrong way to do it.</p>
<p>"Oh, uncle dear! you will laugh at me, and say I am as bad as ever; but
                            as soon as you get better I want to be off again, kind and good as you
                            are to me."</p>
<p>He trembled so violently, that I feared the chair would be upset.</p>
<p>"What, Clara, can't you live with me even now? Everything shall be yours,
                            as it ought to be. I will never meddle with you in any way, but keep to
                            some lonely corner, and not see you very often. Oh, Clara! dear Clara!
                            don't go away! You know I am quite helpless, and I can't live long, and
                            you are all in all to me, and I am so proud of you, darling! But it is
                            not for myself I care. I cannot tell, much less can you, what mischief
                            may be done if you leave this house again. That low, crafty woman will
                            be back again directly—she who made cowards of all the household, and
                            acted the coward herself, who left me to die in my lonely bed, while she
                            took all my keys. If her treachery succeeds, I shall rise from my grave.
                            And I know she will poison me yet, if she gets the chance, and can make
                            anything by it."</p>
<p>It was the first time he had spoken to me of Mrs. Daldy, and I was amazed
                            at his bitterness, for I had heard of no quarrel between them. What on
                            earth did it mean?</p>
<p>"Don't go, Clara!" he implored me, with the cold sweat on his forehead,
                            and every line in his poor thin face a-quivering. "Don't go, my darling,
                            blessed Clara! I have had none to love for years and years, and to love
                            you is so sweet! If you go I must die at once, and, worse than that, die
                            wretched in the knowledge that you will be robbed."</p>
<p>He fell back in the chair, from which, in his excitement, he had striven
                            to rise, and for some minutes there he lay insensible. When I had
                            succeeded in bringing him to himself, he looked at me so piteously, with
                            so much death in his eyes, that I promised, with a sinking heart, never
                            to leave him more, except upon absolute necessity, until he should be
                            well, or need my care no longer.</p>
<p>He even tried to persuade me not to go to London for the things I had
                            left there, but to send a trusty person to pack and bring them home. To
                            this, however, I could not yield, feeling, as I did, that, after all my
                            love for Isola, and all her kindness to me, I was bound to see her and
                            say farewell; and what harm could there possibly be in so short an
                            absence? My uncle wished me to bring her down for a good long visit, but
                            this at such a time could not be thought of. Moreover, lively, impulsive
                            Idols would have grown very long-faced in a dull sick house, which ours
                            must be for the present. It was settled at last that I should go to
                            London the following Monday, stay there one entire day, and come back
                            the day after with all my trifling chattels. One thing more my uncle
                            proposed which I would not hear of. It was, that he should transfer to
                            me, by deed of gift, all the estate, both real and personal, reserving
                            only a small annuity for himself, and a sum of 10,000*l.* for some
                            special purpose, which he would disclose to me at leisure. Thus, he
                            said, he should feel as if justice had been done, and there would be
                            some security against Mrs. Daldy's schemes. Of the latter I felt no fear
                            whatever, and thought it the effect of a shaken mind that he attached so
                            much importance to them. Under no circumstances would I think, for a
                            moment, of allowing him so to divest himself. Money, to any amount, I
                            could have, though I wanted very little, seeing that now, once more, a
                            solemn duty would withdraw me from my long pursuit, and from all the
                            frivolities which many girls delight in. I begged my uncle to appoint an
                            honest steward for the estate, and to assign me a moderate yearly
                            allowance, which would save much trouble. To this he at last consented,
                            and proposed for me so large a revenue, that, after removing the last
                            cipher, I had more than I knew how to spend. The first thing I did was
                            to send the kind farmer the residue of the sum he had lent me, together
                            with interest at ten per cent., which did not seem excessive,
                            considering that he had no security.</p>
<p>And now, with the utmost anxiety, I looked forward to the time when my
                            poor uncle should be strong enough to tell me, without risk, that
                            history of himself which he had distinctly promised me. Surely it must
                            shed some light on the mystery of my own. This thought, as well as the
                            sense of duty, reconciled me in some measure to the suspension of my
                            life-long search. He would have told me everything then and there, in
                            his warm gratitude for my undertaking; but I durst not let him. He was
                            already fatigued with so much talking, and when the stimulus of the
                            fresh air was gone, he suffered a serious relapse.</p>
