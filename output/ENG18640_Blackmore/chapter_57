<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>On the following Monday, my poor uncle being rather better again, I set
                            off for London, as had been determined, and arrived there late in the
                            afternoon. It had been proposed to send a servant with me, but I had
                            been too long accustomed to independence, and also had reasons of my own
                            for refusing. I was to receive, on the morrow, an account, by telegraph,
                            of my patient's health and spirits, and promised to give, in return,
                            some tidings of myself. Mrs. Shelfer had not been apprised of my coming,
                            because she would have been sure to tell Miss Isola, whom, as well as
                            her brother, I wished to take by surprise. Dear Isola had often inquired
                            about my family, but only knew that I was an orphan, much reduced in the
                            world, poor, and all alone. Much as I loved her, I knew quite well that
                            she could not keep a secret, and whenever she teased me about my "iron
                            mask," I retorted upon her that she had first to discover the secret of
                            her own home.</p>
<p>As we rushed towards the mighty city, what a flush was in my cheeks, what
                            a flutter in my heart! Whom might I not see even upon the platform, or,
                            at any rate, in the streets, and, poverty being removed, what obstacle
                            could there be between us? Not that I intended to resign myself to
                            affection, and lead a life of softness, until I had discharged to the
                            utmost my duty to the dead. Yet some sort of pledge might pass—some
                            surety there might be, that neither of us would feel thereafter quite
                            alone in the world. But how could I tell that he even cared about me?
                            Well, I had a strong suspicion. In some things the eyes are the best
                            detective police. Only I had always been so unlucky. Was it not too good
                            luck for me ever to be true?</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelfer's door was opened at my knock, not by her own little
                            bustling self, nor even by shock-headed and sly "Charley," but by a
                            short stout man of affable self-importance, with a semi-Jewish face, and
                            a confidential air. He had a pot of porter in one hand and a paper-roll
                            in the other, a greasy hat on his head, and one leg of his trousers had
                            lost the lower half. Upon learning my name and object, he took no notice
                            whatever of me, but put up his paper-roll for a trumpet, and shouted
                            along the passage, "Balaam, here's a kick! I'm bothered if it's all
                            lies, after all. Never dreamed the old gal could tell a word of truth.
                            Had a higher opinion of her. Blowed if the young woman herself ain't
                            come!"</p>
<p>"Easy there, Balak"—the mouth of the speaker was full—"keep the door, I
                            tell you. Never gets a bit of time to my victuals. She's up to a plant,
                            I doubt. Just let me have a squint at her." Out came another man with a
                            like appearance and air, and a blade-bone in his hand, whereat he
                            continued to gnaw throughout the interview. It was indeed a squint with
                            which he favoured me, and neither of them would move for me to pass.</p>
<p>"Pray what is the meaning of all this?" I asked, in my grandest manner.
                            "Surely I have not mistaken the house I lived in. This, I believe, is
                            Mrs. Shelfer's house?"</p>
<p>Instead of answering me, they closed the door enough to put the
                            slide-chain on, leaving me still outside, where, with boiling
                            indignation, I heard myself discussed; the cabman looking on with an
                            experienced grin.</p>
<p>"Well, Balaam, now, and what do you think of that party?"</p>
<p>"Uncommon fine young gal, and doosed mannersome too; but it don't follow,
                            for all that, that the thing is on the square, you know. Have she got
                            any luggage, Balak?"</p>
<p>"No, mate. And that looks fishy, now one come to think on it. Stop, let
                            me have another look."</p>
<p>"No; leave that to me. Slip the chain out, Balak: and keep your foot
                            behind the door. She can't push us both in without assault and
                            battery."</p>
<p>To my shame and indignation, I was subjected to another critical
                            cross-fire from half drunken eyes. I turned my back and stamped in my
                            vexation; the cabman gave me an approving nod. This little act of mine
                            was so unmistakably genuine, and displayed such very nice embroidery—I
                            do like a tasteful petticoat—that the hard heart of Balaam was softened;
                            at the same moment a brilliant idea stole through his cautious mind.</p>
<p>"Stop now, Balak, put your foot there. She can't push us both in, I
                            believe; leastways not without battery and contempt of court. Now what
                            do you think of this?"—And he whispered to his grimy friend.</p>
<p>"Well, that beats all I ever heer'd on. Let you alone for brains, Balaam,
                            and me for muscle and pluck!"</p>
<p>"Now, young lady," began Balaam in a diplomatic tone, "me and my mate
                            here be in a constitution of trust, or else you may take your oath, and
                            never a pervarication, we never would keep an agreeable young
                            female"—here he gave me two ogles intended for one—"on the flinty stones
                            so long; only we can't say if you mean honest, and there be such a many
                            bad ones going, and we've got a leary file inside. Now listen to what I
                            say. There's a dog as big as a lion in the room as you calls yourn; and
                            he do show his teeth, and no mistake. We be afeared to show our noses
                            there, even at the command of dooty. You can hear him growling now like
                            all the Strand and Fleet Street; and my mate Balak here leave half his
                            breeches behind him, saving your presence, Miss, and lucky to get off
                            so. Now if so be you undertakes, honour bright, to march straight into
                            that front room, my mate and self have concluded to let you in."</p>
<p>"Of course I will," said I, smiling at their terrors. So I paid the
                            cabman, took up my little bag, and ran right up the stairs. Balaam and
                            Balak feared to come round the corner. "You must unlock the door, Miss,"
                            cried one of them, "we was forced to lock him in."</p>
<p>"Oh Judy, my darling Judy, my own pet love of a Judy." He let me say no
                            more; his paws were on my shoulders, and I was in a shower-bath of
                            kisses. In the ecstasy of my joy, I forgot all about the two men and
                            their mysterious doings, and flung myself down on a chair, while Judy,
                            out of his mind with delight, even tried to sit on my lap. He whinnied,
                            and cried, and laughed, and yelled, and could find no vent for his
                            feelings, until he threw his great head back and told all in a wow-wow,
                            that must have been heard in Oxford Street. A little familiar knock, and
                            Mrs. Shelfer appeared, looking rather better than ever.</p>
<p>"Why, dear Mrs. Shelfer, how glad I am to see you! And you look much
                            younger, I declare!"</p>
<p>"And, Miss, you do look bootiful, bootiful, my good friend! Splendid
                            things,"—I was dressed a little better, but still in sombre
                            colours—"splendid, Miss Vaughan, and how you becomes 'em to be sure!
                            Talk of Miss Idols after that, why it's the Queen to a gipsy! And pray,
                            Miss, if I may make so bold, what did you give for this? it beats my
                            sarcenet dress, I do believe."</p>
<p>"Nothing, Mrs. Shelfer, only a little kiss."</p>
<p>"Gracious me, Miss, then you've been and got engaged, and to a lord at
                            least. I heard you were come into your great fortune at last; more than
                            all Middlesex they tell me, Regency Park and all! And that poor
                            straight-legged young man, as come here every day to see Judy, and to
                            ask for you."</p>
<p>"Now, Mrs. Shelfer, don't talk nonsense,"—my heart was jumping, but I did
                            not want her to see it. "I only hope you haven't said a word to him
                            about these foolish reports."</p>
<p>"Me, Miss! Do you think I would now?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I know by your face you have. You can't cheat me, Mrs. Shelfer.
                            Never mind, if you have not mentioned my name." It never struck me that
                            Conrad would be frightened at my money.</p>
<p>"No, never, Miss, as I hope to be saved." And she crossed herself, which
                            I had never seen her do.</p>
<p>"Come, Mrs. Shelfer, now; I've got some pretty little trifles for you in
                            this bag."</p>
<p>She jumped with pleasure; she was so fond of knick-knacks: then she put
                            her fingers on her lips and went to the door and listened. Presently she
                            came back with a mysterious air.</p>
<p>"Pray, Miss, as you are so very kind, excuse my taking the liberty, but
                            would you mind giving Judy the bag in his paws? no fear of them getting
                            it there."</p>
<p>"Why, what on earth is the matter? Why didn't you let me in? Who are
                            those nasty men?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's nothing, Miss; nothing at all to speak of: only they knocks my
                            sticks so in making the inwentory, and the one they made last time, and
                            the time before, would do every bit as well. But they charges for it,
                            every time, the rogues—and they dare to put the chairs down lackered and
                            American cloth, good, morocco as ever was, and as if Miss Minto—"</p>
<p>"Now, Mrs. Shelfer, tell me in two words what it means. Is it a
                            sale?"</p>
<p>"No, no, Miss, I should hope not; only an execution, and them two men are
                            the bailiffs; civil tongues enough, and very good judges of porter and
                            periwinkles. They're the ones as come last time; but I'd sooner have the
                            old ones, jolly fellows they were, and knew how to wink both eyes. But
                            that cross-eyed thief—"</p>
<p>"And have they got my things, Mrs. Shelfer?"</p>
<p>"No, Miss; only what few was in the bedroom; they daren't come here for
                            Judy. It was as much as their lives were worth. If I had known they was
                            coming, I'd have had him at the front door, but they locked him in as
                            soon as he got a piece out of the other fellow's leg. Bless me, how he
                            did holloa!"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say, Mrs. Shelfer, that they have taken possession of my
                            things in my bedroom?"</p>
<p>"To be sure, Miss. I said they was yours, and of course they wouldn't
                            believe me, and the folding door was shut, but Judy would have broken it
                            down only they put the bedstead again it. Gracious me! I never see a dog
                            take on so in all my life! He was like a roaring lion."</p>
<p>"I should rather hope so. Giudice, I commend you; and I've a great mind
                            to let you out, and what is more, I will if they don't give me back my
                            things. Surely, Mrs. Shelfer, they have no right to my property."</p>
<p>"Well, so I say, Miss; because it isn't for the landlord; but they won't
                            believe they are yours."</p>
<p>"If they don't believe me pretty soon, Giudice shall convince them. He is
                            a judge you know, and I've no idea of robbery any more than he has. But
                            who is doing all this, and why do you seem so unconcerned about it? I
                            should cry my eyes out, I am sure."</p>
<p>"Bless your pretty heart, Miss; this makes the fifteenth time I've had
                            them here in the last four years. At first I was terribly put out, and
                            made myself a figure crying; but now I only think it's company, and they
                            drink as if they was, that's certain. You must have seen the
                            inwentories, Miss, round the candles lots of times. Only one thing they
                            does that don't strike me as wery honourable, though it's law I b'lieve;
                            they charges me, and wery high too, for eating up my victuals, and they
                            will have meat four times a day. Why, that Balak, him with his breeches
                            gone—"</p>
<p>"Who put them in, Mrs. Shelfer, and how much is it for?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's one of Charley's bills or notes, of course. Quinlan holds it,
                            him as keeps "the little dust-pan," down Maiden Lane, and Charley says
                            that all he got for it was ten shillings and a waggon-load of
                            water-cresses. Now they'll be here directly, Miss, with you to keep the
                            dog in. Excuse me, Miss, I see you have got one of them new wide things
                            as go all round and up—capital things, I must have one before they come
                            again. And could you manage to sit upon the sofa, Miss, and the three
                            best chairs in your petticoat, with the tea-poy on your lap?"</p>
<p>"What on earth do you mean, Mrs. Shelfer?"</p>
<p>"Why, Miss, they can't lay hold of any article in use, I believe, and you
                            have got so much room in your things."</p>
<p>"Do you suppose I intend to let them come here, for a moment? Now let me
                            look at my bedroom. Come, Judy."</p>
<p>"Oh, Miss, they did have such a hunt here for Charley's double-barrel
                            gun; a regular beauty it is, and that big rogue Quinlan is after it.
                            They know it all round this neighbourhood, it was made by a famous
                            maker, Joe something, I b'lieve, and the best he ever made; it was poor
                            Miss Minto's brother's; and they shan't have it, not one of 'em. I'd
                            sooner shoot them with it. I keeps it always in the safest place I knows
                            on, and twice a year I see that it don't get rusty."</p>
<p>"What safe place do you keep it in?"</p>
<p>She put her little mouth up to my ear, and her little hand up to her
                            mouth, and whispered—</p>
<p>"At the broker's, Miss, in Barbican. He has had it now six years. It's in
                            for a quarter its value, but that's all the better for me: I have less
                            to pay for keeping it, and I carries the ticket night and day in my
                            bosom. And do you know, my good friend, they thought they had got it
                            just now; they got a key that fitted that box of yours, that you always
                            locked so carefully, and they made sure that was it; ha, ha, how I
                            laughed at them when they opened it!"</p>
<p>"What! have they dared to open my mahogany box?" It was the repository of
                            my precious relics.</p>
<p>"To be sure they did, Miss, and they found such curious things there! A
                            lovely thing all set with jewels, they said, a baggonet fit for the Duke
                            of Wellington, and plaster shapes like a cobbler's last, and coloured
                            paper with queer letters on it, and a piece of long black hair, and a
                            plan with distances on it—Lor, Miss, what on earth is the matter? Water!
                            water! You're like death—Balaam! Balak!"</p>
<p>"Stop, Mrs. Shelfer"—I had fallen on the bed—"I would not for ten
                            thousand pounds have had that box exposed to those low ruffians,
                            ransacked, and even catalogued. If I can punish them I will; and you
                            too, you low, miserly, meddling, inquisitive old crone."</p>
<p>She cared for nothing—though afterwards she told me she never saw such
                            eyes in her life—until I luckily called her an "old crone." At that, she
                            fell back upon the towel-horse, and sobbed with both hands over her
                            eyes, as if her heart would break. I had pierced her in the tenderest
                            point—her age.</p>
<p>I did not feel sorry for her at all for at least two minutes, but let her
                            cry away. "Serves her right," I thought. Even if she could not have
                            stopped them from opening that box of mine, at any rate she had no right
                            to gossip about it, and enjoy it all, as she evidently had done.
                            Furthermore, I knew well that she had always been on the tingle to learn
                            the contents of that box, and many a time I had baffled her. Now she had
                            triumphed thoroughly, and I should not have been female if I had calmly
                            allowed it. But seeing her great distress (through all of which she
                            talked, with sobs for affirmations), I began to think what a pity it
                            was; then to wonder whether she deserved it all; next, to believe that
                            she had done no harm; lastly, to feel that I had been a brute. Thereupon
                            I rushed to coax and kiss her, wiped away her tears with my own lawn
                            handkerchief—the feel of which consoled her, for the edge was lace—and
                            begged her pardon fifty times in a thousand foolish words. Finally she
                            was quite set up again by this:</p>
<p>"I tell you, my dear Patty, when I come to your age, when I am five and
                            thirty"—she was fifty-two at least—"I shall fully deserve to be called
                            an old woman for this; and much older I shall look, there is no doubt,
                            than you do."</p>
<p>"Right, my good friend, you are quite right there"—this expression showed
                            me that she herself was right.—"Why the young man from the butcher's, he
                            said to me this morning, and beautiful black hair reminded me of yours,
                            Miss, all stuck together with the fat from off the kidneys—"</p>
<p>"Come, Mrs. Shelfer, let me see about my box."</p>
<p>"To be sure, to be sure, my dear Miss Vaughan; but what do you think he
                            said? 'Now, William John,' says I, 'a good steak mind, a tender juicy
                            steak, for the gentleman visitors here'—Balaam, Miss, and Balak, if you
                            please,—'does like good juicy meat.' 'Mrs. Shelfer, ma'am,' he says, a
                            bowing with his tray like that, 'you shall have a steak, ma'am, as fresh
                            and as juicy as yourself.' Now wasn't that pretty, my good friend?"</p>
<p>"Beautiful, Mrs. Shelfer. But see about my box."</p>
<p>"Surely, surely, Miss Vaughan. But it was very pretty, like a valentine,
                            don't you think it was now?"</p>
<p>"Where is it?"</p>
<p>"Downstairs, Miss, in my little parlour."</p>
<p>"Then send it up at once, by one of the men."</p>
<p>Presently Balaam came up, looking askance at Judy, and with the mahogany
                            box under his right arm. He touched his dirty hat, for Mrs. Shelfer had
                            filled him by this time with the wonders of my wealth, and then he
                            looked doubtfully, and with sorrow, at his burden.</p>
<p>"Put it here if you please," and I pointed to some chairs, "the dog will
                            not touch you while I am here. Now what is the amount of this
                            execution?"</p>
<p>"Debt fifteen pounds, Miss; expenses up to five o'clock, four pound
                            ten."</p>
<p>"Here is the money. Now give me a receipt."</p>
<p>"No, Miss! You don't mean to pay all!"</p>
<p>"Of course, I do."</p>
<p>"Then, Miss, I beg your pardon, but I can't allow you. I has a duty to my
                            employer, and I has a duty to the public too, not forgetting Mrs.
                            Shelfer, and Charley an old friend, and all so handsome in the way of
                            victuals. And I'm sure she wouldn't wish you to be cheated, Miss. Pay
                            ten pounds for the debt, Miss, and that's a deal more than it cost them
                            or they expects to get. 'Twixt you and me, Miss, every stick of this
                            here furniture is in a dozen bills of sale already; and we comes here
                            more for practice like, than for anything else."</p>
<p>In short, I paid 10*l.* for the debt, and 4*l.* for the expenses:
                            whereupon Balaam looked at me with a most impressive and confidential
                            glance.</p>
<p>"Now, Miss, you won't think me rude; but you have come down so handsome,
                            I can tell you something as you may like to know. I've seed the very
                            moral of that sword of yours before."</p>
<p>"Are you certain? Pray where was it?" I trembled with excitement.</p>
<p>"It was in a place in Somers-town, Miss; where I made a levy, some eight
                            year agone."</p>
<p>"What was the name of the people?"</p>
<p>"Dallyhorse, or Jellycorse, or something of the sort. Foreigners they
                            was, and they had only just come to this country. But I can tell you the
                            name more shipshape from the books. Ah, the very moral of it; only there
                            warn't no serpent."</p>
<p>"Do you know what has become of them?"</p>
<p>"No that I don't, and don't want to come across them again. A mean set of
                            mongrel parlywoos; I got starved amost. But I did hear they was riding
                            the high horse now, and something about court."</p>
<p>"Are you quite sure that the weapon was exactly like this? Look at this
                            again."</p>
<p>"Miss, I can take my oath it was the fellow pea, all but the little
                            snake, and he ain't a fixture, I don't believe. I would have sworn it
                            was the very same, only you tells me not. I noticed it most particular;
                            for I never see one like it, though I have had a sight of foreign
                            weapons in my hands ere now. And the gent had got it put away so; we
                            come across it only through a cat as happened to be confined—"</p>
<p>"And what became of it? Did your employer have it?"</p>
<p>"Not he, Miss. When the gent found we had got it, he was put out and no
                            mistake; though he sham not. Away he goes and gets the money somehow,
                            and has us all away in no time."</p>
<p>"How many were there in the family?"</p>
<p>"Well, let me see. They was only living in lodgings, and had but half the
                            house. There was Dallyhorse himself, and a queer-looking lady, and some
                            children, I don't know how many children, for they kept them out of the
                            way; and a nice young woman as did the cooking for them, and precious
                            little it was."</p>
<p>"What was his profession? And who was his creditor?'</p>
<p>"I don't know. They called him an artist I think, but he look to me more
                            like a sailor. It was a boarding-house bill, as I was on him for.
                            Rum-tempered fellow. I thought he would have stuck me when I got his
                            sword thing. A tallish man he was, slight build, and active, and such
                            black eyes."</p>
<p>"Now, Balaam, if you can trace that man, and find out where he is living
                            now, I will give you two hundred pounds. Here's ten pounds for you as an
                            earnest."</p>
<p>Balaam was so amazed, that he almost looked straight at me.</p>
<p>"Please, Miss, may I tell Balak? I shan't be happy if I doesn't. We
                            always works together, and it wouldn't be on the square like."</p>
<p>"Was he with you then? And can he keep a secret?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Miss, he was with me, and I'd trust him with a gallows secret. I
                            can't do no good without him."</p>
<p>"Then, certainly you may tell him; but not while in this house. Here is
                            my country address, that you may know who you act for. Keep clear of the
                            Police. Keep the whole matter to yourselves. In two days, I leave
                            London; if you discover nothing in that time, write to me here, and I
                            will take good care to have the letters forwarded. Do nothing, but find
                            out that one thing, and when I have verified it, I will pay you the two
                            hundred pounds."</p>
<p>"Would you mind, Miss, putting it on paper?"</p>
<p>"Yes: for many reasons, I will not write it down. But you are at liberty
                            to inquire who I am, and whether I am likely to disgrace my word."</p>
<p>After taking his address, "Balaam Levison, Dove Court, Chancery Lane," I
                            allowed him to depart, and heard him pause on every stair, to ponder
                            this strange matter.</p>
<p>Presently Mr. Shelfer came home, and was delighted to see the bailiffs;
                            and the pleasure being mutual, and my cash burning to be quenched, a
                            most hilarious evening was the natural result. My health was drunk, as I
                            could hear too plainly, to unfathomable depths: and comic songs from
                            three loud organs, provided with patent nasal stops, with even Patty's
                            treble pipe audible in the chorus, broke from time to time the tenour of
                            my sad and lonely thoughts.</p>
