<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>Annie Franks was exactly as Isola had described her, "such a nice girl."
                            Kind-hearted like her father, truthful, ladylike, and sensitive;
                            retiring too, and humble-minded, with a well of mute romance in the
                            shadow of her heart, a wave of which she would not for the world
                            display. The only vent she ever allowed this most expansive element was
                            novel-reading, or a little quiet hero-worship. Her greatest happiness
                            was to sit upon a lonely bank, and read a slashing curtel-axe and
                            gramercy romance, with lots of high-born ladies in it, and lots of
                            moonlight love. If history got hard thumps among them, and chronology,
                            like an unwound clock, was right but twice in twenty-four, simple Annie
                            smiled no less, so long as the summer sun flashed duly on pennon, helm,
                            and gonfalon, and she could see bright cavalcades winding through the
                            greenwood shade. In "coat and waistcoat" novels her soul took no
                            delight. Not a shilling would she squeeze from her little beaded purse
                            for all the quicksilver of Dickens, or the frosted gold<ref target="#ENG18640_N8"/> of Thackeray. Yet she was not by any means
                            what fast young ladies call a "spooney;" she had plenty of common sense
                            upon the things of daily life, plenty of general information, and no
                            lack of gentle self-respect.</p>
<p>Now she was wending through an upland meet for gray-clad reverie, where
                            she might dream for days and days, and none but silly deer intrude. As
                            we passed along in the gloaming of the May, through bosomed lawn and
                            bosky dell, with lilac plumes for cavaliers, and hawthorn sweeps for
                            ladies' trains, the soft gray eyes of Annie ceased at last to watch me,
                            and her thoughts were in costume of Chevy Chase or Crecy.</p>
<p>By reason of the message sent the day before, no one in the house
                            expected me; so we stole in quietly, lest my uncle should be alarmed,
                            and I requested Gregory, tipsy Bob's successor, to bring Jane to meet
                            us, in my own little room. Annie being installed there, to her great
                            delight, and allowed free boot of "Marry, Sir knight," and "Now by my
                            halidame," I went to see my poor dear uncle, who by this time was
                            prepared for my visit. Very weak he seemed, and nervous, and more
                            rejoiced at my return than even I had expected. To me also it was warm
                            comfort in my cold pride-ailment to be with one of my own kin, whom none
                            could well disparage. There was a dignity about him, an air of lofty
                            birth, which my own darling father had been too genial to support. Soon
                            I perceived from my uncle's manner, that something had happened since my
                            departure to add to his uneasiness. But he offered no explanation and I
                            did not like to ask him. He in turn perceived the heavy dark
                            despondency, which, in spite of all my efforts, would at times betray
                            itself. Pride and indignation supported me, when I began to think, but
                            then I could not always think, whereas I could always feel. Moreover,
                            pride and indignation are, in almost every case, props that carry barbs.
                            In a word, though I would scorn the love-lorn maiden's part, it was sad
                            for me to know that I could never love again.</p>
<p>With a father's tenderness, he feebly drew my head to his trembling
                            breast, and asked me in a tearful whisper what had happened to me. But I
                            was too proud to tell him. Oh that I had not been! What misery might
                            have been spared to many. But all the time my head lay there, I was on
                            fire with shame and agony, thinking of the breast on which my hair had
                            last been shed.</p>
<p>"Now, good nurse Clara," he said at last with a poor attempt at
                            playfulness, "I shall have no more confidence in your professional
                            skill, unless you wheel me forth to-morrow with a cheerful face. You are
                            tired to-night, my love, and so should I have been, if you had not come
                            home. To-morrow you shall tell me why you came so suddenly and saved me
                            a day of longing. And to-morrow, if I am strong enough, I will tell you
                            a little history, which may be lost, like many a great one, unless it is
                            quickly told. Stop—one cup of tea, dear, and how proud I am to pour it
                            out for you—and then I will not keep you from a livelier friend.
                            To-morrow, you must introduce me. I still like pretty girls, and you
                            should have brought that lovely Isola with you. I can't think why you
                            didn't. She would have been most welcome."</p>
<p>"Come, uncle, I shall be jealous. The young lady I have brought is quite
                            pretty enough for you."</p>
<p>He sighed at some remembrance, and then asked abruptly,</p>
<p>"Do you mean to sleep, my darling, in the little room to-night?" His
                            voice shook so, while he asked this question, that I was quite certain
                            something had alarmed him. The little room was the one I had occupied
                            between the main corridor and his present bedroom. It was meant for an
                            ante-room, not a sleeping chamber; but I had brought my little iron
                            bedstead thither.</p>
<p>"To be sure I do, dear uncle; do you suppose, because I have been off
                            duty, that I mean to be cashiered? Only one thing I must tell you; I
                            have brought home with me one of the very best friends I ever had. You
                            have heard me talk of Giudice. I cannot bear the thought of parting with
                            him to-night, he will cry so dreadfully in the strange stables; and in
                            London he always slept on the mat outside my door. May I have him in the
                            lobby, uncle, you will never hear him move, and he never snores except
                            just after dinner?"</p>
<p>"To be sure, my pet; I would not part you for the world. God bless you,
                            my own child, and keep your true heart lighter."</p>
<p>If I had been really his own child, he could not have been more loving to
                            me, than he had now become.</p>
<p>After giving Annie Franks her tea, which she was far too deep in
                            tournament to drink, I paid a visit to Mrs. Fletcher's room, and learned
                            from her that nothing, so far as she knew, had happened to disturb my
                            uncle: Mrs. Daldy had not been near the house, and there was a rumour
                            afloat that she had been called to take part in a revival meeting near
                            Swansea. So after introducing Judy, who was a dreadful dog for jam, and
                            having him admired almost as much as he ought to be, I returned to
                            Annie, and found her in high delight with everything and everybody, and
                            most of all with her tapestry-writer. Leaving her at last under Tilly's
                            care, Judy and I were making off for our sleeping quarters, when truant
                            Matilda followed me down the passage hastily.</p>
<p>"Oh, Miss, please, Miss, I want to tell you something, and I did not like
                            to name it before that nice young lady, because I am sure she is timid
                            like."</p>
<p>Matilda looked not timid like, but terrified exceedingly, as she stared
                            on every side with her candle guttering.</p>
<p>"Hold your candle up, Matilda; and tell me what it is."</p>
<p>By this time we were in the main passage, "corridor" they called it, and
                            could see all down it by the faint light of some oil-lamps, to the oriel
                            window at the farther end, whereon the moon (now nearly full again) was
                            shining.</p>
<p>"Why, Miss, the ghost was walking last night, and the night before."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, Matilda. Don't be so absurd."</p>
<p>"It's true, Miss. True as you stand there. Pale gray it is this time, and
                            so tall, and the face as white as ashes." And a shiver ran through
                            Tilly, at her own description—"You know, Miss, it's the time of year,
                            and she always walks three nights together, from the big east window to
                            this end and back again. So please to lock your door, Miss, and bolt it
                            too inside."</p>
<p>"Well done, Tilly! Does any one intend to wait up for the ghost? What
                            time does it come?"</p>
<p>"One o'clock, Miss, as punctual as a time-piece. But could you suppose,
                            Miss, any one would dare to wait up and see it?"</p>
<p>"Then how have they seen it, in the name of folly?"</p>
<p>"Why, Miss, I'll tell you. One of the carriage-horses got an inflammation
                            in his eyes, and the farrier give orders to have it sponged never more
                            than three hours between, and so William Edwards, the head-groom if you
                            please, Miss"—Tilly curtseyed here, because this was her legitimate
                            sweetheart—"he stops up till one o'clock to see to it, and then Job
                            Leyson goes instead. So William come in, Miss, on Monday night, to go to
                            bed, please, Miss, and he took the short cut, not that he were allowed,
                            Miss, or would think of taking a liberty on no account whatever, but he
                            were that sleepy he didn't know the way to bed, so he went across the
                            corridor for the short cut from the kitchen gallery to the servants'
                            passage; and there he saw—he hadn't any light, Miss, and the lamps all
                            out—Goodness me! Whatever was that? Did you hear it, Miss?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and see it, Tilly; it's a daddy in your candle. Go on, Tilly, will
                            you. Am I to stop here all night and get as bad as you are?"</p>
<p>"There William Edwards, a man who never swears or drinks, there he saw
                            all in the dark, coming so stately down the corridor, as if it hadn't
                            room enough, with one arm up like this, a tall pale melancholy ghost,
                            and he knew it was the lady who was wronged and killed, when the great
                            wars was, Miss, two hundred year agone."</p>
<p>"Well, Tilly, and did he speak to it?"</p>
<p>"He was that frightened, Miss, he could not move or speak; but he fell
                            again the wall in the side-passage, with his eyes coming out of his
                            head, and his hair up like my wicker-broom. And then she vanished away,
                            and he got to bed, and did perspire so, they was forced to wring the
                            blankets."</p>
<p>"Capital, Tilly! And who saw her the next night?"</p>
<p>"Why that nincompoop Job Leyson, Miss. Our William was a deal too wise to
                            go that way any more, but he tell Job Leyson, and he a foolish empty
                            fellow, perhaps you know, Miss. 'Ho,' says Job, 'I often hear tell of
                            her, to-night I'll have a peep.' So last night when William went to bed
                            on the servants' side, down comes Job and takes the front way, pretty
                            impudent of him I think. And, Miss, I don't know what he see, I never
                            says much to him; but there they found him in the saddle-room, at five
                            o'clock this morning, with his heels up on a rack, and his head down in
                            the bucket, and never a bit of sponge had come near the poor mare's
                            eye."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you, Tilly. Perhaps you had better snuff your candle. No ghost
                            will have much chance that comes near my Judy." And with that I went to
                            bed, tired of such nonsense.</p>
<p>An hour of deep sleep from pure weariness both of mind and body, and I
                            awoke with every fibre full of nervous life. The moon was high in the
                            south-east, and three narrow stripes of lozenged light fell upon the old
                            oak floor. Although my uncle had left the gable where the windows faced
                            the setting sun, he still kept to the western wing. The house, which was
                            built in the reign of Henry the Eighth, covered the site and in some
                            parts embodied the relics of a much more ancient structure. The plan was
                            very simple, at least as regarded the upstair rooms. From east to west
                            ran one long corridor, crossed at right angles, in the centre and near
                            the ends, by three gable passages. Although there were so many servants,
                            not half the rooms were occupied: all the best bedrooms had been empty
                            many a year. No festivities had filled them since my father's days.
                            Gloom and terror still hung over the eastern part, where he had been so
                            foully murdered. In most of the downstair windows along the front of the
                            house, the rickety lattice of diamond panes had been replaced by clear
                            plate-glass, but the old hall, and the corridor, and some of the gable
                            windows still retained their gorgeous tints and heraldry.</p>
<p>As the shadows of the mullions stole upon my counterpane, there began to
                            creep across my mind uneasy inklings of the ghost. A less imaginative
                            man than William Edwards, I who had often enjoyed his escort, knew well
                            there could not be. As for Job Leyson I could not tell with what
                            creative powers his mind might be endowed; but—to judge from
                            physiognomy—a light ring snaffle would hold them.</p>
<p>Thinking, with less and less complacence, of this apparition story, and
                            the red legend which lay beneath it, for the spectral lady was believed
                            to be a certain Beatrice Vaughan, daughter of the Cavalier who perceived
                            the moss-light, and heiress of the house 200 years ago—thinking of this,
                            I say, with more and more of flutter, I sat up in the bed and listened.
                            My uncle's thick irregular breathing, the play of an ivy-leaf on the
                            mullion, the half-hour struck by the turret-clock, were all the sounds I
                            heard; except that my heart, so listless and desponding, was
                            re-asserting some right to throb for its own safety. With my hand upon
                            it, I listened for another minute, resolving if I heard nothing more to
                            make a great nest in the pillows—I always want three at least—and shut
                            both ears to destiny. But there came, before the minute passed, a low,
                            long, hollow sound, an echo of trembling expectation. In a moment I
                            leaped from the bed; though I had never heard it before, I knew it could
                            only be the bloodhound's cautious warning.</p>
<p>I flung a long cloak round me, gathered close my hair, hurried velvet
                            slippers on, locked my uncle in, and quietly opened the outer door.
                            There stood Giudice in the moonlight, with his head towards the far east
                            window, his ears laid back, his crest erect, and in his throat a
                            gurgling sound, a growl suppressed by wonder. He never turned to look at
                            me, nor even wagged his tail, but watched and waited grimly. I laid my
                            hand upon him, and then glided down the corridor, avoiding the moonlight
                            patches. Giudice followed, like my shadow, never a foot behind me, his
                            tread as stealthy as a cat's. Before I reached the oriel window where
                            the broad light fell, something told me to draw aside and watch. I
                            withdrew, and Giudice with me, into the dark entrance to my father's
                            room. Here we would see what came. Scarcely had I been there ten throbs
                            of the heart, when between me and the central light, where the moonbeams
                            fell askance, rose a tall gray figure. I am not quite a coward, for a
                            woman at least, but every drop of blood within me at that sight stood
                            still. Even Giudice trembled, and his growl was hushed, and every hair
                            upon him bristled as he crouched into my cloak. Slowly the form was
                            rising, like a corpse raised from a coffin by the loose end of the
                            winding-sheet. I could not speak, I could not move, much less could I
                            think. With a silent stately walk, or glide—for no feet could I see—the
                            figure came towards the embrasure where we lurked. Ashy white the face
                            was, large the eyes and hollow, all the hair fell down the back, the
                            form was tall and graceful, one arm was lifted as in appeal, to heaven,
                            and the shroud drooped from it, the other lay across the breast. The
                            colour of the shroud was gray, pale, unearthly gray. For one moment as
                            it passed, I kept my teeth from chattering. Giudice crawled one step
                            before me, with his mind made up for death. Back the blood leaped to my
                            heart, as the apparition glided slowly down the corridor without sigh or
                            footfall.</p>
<p>What to do I knew not; my feet were now unrooted from the ground. Should
                            I fly into my father's death-room? No; I was afraid. To stay where I was
                            seemed best, but how could I see it come back, as I knew it would?
                            Another such suspension of my life, and all, I felt, would be over.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while still the figure was receding in the distance, I saw a
                            great change in the bloodhound. He strode into the corridor, and began
                            to follow. At the same time, the deep gurgle in his throat revived. In a
                            moment, it flashed through me that he had smelt the ghost to be a thing
                            of flesh and blood. It might be my father's murderer. At any rate it had
                            entered as he must have done. Close behind the dog I stole after the
                            spectral figure. The supernatural horror fled; all my life was in my
                            veins. What became of me I cared not, I who was so wretched. Almost to
                            the end, that gliding form preceded us, then turned down a flight of
                            steps leading to the basement. Triple resolution gushed through me at
                            this; this was the spot where the ghost was known to turn, and glide
                            back through the corridor. When it had descended about half-way down the
                            staircase, where the steps were on the turn and narrow, standing at the
                            head I distinctly heard a flop, as of a slipper-heel dropping from the
                            foot, and then caught up again. What ghost was likely to want slippers?
                            And what mortal presence need I fear, with Judy at my side? Keeping him
                            behind me by a gentle touch, I hurried down the stairs. Luckily, I
                            stopped before I turned the corner, for a gleam came up the passage; the
                            ghost had struck a lucifer.</p>
<p>It was a dark and narrow passage, proof to any moon-light, and the
                            spectre lost no time in lighting a small lamp, to find the study door; I
                            mean my uncle's private study, where he kept his papers. The lamp was of
                            peculiar shape, very small, and fitted with three reflectors, to throw
                            the light in converging planes.</p>
<p>Still remaining in deep shadow, I saw the person—ghost no longer—produce
                            a key, open the study door and enter. Then an attempt was made to lock
                            the door from the inside, but—as I knew by the sound—the false key would
                            not work that way, and the door was only closed. Whispering into Judy's
                            ear, that if he dared to move—for his honest wrath at these burglarious
                            doings could scarcely be controlled—I would make a ghost of him next
                            day, I left him in the passage, and softly followed the intruder. First
                            I looked through the key-hole; the room was very dark and full of heavy
                            furniture; I could see nothing; but must risk the chance. So I slipped
                            in noiselessly and closed the door behind me. With the ghostly apparel
                            thrown aside, and a mask laid on an ebony desk, stood intently occupied
                            at the large bureau, which I had once so longed to search, my
                            arch-enemy, Mrs. Daldy. I was not at all surprised, having felt long
                            since that it could be no other. Sitting upon a stiff-backed velvet
                            chair, in the shadow of an oaken bookcase—crouch I would not for her—I
                            waited to see what she would do. Already the folding-doors of the large
                            bureau were open; their creaking had drowned the noise of my entry.
                            Before her was exposed a multitude of drawers. All the visible doors she
                            had probably explored on the previous nights, as well as the other
                            repositories of various kinds which the room contained. Her search was
                            narrowed now to one particular part of this bureau.</p>
<p>The folding-doors were very large, and richly inlaid with arabesques and
                            scroll-work of satin-wood and ebony: all the inside was fitted and
                            adorned with ivory pillars, small alcoves containing baby mirrors,
                            flights of chequered steps, and other quaint devices, besides the more
                            business-like and useful sliding trays. With the lamp-light flashing on
                            it, it looked like a palace for the Queen of Dolls—a place for puppet
                            ceremony and pleasure. Every drawer was faced with marquetrie, every
                            little door had panels of shagreen. In short, the whole thing would have
                            been the pride of any shop in Wardour Street, when that street was
                            itself. Having never seen it open till now, I was quite astonished,
                            though I don't know how often my father had promised to show it to me on
                            my very next birthday, if I were good. Probably I was never good
                            enough.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Mrs. Daldy pressed a fan, or slide, of
                            cedar-wood, in the right corner of the cabinet; the slide sunk into a
                            groove, and disclosed two deep, but narrow drawers; these she pulled out
                            from their boxes, and laid aside; they were full of papers, which she no
                            doubt had already examined. Then she placed the diminutive lamp on one
                            of the doll steps, and produced from her pocket three or four little
                            tools. Before commencing with these, she probed and pressed the
                            partition between the sockets of those two drawers, in every imaginable
                            way—a last attempt to find the countersign of some private nook, which
                            had defied her the night before.</p>
<p>At length, with a low cry of impatience, she seized a small, thin chisel,
                            and a bottle of clear liquid: with the one she softened the buhl veneer
                            upon the partition's face, and with the other she removed it. Then,
                            after a little unscrewing, she carefully prized away the stop of
                            cedar-wood, while I admired her workman-like proceedings (so far as they
                            were visible to me), and the graceful action of the arms she was so
                            proud of. Her shoulder came rather in my way, but I got a glimpse of the
                            narrow, vertical opening, where the cedar-stop had been. She drew a long
                            breath of delight and pride, then thrust a wire-crook into this opening,
                            and hooked forth two thin and closely-fastened packets. Eagerly she
                            looked at them; they were what she wanted. No doubt she knew their
                            contents; her object was to get hold of them. Having placed them
                            carefully in her bosom, she prepared for a little more joiner's work, to
                            restore what she had dismantled. Her dexterity was so pleasing, that I
                            let her proceed for a while. She soon refixed the cedar-stop, tapping it
                            in the most knowing way with the handle of the screw-driver, then she
                            screwed it tightly, and spread the wood with some liquid cement to carry
                            the veneer. She had mislaid the narrow strip of tortoise-shell and
                            brass, and was looking for it on the chequered steps, when I called
                            aloud:</p>
<p>"Shall I show you where you put it, Mrs. Daldy? But where on earth did
                            you learn your trade?"</p>
<p>Never was amazement written more strongly on any human face. If the ghost
                            had frightened me, I now had my full revenge. She dropped the bottle of
                            cement, and it rolled on the cabinet steps; she turned, with her face as
                            white as the mask, and glared round the room, for I was still concealed
                            in the recess. I thought she would have blown out the lamp, but she had
                            not presence of mind enough: otherwise among all that furniture it would
                            not have been easy to catch her; and she knew nothing of my sentinel at
                            the door.</p>
<p>After some quiet enjoyment of her terror, I came forth, and met her
                            fairly.</p>
<p>"What, Clara Vaughan! Is it possible? I thought you were in London."</p>
<p>"Is it possible that I have found a Christian, so truly earnest about her
                            soul, so yearning over the unregenerate, committing a black robbery in
                            the dead of night? Is this what you call a wholesome conviction of
                            sin?"</p>
<p>Low exultation I confess: but the highest blood in the land, if it were
                            blood, could scarcely have forborne it: for how I abhorred that
                            hypocrite!</p>
<p>For a time she knew not what to do or say, but glared at me without much
                            Christian feeling. Then she tried to carry it off in a grandly superior
                            style. She drew herself up, and looked as if I were not worth reasoning
                            with.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you are young enough to imagine, that because appearances are at
                            this moment peculiar—"</p>
<p>"Thank you: there is no need to inquire into the state of my mind. Be
                            kind enough to restore those packets which you have stolen."</p>
<p>"Indeed! I am perfectly amazed at your audacity. What I have belongs to
                            me righteously, and a stronger hand than yours is required to rob me."
                            She grasped her chisel, and stood in a menacing attitude. I answered her
                            very quietly, and without approaching nearer.</p>
<p>"If I wish to see you torn in pieces, I have only to raise my hand.
                            Giudice!" And I gave a peculiar whistle thoroughly known to my dog. He
                            leaped against the door, forced the worn catch from the guard, and stood
                            at my side, with his great eyes flashing and his fangs laid bare. Mrs.
                            Daldy jumped to the other side of the table, and seized a heavy
                            chair.</p>
<p>"My dear child, my dear girl, I believe you are right after all. It is so
                            hard to judge—for God's sake keep him back—so hard to judge when one's
                            own rights are in question. The old unregenerate tendencies—"</p>
<p>"Will lodge you in Gloucester jail to-morrow. Once more those papers—or—"
                            and I looked at Giudice and began to raise my hand. His eyes were on it,
                            and he gathered himself for the spring like a cannon recoiling. In the
                            height of her terror, she tore her dress open and flung me the packets
                            across the end of the table. I examined and fixed them to Judy's collar.
                            Then we both advanced, and penned her up in a corner. It was so
                            delightful to see her for once in her native meanness, despoiled of her
                            cant and phylactery, like a Pharisee under an oil-press. She fell on her
                            knees and implored me, in plain earnest English for once, to let her go.
                            She appealed to my self-interest, and offered me partnership in her
                            schemes; whereby alone I could regain the birthright of which I had been
                            so heinously robbed. I only asked if she could reveal the mystery of my
                            father's death. She could not tell me anything, or she would have jumped
                            at the chance. At last I promised to let her go, if she would show me
                            the secret entrance under the oriel window. It was not for her own sake
                            I released her, but to avoid the scandal and painful excitement which
                            her trial must have created. When she departed, now thoroughly
                            crestfallen, I followed her out of the house by the secret passage,
                            wherein she had stored a few of her stage-properties. Giudice, whom, for
                            fear of treachery, I kept at my side all the time, showed his great
                            teeth in the moonlight, and almost challenged my right to let her go.
                            After taking the packets from him, I gave him a sheepskin mat under the
                            window there, and left him on guard; although there was little chance of
                            another attempt being made, while the papers were in my keeping. Her
                            mask and spectral drapery remained with me, as trophies of this my
                            ghostly adventure.</p>
