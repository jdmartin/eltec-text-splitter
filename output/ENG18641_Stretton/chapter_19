<t:head>FIRE! FIRE!</t:head>
<t:p>Anne was standing close to the pantry door, listening to Stephen's mysterious
                         movements in utter bewilderment, hardly knowing whether she ought to call
                         her uncle, but not coming to a decision about it until the boy appeared
                         before her. His first quick action was to secure the door by fastening a
                         rusty bolt which was on the outside, and then, in a few hurried sentences,
                         he explained his strange conduct by telling her how Tim had conveyed to him
                         the design of some of the colliers for breaking into the master's house.
                         There had been several similar robberies in the country during the strike
                         for wages, and Miss Anne was greatly alarmed, while Stephen felt all the
                         tender spirit of a brave man aroused within him, as she sank faint and
                         trembling upon the nearest seat.</t:p>
<t:p>'Don't be afraid,' he said courageously; 'they shall tear me to pieces afore
                         they touch you, Miss Anne. I'm stronger than you'd think; but if I can't
                         take care of thee, God can. Hasn't He sent me here, afore they come, on
                         purpose? They'd have come upon you unawares, but for God.'</t:p>
<t:p>'You are right, Stephen,' answered Miss Anne. 'He says, "Thou shalt not be
                         afraid for the terror by night." But what shall we do? How can we make
                         ourselves safer? I'll try not to be afraid; but we must do all we can
                         ourselves. Hark! there's a footstep already!'</t:p>
<t:p>Yes, there was a footstep, and not a very stealthy one, approaching the
                         house, and the dog bounded forward to the full length of his chain, but he
                         was beaten down with a blow that stunned him. The men were too strong in
                         numbers, and too secure in the extreme loneliness of the dwelling, to care
                         about taking many precautions. Miss Anne and Stephen heard Mr. Wyley cross
                         the floor of his room above, and open his window; but there was silence
                         again, and the chime of the house clock striking eleven was the only sound
                         that broke the silence until the casement above was reclosed, and the
                         master's footfall returned across the room.</t:p>
<t:p>'I must go and tell him,' said Miss Anne; 'perhaps he can secure some of his
                         money, lest Martha should be stopped on the way, or not come in time. Stay
                         here and watch, Stephen, and let me know if you hear anything.'</t:p>
<t:p>She stole up-stairs in the dark, lest those without should see the glimmer of
                         her candle through the fanlight in the hall; and then she spoke softly to
                         her uncle through his locked and bolted door. Down-stairs Stephen listened
                         with his quickened hearing to the footsteps gathering round the house; and
                         presently the latch of the pantry door was lifted with a sudden click that
                         made him start and catch his breath; but Jack Davies could come no further,
                         now the rusty bolt was drawn on the outside. There was a whispered
                         conversation through the pantry window, and the sound of some one getting
                         out again; and then Stephen crept across the dark kitchen into the hall
                         through which Miss Anne had gone. At the head of the staircase was the door
                         of the master's room, now standing open; and the light from it served to
                         guide him across the strange hall, and up the stairs, until he reached the
                         doorway, and could look in. The chamber had a low and sloping ceiling, and
                         a gable-window in the roof, which was defended by strong bars. Near this
                         window was an open cabinet, containing many little drawers and divisions,
                         all of which were filled with papers; while upon a leaf in the front there
                         lay rolls of bank notes, and heaps of golden money, which the master had
                         been counting over. He stood beside his cabinet as if he had just risen
                         from this occupation, and was leaning upon his chair, panic-stricken at the
                         tidings Miss Anne had uttered. His grey hair was scattered over his
                         forehead, instead of being smoothly brushed back; and the long, loose coat,
                         which hung carelessly around his shrivelled form and stooping shoulders,
                         made him look far older than he did in the day-time. As Stephen's eyes
                         rested upon the sunken form and quaking limbs of the aged man, he felt, for
                         the first time, how helpless and infirm his enemy was, instead of the rich,
                         full, and prospering master he had always considered him.</t:p>
<t:p>'Keep off!' cried the old miser, as he caught sight of Stephen on the
                         threshold; and he raised his withered arm as if to ward him from his
                         treasures. 'Keep off! Stephen Fern, is it you? You've come to take your
                         revenge. The robbers and murderers have got in! O God, have pity upon
                         me!'</t:p>
<t:p>'I'm come to take care of Miss Anne,' said Stephen, 'They've not got in yet,
                         master. And, please God, help will be here afore long with Martha. The
                         doors and windows are safe.'</t:p>
<t:p>'Anne, take him away!' implored Mr. Wyley. 'I don't know if it is true, but
                         take him away. I'm not safe while he's there; they will murder me! Go,
                         go!'</t:p>
<t:p>Miss Anne led Stephen away; and no sooner were they outside the room, than
                         the master rushed forward and locked and barred the door securely behind
                         them. There was a window in the landing, looking over the yard where the
                         housebreakers were, and they stood at it in silence, straining their eyes
                         into the darkness. But it did not remain dark long; for a thin, bright
                         flame burst up from behind the dairy wall, and by its fitful blaze they
                         could see the figures of four men coming rapidly round from that corner of
                         the old building.</t:p>
<t:p>'Fire! fire!' they shouted, in wild voices of alarm, and beating the
                         iron-studded door with heavy sticks. 'Wake up, master! wake up! the house
                         is on fire!'</t:p>
<t:p>Their only answer was a frantic scream from the servant, who thrust her head
                         out of her window, and echoed their shouts with piercing cries. But Stephen
                         and Miss Anne did not move; only Miss Anne laid her hand upon his arm, and
                         he felt how much she trembled.</t:p>
<t:p>'They're only trying to frighten us,' he said quietly; 'that's only the
                         wood-stack on fire. They think to frighten us to open the door, by making
                         believe that the house is on fire. Miss Anne, I'm praying to God all the
                         while to send Martha in time.'</t:p>
<t:p>'So am I,' she answered, sobbing; 'but oh, Stephen, I am frightened.'</t:p>
<t:p>'Miss Anne,' he said, in a comforting tone, 'that chapter about faith you've
                         been teaching me, it says something about quenching fire.'</t:p>
<t:p>'"Quenched the violence of fire,"' she murmured; '"out of weakness were made
                         strong."'</t:p>
<t:p>She hid her face for a minute or two in both her hands; and then she was
                         strong enough to go to the servant's room, where the terrified girl was
                         still calling for help. The wild shouts and the deafening clamour at the
                         door rang through the house; but the blaze was gone down again; and when
                         Stephen threw open the window just over the heads of the group of men in
                         the yard below, there was not light enough for him to distinguish their
                         faces.</t:p>
<t:p>'I'm here,' he said,—'Stephen Fern. I found out what you are up to, and
                         Martha's gone to Longville for help. She'll be here afore long, and you
                         can't force the door open. Put out the fire in the wood-stack, and go home.
                         Maybe if you're not found here you'll get off; for I've seen none of you,
                         and I can only guess at who you are. Go home, I say.'</t:p>
<t:p>There was a low, deep growl of disappointment, and a hurried consultation
                         among the men. But whether they would follow Stephen's counsel, it was not
                         permitted them to choose; for suddenly a strong, bright flame burst up in a
                         high column, like a beacon, into the midnight air, and every one gazing
                         upwards saw in a moment that the thatch over the farthest gable had caught
                         fire. The house itself was now burning, and the light, blazing full upon
                         their upturned faces, revealed to Stephen the well-known features of four
                         of his former comrades. The shout that rang from their lips was one of real
                         alarm now.</t:p>
<t:p>'Stephen, lad, open the door!' cried Black Thompson. 'We thought to smoke the
                         old fox out of his kennel, but it's took fire in earnest. We'll not hurt
                         him, nor Miss Anne. Lad! the old house will burn like tinder.'</t:p>
<t:p>What a glaring light spread through the landing! The face of Miss Anne coming
                         from the servant's room shone rosy and bright in it, though she was pale
                         with fear. Through the open window drifted a suffocating smoke of burning
                         wood and thatch, and the crackling and splitting of the old roof sounded
                         noisily above their voices; but Miss Anne commanded herself, and spoke
                         calmly to Stephen.</t:p>
<t:p>'We must open the door to them now,' she said; 'God will protect us from
                         these wicked men. Uncle! uncle! the house is really on fire, and we want
                         the keys. Let me in.'</t:p>
<t:p>She knocked loudly at his door, and lifted up her voice to make him hear, and
                         Stephen shouted; but there was no answer. Without the keys of the massive
                         locks it would not be possible to open the doors, and he had them in his
                         own keeping; but he gave no heed to their calls, nor the vehement screams
                         of the frightened servant. Perhaps he had fallen into a fit; and they had
                         no means of entering his chamber, so securely had he fastened himself in
                         with his gold. Stephen and Miss Anne gazed at one another in the dazzling
                         and ominous light, but no words crossed their trembling lips. Oh, the
                         horror of their position! And already other voices were mingled with those
                         of the assailants; and every one was shouting from without, praying them to
                         open the door, and be saved from their tremendous peril.</t:p>
<t:p>'I'll not open the door!' said Mr. Wyley from within; 'they will rob and
                         murder me. They are come to kill me, and I may as well die here. There's no
                         help.'</t:p>
<t:p>'There is help, dear uncle!' cried Miss Anne; 'there are other people from
                         Botfield; and help is coming from Longville. Oh, let me in!'</t:p>
<t:p>'No,' said the master, 'they all hate me. They'll kill me, and say it was
                         done in the fire. I'll not open to anybody.'</t:p>
<t:p>She prayed and expostulated in vain; he cared little for their danger, so
                         hardened was he by a selfish fear for himself. The fire was gaining ground
                         quickly, for a brisk wind had sprung up, and the long-seasoned timber in
                         the old walls burnt like touchwood. The servant lay insensible on the
                         threshold of the master's chamber; and Miss Anne and Stephen looked out
                         from a front casement upon the gathering crowd, who implored them, with
                         frenzied earnestness, to throw open the door.</t:p>
<t:p>'Miss Anne,' cried Stephen, 'you can get through the pantry window; you are
                         little enough. Oh, be quick, and let me see you safe!'</t:p>
<t:p>'I cannot,' she answered: 'not yet! Not till the last moment. I dare not
                         leave my uncle and that poor girl. Oh, Stephen, if Martha would but
                         come!'</t:p>
<t:p>She rested her head against the casement, sobbing, as though her grief could
                         not be assuaged. Stephen felt heart-sick with his intense longing for the
                         arrival of help from Longville, as he watched the progress of the fire; but
                         at last, after what appeared ages of waiting, they heard a shout in the
                         distance, and saw a little band of horsemen galloping up to the burning
                         house.</t:p>
<t:p>'They are come from Longville, uncle,' cried Miss Anne. 'You must open now;
                         there is not a moment to spare. The fire is gaining upon us fast.'</t:p>
<t:p>He had seen their approach himself, and now he opened the doors, and gave the
                         keys to Miss Anne. He had collected all his papers and notes in one large
                         bundle, which he had clasped in his arms; and as soon as the crowd swept in
                         through the open doors, he cried aloud to the constable from Longville to
                         come and guard him. There was very little time for saving anything out of
                         the house, for before long the flames gathered such volume and strength as
                         to drive every one out before them; and as Stephen stood beside the
                         miserable old man, who was shivering in the bitter night wind, he beheld
                         his dwelling destroyed as suddenly and entirely as the hut at Fern's Hollow
                         had been.</t:p>
