<t:head>THE MASTER'S DEATHBED.</t:head>
<t:p>When the master at last consented to leave the sight of his old dwelling
                         burning into blackened heaps, he seemed to care nothing where he might be
                         taken. He was without a home, and almost without a friend. It was not
                         accident merely, but the long-provoked hatred of his people, that had
                         driven him from the old chambers and the old roof which had sheltered him
                         for so many years, and where all the habits and memories of his life
                         centred. Miss Anne had not been long enough at Botfield to form friendships
                         on her own account, except among the poor and ignorant people on her
                         uncle's works; and she accepted most thankfully the offer of the doctor
                         from Longville to give them a refuge in his house. No sooner had they
                         arrived there than it was discovered that the master was struck with
                         paralysis, brought on by the shock of the fire, and all the terrifying
                         circumstances attending it. He was carried at once to a bedroom, and from
                         that time Miss Anne had been fully occupied in nursing him.</t:p>
<t:p>He had seemed to be getting better the last day or two, and his power of
                         speech had returned, though he spoke but rarely; only following Miss Anne's
                         movements with earnest eyes, and hardly suffering her to leave him, even
                         for necessary rest and refreshment. All that afternoon he had been tossing
                         his restless head from side to side, uttering deep, low groans, and
                         murmuring now and then to himself words which Miss Anne could not
                         understand. She looked white and ill herself, as if her strength were
                         nearly exhausted; but after the doctor had been in, and, feeling the
                         master's pulse, shook his head solemnly, she would not consent to leave his
                         bedside for any length of time.</t:p>
<t:p>'How long?' she whispered, going with the doctor to the outside of the
                         door.</t:p>
<t:p>'Not more than twenty-four hours,' was the answer.</t:p>
<t:p>'Will he be conscious all the time?' she asked again.</t:p>
<t:p>'I cannot tell certainly,' replied the doctor, 'but most probably not.'</t:p>
<t:p>Only twenty-four hours! One day of swiftly-passing time, and then the eternal
                         future! One more sun-setting, and one more sun-rising, and then everlasting
                         night, or eternal day! For a minute Miss Anne leaned against the doorway,
                         with a fainting spirit. There was so much to do, and so short a space for
                         doing anything. All the real business of the whole life had to be crowded
                         into these few hours, if possible. As she entered the room, her uncle's
                         eyes met hers with a glance of unspeakable anguish, and he called her in a
                         trembling tone to her side.</t:p>
<t:p>'I heard,' he whispered. 'Anne, what must be done now?'</t:p>
<t:p>'Oh, uncle,' she said, 'have I not told you often, that "Christ Jesus came
                         into the world to save sinners"? There is no limit with God; with him one
                         day is as a thousand years, and He gives you still a day to make your peace
                         with Him.'</t:p>
<t:p>'There is no peace for my soul with God,' he answered; 'I've been at enmity
                         with Him all my life; and will He receive me at the last moment? He is too
                         just, too righteous, Anne. I'll not insult Him by offering Him my soul now.
                         You asked me once, "What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole
                         world, and lose his own soul?" Mine is lost—lost, and that without remedy.
                         This gold is a millstone about my neck.'</t:p>
<t:p>'Uncle,' she said, commanding her voice with a great effort, 'the thief upon
                         the cross beside our Lord had a shorter time than you, for he was to die at
                         sunset that day; yet he repented and believed in the crucified Saviour, who
                         was able to pardon him. Christ is still waiting to forgive; He is
                         stretching out His arms to receive you. Only look at Him with the same
                         penitence and faith that the dying thief felt.'</t:p>
<t:p>'Nay,' groaned the dying man, 'he could show his faith by confessing Him
                         before all those who were crucifying the Lord, and it was a glory to the
                         Saviour to forgive him then. But what glory would it be to pardon me on
                         this death-bed, where I can do nothing for Him? No; I can do
                         nothing—nothing! All these years I could have worked for God; but now I can
                         do nothing!'</t:p>
<t:p>'Uncle,' said Miss Anne, 'our Lord was asked by some, "What shall we do, that
                         we might work the works of God?" and He answered them, "This is the work of
                         God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent." Oh, that is all! Believe on
                         Him, and He will forgive you; and all the angels in heaven will glorify Him
                         for His mercy.'</t:p>
<t:p>'Anne,' he answered, fixing on her a look of despair, 'I cannot. My heart is
                         hard and heavy; I remember when it used to feel and care about these
                         things; but it is dead now, and my soul is lost for ever. Anne, even if
                         Jesus is willing to pardon me, I cannot believe in forgiveness.'</t:p>
<t:p>Miss Anne sank down by the bedside, unable to answer him, save by a prayer,
                         half aloud, to God for His mercy to be shown to him, if it were possible!
                         He lay there, helpless and hopeless, tossing to and fro upon the pillows.
                         At last he spoke again, in a sharp, clear, energetic tone.</t:p>
<t:p>'Anne, be quick!' he said; 'find me my will among those papers. Perhaps if I
                         could do something, I might be able to believe.'</t:p>
<t:p>He watched her with impatient eagerness as she turned over the precious
                         parcel of papers which he had rescued from the fire. There were many
                         documents and writings belonging to the property he had gathered together,
                         and it was some time before she could find the will. The master tried to
                         take it from her, but in vain; his right hand was powerless.</t:p>
<t:p>'Oh, I forgot!' he cried despairingly; 'this hand is useless, and I cannot
                         alter it now. God will not let me undo the mischief I have done. Anne, I
                         have left Fern's Hollow away from you to my brother Thomas, lest you should
                         restore it to Stephen; and now I can do nothing! Oh, misery, misery! The
                         robbery and murder of the fatherless children rest upon my soul. Send
                         quickly, Anne, send for Stephen Fern.'</t:p>
<t:p>Miss Anne sent a messenger to hasten Stephen; and after that the master lay
                         perfectly still, with closed eyes, as if he were treasuring up the little
                         strength remaining to him. The last sunset was over, and the night-lamp was
                         lighted once more; while Miss Anne sat beside him watching, in an agony of
                         prayer to God. There was no sound to be heard, for every one in the house
                         knew that the old man was dying, and they kept a profound quietness
                         throughout all the rooms. He had taken no notice of anything since he asked
                         for Stephen; but when a light rap was heard at the door he opened his eyes,
                         and turned his grey head round anxiously to see whether he was come.</t:p>
<t:p>It was Stephen. He stood within the doorway, not liking to enter farther, but
                         looking straight forward at the master with a very pale and sorrowful face,
                         upon which there was no trace of triumph or hatred. Miss Anne gazed
                         earnestly at him, but she did not speak; she would not place herself
                         between him and his dying enemy now.</t:p>
<t:p>'Come here, Stephen,' said the master, in a voice of hopeless agony. 'When
                         little Nan was lying dead, you said you would wait, and see what God could
                         do to me. Come near, and hear, and see. Death is nothing, boy; it will be
                         only a glory to you to die. But God is letting loose His terrors upon me;
                         He is mocking at my soul, and laughing at my calamity. Soon, soon I shall
                         be in eternity, without hope, and without God.'</t:p>
<t:p>'Oh, master, master,' exclaimed Stephen, 'there is a time yet for our Father
                         to forgive thee! It doesn't take long to forgive! It didn't take even me
                         long to forgive; and oh, how quickly God can do it if you'll only ask
                         Him!'</t:p>
<t:p>'Do you forgive me?' asked the master, in astonishment.</t:p>
<t:p>'Ah,' he cried, 'I forgave thee long since, directly after I was ill. It was
                         God who helped me; and wouldn't He rather forgive thee Himself? Oh, He
                         loves thee! He taught me how to love thee; and could He do that if He
                         didn't love thee His own self?'</t:p>
<t:p>'If I could only believe in being forgiven!' said the dying man.</t:p>
<t:p>'Oh, believe it, dear master! See, I am here; I have forgiven thee, and I do
                         love thee. Little Nan can never come back, and yet I love thee, and forgive
                         thee from my very heart. Will not Jesus much more forgive thee?'</t:p>
<t:p>'Pray for me, Stephen. Kneel down there, and pray aloud,' he said; and his
                         eyelids closed feebly, and his restless head lay still, as if he had no
                         more power to move it.</t:p>
<t:p>'I cannot,' answered Stephen; 'I'm only a poor lad, and I don't know how to
                         do it up loud. Miss Anne will pray for thee.'</t:p>
<t:p>'If you have forgiven me, pray to God for me,' murmured the master, opening
                         his eyes again with a look of deep entreaty. Over Stephen's pale face a
                         smile was kindling, a smile of pure, intense love and faith, and the light
                         in his pitying eyes met the master's dying gaze with a gleam of
                         strengthening hope. He clasped the cold hand in both his own, and, kneeling
                         down beside him, he prayed from his very soul, 'Lord, lay not this sin to
                         his charge.'</t:p>
<t:p>He could say no more; and Miss Anne, who knelt by him, was silent, except
                         that one sob burst from her lips. The master stirred no more, but lay
                         still, with his numb and paralyzed hand in Stephen's clasp; but in a few
                         minutes he uttered these words, in a tone of mingled entreaty and
                         assertion, 'God be merciful to me a sinner!'</t:p>
<t:p>That was all. An hour or two afterwards it was known throughout Longville,
                         and the news was on the way to Botfield, that the master of Botfield works
                         was dead.</t:p>
