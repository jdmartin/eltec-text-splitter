<t:head>CHAPTER IX.</t:head>
<t:head>HOMELESS.</t:head>
<t:p>Of course Stephen's brief term of favour with Black Thompson was at an end;
                         but whether Miss Anne had given him a hint that the boy was under her
                         protection, and had confessed all to her, or because he might be busy in
                         some deeper scheme of wickedness, he did not display as much anger as
                         Stephen expected, when he refused to show him the haunts of the grouse, or
                         go with him again on a poaching expedition. Stephen was more humble and
                         vigilant than he had been before falling into temptation. He set a close
                         watch upon himself, lest he should be betrayed into a self-confident spirit
                         again; and Tim's loud praises sounded less pleasantly in his ears, so that
                         one evening he told him, with much shame, into what sin he had been led by
                         his desire to avenge Snip's murder. Unfortunately, this disclosure so much
                         heightened Tim's estimation of his character, that from time to time he
                         gave utterance to mysterious hints of the extraordinary courage and spirit
                         Stephen could manifest when occasion required. These praises were, however,
                         in some measure balanced by Martha's taunts and reproaches at home.</t:p>
<t:p>The shooting season had commenced, and the lord of the manor was come, with a
                         number of his friends, to shoot over the hills and plantations. He was a
                         frank, pleasant-looking gentleman, but far too grand and high for Stephen
                         to address, though he gazed wistfully at him whenever he chanced to meet
                         him on the hills. One afternoon Martha saw him and the master walking
                         towards Fern's Hollow, where the fencing-in of the green and of the coppice
                         behind the hut were being finished rapidly; and she crept with stealthy
                         steps under the hedge of the garden, until she came within earshot of them;
                         but they were just moving on, and all she heard of the conversation were
                         these words, from the lord of the manor: 'You shall have it at any rate you
                         fix, Wyley—at a peppercorn rent, if you please; but I will not sell a
                         square yard of my land out and out.' How Martha and Stephen did talk about
                         those words over and over again, and could never come to any conclusion
                         about them.</t:p>
<t:p>It was about noon on Michaelmas Day, a day which was of no note up at Fern's
                         Hollow, where there was no rent to be paid, and Martha was busily hanging
                         out clothes to dry on the gorse bushes before the house, when she saw a
                         troop of labourers coming over the brow of the hill and crossing the
                         newly-enclosed pasture. They were armed with mattocks and pickaxes; but as
                         the peaceful little cottage rose before them, with blind old Fern basking
                         in the warm sunshine, and little Nan playing quietly about the door-sill,
                         the men gathered into a little knot, and stood still with an irresolute and
                         ashamed aspect.</t:p>
<t:p>'They know nothing about it,' said William Morris; 'look at them, as easy and
                         unconcerned as lambs. I was afeared there'd be a upshot, when the master
                         were after old Fern so long. I don't half like the job; and Stephen isn't
                         here. He does look a bit like a man, and we could argy with him; but that
                         old man, and that girl—they'll take on so.'</t:p>
<t:p>'I say, Martha,' shouted a bolder-hearted man, 'hasn't the master let thee
                         know thee must turn out to-day? He wants to lay the foundation of a new
                         house, and get the walls up afore the frost comes on; and we are come to
                         pick the old place to the ground. He only told us an hour ago, or we'd have
                         seen thee was ready.'</t:p>
<t:p>'I don't believe thee; thee's only romancing,' said Martha, turning very
                         pale. 'The old place is our own, and no master has any right to it, save
                         Stephen.'</t:p>
<t:p>'It's no use wasting breath,' replied William Morris. 'The master says he's
                         bought the place from thy grandfather, lass; and he agreed to turn out by
                         noon on Michaelmas Day. Master doesn't want to be hard upon you; and he
                         says, if you've no place to turn in to, you may go to the old cabin on the
                         upper cinder-hill, till there's a cottage empty in Botfield; and we'll help
                         thee to move the things at wunst. We're to get the roof off and the walls
                         down afore nightfall.'</t:p>
<t:p>'Grandfather and little Nan!' screamed Martha; 'get into the house this
                         minute! It's no use you men coming up here on this errand. You know
                         grandfather's simple, and he hasn't sold the house; how could he? He's no
                         more sense than little Nan. No, no; you must go down to the works, and hear
                         what Stephen says. You're a pack of rascals, every one of you, and the
                         master's the biggest; and you'll all have to gnash your teeth over this
                         business some day, I reckon.'</t:p>
<t:p>By this time the old man and the child were safely within the house; and
                         Martha, springing quickly from the wicket, where she had kept the men at
                         bay, followed them in, and barred the door, before any one of the labourers
                         could thrust his shoulder in to prevent her. They held a consultation
                         together when they found that no arguments prevailed upon her to open to
                         them, to which Martha listened disdainfully through the large chinks, but
                         vouchsafed no answer.</t:p>
<t:p>'Come, come, my lass,' said William Morris soothingly; 'it's lost time and
                         strength, thee contending with the master. I don't like the business; but
                         our orders are clear, and we must obey them. Thee let us in, and we'll
                         carry the things down to the cinder-hill cabin for thee. If thee won't open
                         the door, we'll be forced to take the thatch off.'</t:p>
<t:p>'I won't,' answered Martha,—'not for the lord of the manor himself. The house
                         is ours, and I 'ware any of you to touch it. Go down to Stephen and hear
                         what he'll say. If thee takes the thatch off, thee shan't move me out.'</t:p>
<t:p>But when the old stove-pipe, through which the last breath of the household
                         fire had passed, was drawn up, and the blue sky could be seen through the
                         cloud of dust and dirt with which the hut was filled, choking the helpless
                         old man and the frightened child, Martha's courage failed her; and she went
                         out, with little Nan clinging round her, and spoke as calmly to the
                         invaders as her rising sobs would let her.</t:p>
<t:p>'You know it's grandmother's own house,' she said; 'and the lord of the manor
                         himself has no right to it. But I'll go down and fetch Stephen, if you'll
                         only wait.'</t:p>
<t:p>'We daren't wait, Martha,' answered Morris kindly; 'and it's no use, lass;
                         the master's too many for thee. But thee go down to Stephen; and we'll move
                         the things safe, as if they were our own, and put them where they'll not be
                         broken; and we'll take care of little Nan and thy poor old grandfather.
                         Tell Stephen we're desperately cut up about it ourselves; but, if we hadn't
                         done it, somebody that has no good-will towards him would have taken the
                         job. So go thy poor ways with thee, my lass; we are main sorry for thee and
                         Stephen.'</t:p>
<t:p>The hot, choking smoke from the limekiln was blowing across the works; and
                         the dusty pit-bank was covered with busy men and boys and girls, shouting,
                         laughing, singing, and swearing, when Martha arrived at Botfield. She was
                         rarely seen at the pit, for her thrifty and housewifely habits kept her
                         busy at Fern's Hollow; and the rough, loud voices of the banksmen, the
                         regular beat of the engine, the clanking of chains, and the dust and smoke
                         and heat of the almost strange scene bewildered the hillside girl. She made
                         her way to the cabin, a little hut built near the mouth of the shaft for
                         the use of the people employed about the pit; but before she could see Tim,
                         or fix upon any one to inquire about Stephen from, a girl of her own age,
                         but with a face sunburnt and blackened from her rough and unwomanly work,
                         and in an uncouth dress of sackcloth, which was grimed with coal-dust, came
                         up and peered boldly in her face.</t:p>
<t:p>'Why, it's Miss Fern!' she cried, with a loud laugh; 'Miss Fern, Esq., of
                         Fern's Hollow, come to learn us poor pit-folk scholarship and manners.
                         Here, lads! here's Mr. Stephen Fern's fine sister, as knows more nor all of
                         us put together. Give us a bit of your learning, Miss Fern.'</t:p>
<t:p>'I know a black-bess when I see one,' replied Martha sharply; and all the
                         boys and girls joined in a ready roar of merriment against Bess Thompson,
                         whose nickname was the common country name for a beetle.</t:p>
<t:p>'That'll do!' they shouted; 'she knows a black-bess! Thee's got thy answer,
                         Bess Thompson.'</t:p>
<t:p>'What's brought thee to the pit?' asked Bess fiercely; 'we want no
                         scatter-witted hill girls here, I can tell ye. So get off the pit-bank,
                         afore I drive thee off.'</t:p>
<t:p>'What's all this hullabaloo?' inquired Tim, making his appearance at the
                         cabin door. 'Why, Martha, what brings thee at the pit? Come in here, and
                         tell me what's up now.'</t:p>
<t:p>Tim listened to Martha's tearful story with great amazement and indignation;
                         and, after a few minutes' consideration, he told her he had nothing much to
                         do, and he would get leave to take Stephen's place for the rest of the day,
                         so as to set him free to go home at once. He left her standing in the
                         middle of the cabin, for the rough benches round it looked too black for
                         her to venture to take a seat upon them; and in a short time he shouted to
                         her from a skep, which was being lowered into the pit, promising her that
                         Stephen should come up as soon as possible. It seemed a terribly long time
                         to wait amid that noise and dust, and every now and then Black Bess
                         relieved her feelings by making hideous grimaces at her when she passed the
                         cabin door; but Stephen ascended at last, very stern-looking and silent,
                         for Tim had told him Martha's business; and he hurried her away from the
                         pit-bank before he would listen to the detailed account she was longing to
                         give. Even when they were in the lonely lane leading homewards, and she was
                         talking and sobbing herself out of breath, he walked on without a word
                         passing his lips, though his heart was sending up ceaseless prayers to God
                         for help to bear this trial with patience. Poor old home! There was all the
                         well-used household furniture carried out and heaped together on the
                         turf,—chairs and tables and beds,—looking so differently to what they did
                         when arranged in their proper order. The old man, with his grey head
                         uncovered, was wandering to and fro in sore bewilderment; and little Nan
                         had fallen asleep beside the furniture, with the trace of tears upon her
                         rosy cheeks. But the house was almost gone. The door-sill, where Stephen
                         had so often seen the sun go down as he rested himself from his labours,
                         was already taken up; the old grate, round which they had sat all the
                         winter nights that he had ever known, was pulled out of the rock; and all
                         the floor was open to the mocking sunshine. It is a mournful thing to see
                         one's own home in ruins; and a tear or two made a white channel down the
                         coal-dust on Stephen's cheeks; but he subdued himself, and spoke out to the
                         labourers like a man.</t:p>
<t:p>'I know it's not your fault,' he said, as they stood round him, making
                         explanations and excuses; 'but you know grandfather could not sell the
                         place. I'll get you to help me carry the things down to the cinder-hill
                         cabin. The sheep and ponies are coming down the hill, and there'll be rain
                         afore long; and it's not fit for grandfather and little Nan to be out in
                         it. You'll spare time from the work for that?'</t:p>
<t:p>'Ay, will we!' cried the men heartily; and, submitting kindly to Stephen's
                         quiet directions, they were soon laden with the household goods, which were
                         scanty and easily removed. Two or three journeys were sufficient to take
                         them all; and when the labourers returned for the last time to their work
                         of destruction, Stephen took little Nan in his arms, and Martha led away
                         the old man; while the sound of the pickaxes and the crash of the rough
                         rubble stones of their old home followed their slow and lingering steps
                         over the new pasture, and down the hillside towards Botfield.</t:p>
