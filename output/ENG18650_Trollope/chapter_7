<head>CHAPTER VII. Aunt Greenow.  </head>
<p>Kate Vavasor remained only three days in London before she started for Yarmouth; and during
      those three days she was not much with her cousin. "I'm my aunt's, body and soul, for the next
      six weeks," she said to Alice, when she did come to Queen Anne Street on the morning after her
      arrival. "And she is exigeant in a manner I can't at all explain to you. You mustn't be
      surprised if I don't even write a line. I've escaped by stealth now. She went up-stairs to try
      on some new weeds for the seaside, and then I bolted." She did not say a word about George;
      nor during those three days, nor for some days afterwards, did George show himself. As it
      turned out afterwards, he had gone off to Scotland, and had remained a week among the grouse.
      Thus, at least, he had accounted for himself and his movements; but all George Vavasor's
      friends knew that his goings out and comings in were seldom accounted for openly like those of
      other men.</p>
<p>It will perhaps be as well to say a few words about Mrs. Greenow before we go with her to
      Yarmouth. Mrs. Greenow was the only daughter and the youngest child of the old squire at
      Vavasor Hall. She was just ten years younger than her brother John, and I am inclined to think
      that she was almost justified in her repeated assertion that the difference was much greater
      than ten years, by the freshness of her colour, and by the general juvenility of her
      appearance. She certainly did not look forty, and who can expect a woman to proclaim herself
      to be older than her looks? In early life she had been taken from her father's house, and had
      lived with relatives in one of the large towns in the north of England. It is certain she had
      not been quite successful as a girl. Though she had enjoyed the name of being a beauty, she
      had not the usual success which comes from such repute. At thirty-four she was still
      unmarried. She had, moreover, acquired the character of being a flirt; and I fear that the
      stories which were told of her, though doubtless more than half false, had in them sufficient
      of truth to justify the character. Now this was very sad, seeing that Arabella Vavasor had no
      fortune, and that she had offended her father and brothers by declining to comply with their
      advice at certain periods of her career. There was, indeed, considerable trouble in the minds
      of the various male Vavasors with reference to Arabella, when tidings suddenly reached the
      Hall that she was going to be married to an old man.</p>
<p>She was married to the old man; and the marriage fortunately turned out satisfactorily, at
      any rate for the old man and for her family. The Vavasors were relieved from all further
      trouble, and were as much surprised as gratified when they heard that she did her duty well in
      her new position. Arabella had long been a thorn in their side, never having really done
      anything which they could pronounce to be absolutely wrong, but always giving them cause for
      fear. Now they feared no longer. Her husband was a retired merchant, very rich, not very
      strong in health, and devoted to his bride. Rumours soon made their way to Vavasor Hall, and
      to Queen Anne Street, that Mrs. Greenow was quite a pattern wife, and that Mr. Greenow
      considered himself to be the happiest old man in Lancashire. And now in her prosperity she
      quite forgave the former slights which had been put upon her by her relatives. She wrote to
      her dear niece Alice, and to her dearest niece Kate, and sent little presents to her father.
      On one occasion she took her husband to Vavasor Hall, and there was a regular renewal of all
      the old family feelings. Arabella's husband was an old man, and was very old for his age; but
      the whole thing was quite respectable, and there was, at any rate, no doubt about the money.
      Then Mr. Greenow died; and the widow, having proved the will, came up to London and claimed
      the commiseration of her nieces.</p>
<p>"Why not go to Yarmouth with her for a month?" George had said to Kate. "Of course it will
      be a bore. But an aunt with forty thousand pounds has a right to claim attention." Kate
      acknowledged the truth of the argument and agreed to go to Yarmouth for a month. "Your aunt
      Arabella has shown herself to be a very sensible woman," the old squire had written; "much
      more sensible than anybody thought her before her marriage. Of course you should go with her
      if she asks you." What aunt, uncle, or cousin, in the uncontrolled possession of forty
      thousand pounds was ever unpopular in the family?</p>
<p>Yarmouth is not a very prepossessing place to the eye. To my eye, at any rate, it is not so.
      There is an old town with which summer visitors have little or nothing to do; and there are
      the new houses down by the sea-side, to which, at any rate, belongs the full advantage of sea
      air. A kind of esplanade runs for nearly a mile along the sands, and there are built, or in
      the course of building, rows of houses appropriated to summer visitors all looking out upon
      the sea. There is no beauty unless the yellow sandy sea can be called beautiful. The coast is
      low and straight, and the east wind blows full upon it. But the place is healthy; and Mrs.
      Greenow was probably right in thinking that she might there revive some portion of the health
      which she had lost in watching beside the couch of her departing lord.</p>
<p>"Omnibus;—no, indeed. Jeannette, get me a fly." These were the first words Mrs. Greenow
      spoke as she put her foot upon the platform at the Yarmouth station. Her maid's name was
      Jenny; but Kate had already found, somewhat to her dismay, that orders had been issued before
      they left London that the girl was henceforth to be called Jeannette. Kate had also already
      found that her aunt could be imperious; but this taste for masterdom had not shown itself so
      plainly in London as it did from the moment that the train had left the station at Shoreditch.
      In London Mrs. Greenow had been among Londoners, and her career had hitherto been provincial.
      Her spirit, no doubt, had been somewhat cowed by the novelty of her position. But when she
      felt herself to be once beyond the stones as the saying used to be, she was herself again; and
      at Ipswich she had ordered Jeannette to get her a glass of sherry with an air which had
      created a good deal of attention among the guards and porters.</p>
<p>The fly was procured; and with considerable exertion all Mrs. Greenow's boxes, together with
      the more moderate belongings of her niece and maid, were stowed on the top of it, round upon
      the driver's body on the coach box, on the maid's lap, and I fear in Kate's also, and upon the
      vacant seat.</p>
<p>"The large house in Montpelier Parade," said Mrs. Greenow.</p>
<p>"They is all large, ma'am," said the driver.</p>
<p>"The largest," said Mrs. Greenow.</p>
<p>"They're much of a muchness," said the driver.</p>
<p>"Then Mrs. Jones's," said Mrs. Greenow. "But I was particularly told it was the largest in
      the row."</p>
<p>"I know Mrs. Jones's well," said the driver, and away they went.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones's house was handsome and comfortable; but I fear Mrs. Greenow's satisfaction in
      this respect was impaired by her disappointment in finding that it was not perceptibly bigger
      than those to the right and left of her. Her ambition in this and in other similar matters
      would have amused Kate greatly had she been a bystander, and not one of her aunt's party. Mrs.
      Greenow was good-natured, liberal, and not by nature selfish; but she was determined not to
      waste the good things which fortune had given, and desired that all the world should see that
      she had forty thousand pounds of her own. And in doing this she was repressed by no feeling of
      false shame. She never hesitated in her demands through bashfulness. She called aloud for such
      comfort and grandeur as Yarmouth could afford her, and was well pleased that all around should
      hear her calling. Joined to all this was her uncontrolled grief for her husband's death.</p>
<p>"Dear Greenow! sweet lamb! Oh, Kate, if you'd only known that man!" When she said this she
      was sitting in the best of Mrs. Jones's sitting-rooms, waiting to have dinner announced. She
      had taken a drawing-room and dining-room, "because," as she had said, "she didn't see why
      people should be stuffy when they went to the seaside;—not if they had means to make
      themselves comfortable."</p>
<p>"Oh, Kate, I do wish you'd known him!"</p>
<p>"I wish I had," said Kate,—very untruly. "I was unfortunately away when he went to Vavasor
      Hall."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes; but it was at home, in the domestic circle, that Greenow should have been seen to
      be appreciated. I was a happy woman, Kate, while that lasted." And Kate was surprised to see
      that real tears—one or two on each side—were making their way down her aunt's cheeks. But they
      were soon checked with a handkerchief of the broadest hem and of the finest cambric.</p>
<p>"Dinner, ma'am," said Jeannette, opening the door.</p>
<p>"Jeannette, I told you always to say that dinner was served."</p>
<p>"Dinner's served then," said Jeannette in a tone of anger.</p>
<p>"Come, Kate," said her aunt. "I've but little appetite myself, but there's no reason you
      shouldn't eat your dinner. I specially wrote to Mrs. Jones to have some sweetbread. I do hope
      she's got a decent cook. It's very little I eat myself, but I do like to see things nice."</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday; and it was beautiful to see how Mrs. Greenow went to church in all
      the glory of widowhood. There had been a great unpacking after that banquet on the sweetbread,
      and all her funereal millinery had been displayed before Kate's wondering eyes. The charm of
      the woman was in this,—that she was not in the least ashamed of anything that she did. She
      turned over all her wardrobe of mourning, showing the richness of each article, the stiffness
      of the crape, the fineness of the cambric, the breadth of the frills,—telling the price of
      each to a shilling, while she explained how the whole had been amassed without any
      consideration of expense. This she did with all the pride of a young bride when she shows the
      glories of her trousseau to the friend of her bosom. Jeannette stood by the while, removing
      one thing and exhibiting another. Now and again through the performance, Mrs. Greenow would
      rest a while from her employment, and address the shade of the departed one in terms of most
      endearing affection. In the midst of this Mrs. Jones came in; but the widow was not a whit
      abashed by the presence of the stranger. "Peace be to his manes!" she said at last, as she
      carefully folded up a huge black crape mantilla. She made, however, but one syllable of the
      classical word, and Mrs. Jones thought that her lodger had addressed herself to the mortal
      "remains" of her deceased lord.</p>
<gap n="ill07" unit="graphic"/>
<p>"He is left her uncommon well off, I suppose," said Mrs. Jones to Jeannette.</p>
<p>"You may say that, ma'am. It's more nor a hundred thousand of pounds!"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Pounds of sterling, ma'am! Indeed it is;—to my knowledge."</p>
<p>"Why don't she have a carriage?"</p>
<p>"So she do;—but a lady can't bring her carriage down to the sea when she's only just buried
      her husband as one may say. What'd folks say if they saw her in her own carriage? But it ain't
      because she can't afford it, Mrs. Jones. And now we're talking of it you must order a fly for
      church to-morrow, that'll look private, you know. She said I was to get a man that had a
      livery coat and gloves."</p>
<p>The man with the coat and gloves was procured; and Mrs. Greenow's entry into church made
      quite a sensation. There was a thoughtfulness about her which alone showed that she was a
      woman of no ordinary power. She foresaw all necessities, and made provision for all
      emergencies. Another would not have secured an eligible sitting, and been at home in Yarmouth
      church, till half the period of her sojourn there was over. But Mrs. Greenow had done it all.
      She walked up the middle aisle with as much self-possession as though the chancel had belonged
      to her family for years; and the respectable pew-opener absolutely deserted two or three old
      ladies whom she was attending, to show Mrs. Greenow into her seat. When seated, she was the
      cynosure of all eyes. Kate Vavasor became immediately aware that a great sensation had been
      occasioned by their entrance, and equally aware that none of it was due to her. I regret to
      say that this feeling continued to show itself throughout the whole service. How many ladies
      of forty go to church without attracting the least attention! But it is hardly too much to say
      that every person in that church had looked at Mrs. Greenow. I doubt if there was present
      there a single married lady who, on leaving the building, did not speak to her husband of the
      widow. There had prevailed during the whole two hours a general though unexpressed conviction
      that something worthy of remark had happened that morning. It had an effect even upon the
      curate's reading; and the incumbent, while preaching his sermon, could not keep his eyes off
      that wonderful bonnet and veil.</p>
<p>On the next morning, before eleven, Mrs. Greenow's name was put down at the Assembly Room.
      "I need hardly say that in my present condition I care nothing for these things. Of course I
      would sooner be alone. But, my dear Kate, I know what I owe to you."</p>
<p>Kate, with less intelligence than might have been expected from one so clever, began to
      assure her aunt that she required no society; and that, coming thus with her to the seaside in
      the early days of her widowhood, she had been well aware that they would live retired. But
      Mrs. Greenow soon put her down, and did so without the slightest feeling of shame or annoyance
      on her own part. "My dear," she said, "in this matter you must let me do what I know to be
      right. I should consider myself to be very selfish if I allowed my grief to interfere with
      your amusements."</p>
<p>"But, aunt, I don't care for such amusements."</p>
<p>"That's nonsense, my dear. You ought to care for them. How are you to settle yourself in
      life if you don't care for them?"</p>
<p>"My dear aunt, I am settled."</p>
<p>"Settled!" said Mrs. Greenow, astounded, as though there must have been some hidden marriage
      of which she had not heard. "But that's nonsense. Of course you're not settled; and how are
      you to be, if I allow you to shut yourself up in such a place as this,—just where a girl has a
      chance?"</p>
<p>It was in vain that Kate tried to stop her. It was not easy to stop Mrs. Greenow when she
      was supported by the full assurance of being mistress of the place and of the occasion. "No,
      my dear; I know very well what I owe to you, and I shall do my duty. As I said before, society
      can have no charms now for such a one as I am. All that social intercourse could ever do for
      me lies buried in my darling's grave. My heart is desolate, and must remain so. But I'm not
      going to immolate you on the altars of my grief. I shall force myself to go out for your sake,
      Kate."</p>
<p>"But, dear aunt, the world will think it so odd, just at present."</p>
<p>"I don't care twopence for the world. What can the world do to me? I'm not dependent on the
      world,—thanks to the care of that sainted lamb. I can hold my own; and as long as I can do
      that the world won't hurt me. No, Kate, if I think a thing's right I shall do it. I mean to
      make the place pleasant for you if I can, and the world may object if it likes."</p>
<p>Mrs. Greenow was probably right in her appreciation of the value of her independence.
      Remarks may perhaps have been made by the world of Yarmouth as to her early return to society.
      People, no doubt, did remind each other that old Greenow was hardly yet four months buried.
      Mrs. Jones and Jeannette probably had their little jokes down-stairs. But this did not hurt
      Mrs. Greenow. What was said, was not said in her hearing, Mrs. Jones's bills were paid every
      Saturday with admirable punctuality; and as long as this was done everybody about the house
      treated the lady with that deference which was due to the respectability of her possessions.
      When a recently bereaved widow attempts to enjoy her freedom without money, then it behoves
      the world to speak aloud;—and the world does its duty.</p>
<p>Numerous people came to call at Montpelier Parade, and Kate was astonished to find that her
      aunt had so many friends. She was indeed so bewildered by these strangers that she could
      hardly ascertain whom her aunt had really known before, and whom she now saw for the first
      time. Somebody had known somebody who had known somebody else, and that was allowed to be a
      sufficient introduction,—always presuming that the existing somebody was backed by some known
      advantages of money or position. Mrs. Greenow could smile from beneath her widow's cap in a
      most bewitching way. "Upon my word then she is really handsome," Kate wrote one day to Alice.
      But she could also frown, and knew well how to put aside, or, if need be, to reprobate any
      attempt at familiarity from those whose worldly circumstances were supposed to be
      disadvantageous.</p>
<p>"My dear aunt," said Kate one morning after their walk upon the pier, "how you did snub that
      Captain Bellfield!"</p>
<p>"Captain Bellfield, indeed! I don't believe he's a captain at all. At any rate he has sold
      out, and the tradesmen have had a scramble for the money. He was only a lieutenant when the
      97th were in Manchester, and I'm sure he's never had a shilling to purchase since that."</p>
<p>"But everybody here seems to know him."</p>
<p>"Perhaps they do not know so much of him as I do. The idea of his having the impudence to
      tell me I was looking very well! Nothing can be so mean as men who go about in that way when
      they haven't money enough in their pockets to pay their washerwomen."</p>
<p>"But how do you know, aunt, that Captain Bellfield hasn't paid his washerwoman?"</p>
<p>"I know more than you think, my dear. It's my business. How could I tell whose attentions
      you should receive and whose you shouldn't, if I didn't inquire into these things?"</p>
<p>It was in vain that Kate rebelled, or attempted to rebel against this more than maternal
      care. She told her aunt that she was now nearly thirty, and that she had managed her own
      affairs, at any rate with safety, for the last ten years;—but it was to no purpose. Kate would
      get angry; but Mrs. Greenow never became angry. Kate would be quite in earnest; but Mrs.
      Greenow would push aside all that her niece said as though it were worth nothing. Kate was an
      unmarried woman with a very small fortune, and therefore, of course, was desirous of being
      married with as little delay as possible. It was natural that she should deny that it was so,
      especially at this early date in their mutual acquaintance. When the niece came to know her
      aunt more intimately, there might be confidence between them, and then they would do better.
      But Mrs. Greenow would spare neither herself nor her purse on Kate's behalf, and she would be
      a dragon of watchfulness in protecting her from the evil desires of such useless men as
      Captain Bellfield.</p>
<p>"I declare, Kate, I don't understand you," she said one morning to her niece as they sat
      together over a late breakfast. They had fallen into luxurious habits, and I am afraid it was
      past eleven o'clock, although the breakfast things were still on the table. Kate would usually
      bathe before breakfast, but Mrs. Greenow was never out of her room till half-past ten. "I like
      the morning for contemplation," she once said. "When a woman has gone through all that I have
      suffered she has a great deal to think of." "And it is so much more comfortable to be
      a-thinking when one's in bed," said Jeannette, who was present at the time. "Child, hold your
      tongue," said the widow. "Yes, ma'am," said Jeannette. But we'll return to the scene at the
      breakfast-table.</p>
<p>"What don't you understand, aunt?"</p>
<p>"You only danced twice last night, and once you stood up with Captain Bellfield."</p>
<p>"On purpose to ask after that poor woman who washes his clothes without getting paid for
      it."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, Kate; you didn't ask him anything of the kind, I'm sure. It's very provoking. It
      is indeed."</p>
<p>"But what harm can Captain Bellfield do me?"</p>
<p>"What good can he do you? That's the question. You see, my dear, years will go by. I don't
      mean to say you ain't quite as young as ever you were, and nothing can be nicer and fresher
      than you are;—especially since you took to bathing."</p>
<p>"Oh, aunt, don't!"</p>
<p>"My dear, the truth must be spoken. I declare I don't think I ever saw a young woman so
      improvident as you are. When are you to begin to think about getting married if you don't do
      it now?"</p>
<p>"I shall never begin to think about it, till I buy my wedding clothes."</p>
<p>"That's nonsense,—sheer nonsense. How are you to get wedding clothes if you have never
      thought about getting a husband? Didn't I see Mr.. Cheesacre ask you for a dance last
      night?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he did; while you were talking to Captain Bellfield yourself, aunt."</p>
<p>"Captain Bellfield can't hurt me, my dear. And why didn't you dance with Mr. Cheesacre?"</p>
<p>"He's a fat Norfolk farmer, with not an idea beyond the virtues of stall-feeding."</p>
<p>"My dear, every acre of it is his own land,—every acre! And he bought another farm for
      thirteen thousand pounds only last autumn. They're better than the squires,—some of those
      gentlemen farmers; they are indeed. And of all men in the world they're the easiest
      managed."</p>
<p>"That's a recommendation, no doubt."</p>
<p>"Of course it is;—a great recommendation."</p>
<p>Mrs. Greenow had no idea of joking when her mind was intent on serious things. "He's to take
      us to the picnic to-morrow, and I do hope you'll manage to let him sit beside you. It'll be
      the place of honour, because he gives all the wine. He's picked up with that man Bellfield,
      and he's to be there; but if you allow your name to be once mixed up with his, it will be all
      over with you as far as Yarmouth is concerned."</p>
<p>"I don't at all want to be mixed up with Captain Bellfield, as you call it," said Kate. Then
      she subsided into her novel, while Mrs. Greenow busied herself about the good things for the
      picnic. In truth, the aunt did not understand the niece. Whatsoever might be the faults of
      Kate Vavasor, an unmaidenly desire of catching a husband for herself was certainly not one of
      them.</p>
