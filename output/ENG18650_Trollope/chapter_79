<head>CHAPTER LXXIX. Diamonds Are Diamonds.  </head>
<p>Kate and Alice, as they drew near to their journey's end, were both a little flurried, and I
      cannot but own that there was cause for nervousness. Kate Vavasor was to meet Mr. Grey for the
      first time. Mr. Grey was now staying at Matching and was to remain there until a week of his
      marriage. He was then to return to Cambridgeshire for a day or two, and after that was to
      become a guest at the rector's house at Matching the evening before the ceremony. "Why not let
      him come here at once?" Lady Glencora had said to her husband. "It is such nonsense, you
      know." But Mr. Palliser would not hear of it. Mr. Palliser, though a Radical in public life,
      would not for worlds transgress the social laws of his ancestors; and so the matter was
      settled. Kate on this very day of her arrival at Matching would thus see Mr. Grey for the
      first time, and she could not but feel that she had been the means of doing Mr. Grey much
      injury. She had moreover something,—not much indeed, but still something,—of that feeling
      which made the Pallisers terrible to the imagination, because of their rank and wealth. She
      was a little afraid of the Pallisers, but of Mr. Grey she was very much afraid. And Alice also
      was not at her ease. She would fain have prevented so very quick a marriage had she not felt
      that now,—after all the trouble that she had caused,—there was nothing left for her but to do
      as others wished. When a day had been named she had hardly dared to demur, and had allowed
      Lady Glencora to settle everything as she had wished. But it was not only the suddenness of
      her marriage which dismayed her. Its nature and attributes were terrible to her. Both Lady
      Midlothian and the Marchioness of Auld Reekie were coming. When this was told to her by letter
      she had no means of escape. "Lady Macleod is right in nearly all that she says," Lady Glencora
      had written to her. "At any rate, you needn't be such a fool as to run away from your cousins,
      simply because they have handles to their names. You must take the thing as it comes." Lady
      Glencora, moreover, had settled for her the list of bridesmaids. Alice had made a petition
      that she might be allowed to go through the ceremony with only one,—with none but Kate to back
      her. But she ought to have known that when she consented to be married at Matching,—and indeed
      she had had very little power of resisting that proposition,—all such questions would be
      decided for her. Two daughters therefore of Lady Midlothian were to act, Lady Jane and Lady
      Mary, and the one daughter of the Marchioness, who was also a Lady Jane, and there were to be
      two Miss Howards down from London,—girls who were known both to Alice and to Lady Glencora,
      and who were in some distant way connected with them both. A great attempt was made to induce
      the two Miss Pallisers to join the bevy, but they had frankly pleaded their age. "No woman
      should stand up as a bridesmaid," said the strong-minded Sophy, "who doesn't mean to get
      married if she can. Now I don't mean to get married, and I won't put myself among the young
      people." Lady Glencora was therefore obliged to submit to do the work with only six. But she
      swore that they should be very smart. She was to give all the dresses, and Mr. Palliser was to
      give a brooch and an armlet to each. "She is the only person in the world I want to pet,
      except yourself," Lady Glencora had said to her husband, and he had answered by giving her
       <hi>carte blanche</hi> as regards expense.</p>
<gap n="ill79" unit="graphic"/>
<p>All this was very terrible to Kate, who had not much feminine taste for finery. Of the dress
      she had heard,—of the dress which was waiting at Matching to be made up after her
      arrival,—though as yet she knew nothing of the trinkets. There are many girls who could submit
      themselves at a moment to the kindness of such a woman as Lady Glencora. Perhaps most girls
      would do so, for of all such women in the world, Lady Glencora was the least inclined to
      patronize or to be condescending in her kindnesses. But Kate Vavasor was one to whom such
      submission would not come easily.</p>
<p>"I wish I was out of this boat," she said to Alice in the train.</p>
<p>"So that I might be shipwrecked alone!"</p>
<p>"No; there can be no shipwreck to you. When the day of action comes you will be taken away,
      up to heaven, upon the clouds. But what are they to do with me?"</p>
<p>"You'll find that Glencora will not desert you. You can't conceive what taste she has."</p>
<p>"I'd sooner be bridesmaid to Charlie Fairstairs. I would indeed. My place in the world is
      not among Cabinet Ministers and old countesses."</p>
<p>"Nor mine."</p>
<p>"Yes; it seems that yours is to be there. They are your cousins, and you have made at any
      rate one great friend among them,—one who is to be the biggest of them all."</p>
<p>"And you are going to throw me over, Kate?"</p>
<p>"To tell the truth, Alice, I sometimes think you had better throw me over. I know it would
      be sad,—sad for both, but perhaps it would be better. I have done you much harm and no good;
      and now where I am going I shall disgrace you." She talked even of getting out at some station
      and returning, and would have done so had not Alice made it impossible. As it was, the evening
      found her and Alice together entering the park-gate at Matching, in Lady Glencora's carriage.
      Lady Glencora had sent a note to the station. "She could not come herself," she said, "because
      Mr. Palliser was a little fussy. You'll understand, dear, but don't say a word." Alice didn't
      say a word, having been very anxious not to lower Mr. Palliser in her cousin's respect.</p>
<p>None of the Lady Janes and Lady Marys were at Matching when they arrived. Indeed, there was
      no guest there but Mr. Grey, for which Kate felt herself to be extremely grateful. Mr. Grey
      came into the hall, standing behind Mr. Palliser, who stood behind his wife. Alice passed by
      them both, and was at once in her lover's arms. "Then I must introduce myself," said Lady
      Glencora to Kate, "and my husband also." This she did, and no woman in England could have
      excelled her in the manner of doing it. "I have heard so much about you," said she, still
      keeping Kate's hand, "and I know how good you've been;—and how wicked you have been," she
      added in a whisper. Then Mr. Grey was brought up to her, and they were introduced. It was not
      till some days had passed over them that she felt herself at all at her ease with Mr. Grey,
      and I doubt whether she ever reached that point with Mr. Palliser; but Lady Glencora she knew,
      and liked, and almost loved, from the first moment of their meeting.</p>
<p>"Have you heard the news?" said Lady Glencora to Alice, the first minute that they were
      alone. Alice, of course, had not heard the news. "Mr. Bott is going to marry Mrs. Marsham.
      There is such a row about it. Plantagenet is nearly mad. I never knew him so disgusted in my
      life. Of course I don't dare to tell him so, but I am so heartily rejoiced. You know how I
      love them both, and I could not possibly wish any better reward for either." Alice, who had
      personally known more of Mr. Bott than of Mrs. Marsham, said that she couldn't but be sorry
      for the lady. "She's old enough to be his mother," said Lady Glencora, "otherwise I really
      don't know any people better suited to each other. The best is, that Mr. Bott is doing it to
      regain his footing with Mr. Palliser! I am sure of that;—and Plantagenet will never speak to
      him again. But, Alice, there is other news."</p>
<p>"What other news?"</p>
<p>"It is hardly news yet, and of course I am very wicked to tell you. But I feel sure Mr. Grey
      knows all about it, and if I didn't tell, he would."</p>
<p>"He hasn't told me anything yet."</p>
<p>"He hasn't had time; and when he does, you mustn't pretend to know. I believe Mr. Palliser
      will certainly be Chancellor of the Exchequer before next month, and, if so, he'll never come
      in for Silverbridge again."</p>
<p>"But he'll be in Parliament; will he not?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; he'll be in Parliament. I don't understand all about it. There is a man going out
      for the county,—for Barsetshire,—some man whom the Duke used to favour, and he wants
      Plantagenet to come in for that. I can't understand what difference it makes."</p>
<p>"But he will be in the Cabinet?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. But who do you suppose is to be the new Member for Silverbridge?"</p>
<p>"I can't guess," said Alice. Though, of course, she did guess.</p>
<p>"Mind, I don't know it. He has never told me. But he told me that he had been with the Duke,
      and asked the Duke to let Jeffrey have the seat. The Duke became as black as thunder, and said
      that Jeffrey had no fortune. In short, he wouldn't hear of it. Poor Jeffrey! we must try to do
      something for him, but I really don't know how. Then the Duke said, that Plantagenet should
      put in for Silverbridge some friend who would support himself; and I fancy,—mind it's only
      fancy,—but I fancy that Plantagenet mentioned to his Grace—one Mr. Grey."</p>
<p>"Oh, Glencora!"</p>
<p>"They've been talking together till sometimes I think Mr. Grey is worse than Plantagenet.
      When Mr. Grey began to say something the other night in the drawing-room about sugar, I knew
      it was all up with you. He'll be a financial Secretary; you see if he isn't; or a lord of
      something, or an under-somebody of State; and then some day he'll go mad, either because he
      does or because he doesn't get into the Cabinet." Lady Glencora, as she said all this, knew
      well that the news she was giving would please her cousin better than any other tidings that
      could be told.</p>
<p>By degrees the guests came. The two Miss Howards were the first, and they expressed
      themselves as delighted with Lady Glencora's taste and with Mr. Palliser's munificence,—for at
      that time the brooches and armlets had been produced. Kate had said very little about these
      matters, but the Miss Howards were loud in their thanks. But they were good-humoured, merry
      girls, and the house was pleasanter after their arrival than it had been before. Then came the
      dreaded personage,—the guest,—Lady Midlothian! On the subject of Lady Midlothian Kate had
      really become curious. She had a real desire to see the face and gait of the woman, and to
      hear her voice. Lady Midlothian came, and with her came Lady Jane and Lady Mary. I am by no
      means sure that Lady Jane and Lady Mary were not nearly as old as the two Miss Pallisers; but
      they were not probably so fully resolved as to the condition of their future modes of living
      as were those two ladies, and if so, they were not wrong to shine as bridesmaids. With them
      Alice had made some slight acquaintance during the last spring in London, and as they were now
      to attend upon her as the bride they were sufficiently gracious. To Kate, too, they were civil
      enough, and things, in public, went on very pleasantly at Matching.</p>
<p>A scene there was, of course, between Alice and Lady Midlothian;—a scene in private. "You
      must go through it," Lady Glencora had said, with jocose mournfulness; "and why should you not
      let her jump upon you a little? It can't hurt you now."</p>
<p>"But I don't like people to jump upon me," Alice said.</p>
<p>"And why are you to have everything just as you like it? You are so unreasonable. Think how
      I've been jumped on! Think what I have borne from them! If you knew the things she used to say
      to me, you would not be such a coward. I was sent down to her for a week, and had no power of
      helping myself. And the Marchioness used to be sent for to look at me, for she never talks.
      She used to look at me, and groan, and hold up her hands till I hated her the worst of the
      two. Think what they did to me, and yet they are my dear friends now. Why should you escape
      altogether?"</p>
<p>Alice could not escape altogether, and therefore was closeted with Lady Midlothian for the
      best part of an hour. "Did Lady Macleod read to you what I wrote?" the Countess asked.</p>
<p>"Yes,—that is, she gave me the letter to read."</p>
<p>"And I hope you understand me, Alice?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I suppose so."</p>
<p>"You suppose so, my dear! If you only suppose so I shall not be contented. I want you to
      appreciate my feelings towards you thoroughly. I want you to know that I am most anxious as to
      your future life, and that I am thoroughly satisfied with the step you are now taking." The
      Countess paused, but Alice said nothing. Her tongue was itching to tell the old woman that she
      cared nothing for this expression of satisfaction; but she was aware that she had done much
      that was deserving of punishment, and resolved to take this as part of her penance. She was
      being jumped upon, and it was unpleasant; but, after all that had happened, it was only
      fitting that she should undergo much unpleasantness. "Thoroughly satisfied," continued the
      Countess; "and now, I only wish to refer, in the slightest manner possible, to what took place
      between us when we were both of us under this roof last winter."</p>
<p>"Why refer to it at all, Lady Midlothian?"</p>
<p>"Because I think it may do good, and because I cannot make you understand that I have
      thoroughly forgiven everything, unless I tell you that I have forgiven that also. On that
      occasion I had come all the way from Scotland on purpose to say a few words to you."</p>
<p>"I am so sorry that you should have had the trouble."</p>
<p>"I do not regret it, Alice. I never do regret doing anything which I believe to have been my
      duty. There is no knowing how far what I said then may have operated for good." Alice thought
      that she knew very well, but she said nothing. "I must confess that what I then understood to
      be your obstinacy,—and I must say also, if I tell the truth, your indifference to—to—to all
      prudential considerations whatever, not to talk of appearances and decorum, and I might say,
      anything like a high line of duty or moral conduct,—shocked me very much. It did, indeed, my
      dear. Taking it altogether, I don't know that I was ever more shocked in my life. The thing
      was so inscrutable!" Here Lady Midlothian held up one hand in a manner that was truly
      imposing; "so inscrutable! But that is all over now. What was personally offensive to myself I
      could easily forgive, and I do forgive it. I shall never think of it any more." Here Lady
      Midlothian put up both her hands gently, as though wafting the injury away into the air. "But
      what I wish specially to say to you is this; your own conduct is forgiven also!" Here she
      paused again, and Alice winced. Who was this dreadful old Countess;—what was the Countess to
      her, that she should be thus tormented with the old woman's forgiveness? John Grey had
      forgiven her, and of external forgiveness that was enough. She had not forgiven herself,—would
      never forgive herself altogether; and the pardon of no old woman in England could assist her
      in doing so. She had sinned, but she had not sinned against Lady Midlothian. "Let her jump
      upon you, and have done with it," Lady Glencora had said. She had resolved that it should be
      so, but it was very hard to keep her resolution.</p>
<p>"The Marchioness and I have talked it over," continued Lady Midlothian, "and she has asked
      me to speak for both her and myself." There is comfort at any rate in that, thought Alice, who
      had never yet seen the Marchioness. "We have resolved that all those little mistakes should be
      as though they had never been committed. We shall both be most happy to receive you and your
      husband, who is, I must say, one of the most gentlemanlike looking men I ever saw. It seems
      that he and Mr. Palliser are on most friendly,—I may say, most confidential terms, and that
      must be quite a pleasure to you."</p>
<p>"It's a pleasure to him, which is more to the purpose," said Alice.</p>
<p>"Exactly so. And now, my dear, everything is forgiven and shall be forgotten. Come and give
      me a kiss, and let me wish you joy." Alice did as she was bidden, and accepted the kiss and
      the congratulations, and a little box of jewellery which Lady Midlothian produced from out of
      her pocket. "The diamonds are from the Marchioness, my dear, whose means, as you doubtless are
      aware, greatly exceed my own. The garnets are from me. I hope they may both be worn long and
      happily."</p>
<p>I hardly know which was the worst, the lecture, the kiss, or the present. The latter she
      would have declined, had it been possible; but it was not possible. When she had agreed to be
      married at Matching she had not calculated the amount of punishment which would thereby be
      inflicted on her. But I think that, though she bore it impatiently, she was aware that she had
      deserved it. Although she fretted herself greatly under the infliction of Lady Midlothian, she
      acknowledged to herself, even at the time, that she deserved all the lashes she received. She
      had made a fool of herself in her vain attempt to be greater and grander than other girls, and
      it was only fair that her folly should be in some sort punished before it was fully pardoned.
      John Grey punished it after one fashion; by declining to allude to it, or to think of it, or
      to take any account of it. And now Lady Midlothian had punished it after another fashion, and
      Alice went out of the Countess's presence with sundry inward exclamations of "mea culpa," and
      with many unseen beatings of the breast.</p>
<p>Two days before the ceremony came the Marchioness and her august daughter. Her Lady Jane was
      much more august than the other Lady Jane;—very much more august indeed. She had very long
      flaxen hair, and very light blue eyes, which she did not move frequently, and she spoke very
      little,—one may almost say not at all, and she never seemed to do anything. But she was very
      august, and was, as all the world knew, engaged to marry the Duke of Dumfriesshire, who,
      though twice her own age, was as yet childless, as soon as he should have completed his
      mourning for his first wife. Kate told her cousin that she did not at all know how she should
      ever stand up as one in a group with so august a person as this Lady Jane, and Alice herself
      felt that such an attendant would quite obliterate her. But Lady Jane and her mother were both
      harmless. The Marchioness never spoke to Kate and hardly spoke to Alice, and the Marchioness's
      Lady Jane was quite as silent as her mother.</p>
<p>On the morning of this day,—the day on which these very august people came,—a telegram
      arrived at the Priory calling for Mr. Palliser's immediate presence in London. He came to
      Alice full of regret, and behaved himself very nicely. Alice now regarded him quite as a
      friend. "Of course I understand," she said, "and I know that the business which takes you up
      to London pleases you." "Well; yes;—it does please me. I am glad,—I don't mind saying so to
      you. But it does not please me to think that I shall be away at your marriage. Pray make your
      father understand that it was absolutely unavoidable. But I shall see him, of course, when I
      come back. And I shall see you too before very long."</p>
<p>"Shall you?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes."</p>
<p>"And why so?"</p>
<p>"Because Mr. Grey must be at Silverbridge for his election.—But perhaps I ought not tell you
      his secrets." Then he took her into the breakfast-parlour and showed her his present. It was a
      service of Sèvres china,—very precious and beautiful. "I got you these things because Grey
      likes china."</p>
<p>"So do I like china," said she, with her face brighter than he had ever yet seen it.</p>
<p>"I thought you would like them best," said he. Alice looking up at him with her eyes full of
      tears told him that she did like them best; and then, as he wished her all happiness, and as
      he was stooping over her to kiss her, Lady Glencora came in.</p>
<p>"I beg pardon," said she, "I was just one minute too soon; was I not?"</p>
<p>"She would have them sent here and unpacked," said Mr. Palliser, "though I told her it was
      foolish."</p>
<p>"Of course I would," said Lady Glencora. "Everything shall be unpacked and shown. It's easy
      to get somebody to pack them again."</p>
<p>Much of the wedding tribute had already been deposited with the china, and among other
      things there were the jewels that Lady Midlothian had brought.</p>
<p>"Upon my word, her ladyship's diamonds are not to be sneezed at," said Lady Glencora.</p>
<p>"I don't care for diamonds," said Alice.</p>
<p>Then Lady Glencora took up the Countess's trinkets, and shook her head and turned up her
      nose. There was a wonderfully comic expression on her face as she did so.</p>
<p>"To me they are just as good as the others," said Alice.</p>
<p>"To me they are not, then," said Lady Glencora. "Diamonds are diamonds, and garnets are
      garnets; and I am not so romantic but what I know the difference."</p>
<p>On the evening before the marriage Alice and Lady Glencora walked for the last time through
      the Priory ruins. It was now September, and the evenings were still long, so that the ladies
      could get out upon the lawn after dinner. Whether Lady Glencora would have been allowed to
      walk through the ruins so late as half-past eight in the evening if her husband had been there
      may be doubtful, but her husband was away and she took this advantage of his absence.</p>
<p>"Do you remember that night we were here?" said Lady Glencora.</p>
<p>"When shall I forget it; or how is it possible that such a night should ever be
      forgotten?"</p>
<p>"No; I shall never forget it. Oh dear, what wonderful things have happened since that! Do
      you ever think of Jeffrey?"</p>
<p>"Yes;—of course I think of him. I did like him so much. I hope I shall see him some
      day."</p>
<p>"And he liked you too, young woman; and, what was more, young woman, I thought at one time
      that, perhaps, you were going to like him in earnest."</p>
<p>"Not in that way, certainly."</p>
<p>"You've done much better, of course; especially as poor Jeffrey's chance of promotion
      doesn't look so good now. If I have a boy, I wonder whether he'll hate me?"</p>
<p>"Why should he hate you?"</p>
<p>"I can't help it, you know, if he does. Only think what it is to Plantagenet. Have you seen
      the difference it makes in him already?"</p>
<p>"Of course it makes a difference;—the greatest difference in the world."</p>
<p>"And think what it will be to me, Alice. I used to lie in bed and wish myself dead, and make
      up my mind to drown myself,—if I could only dare. I shan't think any more of that poor fellow
      now." Then she told Alice what had been done for Burgo; how his uncle had paid his bills once
      again, and had agreed to give him a small income. "Poor fellow!" said Lady Glencora, "it won't
      do more than buy him gloves, you know."</p>
<p>The marriage was magnificent, greatly to the dismay of Alice and to the discomfort of Mr.
      Vavasor, who came down on the eve of the ceremony,—arriving while his daughter and Lady
      Glencora were in the ruins. Mr. Grey seemed to take it all very easily, and, as Lady Glencora
      said, played his part exactly as though he were in the habit of being married, at any rate,
      once a year. "Nothing on earth will ever put him out, so you need not try, my dear," she said,
      as Alice stood with her a moment alone in the dressing-room up-stairs before her
      departure.</p>
<p>"I know that," said Alice, "and therefore I shall never try."</p>
