<p>The day after Rachel’s adventure with Don a card came into the drawing-room, and therewith a
     message that the gentleman had availed himself of Mrs. Curtis’s kind permission, and was
     sketching the Spinster’s Needles, two sharp points of red rock that stood out in the sea at the
     end of the peninsula, and were specially appropriated by Rachel and Grace.</p>
<p>The card was written, not engraved, the name “Rd. R. H. C. L. Mauleverer;” and a discussion
     ensued whether the first letters stood for Richard or for Reverend, and if he could be
     unconscionable enough to have five initials. The sisters had some business to transact at
     Villars’s, the Avonmouth deposit of literature and stationery, which was in the hands of a
     somewhat aspiring genius, who edited the weekly paper, and respected Miss Rachel Curtis in
     proportion to the number of periodicals she took in, and the abstruseness of the publications
     she inquired after. The paper in its Saturday’s dampness lay fresh on the counter, and glancing
     at the new arrivals, Grace had the desired opportunity of pointing to Mr. Mauleverer’s name,
     and asking when he had come. About a week since, said the obliging Mr. Villars, he appeared to
     be a gentleman of highly literary and artistic tastes, a philanthropist; indeed, Mr. Villars
     understood him to be a clerical gentlemen who had opinions—</p>
<p>“Oh, Rachel, I am very sorry,” said Grace.</p>
<p>“Sorry, what for?”</p>
<p>“Why, you and mamma seemed quite inclined to like him.”</p>
<p>“Well, and what have we heard?”</p>
<p>“Not much that is rational, certainly,” said Grace, smiling; “but we know what was
     meant.”</p>
<p>“Granting that we do, what is proved against him? No, I will not say proved, but alleged. He
     is one of the many who have thought for themselves upon the perplexing problems of faith and
     practice, and has been sincere, uncompromising, self-sacrificing, in avowing that his mind is
     still in that state of solution in which all earnest and original minds must be ere the
     crystallizing process sets in. Observe, Grace, I am not saying for an instant that he is in the
     right. All I do say is, that when depth of thought and candour have brought misfortune upon a
     man, it is ungenerous, therefore, to treat him as if he had the leprosy.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Rachel, I think you have made more out of his opinions than I did.”</p>
<p>“I was only arguing on your construction of his opinions.”</p>
<p>“Take care—!” For they were at this moment reaching a gate of Myrtlewood, and the sound of
     hoofs came close behind them. They were those of the very handsome chestnut, ridden by
     Alexander Keith, who jumped off his horse with more alacrity than usual as they were opening
     the gate for him, and holding out his hand, eagerly said—</p>
<p>“Then I conclude there is nothing the matter?”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all,” said Grace. “What did you hear?”</p>
<p>“Only a little drowning, and a compound fracture or two,” said he, relapsing into his languid
     ease as he gave his bridle to a groom, and walked with them towards the house.</p>
<p>“There, how very annoying!” exclaimed Rachel, “though, of course, the smallest adventure does
     travel.”</p>
<p>“I may venture to hope that neither are you drowned, nor my sister’s leg broken, nor a
     celebrated professor and essayist ‘in a high fever wi’ pulling any of you out of the sea.’”</p>
<p>“There, Grace,” exclaimed Rachel; “I told you he was something distinguished.”</p>
<p>“My dear Rachel, if his celebrity be in proportion to the rest of the story.”</p>
<p>“Then there really was a rescue!” exclaimed Captain Keith, now with much more genuine
     anxiety; and Rachel recollecting her desire that the right version should have the precedence,
     quickly answered, “There was no danger, only Don slipped down into that curved cove where we
     walked one day with the boys. I went down after him, but he had broken his leg. I could not get
     up with him in my arms, and Bessie called some one to help me.”</p>
<p>“And why could not Bessie help you herself?”</p>
<p>“Oh! strangers can never climb on our slippery rocks as we can.”</p>
<p>“Moreover, it would have spoilt the predicament,” muttered the brother to himself; then
     turning round with a smile, “And is the child behaving herself?”</p>
<p>Grace and Rachel answered in a eager duet how she was charming every one, so helpful, so
     kind, so everything.</p>
<p>“Ah!” he said with real satisfaction, apparent in the eyes that were so pleasant when open
     wide enough to be visible; “I knew she always did better when I was not there.”</p>
<p>They were by this time entering the hall, which, in the confident fashion of the sea-side,
     stood open; and at the moment Fanny came tripping downstairs with her dress looped up, and a
     shady hat on her head, looking fearfully girlish, thought her cousins, though her attire was
     still rigidly black.</p>
<p>“Oh, I am so glad to see you; Don is so much better, Rachel, and Conrade wants to thank you.
     He went up yesterday, and was so sorry you were out. Might it not have been dreadful, Alick? I
     have been so wanting to tell you how very delightful that dear sister of yours is. All the boys
     are distracted about her. Come out please. She has been teaching the boys such a delightful
     game; so much nicer than cricket, for I can play with them.”</p>
<p>Alick and Rachel could not but exchange a glance, and at the same moment, emerging through
     the screen of shrubs on the lawn, Bessie Keith, Conrade, Francis, and Leoline, were seen each
     with a mallet in hand and a gay ball in readiness to be impelled through the hoops that beset
     the lawn.</p>
<p>“And you really are learning croquet!” exclaimed innocent Grace; “well, it makes a beautiful
     ground.”</p>
<p>“Croquet!” exclaimed poor Lady Temple, with startled eyes; “you don’t really mean that it is
     croquet! O Bessie, Bessie!”</p>
<p>“Ah! I didn’t mean you to have come so soon,” said the much amused Bessie, as she gave her
     hand in greeting. “I meant the prejudice to be first conquered. See, dear Lady Temple, I’m not
     ashamed; this whitey brown moustache is going to kiss me nevertheless and notwithstanding.”</p>
<p>And so it certainly did, and smiled into the bargain, while the boys came clamouring up, and
     after thanks for Don’s preservation, began loudly to beg mamma would come, they could not make
     up their sides without her, but mamma was distressed and unhappy.</p>
<p>“Not now, my dears—I must—I must. Indeed I did not know.”</p>
<p>“Now, Alick, I trust to your generosity,” said Bessie, finding that they must be pacified.
     “Coming, Con—Come, Grace, come and convince Lady Temple that the pastime is not too wicked for
     you.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Alick,” Lady Temple was saying. “I am very sorry, I won’t allow it one moment if you
     think it is objectionable.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t,” said Alick, smiling. “Far from it. It is a capital game for you and your
     boys.”</p>
<p>“I thought—I thought you disapproved and could not bear it,” said Lady Temple, wondering and
     wistful.</p>
<p>“Can’t bear is not disapprove. Indeed,” seeing that gentle earnest alone could console her,
     “there is no harm in the game itself. It is a wholly personal distaste, arising from my having
     been bored with it when I was ill and out of spirits.”</p>
<p>“But is not there something about it in ‘Punch?’” she still asked, so anxiously, that it was
     impossible not to smile; but there was not a particle of that subdued mockery that was often so
     perplexing in him, as he replied, “Certainly there is about its abuse as an engine for
     flirtation, which, to tell you the truth, was what sickened me with the sight at Littleworthy;
     but that is not the line Con and Francie will take just yet. Why, my uncle is specially
     addicted to listening to croquet, and knows by the step and sound how each player is getting
     on, till he is quite an oracle in disputed hits.”</p>
<p>“So Bessie told me,” said Fanny, still feeling that she had been taken in and the brother
     unkindly used; “but I can’t think how she could, when you don’t like it.”</p>
<p>“Nobody is bound to respect foolish prejudices,” said Alick, still quite in earnest. “It
     would have been very absurd not to introduce it.”</p>
<p>“Come, Alick,” said Bessie, advancing, “have you absolved her, and may we begin? Would it not
     be a generous act of amnesty if all the present company united in a match?”</p>
<p>“Too many,” said Alick, “odd numbers. I shall go down and call on Miss Williams. May I come
     back, Lady Temple, and have a holiday from the mess?”</p>
<p>“I shall be very glad; only I am afraid there is no dinner.”</p>
<p>“So much the better. Only let me see you begin, or I shall never dare to express an opinion
     for the future.”</p>
<p>“Mamma, do pray, pray begin; the afternoon is wasting like nothing!” cried Conrade of the
     much-tried patience. “And Aunt Rachel,” he added, in his magnanimity, “you shall be my partner,
     and I’ll teach you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Conrade, but I can’t; I promised to be at home at four,” said Rachel, who had all
     this time been watching with curious interest which influence would prevail—whether Alick would
     play for Fanny’s sake, or Fanny abstain for Alick’s sake. She was best satisfied as it was, but
     she had still to parry Bessie Keith’s persuasive determination. Why would she go home? it
     certainly was to inspect the sketches of the landscape-painter. “You heard, Alick, of the
     interesting individual who acted the part of Rachel’s preserver,” she added.</p>
<p>The very force of Rachel’s resolution not to be put out of countenance served to cover her
     with the most uncomfortable blushes, all the more at the thought of her own unlucky
     exclamation. “I came here,” said Alick, coolly, “to assist in recovering the beloved remains
     from a watery grave;” and then, as Bessie insisted on hearing the Avoncester version, he gave
     it; while Grace added the intelligence that the hero was a clergyman, sinking the opinions, as
     too vague to be mentioned, even had not the company been too flighty for a subject she thought
     serious and painful. “And he is at this moment sketching the Spinster’s Needles!” said Bessie.
     “Well, I am consoled. With all your resolve to flatten down an adventure, fate is too strong
     for you. Something will come of it. Is not the very resolve that it shall not be an adventure a
     token?”</p>
<p>“If any one should wish to forget it, it is you, I think, Bessie,” said Alick. “Your
     admirable sagacity seems to have been at fault. I thought you prided yourself on your
     climbing.”</p>
<p>“Up a slippery perpendicular—”</p>
<p>“I know the place,” he gravely answered.</p>
<p>“Well,” exclaimed Bessie, recovering herself, “I am not a mermaid nor even a dear gazelle,
     and, in my humble opinion, there was far more grace in preventing heroism from being ‘unwept,
     unnoticed, and unsung,’ than in perilling my own neck, craning down and strangling the
     miserable beast, by pulling him up by the scrough of his neck! What an introduction would have
     been lost!”</p>
<p>“If you are going to play, Bessie,” said her brother, “it would be kind to take pity upon
     those boys.”</p>
<p>“One achievement is mine,” she said, dancing away backwards, her bright eyes beaming with
     saucy merriment, “the great Alexander has bidden me to croquet.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid,” said her brother, turning to Rachel as she departed, “that it was all her
     fault. Pray be patient with her, she has had many disadvantages.”</p>
<p>His incomprehensible irony had so often perplexed Rachel, that she did not know whether his
     serious apologetic tone were making game of her annoyance, and she answered not very
     graciously, “Oh, never mind, it did not signify.” And at the same time came another urgent
     entreaty from the boys that the two “aunts” would join the game, Conrade evidently considering
     that partnership with him would seal the forgiveness Aunt Rachel had won by the rescue of
     Don.</p>
<p>Grace readily yielded, but Rachel pleaded her engagement, and when the incorrigible Bessie
     declared that they perfectly understood that nothing could compete with the sketch of the
     Spinster’s Needles, she answered, “I promised to write a letter for my mother on business
     before post time. The Burnaby bargain,” she explained, to add further conviction.</p>
<p>“A business-like transaction indeed!” exclaimed Bessie, much diverted with the name.</p>
<p>“Only a bit of land in trust for apprenticing poor children,” said Rachel. “It was left by a
     Curtis many generations ago, in trust to the rector of the parish and the lord of the manor;
     and poor Mr. Linton is so entirely effete, that it is virtually in our hands. It is one of the
     vexations of my life that more good cannot be done with it, for the fees are too small for
     superior tradespeople, and we can only bind them to the misery of lacemaking. The system
     belongs to a worn-out state of things.”</p>
<p>The word system in Rachel’s mouth was quite sufficient to send Bessie to her croquet, and the
     poor boys were at length rewarded for their unusual patience. Their mother had been enduring
     almost as much as they did in her dislike to see them tantalised, and she now threw herself
     into the game with a relish that proved that as yet, at least, Conrade’s approbation was more
     to her than Captain Keith’s. It was very pretty to see her so pleased with her instructions, so
     eager about her own game, and yet so delighted with every hit of her boys; while Bessie was an
     admirable general, playing everybody’s game as well as her own, and with such life and spirit,
     such readiness and good nature, that a far duller sport would have been delicious under her
     management.</p>
<p>“Poor Alick,” said she, meeting him when he again strolled into the garden, while the boys
     were collecting the mallets and balls; “he did think he had one lawn in the world undefiled by
     those horrible hoops!” then as she met his smile of amusement and pardon, “but it was so
     exactly what they wanted here. It is so good for Lady Temple and her boys to have something
     they can do together.”</p>
<p>The pleased affectionate smile was gone.</p>
<p>“I object to nothing but its being for her good,” he said gravely.</p>
<p>“But now, does not it make her very happy, and suit her excellently?”</p>
<p>“May be so, but that is not the reason you introduced it.”</p>
<p>“You have a shocking habit of driving one up into corners, Alick, but it shall be purely,
     purely for my own selfish delight,” and she clasped her hands in so droll an affectation of
     remorse, that the muscles round his eyes quivered with diversion, though the hair on his lip
     veiled what the corners of his mouth were about; “if only,” she proceeded, “you won’t let it
     banish you. You must come over to take care of this wicked little sister, or who knows what may
     be the consequences.”</p>
<p>“I kept away partly because I was busy, and partly because I believe you are such a little
     ape as always to behave worse when you have the semblance of a keeper;” he said, with his arm
     fondly on her shoulder as they walked.</p>
<p>“And in the mean time fell out the adventure of the distinguished essayist.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid,” he returned, “that was a gratuitous piece of mischief, particularly annoying
     to so serious and thoughtful a person as Miss Rachel Curtis.”</p>
<p>“Jealousy?” exclaimed Bessie in an ecstatic tone. “You see what you lost by not trusting me,
     to behave myself under the provocation of your presence.”</p>
<p>“What! the pleasure of boxing your ears for a coward?”</p>
<p>“Of seizing the happy opening! I am very much afraid for you now, Alick,” she proceeded with
     mock gravity. “What hope can a poor Captain of Highlanders, even if he does happen to be a
     wounded hero or two, have against a distinguished essayist and landscape painter; if it were a
     common case indeed, but where Wisdom herself is concerned—”</p>
<p>“Military frivolity cannot hope,” returned Alick, with a shake of his head, and a calm
     matter-of-fact acquiescent tone.</p>
<p>“Ah, poor Alick,” pursued his sister, “you always were a discreet youth; but to be connected
     with such a union of learning, social science, and homeaopathy, soared beyond my utmost
     ambition. I suppose the wedding tour—supposing the happy event to take place—will be through a
     series of model schools and hospitals, ending in Hanwell.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Alick, equally coolly, “to the Dutch reformatory, and the Swiss cretin
     asylum.”</p>
<p>She was exceedingly tickled at his readiness, and proceeded in a pretended sentimental tone,
     “I am glad you have revealed the secrets of your breast. I saw there was a powerful attraction
     and that you were no longer your own, but my views were humbler. I thought the profound respect
     with which you breathed the name of Avonmouth, was due to the revival of the old predilection
     for our sweet little—”</p>
<p>“Hush, Bessie,” said her brother, roused for the first time into sternness, “this is more
     than nonsense. One word more of this, and you will cut me off from my greatest rest and
     pleasure.”</p>
<p>“From the lawn where croquet waits his approbation,” was on Bessie’s tongue, but she did not
     say it. There were moments when she stood in fear of her brother. He paused, and as if
     perceiving that his vehemence was in itself suspicious, added, “Remember, I never met her from
     seven years old till after her marriage. She has been the kindest of friends in right of our
     fathers’ old friendship. You know how her mother nursed me, and the sister she was to me. And
     Bessie, if your selfishness—I wish I could call it thoughtlessness—involves her innocent
     simplicity in any scrape, derogatory to what is becoming her situation, I shall find it very
     hard to forgive you, and harder still to forgive myself for letting you come here.”</p>
<p>Bessie pouted for a moment, but her sweetness and good humour were never away. “There, you
     have given your wicked little sister a screed,” she said, looking insinuatingly up at him.
     “Just as if I did not think her a darling, and would not for the world do anything to spoil
     her. Have not I been leading the most exemplary life, talking systems and visiting cottages
     with Rachel and playing with the boys, and singing with the clergyman; and here am I pounced
     on, as if I were come to be the serpent in this anti-croquet paradise.”</p>
<p>“Only a warning, Bessie.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be better now you have had it out. I’ve seen you suppressing it all this time, for
     fear of frightening me away.”</p>
<p>Every one knows how the afternoon croquet match on the Myrtlewood Lawn became an institution,
     though with some variation in the observers thereof, owing to the exigencies of calls, rides,
     and Ermine Williams’s drive, which Lady Temple took care should happen at least twice a week.
     The most constant votaries of the mallet and hoop were, of course, the two elder boys, the next
     pair being distant worshippers only now and then admitted by special favour, but the ardour of
     their mother even exceeded that of Bessie Keith, and it was always a disappointment to her if
     she were prevented from playing. Grace and Alison Williams frequently took their share with
     enjoyment, though not with the same devotion, and visitors, civil and military, also often did
     their part, but the most fervent of all these was Mr. Touchett. Ever since that call of his,
     when, after long impatience of his shy jerks of conversation and incapacity of taking leave,
     Miss Keith had exclaimed, “Did you ever play at croquet? do come, and we will teach you,” he
     had been its most assiduous student. The first instructions led to an appointment for more, one
     contest to another, and the curate was becoming almost as regular a croquet player as Conrade
     himself, not conversing much but sure to be in his place; and showing a dexterity and precision
     that always made Lady Temple pleased to have him on her side, and exclaim with delight at his
     hits as a public benefit to the cause, or thank him with real gratitude when he croqued her or
     one of her sons out of a difficulty.</p>
<p>Indeed that little lawn at Myrtlewood was a battle-field, of which Alison used to carry her
     sister amusing and characteristic sketches. The two leading players were Miss Keith and Mr.
     Touchett, who alone had any idea of tactics; but what she did by intuition, sleight of hand or
     experience, he effected by calculation and generalship, and even when Conrade claimed the
     command of his own side, the suggestions of the curate really guided the party. Conrade was a
     sort of Murat on the croquet field, bold, dashing, often making wonderful hits, but uncertain,
     and only gradually learning to act in combination. Alison was a sure-handed, skilful hitter,
     but did not aspire to leadership. Mamma tried to do whatever her boys commanded, and often did
     it by a sort of dainty dexterity, when her exultation, was a very pretty sight, nor was Grace’s
     lady-like skill contemptible, but having Francis as an ally was like giving a castle; and he
     was always placed on the other side from Conrade, as it was quite certain that he would do the
     very reverse of whatever his brother advised. Now and then invitations were given for Rose
     Williams to join the game, but her aunts never accepted them. Ermine had long ago made up her
     mind against intimacies between her niece and any pupils of Alison’s, sure that though starts
     of pleasure might result, they would be at the cost of ruffling, and, perhaps, perturbing the
     child’s even stream of happiness—even girl-friendships might have been of doubtful effect where
     circumstances were so unequal; but Lady Temple’s household of boys appeared to Ermine by no
     means a desirable sphere for her child to be either teased or courted in. Violetta, Colinette,
     and Augustus were safer comrades, and Rose continued to find them sufficient, varied with the
     rare delight of now and then sharing her aunt’s drive, and brightened by many a kind message in
     Colonel Keith’s letters to her aunt, nay, occasionally a small letter to herself, or an
     enclosure of some pretty photograph for her much-loved scrap book, or some article for
     Colinette’s use, sometimes even a new book! She was never forgotten in his letters, and Ermine
     smiled her strange pensive smile of amusement at his wooing of the unconscious Rose.</p>
