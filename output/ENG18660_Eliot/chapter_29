<p>The multiplication of uncomplimentary placards noticed by Mr Lyon and Felix Holt
      was one of several signs that the days of nomination and election were approaching. The
      presence of the Revising Barrister in Treby was not only an opportunity for all persons not
      otherwise busy to show their zeal for the purification of the voting-lists, but also to
      reconcile private ease and public duty by standing about the streets and lounging at
      doors.</p>
<p>It was no light business for Trebians to form an opinion; the mere fact of a public
      functionary with an unfamiliar title was enough to give them pause, as a premiss that was not
      to be quickly started from. To Mr Pink the saddler, for example, until some distinct injury or
      benefit had accrued to him,
      <pb n="188"/> the existence of the Revising-Barrister was like the existence of the young
      giraffe which Wombwell had lately brought into those parts—it was to be contemplated, and not
      criticised. Mr Pink professed a deep-dyed Toryism; but he regarded all fault-finding as
      Radical and somewhat impious, as disturbing to trade, and likely to offend the gentry or the
      servants through whom their harness was ordered: there was a Nemesis in things which made
      objection unsafe, and even the Reform Bill was a sort of electric eel which a thriving
      tradesman had better leave alone. It was only the "Papists" who lived far enough off to be
      spoken of uncivilly.</p>
<p>But Mr Pink was fond of news, which he collected and retailed with perfect impartiality,
      noting facts and rejecting comments. Hence he was well pleased to have his shop so constant a
      place of resort for loungers, that to many Trebians there was a strong association between the
      pleasures of gossip and the smell of leather. He had the satisfaction of chalking and cutting,
      and of keeping his journeymen close at work, at the very time that he learned from his
      visitors who were those whose votes had been called in question before His Honour, how Lawyer
      Jermyn had been too much for Lawyer Labron about Todd's cottages, and how, in the
      <pb n="189"/> opinion of some townsmen, this looking into the value of people's property, and
      swearing it down below a certain sum, was a nasty, inquisitorial kind of thing; while others
      observed that being nice to a few pounds was all nonsense—they should put the figure high
      enough, and then never mind if a voter's qualification was thereabouts. But, said Mr Sims the
      auctioneer, everything was done for the sake of the lawyers. Mr Pink suggested impartially
      that lawyers must live; but Mr Sims having a ready auctioneering wit, did not see that so many
      of them need live, or that babies were born lawyers. Mr Pink felt that this speculation was
      complicated by the ordering of side-saddles for lawyers' daughters, and, returning to the firm
      ground of fact, stated that it was getting dusk.</p>
<p>The dusk seemed deepened the next moment by a tall figure obstructing the doorway, at sight
      of whom Mr Pink rubbed his hands and smiled and bowed more than once, with evident solicitude
      to show honour where honour was due, while he said,</p>
<p>"Mr Christian, sir, how do you do, sir?"</p>
<p>Christian answered with the condescending familiarity of a superior. "Very badly, I can tell
      you, with these confounded braces that you were to make such a fine job of. See, old fellow,
      they've burst out again."</p>
<pb n="190"/>
<p>"Very sorry, sir. Can you leave them with me?"</p>
<p>"O yes, I'll leave them. What's the news, eh?" said Christian, half seating himself on a
      high stool, and beating his boot with a hand-whip.</p>
<p>"Well, sir, we look to you to tell us that," said Mr Pink, with a knowing smile. "You're at
      headquarters—eh, sir? That was what I said to Mr Scales the other day. He came for some
      straps, Mr Scales did, and he asked that question in pretty near the same terms that you've
      done, sir, and I answered him, as I may say, ditto. Not meaning any disrespect to you, sir,
      but a way of speaking."</p>
<p>"Come, that's gammon, Pink," said Christian. "You know everything. You can tell me, if you
      will, who is the fellow employed to paste up Transome's handbills?"</p>
<p>"What do <hi>you</hi> say, Mr Sims?" said Pink, looking at the auctioneer.</p>
<p>"Why, you know and I know well enough. It's Tommy Trounsem—an old, crippling, half-mad
      fellow. Most people know Tommy. I've employed him myself for charity."</p>
<p>"Where shall I find him?" said Christian.</p>
<p>"At the Cross-Keys, in Pollard's End, most likely," said Mr Sims. "I don't know where he
      puts himself when he isn't at the public."</p>
<pb n="191"/>
<p>"He was a stoutish fellow fifteen year ago, when he carried pots," said Mr Pink.</p>
<p>"Ay, and has snared many a hare in his time," said Mr Sims. "But he was always a little
      cracked. Lord bless you! he used to swear he'd a right to the Transome estate."</p>
<p>"Why, what put that notion into his head?" said Christian, who had learned more than he
      expected.</p>
<p>"The lawing, sir—nothing but the lawing about the estate. There was a deal of it twenty year
      ago," said Mr Pink. "Tommy happened to turn up hereabout at that time; a big, lungeous fellow,
      who would speak disrespectfully of hanybody."</p>
<p>"O, he meant no harm," said Mr Sims. "He was fond of a drop to drink, and not quite right in
      the upper storey, and he could hear no difference between Trounsem and Transome. It's an odd
      way of speaking they have in that part where he was born—a little north'ard. You'll hear it in
      his tongue now, if you talk to him."</p>
<p>"At the Cross-Keys I shall find him, eh?" said Christian, getting off his stool. "Good-day,
      Pink, good-day."</p>
<p>Christian went straight from the saddler's to Quorlen's, the Tory printer's, with whom he
      had contrived a political spree. Quorlen was a new man in Treby,
      <pb n="192"/> who had so reduced the trade of Dow, the old hereditary printer, that Dow had
      lapsed to Whiggery and Radicalism and opinions in general, so far as they were contented to
      express themselves in a small stock of types. Quorlen had brought his Duffield wit with him,
      and insisted that religion and joking were the handmaids of politics; on which principle he
      and Christian undertook the joking, and left the religion to the Rector. The joke at present
      in question was a practical one. Christian, turning into the shop, merely said, "I've found
      him out—give me the placards;" and, tucking a thickish flat bundle, wrapped in a black glazed
      cotton bag, under his arm, walked out into the dusk again.</p>
<p>"Suppose now," he said to himself, as he strode along—"suppose there should be some secret
      to be got out of this old scamp, or some notion that's as good as a secret to those who know
      how to use it? That would be virtue rewarded. But I'm afraid the old tosspot is not likely to
      be good for much. There's truth in wine, and there may be some in gin and muddy beer; but
      whether it's truth worth my knowing, is another question. I've got plenty of truth in my time
      out of men who were half-seas-over, but never any that was worth a sixpence to me."</p>
<p>The Cross-Keys was a very old-fashioned "public:"
      <pb n="193"/> its bar was a big rambling kitchen, with an undulating brick floor; the
      small-paned windows threw an interesting obscurity over the far-off dresser, garnished with
      pewter and tin, and with large dishes that seemed to speak of better times; the two settles
      were half pushed under the wide-mouthed chimney; and the grate, with its brick hobs, massive
      iron crane, and various pothooks, suggested a generous plenty possibly existent in all moods
      and tenses except the indicative present. One way of getting an idea of our
      fellow-countrymen's miseries is to go and look at their pleasures. The Cross-Keys had a
      fungous-featured landlord and a yellow sickly landlady, with a napkin bound round her head
      like a resuscitated Lazarus; it had doctored ale, an odour of bad tobacco, and remarkably
      strong cheese. It was not what Astræa, when come back, might be expected to approve as the
      scene of ecstatic enjoyment for the beings whose special prerogative it is to lift their
      sublime faces towards heaven. Still, there was ample space on the hearth—accommodation for
      narrative bagmen or boxmen—room for a man to stretch his legs; his brain was not pressed upon
      by a white wall within a yard of him, and the light did not stare in mercilessly on bare
      ugliness, turning the fire to ashes. Compared with some beerhouses of this
      <pb n="194"/> more advanced period, the Cross-Keys of that day presented a high standard of
      pleasure.</p>
<p>But though this venerable "public" had not failed to share in the recent political
      excitement of drinking, the pleasures it offered were not at this early hour of the evening
      sought by a numerous company. There were only three or four pipes being smoked by the
      firelight, but it was enough for Christian when he found that one of these was being smoked by
      the bill-sticker, whose large flat basket, stuffed with placards, leaned near him against the
      settle. So splendid an apparition as Christian was not a little startling at the Cross-Keys,
      and was gazed at in expectant silence; but he was a stranger in Pollard's End, and was taken
      for the highest style of traveller when he declared that he was deucedly thirsty, ordered
      sixpennyworth of gin and a large jug of water, and, putting a few drops of the spirit into his
      own glass, invited Tommy Trounsem, who sat next him; to help himself. Tommy was not slower
      than a shaking hand obliged him to be in accepting this invitation. He was a tall
      broad-shouldered old fellow, who had once been good-looking; but his cheeks and chest were
      both hollow now, and his limbs were shrunken.</p>
<p>"You've got some bills there, master, eh?" said
      <pb n="195"/> Christian, pointing to the basket. "Is there an auction coming on?"</p>
<p>"Auction? no," said Tommy, with a gruff hoarseness, which was the remnant of a jovial bass,
      and with an accent which differed from the Trebian fitfully, as an early habit is wont to
      reassert itself. "I've nought to do wi' auctions; I'm a pol'tical charicter. It's me am
      getting Trounsem into Parl'ment."</p>
<p>"Trounsem, says he," the landlord observed, taking out his pipe with a low laugh. "It's
      Transome, sir. May be you don't belong to this part. It's the candidate 'ull do most for the
      working men, and's proved it too, in the way o' being openhanded and wishing 'em to enjoy
      themselves. If I'd twenty votes, I'd give one for Transome, and I don't care who hears
      me."</p>
<p>The landlord peeped out from his fungous cluster of features with a beery confidence that
      the high figure of twenty had somehow raised the hypothetic value of his vote.</p>
<p>"Spilkins, now," said Tommy, waving his hand to the landlord, "you let one genelman speak to
      another, will you? This genelman wants to know about my bills. Does he, or doesn't he?"</p>
<p>"What then? I spoke according," said the landlord, mildly holding his own.</p>
<pb n="196"/>
<p>"You're all very well, Spilkins," retuned Tommy, "but y'aren't me. I know what the bills
      are. It's public business. I'm none o' your common bill-stickers, master; I've left off
      sticking up ten guineas reward for a sheep-stealer, or low stuff like that. These are
      Trounsem's bills; and I'm the rightful family, and so I give him a lift. A Trounsem I am, and
      a Trounsem I'll be buried; and if Old Nick tries to lay hold on me for poaching, I'll say,
      'You be hanged for a lawyer, Old Nick; every hare and pheasant on the Trounsem's land is
      mine;' and what rises the family, rises old Tommy; and we're going to get into
      Parl'ment—that's the long and the short on't, master. And I'm the head o' the family, and I
      stick the bills. There's Johnsons, and Thomsons, and Jacksons, and Billsons; but I'm a
      Trounsem, I am. What do you say to that, master?"</p>
<p>This appeal, accompanied by a blow on the table, while the landlord winked at the company,
      was addressed to Christian, who answered, with severe gravity,</p>
<p>"I say there isn't any work more honourable than bill-sticking."</p>
<p>"No, no," said Tommy, wagging his head from side to side. "I thought you'd come in to that.
      I thought you'd know better than say contrairy.
      <pb n="197"/> But I'll shake hands wi' you; I don't want to knock any man's head off. I'm a
      good chap—a sound crock—an old family kep' out o'my rights. I shall go to heaven, for all Old
      Nick."</p>
<p>As these celestial prospects might imply that a little extra gin was beginning to tell on
      the bill-sticker, Christian wanted to lose no time in arresting his attention. He laid his
      hand on Tommy's arm and spoke emphatically.</p>
<p>"But I'll tell you what you bill-stickers are not up to. You should be on the look-out when
      Debarry's side have stuck up fresh bills, and go and paste yours over them. I know where
      there's a lot of Debarry's bills now. Come along with me, and I'll show you. We'll paste them
      over, and then we'll come back and treat the company."</p>
<p>"Hooray!" said Tommy. "Let's be off them."</p>
<p>He was one of the thoroughly inured, originally hale drunkards, and did not easily lose his
      head or legs or the ordinary amount of method in his talk. Strangers often suppposed that
      Tommy was tipsy when he had only taken what he called "one blessed pint," chiefly from that
      glorious contentment with himself and his adverse fortunes which is not usually characteristic
      of the sober Briton. He knocked the ashes out of his pipe, seized his paste-vessel
      <pb n="198"/> and his basket, and prepared to start, with a satisfactory promise that he could
      know what he was about.</p>
<p>The landlord and some others had confidently concluded that they understood all about
      Christian now. He was a Transome's man, come to see after the bill-sticking in Transome's
      interest. The landlord, telling his yellow wife snappishly to open the door for the gentleman,
      hoped soon to see him again.</p>
<p>"This is a Transome's house, sir," he observed, "in respect of entertaining customers of
      that colour. I do my duty as a publican, which, if I know it, is to turn back no genelman's
      money. I say, give every genelman a chanch, and the more the merrier, in Parl'ment and out of
      it. And if anybody says they want but two Parl'ment men, I say it 'ud be better for trade if
      there was six of 'em, and voters according."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay," said Christian; "you're a sensible man, landlord. You don't mean to vote for
      Debarry then, eh?"</p>
<p>"Not nohow," said the landlord, thinking that where negatives were good the more you heard
      of them the better.</p>
<p>As soon as the door had closed behind Christian and his new companion, Tommy said,</p>
<pb n="199"/>
<p>"Now, master, if you're to be my lantern, don't you be a Jacky Lantern, which I take to mean
      one as leads you the wrong way. For I'll tell you what—if you've had the luck to fall in wi'
      Tommy Trounsem, don't you let him drop."</p>
<p>"No, no—to be sure not," said Christian. "Come along here. We'll go to the Back Brewery wall
      first."</p>
<p>"No, no; don't you let me drop. Give me a shilling any day you like, and I'll tell you more
      nor you'll hear from Spilkins in a week. There isna many men like me. I carried pots for
      fifteen year off and on—what do you think o' that now, for a man as might ha' lived up there
      at Trounsem Park, and snared his own game? Which I'd ha' done," said Tommy, wagging his head
      at Christian in the dimness undisturbed by gas. "None o' your shooting for me—it's two to one
      you'll miss. Snaring's more fishing-like. You bait your hook, and if it isna the fishes'
      goodwill to come, that's nothing again' the sporting genelman. And that's what I say by
      snaring."</p>
<p>"But if you'd a right to the Transome estate, how was it you were kept out of it, old boy?
      It was some foul shame or other, eh?"</p>
<p>"It's the law—that's what it is. You're a good
      <pb n="200"/> sort o' chap; I don't mind telling you. There's folks born to property, and
      there's folks catch hold on it; and the law's made for them as catch hold. I'm pretty deep; I
      see a good deal further than Spilkins. There was Ned Patch, the pedlar, used to say to me,
      'You canna read, Tommy,' says he. 'No; thank you,' says I; 'I'm not going to crack my
      headpiece to make myself as big a fool as you.' I was fond o' Ned. Many's the pot we've had
      together."</p>
<p>"I see well enough you're deep, Tommy. How came you to know you were born to property?"</p>
<p>"It was the regester—the parish regester," said Tommy, with his knowing wag of the head,
      "that shows as you was born. I allays felt it inside me as I was somebody, and I could see
      other chaps thought it on me too; and so one day at Littleshaw, where I kep ferrets and a
      little bit of a public, there comes a fine man looking after me, and walking me up and down
      wi' questions. And I made out from the clerk as he'd been at the regester; and I gave the
      clerk a pot or two, and he got it of our parson as the nake o' Trounsem was a great name
      hereabout. And I waits a bit for my fine man to come again. Thinks I, if there's property
      wants a right owner, I shall be called for; for I didn't
      <pb n="201"/> know the law then. And I waited and waited, till I see'd no fun i' waiting. So I
      parted wi' my public and my ferrets—for she was dead a'ready, my wife was, and I hadn't no
      cumbrance. And off I started a pretty long walk to this countryside, for I could walk for a
      wager in them days."</p>
<p>"Ah! well, here we are at the Back Brewery wall. Put down your paste and your basket now,
      old boy, and I'll help you. You paste, and I'll give you the bills, and then you can go on
      talking."</p>
<p>Tommy obeyed automatically, for he was now carried away by the rare opportunity of talking
      to a new listener, and was only eager to go on with his story. As soon as his back was turned,
      and he was stooping over his paste-pot, Christian, with quick adroitness, exchanged the
      placards in his own bag for those in Tommy's basket. Christian's placards had not been printed
      at Treby, but were a new lot which had been sent from Duffield that very day—"highly spiced,"
      Quorlen had said, "coming from a pen that was up to that sort of thing." Christian had read
      the first of the sheaf, and supposed they were all alike. He proceeded to hand one to Tommy,
      and said,</p>
<p>"Here, old boy, paste this over the other. And
      <pb n="202"/> so, when you got into this country-side, what did you do?"</p>
<p>"Do? Why, I put up at a good public and ordered the best, for I'd a bit o' money in my
      pocket; and I axed about, and they said to me, if it's Trounsem business you're after, you go
      to Lawyer Jermyn. And I went; and says I, going along, he's may be the fine man as walked me
      up and down. But no such thing. I'll tell you what Lawyer Jermyn was. He stands you there, and
      holds you away from him wi' a pole three yard long. He stares at you, and says nothing, till
      you feel like a Tomfool; and then he threats you to set the justice on you; and then he's
      sorry for you, and hands you money, and preaches you a sarmint, and tells you you're a poor
      man, and he'll give you a bit of advice—and you'd better not be meddling wi' things belonging
      to the law, else you'll be catched up in a big wheel and fly to bits. And I went of a cold
      sweat, and I wished I might never come i' sight o' Lawyer Jermyn again. But he says, if you
      keep i' this neighbourhood, behave yourself well, and I'll pertect you. I were deep enough,
      but it's no use being deep, 'cause you can never know the law. And there's times when the
      deepest fellow's worst frightened."</p>
<pb n="203"/>
<p>"Yes, yes. There! Now for another placard. And so that was all?"</p>
<p>"All?" said Tommy, turning round and holding the paste-brush in suspense. "Don't you be
      running too quick. Thinks I, 'I'll meddle no more. I've got a bit o' money—I'll buy a basket,
      and be a potman. It's a pleasant life. I shall live at publics and see the world, and pick up
      'quaintance, and get a chanch penny.' But when I'd turned into the Red Lion, and got myself
      warm again wi' a drop o' hot, something jumps into my head. Thinks I, Tommy, you've done
      finely for yourself: you're a rat as has broke up your house to take a journey, and show
      yourself to a ferret. And then it jumps into my head: I'd once two ferrets as turned on one
      another, and the little un killed the big un. Says I to the landlady, 'Missis, could you tell
      me of a lawyer,' says I, 'not very big or fine, but a second size—a pig-potato, like?' 'That I
      can,' says she; 'there's one now in the bar parlour.' 'Be so kind as bring us together,' says
      I. And she cries out—I think I hear her now—'Mr Johnson!' And what do you think?"</p>
<p>At this crisis in Tommy's story the grey clouds, which had been gradually thinning, opened
      sufficiently to let down the sudden moonlight, and
      <pb n="204"/> show his poor battered old figure and face in the attitude and with the
      expression of a narrator sure of the coming effect on his auditor; his body and neck stretched
      a little on one side, and his pastebrush held out with an alarming intention of tapping
      Christian's coat-sleeve at the right moment. Christian started to a safe distance, and
      said,</p>
<p>"It's wonderful. I can't tell what to think."</p>
<p>"Then never do you deny Old Nick," said Tommy, with solemnity. "I've believed in him more
      ever since. Who was Johnson? Why, Johnson was the fine man as had walked me up and down with
      questions. And I out with it to him then and there. And he speaks me civil, and says, 'Come
      away wi' me, my good fellow.' And he told me a deal o' law. And he says, whether you're a
      Tommy Trounsem or no, it's no good to you, but only to them as have got hold o' the property.
      If you was a Tommy Trounsem twenty times over, it 'ud be no good, for the law's bought you
      out; and your life's no good, only to them as have catched hold o' the property. The more you
      live, the more they'll stick in. Not as they want you now, says he—you're no good to anybody,
      and you might howl like a dog for iver, and the law 'ud take no notice on you. Says Johnson,
      <pb n="205"/> I'm doing a kind thing by you, to tell you. For that's the law. And if you want
      to know the law, master, you ask Johnson. I heard 'em say after, as he was an understrapper at
      Jermyn's. I've never forgot it from that day to this. But I saw clear enough, as if the law
      hadn't been again' me, the Trounsem estate 'ud ha' been mine. But folks are fools hereabouts,
      and I've left off talking. The more you tell'em the truth, the more they'll niver believe you.
      And I went and bought my basket and the pots, and—"</p>
<p>"Come, then, fire away," said Christian. "Here's another placard."</p>
<p>"I'm getting a bit dry, master."</p>
<p>"Well, then, make haste, and you'll have something to drink all the sooner."</p>
<p>Tommy turned to his work again, and Christian, continuing his help, said, "And how long has
      Mr Jermyn been employing you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no particular time—off and on; but a week or two ago he sees me upo' the road, and
      speaks to me uncommon civil, and tells me to go up to his office, and he'll give me employ.
      And I was noways unwilling to stick the bills to get the family into Parl'ment. For there's no
      man can help the law. And the family's the family, whether you carry pots
      <pb n="206"/> or no. Master, I'm uncommon dry; my head's a turning round; it's talking so long
      on end."</p>
<p>The unwonted excitement of poor Tommy's memory was producing a reaction.</p>
<p>"Well, Tommy," said Christian, who had just made a discovery among the placards which
      altered the bent of his thoughts, "you may go back to the Cross-Keys now, if you like; here's
      a half-crown for you to spend handsomely. I can't go back there myself just yet; but you may
      give my respects to Spilkins, and mind you paste the rest of the bills early to-morrow
      morning."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay. But don't you believe too much i' Spilkins," said Tommy, pocketing the half-crown,
      and showing his gratitude by giving this advice—"he's no harm much—but weak. He thinks he's at
      the bottom o' things because he scores you up. But I bear him no ill-will. Tommy Trounsem's a
      good chap; and any day you like to give me half—a—crown, I'll tell you the same story over
      again. Not now; I'm dry. Come, help me up wi' these things; you're a younger chap than me.
      Well, I'll tell Spilkins you'll come again another day."</p>
<p>The moonlight, which had lit up poor Tommy's oratorical attitude, had served to light up for
      Christian the print of the placards. He had expected the
      <pb n="207"/> copies to be various, and had turned them half over at different depths of the
      sheaf before drawing out those he offered to the bill-sticker. Suddenly the clearer light had
      shown him on one of them a name which was just then especially interesting to him, and all the
      more when occurring in a placard intended to dissuade the electors of North Loamshire from
      voting for the heir of the Transomes. He hastily turned over the lists that preceded and
      succeeded, that he might draw out and carry away all of this pattern; for it might turn out to
      be wiser for him not to contribute to the publicity of handbills which contained allusions to
      Bycliffe <hi>versus</hi> Transome. There were about a dozen of them; he pressed them together
      and thrust them into his pocket, returning all the rest to Tommy's basket. To take away this
      dozen might not be to prevent similar bills from being posted up elsewhere, but he had reason
      to believe that these were all of the same kind which had been sent to Treby from
      Duffield.</p>
<p>Christian's interest in his practical joke had died out like a morning rushlight. Apart from
      this discovery in the placards, old Tommy's story had some indications in it that were worth
      pondering over. Where was that well-informed Johnson now? Was he still an understrapper of
      Jermyn's?</p>
<pb n="208"/>
<p>With this matter in his thoughts, Christian only turned in hastily at Quorlen's, threw down
      the black bag which contained the captured Radical handbills, said he had done the job, and
      hurried back to the Manor that he might study his problem.</p>
