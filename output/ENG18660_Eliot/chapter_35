<p>A week after that Treby Riot, Harold Transome was at Transome Court. He had
      returned from a hasty visit to town, to keep his Christmas at this delightful country home,
      not in the best Christmas spirits. He had lost the election; but if that had been his only
      annoyance, he had good humour and good sense enough to have borne it as well as most men, and
      to have paid the eight or nine thousand,
      <pb/> which had been the price of ascertaining that he was not to sit in the next Parliament,
      without useless grumbling. But the disappointments of life can never, any more than its
      pleasures, be estimated singly; and the healthiest and most agreeable of men is exposed to
      that coincidence of various vexations, each heightening the effect of the other, which may
      produce in him something corresponding to the spontaneous and externally unaccountable
      moodiness of the morbid and disagreeable.</p>
<p>Harold might not have grieved much at a small riot in Treby, even if it had caused some
      expenses to fall on the county; but the turn which the riot had actually taken, was a bitter
      morsel for rumination, on more grounds than one. However the disturbances had arisen and been
      aggravated—and probably no one knew the whole truth on these points —the conspicuous, gravest
      incidents had all tended to throw the blame on the Radical party, that is to say, on Transome
      and on Transome's agents; and so far the candidateship and its results had done Harold
      dishonour in the county: precisely the opposite effect to that which was a dear object of his
      ambition. More than this, Harold's conscience was active enough to be very unpleasantly
      affected by what had befallen Felix Holt. His memory, always
      <pb/> good, was particularly vivid in its retention of Felix Holt's complaint to him about the
      treating of the Sproxton men, and of the subsequent irritating scene in Jermyn's office, when
      the personage with the inauspicious name of Johnson had expounded to him the impossibility of
      revising an electioneering scheme once begun, and of turning your vehicle back when it had
      already begun to roll downhill. Remembering Felix Holt's words of indignant warning about
      hiring men with drink in them to make a noise, Harold could not resist the urgent impression
      that the offences for which Felix was committed were fatalities, not brought about by any
      willing co-operation of his with the rioters, but arising probably from some ill-judged
      efforts to counteract their violence. And this impression, which insisted on growing into a
      conviction, became in one of its phases an uneasy sense that he held evidence which would at
      once tend to exonerate Felix, and to place himself and his agents in anything but a desirable
      light. It was likely that some one else could give equivalent evidence in favour of Felix—the
      little talkative Dissenting preacher, for example; but, anyhow, the affair with the Sproxton
      men would be ripped open and made the worst of by the opposite parties. The man who has failed
      in the use of
      <pb/> some indirectness, is helped very little by the fact that his rivals are men to whom
      that indirectness is a something human, very far from being alien. There remains this grand
      distinction, that he has failed, and that the jet of light is thrown entirely on his
      misdoings.</p>
<p>In this matter Harold felt himself a victim. Could he hinder the tricks of his agents? In
      this particular case he had tried to hinder them, and had tried in vain. He had not loved the
      two agents in question, to begin with; and now at this later stage of events he was more
      innocent than ever of bearing them anything but the most sincere ill-will. He was more utterly
      exasperated with them than he would probably have been if his one great passion had been for
      public virtue. Jermyn, with his John Johnson, had added this ugly dirty business of the Treby
      election to all the long-accumulating list of offences, which Harold was resolved to visit on
      him to the utmost. He had seen some handbills carrying the insinuation that there was a
      discreditable indebtedness to Jermyn on the part of the Transomes. If any such notions existed
      apart from electioneering slander, there was all the more reason for letting the world see
      Jermyn severely punished for abusing his power over the family affairs, and
      <pb/> tampering with the family property. And the world certainly should see this with as
      little delay as possible. The cool confident assuming fellow should be bled to the last drop
      in compensation, and all connection with him be finally got rid of. Now that the election was
      done with, Harold meant to devote himself to private affairs, till everything lay in complete
      order under his own supervision.</p>
<p>This morning he was seated as usual in his private room, which had now been handsomely
      fitted up for him. It was but the third morning after the first Christmas he had spent in his
      English home for fifteen years, and the home looked like an eminently desirable one. The white
      frost lay on the broad lawn, on the many-formed leaves of the evergreens, and on the giant
      trees at a distance. Logs of dry oak blazed on the hearth; the carpet was like warm moss under
      his feet; he had breakfasted just according to his taste, and he had the interesting
      occupations of a large proprietor to fill the morning. All through the house now, steps were
      noiseless on carpets or on fine matting; there was warmth in hall and corridors; there were
      servants enough to do everything, and to do it at the right time. Skilful Dominic was always
      at hand to meet his master's demands, and his bland presence
      <pb/> diffused itself like a smile over the household, infecting the gloomy English mind with
      the belief that life was easy, and making his real predominance seem as soft and light as a
      down quilt. Old Mr Transome had gathered new courage and strength since little Harry and
      Dominic had come, and since Harold had insisted on his taking drives. Mrs Transome herself was
      seen on a fresh background with a gown of rich new stuff. And if, in spite of this, she did
      not seem happy, Harold either did not observe it, or kindly ignored it as the necessary
      frailty of elderly women whose lives have had too much of dulness and privation. Our minds get
      tricks and attitudes as our bodies do, thought Harold, and age stiffens them into
      unalterableness. "Poor mother! I confess I should not like to be an elderly woman myself. One
      requires a good deal of the purring cat for that, or else of the loving grandame. I wish she
      would take more to little Harry. I suppose she has her suspicions about the lad's mother, and
      is as rigid in those matters as in her Toryism. However, I do what I can; it would be
      difficult to say what there is wanting to her in the way of indulgence and luxury to make up
      for the old niggardly life."</p>
<p>And certainly Transome Court was now such a
      <pb/> home as many women would covet. Yet even Harold's own satisfaction in the midst of its
      elegant comfort needed at present to be sustained by the expectation of gratified resentment.
      He was obviously less bright and enjoying than usual, and his mother, who watched him closely
      without daring to ask questions, had gathered hints and drawn inferences enough to make her
      feel sure that there was some storm gathering between him and Jermyn. She did not dare to ask
      questions, and yet she had not resisted the temptation to say something bitter about Harold's
      failure to get returned as a Radical, helping, with feminine self-defeat, to exclude herself
      more completely from any consultation by him. In this way poor women, whose power lies solely
      in their influence, make themselves like music out of tune, and only move men to run away.</p>
<p>This morning Harold had ordered his letters to be brought to him at the breakfast-table,
      which was not his usual practice. His mother could see that there were London business letters
      about which he was eager, and she had found out that the letter brought by a clerk the day
      before was to make an appointment with Harold for Jermyn to come to Transome Court at eleven
      this morning. She observed Harold swallow his coffee and push away
      <pb/> his plate with an early abstraction from the business of breakfast which was not at all
      after his usual manner. She herself ate nothing; her sips of tea seemed to excite her; her
      cheeks flushed, and her hands were cold. She was still young and ardent in her terrors; the
      passions of the past were living in her dread.</p>
<p>When Harold left the table she went into the long drawing-room, where she might relieve her
      restlessness by walking up and down, and catch the sound of Jermyn's entrance into Harold's
      room, which was close by. Here she moved to and fro amongst the rose-coloured satin of chairs
      and curtains—the great story of this world reduced for her to the little tale of her own
      existence —dull obscurity everywhere, except where the keen light fell on the narrow track of
      her own lot, wide only for a woman's anguish. At last she heard the expected ring and
      footstep, and the opening and closing door. Unable to walk about any longer, she sank into a
      large cushioned chair, helpless and prayerless. She was not thinking of God's anger or mercy,
      but of her son's. She was thinking of what might be brought, not by death, but by life.</p>
