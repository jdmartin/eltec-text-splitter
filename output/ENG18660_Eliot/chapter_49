<p>A little after five o'clock that day, Harold arrived at Transome Court. As he was
      winding along the broad road of the park, some parting gleams of the March sun pierced the
      trees here and there, and threw on the grass a long shadow of himself and the groom riding,
      and illuminated a window or two of the home he was approaching. But the bitterness in his mind
      made these sunny gleams almost as odious as an artificial smile. He wished he had never come
      back to this pale English sunshine.</p>
<p>In the course of his eighteen miles' drive, he had made up his mind what he would do. He
      understood now, as he had never understood before, the neglected solitariness of his mother's
      life, the allusions
      <pb n="246"/> and innuendoes which had come out during the election. But with a proud
      insurrection against the hardship of an ignominy which was not of his own making, he inwardly
      said, that if the circumstances of his birth were such as to warrant any man in regarding his
      character of gentleman with ready suspicion, that character should be the more strongly
      asserted in his conduct. No one should be able to allege with any show of proof that he had
      inherited meanness.</p>
<p>As he stepped from the carriage and entered the hall, there were the voice and the trotting
      feet of little Harry as usual, and the rush to clasp his father's leg and make his joyful
      puppy-like noises. Harold just touched the boy's head, and then said to Dominic in a weary
      voice.</p>
<p>"Take the child away. Ask where my mother is."</p>
<p>Mrs Transome, Dominic said, was up-stairs. He had seen her go up after coming in from her
      walk with Miss Lyon, and she had not come down again.</p>
<p>Harold, throwing off his hat and greatcoat, went straight to his mother's dressing-room.
      There was still a hope in his mind. He might be suffering simply from a lie. There is much
      misery created in the world by mere mistake or slander, and he
      <pb n="247"/> might have been stunned by a lie suggested by such slander. He rapped at his
      mother's door.</p>
<p>Her voice said immediately, "Come in."</p>
<p>Mrs Transome was resting in her easy-chair, as she often did between an afternoon walk and
      dinner. She had taken off her walking-dress and wrapped herself in a soft dressing-gown. She
      was neither more nor less empty of joy than usual. But when she saw Harold, a dreadful
      certainty took possession of her. It was as if a long-expected letter, with a black seal, had
      come at last.</p>
<p>Harold's face told her what to fear the more decisively, because she had never before seen
      it express a man's deep agitation. Since the time of its pouting childhood and careless youth
      she had seen only the confident strength and good-humoured imperiousness of maturity. The last
      five hours had made a change as great as illness makes. Harold looked as if he had been
      wrestling, and had had some terrible blow. His eyes had that sunken look which, because it is
      unusual, seems to intensify expression.</p>
<p>He looked at his mother as he entered, and her eyes followed him as he moved, till he came
      and stood in front of her, she looking up at him, with white lips.</p>
<pb n="248"/>
<p>"Mother," he said, speaking with a distinct slow-ness, in strange contrast with his habitual
      manner, "tell me the truth, that I may know how to act."</p>
<p>He paused a moment, and then said, "Who is my father?"</p>
<p>She was mute: her lips only trembled. Harold stood silent for a few moments, as if waiting.
      Then he spoke again.</p>
<p>" <hi>He</hi> has said—said it before others—that <hi>he</hi> is my father."</p>
<p>He looked still at his mother. She seemed as if age were striking her with a sudden wand—as
      if her trembling face were getting haggard before him. She was mute. But her eyes had not
      fallen; they looked up in helpless misery at her son.</p>
<p>Her son turned away his eyes from her, and left her. In that moment Harold felt hard: he
      could show no pity. All the pride of his nature rebelled against his sonship.</p>
