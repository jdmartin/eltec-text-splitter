<t:head><t:hi>Chapter XXVI</t:hi></t:head>
<t:p>Miss Marjoribanks's mind had scarcely subsided out of the first exhilarating sense of a great
     many things to do, and a truly important mission in hand, when little Rose Lake sought her with
     that confession of family troubles, and prayer for counsel and aid in the extremity, which
     opened a new way and mode of working to Lucilla. Rose was proud, poor little soul, not only of
     her exceptional position, and that of her family, as a family of artists, but also with a
     constitutional and individual pride as one of the natural conservators of domestic honour, who
     would rather have died than have heard the Lakes lightly spoken of, or upbraided with debt or
     indecorum, or any other crime. She had been silent as long as she could about Barbara's
     shortcomings, jealously concealing them from all the world, and attacking them with a violence
     which made her big elder sister, who was twice as big and six times as strong as she, tremble
     before her when they were alone. But little Rose had at length found things come to a point
     beyond which her experience did not go. Barbara began to have secret meetings with a man whose
     presence nobody was aware of, and who did not come openly to the house to seek her, and
     persevered, in spite of all remonstrances, in this clandestine career; and all the prejudices
     and all the instincts of the young artist rose up against her. A vague presentiment of greater
     evil behind impelled her to some action, and shame and pride combined at the same time to keep
     her silent. She could not speak to her father, because the poor man lost his head straightway,
     and made piteous appeals to her not to make a fuss, and threw the burden back again upon her
     with a double weight; and besides, he was only a man, though he was her father, and Rose had
     the pride of a woman in addition to her other pride. In these painful circumstances, it
     occurred to her to consult Lucilla, who had been, as has been recounted in an early part of
     this history, a great authority at Mount Pleasant, where her heroic belief in herself led, as
     was natural, others to believe in her. And then Miss Marjoribanks was one of the people who can
     keep counsel; and Rose felt, besides, that Lucilla had been injured, and had not revenged
     herself, and that to put confidence in her would be, to a certain extent, to make up for the
     offence. All these motives, combined with an intolerable sense of having upon her shoulders a
     burden greater than she could bear, drove the young artist at last to Grange Lane, where
     Lucilla, as we have said, was still in the state of mental exhilaration and excitement
     naturally consequent upon having a very important piece of work in hand.</t:p>
<t:p>"I don't know what to do," said Rose; "I made up my mind I never would say a word to any one.
     It is so strange she should have no proper pride! but then it is dreadful to think, what if
     anything should come of it! though I am sure I don't know what could come of it; but they might
     run away, or something; and then people are so fond of talking. I thought for a long time, if I
     only knew some nice old lady; but then I don't suppose there are any nice old ladies in
     Carlingford," added the Preraphaelist, with a sigh.</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, you little monster!" cried Lucilla, "there is Mrs Chiley, the dearest old——; but never
     mind, make haste and tell me all the same."</t:p>
<t:p>"Lucilla," said Rose solemnly, "we are not great people like you; we are not rich, nor able
     to have all we like, and everybody to visit us; but, all the same, we have our Pride. The
     honour of a family is just as precious whether people live," said the young artist, with a
     certain severity, "in Grove Street or in Grange Lane."</t:p>
<t:p>This exordium had its natural effect upon Miss Marjoribanks; her imagination leaped forward a
     long way beyond the reality which her companion talked of so solemnly, and she changed her
     colour a little, as even a woman of her experience might be excused for doing in the presence
     of something terrible and disastrous so near at hand.</t:p>
<t:p>"I wish you would not frighten me," said Lucilla; "I am very sorry for you, you dear little
     Rose. You are only a baby yourself, and ought not to have any bother. Tell me all about it,
     there's a dear."</t:p>
<t:p>But these soothing tones were too much for Rose's composure. She cried, and her cheeks
     flushed, and her dewy eyes enlarged and lightened when they had thrown off a little part of
     their oppression in the form of those hot salt tears. Miss Marjoribanks had never seen her look
     so pretty, and said so to herself, with a momentary and perfectly disinterested regret that
     there was "nobody" to see her—a regret which probably changed its character before Rose left
     the house. But in the meantime Lucilla soothed her and kissed her, and took off her hat and
     shed her pretty curls off her forehead. These curls were not by any means so strong and
     vehement in their twist as Miss Marjoribanks's own, but hung loosely and softly with the "sweet
     neglect" of the poet. "You would look very nice if you would take a little pains," Lucilla
     said, in her maternal way. "You must wear your hair just so on Thursday; and now tell me all
     about it—there's a dear."</t:p>
<t:p>"Lucilla, <t:hi>you know</t:hi>" said Rose, drying her tears, "she has taken to going out in the
     evening, and I am sure she meets him every night. I can't be a spy on her, whatever she does,
     and I can't lock her up, you know, or lock the door, or anything like that. I am not her
     mother," said the poor little sister pathetically, with a regretful sob. "And then she has
     taken to making herself <t:hi>nice</t:hi> before she goes out. I don't think she ever cared much
     for being nice—not at home, you know; but now she has pretty collars and gloves and things, and
     I can't tell where she gets them," cried Rose, her eyes lighting up passionately. "She has no
     money to spend on such things. Lucilla, I should die if I thought she would accept them from
      <t:hi>him</t:hi>."</t:p>
<t:p>"You dear old Rose, you don't know what you are saying," said the experienced Lucilla; "most
     likely, if she meets a gentleman, she is engaged to him; and They always give people presents,
     you know. If you would only tell me who it is."</t:p>
<t:p>"Lucilla, do not trifle with me," said Rose; "it is much too serious for that—engaged without
     papa knowing of it, nor me! You know very well that would be no engagement. I sometimes think
     she is—is—fond of him," said the reverent little maiden, whose voice changed and softened under
     the influence of that supposition; "and then again I think it is only because he is rich," she
     went on, with new vehemence. "Oh, Lucilla, if you only knew how dreadful it was to have such
     thoughts—and there is nobody to take care of her but me! Papa cannot be worried, for that would
     react upon everything. An artist is not just like other people. It is everybody's duty to leave
     him undisturbed; and then, you know, he is only a man, and does not understand; and if she
     won't pay any attention to me when I speak to her, oh, Lucilla, tell me, what can I do?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Let me think," said Lucilla gravely. "You know I can't tell all in a moment. It is Mr
     Cavendish, I suppose, though you won't say so. Now just wait a moment, and let me think."</t:p>
<t:p>"I once thought of going to him," said Rose; "perhaps he might be generous, and go away. An
     artist can do many things that other people can't do. We have an exceptional position," the
     Preraphaelist went on, faltering a little, and not feeling quite so sure of the fact on that
     special occasion. "I thought of going and begging of him, if it was on my knees——"</t:p>
<t:p>"My dear," said Lucilla, with great seriousness, "if you did, I think it is most likely he
     would fall in love with <t:hi>you</t:hi>, and that would not mend the matter; and I am sure Barbara
     would give you poison. I will tell you what we must do. I would not do it for everybody; but
     you know I was always very fond of you, you dear little Rose. You shall ask me for to-morrow
     evening to come to tea."</t:p>
<t:p>"To come to tea!" echoed poor Rose, in dismay. She had been waiting for Lucilla's advice with
     a great deal of anxiety; but at the present moment it would be vain to conceal that the
     proposed expedient seemed to her altogether inadequate for the emergency. The light went out of
     her face as she opened her eyes wide and fixed them on Lucilla; and for one moment, one
     desperate moment, Rose was disloyal, and lost faith in the only person who could help her;
     which, perhaps, under the circumstances, was not a thing to cause much surprise.</t:p>
<t:p>"My dear, you may be sure I would not propose it, if I did not feel it was the best thing to
     do," said Lucilla, with great gravity. "It happens precisely that I want to see Mr Cavendish,
     and if he is at home he never shows himself, and I have been wondering how I could find him. I
     shall make him walk home with me," said Miss Marjoribanks, "so you need not be uneasy, Rose,
     about the trouble I am taking. I am doing it to serve myself as well as you. We shall say eight
     o'clock, if that is not too late."</t:p>
<t:p>"But, Lucilla——" said Rose, with consternation; and then she stopped short, and could not
     tell what more to say.</t:p>
<t:p>"You don't understand it?" said Miss Marjoribanks; "I don't think it was to be expected that
     you should understand it. A little thing like you has no way of knowing the world. When Barbara
     knows I am there, she will be sure to bring him to the very door; she will want me to see that
     he is with her; and you may leave the rest to me," said Lucilla. "For my part, I have something
     very particular to say to Mr Cavendish. It is my luck," Miss Marjoribanks added, "for I could
     not think how to get to see him. At eight o'clock to-morrow evening——"</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes," said Rose; but perhaps it was still doubtful how far she understood the mode of
     operations proposed. Lucilla's prompt and facile genius was too much for the young artist, and
     there was, as she herself would have said, an entire want of "keeping" between her own sense of
     the position, tragical and desperate as that was, and any state of matters which could be
     ameliorated by the fact of Miss Marjoribanks coming to tea. It had been Rose's only hope, and
     now it seemed all at once to fail her; and yet, at the same time, that instinctive faith in
     Lucilla which came naturally to every one under her influence struggled against reason in
     Rose's heart. Her red soft lips fell apart with the hurried breath of wonder and doubt; her
     eyes still expanded, and clearer than usual after their tears, were fixed upon Lucilla with an
     appealing, questioning look; and it was just at this moment, when Rose was a great deal too
     much absorbed in her disappointment and surprise, and lingering hope, to take any notice of
     strange sounds or sights, or of anybody coming, that Thomas all at once opened the door and
     showed Mrs Centum into the room.</t:p>
<t:p>Now it would have mattered very little for Mrs Centum—who, to be sure, knew Lucilla perfectly
     well, and would never have dreamed for a moment of identifying such a trifling little person as
     Rose Lake in any way with Miss Marjoribanks; but then Mrs Centum happened at that precise
     moment to be bringing the new arrival, the important stranger, who had so much in his
     power—General Travers himself—to be introduced to Lucilla; and it was not the fault either of
     Rose or the General if it was on the young mistress of the Female School of Design that the
     warrior's first glance fell. Naturally the conversation had run upon Miss Marjoribanks on the
     past evening, for Mrs Centum was full of the enthusiasm and excitement incident to that
      <t:hi>paté</t:hi> which Lucilla had so magnanimously enabled her to produce. "Is she pretty?"
     General Travers had demanded, as was to be expected. "We—ll," Mrs Centum had replied, and made
     a long pause—"would you call Lucilla pretty, Charles?" and Charles had been equally dubious in
     his response; for, to be sure, it was a dereliction from Miss Marjoribanks's dignity to call
     her pretty, which is a trifling sort of qualification. But when the General entered the
     drawing-room, which might be called the centre of Carlingford, and saw before him that little
     dewy face, full of clouds and sunshine, uncertain, unquiet, open-eyed, with the red lips apart,
     and the eyes clear and expanded with recent tears—a face which gave a certain sentiment of
     freshness and fragrance to the atmosphere like the quiet after a storm—he did not understand
     what his hosts could mean. "I call her very pretty," he said, under his breath, to his
     interested and delighted chaperone; and we are surely justified in appealing to the readers of
     this history, as Lucilla, who was always reasonable, afterwards did to herself, whether it
     could be justly said under all the circumstances, that either Rose or the General were to
     blame?</t:p>
<t:p>The little artist got up hurriedly when she awoke to the fact that other visitors had come
     into the room, but she was not at all interested in General Travers, whom Rose, with the
     unconscious insolence of youth, classified in her own mind as an elderly gentleman. Not that he
     was at all an elderly gentleman; but then a man of forty, especially when he is a fine man and
     adequately developed for his years, has at the first glance no great attraction for an
     impertinent of seventeen. Rose did not go away without receiving another kiss from Lucilla, and
     a parting reminder. "To-morrow at eight o'clock; and mind you leave it all to me, and don't
     worry," said Miss Marjoribanks; and Rose, half ashamed, put on her hat and went away, without
     so much as remarking the admiration in the stranger's eyes, nor the look of disappointment with
     which he saw her leave the room. Rose thought no more of him than if he had been a piece of
     furniture; but as for the General, when he found himself obliged to turn to Lucilla and make
     himself agreeable, the drawback of having thus had his admiration forestalled and drawn away
     from its legitimate object was such, that he did not find her at all pretty; which, after all,
     on a first interview at least, is all They think about, as Miss Marjoribanks herself said.</t:p>
<t:p>"We must do all we can to make Carlingford agreeable to the General," said Mrs Centum. "You
     know how much depends upon it, Lucilla. If we can but make him like the place, only think what
     an advantage to society—and we have such nice society in Carlingford," said the injudicious
     woman, who did not know what to say.</t:p>
<t:p>"Nothing very particular," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I hope General Travers will like us; but
     as for the officers, I am not so sure. They are all so light and airy, you know: and to have
     nothing but flirting men is almost as bad as having nobody that can flirt; which is my
     position," Lucilla added, with a sigh, "as long as Mr Cavendish is away."</t:p>
<t:p>"Lucilla," cried Mrs Centum, a little shocked, "one would think to hear you that you were the
     greatest coquette possible; and on the contrary she is quite an example to all our young
     ladies, I assure you, General; and as for flirting——"</t:p>
<t:p>"Dear Mrs Centum," said Lucilla sweetly, "one has always to do one's duty to society. As far
     as I am concerned, it is quite different. And I don't mean to say that the officers would not
     be a great acquisition," Miss Marjoribanks continued, with her usual politeness; "but then too
     many young people are the ruin of society. If we were to run all to dancing and that sort of
     thing, after all the trouble one has taken——" said Lucilla. Perhaps it was not quite civil; but
     then it must be admitted, that to see a man look blankly in your face as if he were saying in
     his mind, "Then it is only <t:hi>you</t:hi>, and not that pretty little thing, that is Miss
     Marjoribanks!" was about as exasperating a sensation as one is likely to meet with. Lucilla
     understood perfectly well General Travers's look, and for the moment, instead of making herself
     agreeable, it was the contrary impulse that moved her. She looked at him, not blankly as he
     looked at her, but in a calmly considerate way, as she might have looked at Mr Holden the
     upholsterer, had he proposed a new kind of <t:hi>tapisserie</t:hi> to her judgment. "One would be
     always delighted, of course, to have General Travers," said Miss Marjoribanks, "but I am afraid
     the officers would not do."</t:p>
<t:p>As for Mrs Centum, she was quite incapable of managing such a terrible crisis. She felt it,
     indeed, a little hard that it should be her man who was defied in this alarming way, while Mr
     Cavendish and the Archdeacon, the two previous candidates, had both been received so sweetly.
     To be sure, it was his own fault; but that did not mend matters. She looked from one to the
     other with a scared look, and grew very red, and untied her bonnet; and then, as none of these
     evidences of agitation had any effect upon the other parties involved, plunged into the heat of
     the conflict without considering what she was about to say.</t:p>
<t:p>"Lucilla, I am surprised at you," said Mrs Centum, "when you know how you have gone on about
     Mr Cavendish—when you know what a fuss you have made, and how you have told everybody——"</t:p>
<t:p>"By the bye, who is Mr Cavendish?" said General Travers, interposing, with that holy horror
     of a quarrel between women which is common to the inferior half of creation. "I wonder if he is
     a fellow one used to meet everywhere. One never could get any satisfaction who he belonged to.
     He never pretended to be one of the Devonshire Cavendishes, you know. I don't know if he had
     any family at all, or relations, or that sort of thing. In most cases a man gets on just as
     well without them, in my opinion. I wonder if this fellow you are talking of is he?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, no," said Mrs Centum. "I hope you will meet him before you leave Carlingford. He has a
     sister married here; but we have always understood he was one of the Cavendishes. I am sure Mrs
     Woodburn always gives herself out for somebody," she continued, beginning to let the
     interesting suspicion enter her mind; for, to be sure, they were about of a standing, and the
     banker's wife had sometimes felt a little sore at the idea that her neighbour possessed
     distinctions of family which were denied to herself. "It is true, none of her relations ever
     come to see her," said Mrs Centum, and she began to forget the General, and Lucilla's reception
     of him, in this still more interesting subject. It was the first time that the authenticity of
     the Cavendishes had been attacked in Carlingford; and, to be sure, what is the good of having
     fine connections if they cannot be produced? While Mrs Centum pondered a suggestion so
     interesting, Lucilla, on her part, also took advantage of the occasion, and descended from the
     calm heights of dignity on which she had placed herself. And the General, who was a well-bred
     man, had got over for the moment the unlucky impression made upon him by the fresh face of
     little Rose Lake.</t:p>
<t:p>"Mr Cavendish is very nice," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I am very fond of all my own relations,
     but I don't care about other people's. Of course he is one of the Cavendishes. I don't see how
     he can help it, when that is his name. I should think it was sure to be the same. We should be
     so obliged to you if you would bring him back to Carlingford. I don't know, I am sure, why he
     is so obstinate in staying away."</t:p>
<t:p>"Perhaps somebody has been unkind to him," said the General, feeling it was expected of
     him.</t:p>
<t:p>"I am sure <t:hi>I</t:hi> have not been unkind to him," said Lucilla. "He is such a loss to me.
     If you are going to do us the pleasure of coming on Thursday—Oh, I am sure we shall feel quite
     honoured, both papa and I—I will show you how badly off I am. It is not a party in the least,
     and we don't dance," said Miss Marjoribanks, "that is why I am a little uncertain about the
     officers. It is one of my principles that too many young people are the ruin of society; but it
     is hard work, sometimes, when one is not properly supported," Lucilla added, with a gentle
     sigh.</t:p>
<t:p>"If I can be of any use," said the amused soldier. "I don't pretend to be able to replace
     Cavendish, if it is Cavendish; but——"</t:p>
<t:p>"No," said Miss Marjoribanks, with resignation, "it is not easy to replace him. He has quite
     a talent, you know; but I am sure it is very kind of you, and we shall be delighted to have
     such an acquisition," Lucilla continued, after a pause, with a gracious smile; and then she led
     her guests downstairs to luncheon, which was every way satisfactory. As for the General, it
     cannot be doubted that he had the worst of it in this little encounter, and felt himself by no
     means such a great personage in Carlingford as his hospitable entertainers had persuaded him he
     should be. Mrs Centum declared afterwards that she could not form the least idea what Lucilla
     meant by it, she who was generally so civil to everybody. But it is not necessary to say that
     Miss Marjoribanks knew perfectly well what she was doing, and felt it imperatively necessary to
     bring down General Travers to his proper level. Carlingford could exist perfectly well without
     him and his officers; but Lucilla did not mean that the society she had taken so much pains to
     form should be condescended to by a mere soldier. And then, after all, she was only human, and
     it was not to be expected she could pass over the blank look with which her visitor turned to
     herself, after having by evil fortune cast his eyes upon Rose Lake. At the same time, Miss
     Marjoribanks, always magnanimous, did not blame Rose, who had no hand whatever in the matter;
     and if she avenged herself in a ladylike and satisfactory manner, it is not to be supposed that
     it was simply a sense of offence which actuated Lucilla. She did it, on the contrary, on
     strictly philosophical principles, having perceived that Mrs Centum was spoiling her General,
     and that it was absolutely necessary that he should be disabused.</t:p>
<t:p>When they left, Mrs Centum was almost afraid to put the question that trembled on her lips.
     She uttered it at last, faltering, and with a very doubtful expression, for she could not
     conceal from herself the fact that the General had been snubbed. "How do you like Lucilla?" she
     said, in the most humble way; and then she turned away her face. She could bear it, whatever it
     might be. She said to herself that so long as the children were well, and the holidays about
     over, she could bear anything; and what did it matter to her about the officers?—but at the
     same time she preferred to avert her face when she received the blow.</t:p>
<t:p>"I am sure Miss Marjoribanks is a person for whom I shall always entertain the highest
     respect," said the General, and he gave a little laugh. "Was that pretty little creature a
     sister of hers?—or a friend?—or what? I don't know when I have seen anything so pretty," said
     the unsuspecting man; and then Mrs Centum turned round upon him with a kind of horror.</t:p>
<t:p>"<t:hi>That</t:hi> Lucilla's sister!—why, she has no sister; I told you so; she is an only child,
     and will have everything. She will be quite an heiress," cried Mrs Centum, "if the old Doctor
     were to die; though, I am sure, poor dear man, I hope he will not die. There is no other
     medical man in the town that one can have the least confidence in, except Dr Rider; and then
      <t:hi>he</t:hi> is so young, and can't have much experience with children. Her sister, indeed! It
     was little Rose Lake, the drawing-master's daughter," said Mrs Centum, with cruel distinctness.
     The General only said, "Oh!" but it was in a crestfallen tone; for to be snubbed by one lady,
     and struck with sudden enthusiasm for another, who, after all, was not a lady to speak of, but
     only a drawing-master's daughter, was rather hard upon the poor man. Thus it was the soldier,
     who in ordinary circumstances ought to have been the most successful, who began in the most
     cruel and uncomfortable way his campaign in Carlingford.</t:p>
</t:div>
