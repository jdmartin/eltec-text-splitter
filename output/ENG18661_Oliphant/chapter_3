<t:p>It may be well to seize the opportunity of Miss Marjoribanks's travels, through which it is
     unnecessary to follow her, as they have nothing particular to do with the legitimate history of
     her great undertaking, to explain a little the state of affairs in Carlingford before this
     distinguished revolutionary began her labours. It is something like going back into the
     prehistoric period—those ages of the flint, which only ingenious quarrymen and learned
     geologists can elucidate—to recall the social condition of the town before Miss Marjoribanks
     began her Thursday evenings, before St Roque's Chapel was built or thought of, while Mr Bury,
     the Evangelical Rector, was still in full activity, and before old Mr Tufton, at Salem Chapel
     (who sometimes drank tea at the Rectory, and thus had a kind of clandestine entrance into the
     dim outskirts of that chaos which was then called society), had his first "stroke." From this
     latter circumstance alone the entirely disorganised condition of affairs will be visible at a
     glance. It is true, Mr Vincent, who succeeded Mr Tufton, was received by Lady Western, in days
     when public opinion had made great advances; but then Lady Western was the most good-natured
     creature in the world, and gave an invitation, when it happened to come into her head, without
     the least regard for the consequences; and, after all, Mr Vincent was very nice-looking and
     clever, and quite presentable. Fortunately, however, the period to which we allude was prior to
     the entrance of Lady Western into Grange Lane. She was a very pretty woman, and knew how to
     look like a lady of fashion, which is always of importance; but she was terribly inconsequent,
     as Miss Marjoribanks said, and her introductions were not in the least to be depended upon. She
     was indeed quite capable of inviting a family of retired drapers to meet the best people in
     Grange Lane, for no better reason than to gratify her protégés, which, of course, was a
     proceeding calculated to strike at the roots of all society. Fortunately for Carlingford, its
     reorganisation was in abler hands. Affairs were in an utterly chaotic state at the period when
     this record commences. There was nothing which could be properly called a centre in the entire
     town. To be sure, Grange Lane was inhabited, as at present, by the best families in
     Carlingford; but then, without organisation, what good does it do to have a number of people
     together? For example, Mr Bury was utterly unqualified to take any lead. Mrs Bury had been dead
     a long time, and the daughters were married, and the Rector's maiden sister, who lived with
     him, was entirely of his own way of thinking, and asked people to tea-parties, which were like
     Methodists' class-meetings, and where Mr Tufton was to be met with, and sometimes other
     Dissenters, to whom the Rector gave what he called the right hand of fellowship. But he never
     gave anything else to society, except weak tea and thin bread-and-butter, which was fare, the
     ladies said, which the gentlemen did not relish. "I never can induce Charles to go out to tea,"
     said young Mrs Woodburn piteously; "he won't, and there is an end of it. After dinner he thinks
     of nothing but an easy-chair and the papers; and, my dear Miss Bury, what can I do?" "It is a
     great pity, my dear, that your husband's carelessness should deprive you of the benefit of
     Christian conversation; but, to be sure, it is your duty to stay with him, and I hope it will
     be made up to you at home," Miss Bury would say. As for the Rector, his favourites were devoted
     to him; and as he always saw enough of familiar faces at his sister's tea-parties, he took no
     account of the defaulters. Then there was Dr Marjoribanks, who gave only dinners, to which
     naturally, as there was no lady in the house, ladies could not be invited, and who, besides,
     was rather a drawback than a benefit to society, since he made the men quite intolerable, and
     filled them with such expectations, in the way of cookery, that they never were properly
     content with a good family dinner after. Then the ladies, from whom something might justly have
     been expected in the way of making society pleasant—such as Mrs Centum and Mrs Woodburn, for
     example, who had everything they could desire, and the most liberal housekeeping
     allowances—were either incapacitated by circumstances (which was a polite term in use at
     Carlingford, and meant babies) or by character. Mrs Woodburn liked nothing so well as to sit by
     the fire and read novels, and "take off" her neighbours, when any one called on her; and, of
     course, the lady who was her audience on one occasion, left with the comfortable conviction
     that next time she would be the victim; a circumstance which, indeed, did not make the offender
     unpopular—for there were very few people in Carlingford who could be amusing, even at the
     expense of their neighbours—but made it quite impossible that she should ever do anything in
     the way of knitting people together, and making a harmonious whole out of the scraps and
     fragments of society. As for Mrs Chiley, she was old, and had not energy enough for such an
     undertaking; and, besides, she had no children, and disliked bustle and trouble, and was of
     opinion that the Colonel never enjoyed his dinner if he had more than four people to help him
     to eat it; and, in short, you might have gone over Grange Lane, house by house, finding a great
     deal of capital material, but without encountering a single individual capable of making
     anything out of it. Such was the lamentable condition, at the moment this history commences, of
     society in Carlingford.</t:p>
<t:p>And yet nobody could say that there were not very good elements to make society with. When
     you add to a man capable of giving excellent dinners, like Dr Marjoribanks, another man like
     young Mr Cavendish, Mrs Woodburn's brother, who was a wit and a man of fashion, and belonged to
     one of the best clubs in town, and brought down gossip with the bloom on it to Grange Lane; and
     when you join to Mrs Centum, who was always so good and so much out of temper that it was safe
     to calculate on something amusing from her, the languid but trenchant humour of Mrs
     Woodburn—not to speak of their husbands, who were perfectly available for the background, and
     all the nephews and cousins and grand-children, who constantly paid visits to old Mr Western
     and Colonel Chiley; and the Browns, when they were at home, with their floating suite of
     admirers; and the young ladies who sang, and the young ladies who sketched, and the men who
     went out with the hounds, when business permitted them; and the people who came about the town
     when there was an election; and the barristers who made the circuit; and the gay people who
     came to the races; not to speak of the varying chances of curates, who could talk or play the
     piano, with which Mr Bury favoured his parishioners—for he changed his curates very often; and
     the occasional visits of the lesser county people, and the country clergymen;—it will be
     plainly apparent that all that was wanting to Carlingford was a master-hand to blend these
     different elements. There had even been a few feeble preliminary attempts at this great work,
     which had failed, as such attempts always fail when they are premature, and when the real agent
     of the change is already on the way; but preparations and presentiments had taken vague
     possession of the mind of the town, as has always been observed to be the case before a great
     revolution, or when a man destined to put his mark on his generation, as the newspapers say, is
     about to appear. To be sure, it was not a man this time, but Miss Marjoribanks; but the
     atmosphere thrilled and trembled to the advent of the new luminary all the same.</t:p>
<t:p>Yet, at the same time, the world of Carlingford had not the least idea of the real quarter
     from which the sovereign intelligence which was to develop it from chaos into order and harmony
     was, <t:hi>effectivement</t:hi>, to come. Some people had hoped in Mrs Woodburn before she fell
     into her present languor of appearance and expression; and a great many people hoped in Mr
     Cavendish's wife, if he married, as he was said to intend to do; for this gentleman, who was in
     the habit of describing himself, no doubt, very truthfully, as one of the Cavendishes, was a
     person of great consideration in Grange Lane; and some hoped in a new Rector, for it was
     apparent that Mr Bury could not last very long. Thus, with the ordinary short-sightedness of
     the human species, Carlingford blinded itself, and turned its eyes in every direction in the
     world rather than in that of the Swiss mountains, which were being climbed at that moment by a
     large and blooming young woman, with tawny short curls and alert decided movements; so little
     do we know what momentous issues may hang upon the most possible accident! Had that energetic
     traveller slipped but an inch farther upon the <t:hi>mer de glace</t:hi>—had she taken that other
     step which she was with difficulty persuaded not to take on the Wengern Alp—there would have
     been an end of all the hopes of social importance for Carlingford. But the good fairies took
     care of Lucilla and her mission, and saved her from the precipice and the crevasses; and
     instinctively the air at home got note of what was coming, and whispered the news mysteriously
     through the keyholes. "Miss Marjoribanks is coming home," the unsuspecting male public said to
     itself as it returned from Dr Marjoribanks's dinners, with a certain distressing, but mistaken
     presentiment, that these delights were to come to an end; and the ladies repeated the same
     piece of news, conjoining with it benevolent intimations of their intention to call upon her,
     and make the poor thing feel herself at home. "Perhaps she may be amusing," Mrs Woodburn was
     good enough to add; but these words meant only that perhaps Lucilla, who was coming to set them
     all right, was worthy of being placed in the satirist's collection along with Mrs Centum and
     Mrs Chiley. Thus, while the town ripened more and more for her great mission, and the ignorant
     human creatures, who were to be her subjects, showed their usual blindness and ignorance, the
     time drew nearer and nearer for Miss Marjoribanks's return.</t:p>
