<t:p>Mr Ashburton went away from Lucilla's side, thinking to come back again, and clear everything
     up: but he did not come back. Though he heard nothing, and saw nothing, that could throw any
     distinct light on the state of her mind, yet instinct came to his aid, it is to be supposed, in
     the matter. He did not return: and Lucilla sat on her sofa with her hands clasped together to
     support her, and her heart leaping in her very mouth. She was in a perfect frenzy of suspense,
     listening with her whole heart and soul; but that did not prevent the same crowd of thoughts
     which had been persecuting her for twenty-four hours from keeping up their wild career as
     before. What reason had she to suppose that "any one" had arrived? Who could arrive in that
     accidental way, without a word of warning? And what possible excuse had she to offer to herself
     for sending the new member for Carlingford—a man so excellent and honourable and eligible—away?
     The minutes, or rather the seconds, passed over Miss Marjoribanks like hours, as she sat thus
     waiting, not daring to stir lest the slightest movement might keep from her ears some sound
     from below, till at last the interval seemed so long that her heart began to sink, and her
     excitement to fail. It could not be any one—if it had been any one, something more must have
     come of it before now. It must have been Lydia Richmond coming to see her sister next door, or
     somebody connected with the election, or——</t:p>
<t:p>When she got as far as this, Lucilla's heart suddenly mounted up again with a spring into her
     ears. She heard neither words nor voice, but she heard something which had as great an effect
     upon her as either could have had. On the landing half-way up the stairs, there had stood in Dr
     Marjoribanks's house from time immemorial a little old-fashioned table, with a large china bowl
     upon it, in which the cards of visitors were placed. It was a great bowl, and it was always
     full, and anybody rushing upstairs in a reckless way might easily upset table and cards and all
     in their progress. This was what happened while Lucilla sat listening. There was a rumble, a
     crash, and a sound as of falling leaves, and it made her heart, as we have said, jump into her
     ears. "It is the table and all the cards," said Lucilla—and in that moment her composure came
     back to her as by a miracle. She unclasped her hands, which she had been holding pressed
     painfully together by way of supporting herself, and she gave a long sigh of unutterable
     relief, and her whirl of thought stopped and cleared up with an instantaneous rapidity.
     Everything seemed to be explained by that sound; and there never was a greater change upon the
     looks and feelings of any one in this world than that which passed upon the looks and feelings
     of Lucilla, in the interval between the drawing up of that cab and the rush of Tom Marjoribanks
     at the drawing-room door.</t:p>
<t:p>For after the commotion on the staircase Lucilla had no further doubt on the subject. She
     even had the strength to get up to meet him, and hold out her hands to him by way of
     welcome—but found herself, before she knew how, in the arms of a man with a beard, who was so
     much changed in his own person that he ventured to kiss her, which was a thing Tom
     Marjoribanks, though her cousin, had never dared to do before. He kissed her—such was his
     audacity; and then he held her at arm's length to have a good look at her; and then, according
     to all appearance, would have repeated his first salutation, but that Lucilla had come to
     herself, and took the reins at once into her hand.</t:p>
<t:p>"Tom!" she said, "of course it is you; nobody else would have been so impertinent. When did
     you come? Where did you come from? Who could ever have thought of your appearing like this, in
     such an altogether unexpected——?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Unexpected!" said Tom, with an astonished air. "But I suppose you had other things to think
     of. Ah, Lucilla, I could not write to you. I felt I ought to be beside you, trying if there was
     not something I could do. My mother told you, of course; but I could not trust myself to write
     to <t:hi>you</t:hi>."</t:p>
<t:p>Then Lucilla saw it all, and that Aunt Jemima had meant to do Mr Ashburton a good turn. And
     she was not grateful to her aunt, however kind her intentions might have been. But Tom was
     holding her hand, and looking into her face while this thought passed through her mind, and
     Miss Marjoribanks was not the woman, under any circumstances, to make dispeace.</t:p>
<t:p>"I am sure I am very glad," said Lucilla. "I would say you were changed, but only of course
     that would make you think how I am changed; and though one knows one has gone off——"</t:p>
<t:p>"I never saw you look so nice all your life," cried Tom energetically; and he took hold of
     both her hands, and looked into her face more and more. To be sure he had a kind of right,
     being a cousin, and newly returned after so long an absence; but it was embarrassing all the
     same.</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, Tom, don't say so," cried Lucilla; "if you but knew how different the house is, and
     everything so altered—and dear papa!"</t:p>
<t:p>It was natural, and indeed it was only proper, that Miss Marjoribanks should cry—which she
     did abundantly, partly for grief, and partly because of the flutter of agitation, and something
     like joy, in which she was, and which, considering that she had always frankly owned that she
     was fond of Tom, was quite natural too. She cried with honest abandonment, and did not take
     much notice what her cousin was doing to comfort her, though indeed he applied himself to that
     benevolent office in the most anxious way.</t:p>
<t:p>"Don't cry, Lucilla," he said, "I can't bear it. It don't look natural to see you cry. My
     poor uncle was an old man, and you were always the best daughter in the world——"</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, Tom! sometimes I don't think so," sobbed Lucilla; "sometimes I think if I had sat up
     that last night——And you don't know how good he was. It was me he was thinking of, and never
     himself. When he heard the money was lost, all that he said was, Poor Lucilla! You rang his
     bell though it is the night-bell, and nobody ever touches it now; I knew it could be nobody but
     you; and to see you again brings up everything so distinctly. Oh, Tom! he was always very fond
     of you."</t:p>
<t:p>"Lucilla," said Tom Marjoribanks, "you know I always had a great regard for my uncle. But it
     was not for him I came back. He was never half so fond of me as I am of you. You know that as
     well as I do. There never was a time that I would not have gone to the other end of the world
     if you had told me; and I have done it as near as possible. I went to India because you sent me
     away. And I have come back——"</t:p>
<t:p>"You have not come back only for an hour, I hope?" said Miss Marjoribanks, with momentary
     impatience; "you are not obliged to talk of everything all in a moment—and when one has not
     even got over one's surprise at seeing you. When <t:hi>did</t:hi> you come back? When did you have
     anything to eat? You want your breakfast or your lunch or something; and, Tom! the idea of
     sitting here talking to me, and talking nonsense, when you have not seen your mother. She is in
     her own room, you unnatural boy—the blue room, next to what used to be yours. To think Aunt
     Jemima should be in the house, and you should sit here talking nonsense to me!"</t:p>
<t:p>"This minute," said Tom apologetically; but he drew his chair in front of Miss Marjoribanks,
     so that she could not get away. "I have come back to stay as long as you will let me," he said;
     "don't go away yet. Look here, Lucilla—if you had married, I would have tried to bear it; but
     as long as you are not married, I can't help feeling as if there might be a chance for me yet.
     And that is why I have come home. I met somebody coming downstairs."</t:p>
<t:p>"Tom," said Miss Marjoribanks, "it is dreadful to see that you have come back just as
     tiresome as ever. I always said I would not marry for ten years. If you mean to think I have
     never had any opportunities——"</t:p>
<t:p>"Lucilla," said Tom, and there was decision in his eye, "somebody came downstairs as I came
     in. I want to know whether it is to be him or me!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Him—or you!" said Lucilla, in dismay. Blunderer as he was, he had gone direct to the very
     heart of the question, and it was impossible not to tremble a little in the presence of such
     straightforward clear-sightedness. Miss Marjoribanks had risen up to make her escape as soon as
     it should be possible, but she was so much struck by Tom's unlooked-for perspicuity, that she
     sat down again in her consternation. "I think you are going out of your mind," she said. "What
     do you know about the gentleman who went downstairs? I am not such a wonderful beauty, nor such
     a witch, that everybody who sees me should want to—to marry me. Don't talk any more nonsense,
     but let me go and get you something to eat."</t:p>
<t:p>"They would if they were of my way of thinking," said the persistent Tom. "Lucilla, you
     shan't go. This is what I have come home for. You may as well know at once, and then there can
     be no mistake about it. My poor uncle is gone, and you can't be left by yourself in the world.
     Will you have him or me?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I am not going to be tyrannised over like this," said Lucilla, with indignation, again
     rising, though he still held her hands. "You talk as if you had just come for a call, and had
     everything to say in a moment. When a man comes off a long journey it is his breakfast he
     wants, and not a—not anything else that I know of. Go up to your mother, and let me go."</t:p>
<t:p>"Will you have him or me?" repeated Tom. It was not wisdom, is was instinct, that made him
     thus hold fast by his text; and as for Lucilla, nothing but the softened state in which she
     was, nothing but the fact that it was Tom Marjoribanks who had been ten years away, and was
     always ridiculous, could have kept her from putting down at once such an attempt to coerce her.
     But the truth was, that Miss Marjoribanks did not feel her own mistress at that moment, and
     perhaps that was why he had the audacity to repeat, "Will you have him or me?"</t:p>
<t:p>Then Lucilla found herself fairly driven to bay. "Tom!" she said, with a solemnity that
     overwhelmed him for the moment, for he thought at first, with natural panic, that it was
     himself who was being rejected, "I would not have <t:hi>him</t:hi> if he were to go down on his
     knees. I know he is very nice and very agreeable, and the best man——And I am sure I ought to do
     it," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a mournful sense of her own weakness; "and everybody will
     expect it of me; but I am not going to have him, and I never meant it, whatever you or anybody
     may say."</t:p>
<t:p>When Lucilla had made this decisive utterance she turned away with a certain melancholy
     majesty to go and see after lunch—for he had loosed her hand and fallen back in consternation,
     thinking for the moment that it was all over. Miss Marjoribanks sighed, and turned round, not
     thinking of Tom, who was safe enough, but with a natural regret for the member for Carlingford,
     who now, poor man, was as much out of the question as if he had been dead and buried. But
     before she reached the door Tom had recovered himself. He went up to her in his ridiculous way
     without the slightest regard either for the repast she was so anxious to prepare for him, or
     for his mother's feelings, or indeed for anything else in the world, except the one thing which
     had brought him, as he said, home.</t:p>
<t:p>"Then, Lucilla, after all, it is to be me," he said, taking her to him, and arresting her
     progress as if she had been a baby; and though he had such a beard, and was twice as big and
     strong as he used to be, there were big tears in the great fellow's eyes. "It is to be me after
     all," said Tom, looking at her in a way that startled Lucilla. "Say it is to be me!"</t:p>
<t:p>Miss Marjoribanks had come through many a social crisis with dignity and composure. She had
     never yet been known to fail in an emergency. She had managed Mr Cavendish, and, up to the last
     moment, Mr Ashburton, and all the intervening candidates for her favour, with perfect
     self-control and command of the situation. Perhaps it was because, as she had herself said, her
     feelings had never been engaged. But now, when it was only Tom—he whom, once upon a time, she
     had dismissed with affectionate composure, and given such excellent advice to, and regarded in
     so motherly a way—all Lucilla's powers seemed to fail her. It is hard to have to wind up with
     such a confession after having so long entertained a confidence in Lucilla which nothing seemed
     likely to impair. She broke down just at the moment when she had most need to have all her wits
     about her. Perhaps it was her past agitation which had been too much for her. Perhaps it was
     the tears in Tom Marjoribanks's eyes. But the fact was that Lucilla relinquished her superior
     position for the time being, and suffered him to make any assertion he pleased, and was so weak
     as to cry, for the second time, too—which, of all things in the world, was surely the last
     thing to have been expected of Miss Marjoribanks at the moment which decided her fate.</t:p>
<t:p>Lucilla cried, and acquiesced, and thought of her father and of the Member for Carlingford,
     and gave to each a tear and a regret; and she did not even take the trouble to answer any
     question, or to think who it was she was leaning on. It was to be Tom after all—after all the
     archdeacons, doctors, generals, members of Parliament—after the ten years and more in which she
     had not gone off—after the poor old Doctor's grudge against the nephew whom he did not wish to
     inherit his wealth, and Aunt Jemima's quiet wiles, and attempt to disappoint her boy. Fate and
     honest love had been waiting all the time till their moment came; and now it was not even
     necessary to say anything about it. The fact was so clear that it did not require stating. It
     was to be Tom after all.</t:p>
<t:p>To do him justice, Tom behaved at this moment, in which affairs were left in his hands, as if
     he had been training for it all his life. Perhaps it was the first time in which he had done
     anything absolutely without a blunder. He had wasted no time, and no words, and left no room
     for consideration, or for that natural relenting towards his rival which was inevitable as soon
     as Mr Ashburton was off the field. He had insisted, and he had perceived that there was but one
     alternative for Lucilla. Now that all was over, he took her back to her seat, and comforted
     her, and made no offensive demonstrations of triumph. "It is to be me after all!" he repeated;
     and it was utterly impossible to add anything to the eloquent brevity of this succinct
     statement of the case.</t:p>
<t:p>"Tom," said Miss Marjoribanks, when she had a little recovered, "if it is to be you, that is
     no reason why you should be so unnatural. Go up directly and see your mother. What will Aunt
     Jemima think of me if she knows I have let you stay talking nonsense here?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, Lucilla—this moment," said Tom; but all the same he showed not the slightest
     inclination to go away. He did not quite believe in it as yet, and could not help feeling as
     if, should he venture to leave her, the whole fabric of his incredible good fortune must
     dissolve and melt away. As for Lucilla, her self-possession gradually came back to her when the
     crisis was over, and she felt that her involuntary abdication had lasted long enough, and that
     it was full time to take the management of affairs back into her own hands.</t:p>
<t:p>"You shall go <t:hi>now</t:hi>," she said, drying her eyes, "or else you cannot stay here. I
     thought of letting you stay in the house, as Aunt Jemima is with me; but if you do not mean to
     go and tell your mother, I will tell Nancy to send your things up to the Blue Boar. Ring the
     bell, please; if you will not ring the bell, I will do it myself, Tom. You may say what you
     like, but I know you are famishing; and Aunt Jemima is in the blue room, next door to——Oh, here
     is Nancy. It is Mr Tom, who has come home," said Lucilla hastily, not without a rising colour;
     for it was hard to explain why, when his mother was in the blue room all this time, he should
     have stayed here.</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, Miss Lucilla—so I heard," said Nancy, dropping a doubtful curtsey. And then only Tom
     was persuaded, and bethought himself of his natural duty, and rushed upstairs. He seized
     Nancy's hand, and shook it violently, as he passed her, to her great consternation. The moment
     of his supremacy was over. It was to be Tom after all; but Lucilla had recovered her
     self-possession, and taken the helm in her hand again, and Tom was master of the situation no
     more.</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, it is Mr Tom," said Lucilla, shaking her head with something between a smile and a
     sigh. "It could be nobody but him that would ring <t:hi>that</t:hi> bell, and upset all the cards.
     I hope he has not broken dear papa's punch-bowl that he used to be so fond of. He must have
     something to eat, Nancy, though he is such an awkward boy."</t:p>
<t:p>"I don't see nothing like a boy in him," said Nancy; "he's big and stout, and one o' them
     awful beards. There's been a deal of changes since he went away; but if he's new comed off that
     terrible long journey, it is but natural, as you say, Miss Lucilla, that he should want
     something to eat."</t:p>
<t:p>And then Miss Marjoribanks made various suggestions, which were received still doubtfully by
     her prime minister. Nancy, to tell the truth, did not like the turn things were taking.
     Lucilla's maiden household had been on the whole getting along very comfortably, and there was
     no telling how long it might have lasted without any new revolution. To be sure, Mr Ashburton
     had looked dangerous, but Nancy had seen a great many dangers of that kind blow over, and was
     not easily alarmed. Mr Tom, however, was a very different person; and Nancy was sufficiently
     penetrating to see that something had happened. Therefore, she received very coldly Lucilla's
     suggestions about lunch. "It ain't like the old times," she said at last, "when there was
     always something as one could put to the fire in a hurry;" and Nancy stood turning round the
     handle of the door in her hand, and contemplating the changed state of affairs with a sigh.</t:p>
<t:p>"That would be all very true if you were like anybody else," said Lucilla; "but I hope you
     would not like to send Mr Tom off to the Blue Boar. After all, perhaps it is better to have a—a
     gentleman in the house. I know you always used to think so. They are a great deal of trouble;
     but—for some things, you know——" said Lucilla; "and then Mr Tom is not just like other people;
     and whatever happens, Nancy, you are an old dear, and it shall never make any difference
     between you and me."</t:p>
<t:p>When she had said these words, Lucilla gave her faithful servant a hug, and sent her off to
     look after Tom Marjoribanks's meal; and then she herself went half-way downstairs and picked up
     the cards that were still scattered about the landing, and found with satisfaction that the
     Doctor's old punch-bowl was not broken. All Tom's things were lying below in the hall—heaps of
     queer Indian-looking baggage—tossed down anyhow in a corner, as if the owner had been in much
     too great a hurry to think of any secondary circumstances. "And it was there he met poor Mr
     Ashburton," said Lucilla to herself, with a certain pathos. There it was indeed that the
     encounter had taken place. They had seen each other but for a moment, but that moment had been
     enough to send the Member for Carlingford away dejected, and to impress upon Tom's mind the
     alternative that it was either to be "him or me." Miss Marjoribanks contemplated the spot with
     a certain tender sentimental interest, as any gentle moralist might look at a field of battle.
     What feelings must have been in the minds of the two as they met and looked at each other! What
     a dread sense of disappointment on the one side; what sharp stimulation on the other! Thus
     Lucilla stood and looked down from her own landing upon the scene of that encounter, full of
     pensive interest. And now it was all over, and Mr Ashburton had passed away as completely as Mr
     Chiltern, who was in his grave, poor man; or Mr Cavendish, who was going to marry Barbara Lake.
     The thought of so sudden a revolution made Lucilla giddy as she went thoughtfully upstairs.
     Poor Mr Ashburton! It hardly seemed real even to Miss Marjoribanks when she sat down again in
     the drawing-room, and confessed to herself that, after all, it was to be Tom.</t:p>
<t:p>But when he came downstairs again with his mother, Lucilla was quite herself, and had got
     over all her weakness. Aunt Jemima, for her part, was in a very agitated state of mind. Tom had
     come too soon or Mr Ashburton too late, and all the fruits of her little bit of treachery were
     accordingly lost, and at the same time, the treachery itself remained, revealed at least to one
     person in the very clearest light. It did not seem possible to Aunt Jemima that Lucilla would
     not tell. If she had not done it now, in the excitement of the moment, at least it would come
     out some time when she was least expecting it, and her son's esteem and confidence would be
     lost. Therefore it was with a very blank countenance that Mrs John Marjoribanks came
     downstairs. She dared not say a word, and she had to kiss her niece, and take her to her
     maternal bosom, Tom looking on all the while; but she gave Lucilla a look that was pitiful to
     see. And when Tom finally was dismissed to his room, to open his trunks, and show the things he
     had brought home, Aunt Jemima drew near her future daughter with wistful guiltiness. There was
     no comfort to her in the thought of the India shawl, which her son had gone to find. Any day,
     any hour, Lucilla might tell; and if the unlucky mother were put on her defence, what could she
     say?</t:p>
<t:p>"Lucilla," said the guilty woman, under her breath, "I am sure you think it very strange. I
     don't attempt to deceive <t:hi>you</t:hi>. I can't tell you how thankful and glad I am that it has
     all ended so well; but you know, Lucilla, in the first place, I did not know what your feelings
     were; and I thought, perhaps, that if anything would tell, it would be a surprise, and
     then——"</t:p>
<t:p>"Did you, Aunt Jemima?" said Miss Marjoribanks, with gentle wonder. "I thought you had been
     thinking of Mr Ashburton, for my part."</t:p>
<t:p>"And so I was, Lucilla," said the poor lady, with great relief and eagerness. "I thought he
     was coming forward, and of course he would have been a far better match than my Tom. I had to
     think for you both, my dear. And then I never knew what your feelings were, nor if you would
     care; and then it was not as if there had been a day fixed——"</t:p>
<t:p>"Dear Aunt Jemima," said Miss Marjoribanks, "if you are pleased now, what does it matter? but
     I do hope you are pleased now?"</t:p>
<t:p>And Mrs John took her niece into her arms again this time with better will, and cried. "I am
     as happy as ever I can be," said the inconsistent mother. "I always knew you were fond of each
     other, Lucilla; before you knew it yourselves, I saw what would come of it. But my poor
     brother-in-law——And you will make my boy happy, and never turn him against his mother," cried
     the repentant sinner. Lucilla was not the woman to resist such an appeal. Mrs John had meant
     truly enough towards her in other ways, if not in this way; and Miss Marjoribanks was fond of
     her aunt, and it ended in a kiss of peace freely bestowed, and a vow of protection and guidance
     from the strong to the weak, though the last was only uttered in the protectress's liberal
     heart.</t:p>
