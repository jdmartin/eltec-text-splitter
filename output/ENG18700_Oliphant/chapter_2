<head>PART II.</head>
<head>MADNESS.</head>
<p>Flityville, <hi rend="italic">March 20</hi>. </p>
<p>As the event which I am about to recount forms the turning-point of my
                    life—unless, indeed, something still more remarkable happens, which I do not at
                    present foresee, to turn me back again—I do not feel that it would be either
                    becoming, or indeed possible, for me to maintain that vein of easy cheerfulness
                    which has characterised my composition hitherto. What is fun to you, O my
                    reader! may be death to me; and nothing can be further from my intention than to
                    excite the smallest tendency to risibility on your part at my misfortunes or
                    trials. You will already have guessed what these are; but how to recur to those
                    agonising details, how to present to you the picture of my misery in its true
                    colours,—nothing but the stern determination to carry out my original design,
                    and the conscientious conviction that "the story of my life from month to month"
                    may be made a profitable study to my fellow-men, could induce me in this
                    cold-blooded way to tear open the still unhealed wound.</p>
<p>I came down to breakfast rather late on the morning following the events narrated
                    in the last chapter. Broadhem and Grandon had already vanished from the scene;
                    so had Mr Wog, who went up to town to see what he called "the elephant,"—an
                    American expression, signifying "to gain experience of the world." The phrase
                    originated in an occurrence at a menagerie, and as upon this occasion Mr Wog
                    applied it to the opening of Parliament, it was not altogether inappropriate. I
                    found still lingering over the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> of breakfast my
                    host and hostess, Lady Broadhem and her daughters, the Bishop and Chundango. The
                    latter appeared to be having all the talk to himself, and, to give him his due,
                    his conversation was generally entertaining.</p>
<p>"My dear mother," he was saying, "still unconverted, has buried all my jewellery
                    in the back verandah. After I had cleared a million sterling, I divided it into
                    two parts; with one part I bought jewels, of which my mother is an excellent
                    judge, and the other I put out at interest. Not forgetting," with an upward
                    glance, "a sum the interest of which I do not look for here."</p>
<p>"Then, did you give all your jewels to your mother?" asked Lady Broadhem.</p>
<p>"Oh no; she is only keeping them till I can bestow them upon the woman I choose
                    for her daughter-in-law."</p>
<p>"Are you looking out for her now?" I asked, somewhat abruptly.</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear friend," said John; "I hope to find in England some Christian young
                    person as a yoke-mate."</p>
<p>There was a self-satisfied roll of his eye as he said this, which took away from
                    me all further desire for the bacon and eggs I had just put on my plate.</p>
<p>"Dear Mr Chundango," said Lady Broadhem, "tell us some of your adventures as a
                    catechist in the Bombay Ghauts. Did you give up all when you became one? Was
                    your family noble? and did you undergo much persecution from them?"</p>
<p>"The Rajah of Sattara is my first cousin," said Chundango, unblushingly; "but
                    they repudiated me when I became a Christian, and deny the relationship."</p>
<p>"Are you going up to Convocation?" said Dickiefield to the Bishop, to divert
                    attention from Chundango's last barefaced assertion. "I hear they are going to
                    take some further action about the judgment on the 'Essays and Reviews.'"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Joseph; "and I see there is a chance of three new sees being created.
                    I should like to talk over the matter with you. Considering how seriously my
                    health has suffered in the tropics, and how religiously I have adhered to my
                    Liberal opinions in politics even in the most trying climates, it might be worth
                    while——"</p>
<p>"Excuse me for interrupting you, my dear lord," said Dickiefield, "but the
                    present Government are not so particular about the political as the theological
                    views of their bishops. When you remember that the Prime Minister of this
                    country is held morally accountable for the orthodoxy of its religious tenets,
                    you must at once perceive how essential it is, not only that he should be
                    profoundly versed in points of Scriptural doctrine himself, but that he should
                    never appoint a bishop of whose soundness he is not from personal knowledge
                    thoroughly satisfied."</p>
<p>"I have no objection to talk over the more disputed points with him," said the
                    Bishop. "When do you think he could spare a moment?"</p>
<p>"The best plan would be," replied Dickiefield, with a twinkle in his eye, "to
                    catch him in the lobby of the House some evening when there is nothing
                    particular going on. What books of reference would you require?"</p>
<p>The Bishop named one, when I interrupted him, for I felt Dickiefield had not put
                    the case fairly as regarded the first Minister of the Crown.</p>
<p>"It is not the Premier's fault at all," said I; "he may be the most liberal
                    theologian possible, but he has nothing to do with doctrine; that lies in the
                    Chancellor's department. As the supreme arbiter in points of religious belief,
                    and as the largest dispenser of spiritual patronage in the kingdom, it is
                    evident that the qualifications for a Lord Chancellor should be not so much his
                    knowledge of law, as his unblemished moral character and incapacity for
                    perpetrating jobs. He is, in fact, the principal veterinary surgeon of the
                    ecclesiastical stable, and any man in orders that he 'warrants sound' cannot be
                    objected to on the score of orthodoxy. The Prime Minister is just in the same
                    position as the head of any other department,—whoever passes the competitive
                    examination he is bound to accept, but may use his own discretion as to
                    promotion, and, of course, sticks to the traditions of the service. The fact is,
                    if you go into the Colonial Episcopal line you get over the heads of a lot of
                    men who are steadily plodding on for home promotion, and, of course they don't
                    think it fair for an outsider to come back again, and cut them out of a palace
                    and the patronage attached to it on the strength of having been a missionary
                    bishop. It is just the same in the Foreign Office,—if you go out of Europe you
                    get out of the regular line. However, we shall have the judgment on the Colenso
                    case before long, and, from the little I know of the question, it is possible
                    you may find that you are not legally a bishop at all. In that case you will
                    have what is far better than any interest—a grievance. You can say that you were
                    tempted to give up a good living to go to the heathen on false pretences, and
                    they'll have to make it up to you. You could not do better than apply for one of
                    the appointments attached to some cathedrals, called 'Peculiars.' I believe that
                    they are very comfortable and independent. If you will allow me I will write to
                    my solicitor about one. Lawyers are the men to manage these matters, as they are
                    all in with each other, and every bishop has one attached to him."</p>
<p>"Thank you, my lord—my observation was addressed to Lord Dickiefield," said the
                    Bishop, very stiffly; for there was an absence of that deference in my tone to
                    which those who love the uppermost seats in the synagogues are accustomed, but
                    which I reserve for some poor labourers who will never be heard of in this
                    world.</p>
<p>"Talking of committees," I went on, "how confused the Lord Chancellor must be
                    between them all. He must be very apt to forget when he is 'sitting' and when he
                    is being 'sat upon.' If he had not the clearest possible head, he would be
                    proving to the world that Mr E—— was competent to teach the Zulus theology in
                    spite of the Bishop of Cape Town, and that he was justified in giving Dr Colenso
                    a large retiring pension. What with having to quote texts in one committee-room,
                    and arithmetic in another, and having to explain the law of God, the law of the
                    land, and his own conduct alternately, it is a miracle that he does not get a
                    softening of the brain. Depend upon it," said I, turning to the Bishop, who
                    looked flushed and angry, "that a 'Peculiar' is a much snugger place than the
                    Woolsack."</p>
<p>"Lord Frank, permit me to say," broke in Lady Broadhem, who had several times
                    vainly endeavoured to interrupt me, "that your manner of treating sacred
                    subjects is most disrespectful and irreverent, and that your allusions to an
                    ecclesiastical stable, 'outsiders,' and other racing slang, is in the worst
                    possible taste, considering the presence of the Bishop."</p>
<p>"Lady Broadhem," said I, sternly, "when the money-changers were scourged out of
                    the Temple there was no want of reverence displayed towards the service to which
                    it was dedicated; and it seems to me, that to sell 'the Temple' itself, whether
                    under the name of an 'advowson,' a 'living,' or a 'cure of souls,' is the very
                    climax of irreverence, not to use a stronger term; and when the Lord Chancellor
                    brings in an Act for the purpose of facilitating this traffic in 'souls,' and
                    'augmenting the benefices' derived from curing them, I think it is high time, at
                    the risk of giving offence to my friend the Bishop, and to the ecclesiastical
                    establishment generally, to speak out. What times have we fallen upon that the
                    priesthood itself, once an inspiration, has become a trade?"<ref target="#ENG18700_N1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Lady Broadhem seemed a little cowed by my vehemence, which some might have
                    thought amounted to rudeness, but would not abandon the field. "The result," she
                    said, "of impoverishing the Church will be, that you will only get literates to
                    go into it; as it is, compared with other professions, it holds out no
                    inducement for young men of family. Fortunately our own living, being worth
                    —1200 a-year, always secures us a member of the family, and therefore a
                    gentleman; but if you did away with them you would not have holier men, but
                    simply worse-bred ones. I am sure we should not gain by having the Church filled
                    with clergy of the class of Dissenting preachers."</p>
<p>"I don't think you would, any more than the Pharisees would have gained by being
                    reduced to the level of the Sadducees; not that I would wish to use either term
                    offensively towards the conscientious individuals who were, doubtless, comprised
                    in the above sects in old time, still less as a reproach to the excellent men
                    who fill the churches and chapels of this country now; but it has possibly not
                    occurred to them that the Churchianity of the present day bears as little
                    resemblance to the Christianity of eighteen hundred years ago, as the latter did
                    to the worship it came to supersede;" and I felt I had sown seed in the
                    ecclesiastical vineyard, and would leave it to fructify. "Good fellow, Frank!" I
                    overheard Dickiefield say, as I left the room; "it is a pity his head is a
                    little turned!" "Ah," I thought, "something is upside down; perhaps it is my
                    head, but I rather think it is the world generally, including always the
                    religious world. It seemed to have taken a start in the right direction nearly
                    two thousand years ago, and now it has all slipped back again worse than ever,
                    and is whirling the wrong way with a rapidity that makes one giddy. I feel more
                    giddy than usual to-day, somehow," I soliloquised; "and every time I look at
                    Lady Ursula, I feel exactly as if I had smoked too much. It can't be really
                    that, so I'll light a cigar and steady my nerves before I come to the tremendous
                    issue. She is too sensible to mind my smelling of tobacco." These were the
                    thoughts that passed through my somewhat bewildered brain, as I stepped out upon
                    the terrace and lit my cigar. So far from my nerves becoming steadier, however,
                    under the usually soothing influence, I felt my heart beating more rapidly each
                    time I endeavoured to frame the sentence upon which was to depend the happiness
                    of my life, until at last my resolution gave way altogether, and I determined to
                    put upon paper, in the form of an interrogatory, the momentous question. A glass
                    door opened from a recess in the drawing-room upon the terrace on which I was
                    walking, and in it, on my former visits, I had been in the daily habit of
                    writing my letters. It was a snug retreat, with a fire all to itself, a charming
                    view, and a <hi rend="italic">portière</hi> which separated it or not from the
                    drawing-room, according to the wish of the occupant. The first question I had to
                    consider when I put the writing materials before me was, whether I ought to
                    begin, "Dear Lady Ursula," or, "My dear Lady Ursula." I should not have
                    entertained the idea of beginning "My dear," did I not feel that having known
                    her as a child entitled me to assume a certain intimacy. However, on further
                    consideration, I adopted the more distant form, and then my real difficulty
                    began. While looking for an inspiration at the further end of the avenue which
                    stretched from the lawn, I became conscious of a figure moving slowly towards
                    me, which I finally perceived to be that of Lady Broadhem herself. In my then
                    frame of mind, any escape from my dilemma was a relief, and I instinctively left
                    the still unwritten note and joined her.</p>
<p>"This is a courageous proceeding, Lady Broadhem; the weather is scarcely mild
                    enough for strolling."</p>
<p>"I determined to make sure of some exercise," she replied,—"the clouds look
                    threatening; besides, I have a good deal on my mind, and I can always think
                    better when I am walking <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>."</p>
<p>She put a marked emphasis on the last word, I can't imagine why, so I said, "That
                    is just my case. If you only knew the torture I am enduring, you would not
                    wonder at my wanting to be alone. As for exercise, it would not be of the
                    slightest use."</p>
<p>"Dear me," said Lady Broadhem, pulling a little box like a card-case out of her
                    pocket, "tell me your exact symptoms, and I'll give you some globules."</p>
<p>"It is not altogether beyond the power of hom—opathy," I said, with a sigh.
                    "Hahnemann was quite right when he adopted as the motto for his system, 'Like
                    cures like,' It applies to my complaint exactly. Love will cure love, but not in
                    hom—opathic doses."</p>
<p>"How very odd! I was thinking the very same thing when you joined me. My dear
                    girls are of course ever uppermost in my mind, and I really am troubled about
                    Ursula. I think," she said, looking with a sidelong glance into my face, "I know
                    who is on the point of declaring himself," and she stopped suddenly, as though
                    she had spoken under some irresistible impulse.</p>
<p>I don't remember having blushed since I first went to school, but if Lady
                    Broadhem could have seen the colour of my skin under my thick beard, she would
                    have perceived how just her penetration had been. Still I was a good deal
                    puzzled at the quickness with which she had made a discovery I imagined unknown,
                    even to the object of my affections, to say nothing of the coarseness of her
                    alluding to it to me in that direct manner. What had I said or done that could
                    have put her on the scent? I pondered in vain over the mystery. My conduct had
                    been most circumspect during the few hours I had been in love; nothing but the
                    sagacity with which the maternal instinct is endowed could account for it.</p>
<p>"Do you think Lady Ursula returns the affection?" said I, timidly.</p>
<p>"Ursula is a dear, well-principled girl, who will make any man who is fortunate
                    enough to win her happy. I am sure she will be guided by my wishes in the
                    matter. And now, Lord Frank, I think we have discussed this subject
                    sufficiently. I have said more, perhaps, than I ought; but we are such old
                    friends that, although I entirely disagree with your religious opinions, it has
                    been a relief to me even to say thus much. I trust my anxieties will soon be at
                    an end;" with which most encouraging speech Lady Broadhem turned towards the
                    house, leaving me overcome with rapture and astonishment, slightly tinged with
                    disgust at finding that the girl I loved was thrown at my head.</p>
<p>I did not delay, when I got back to my recess in the drawing-room, to tear up
                    with a triumphant gesture my note beginning "Dear," and to commence another, "My
                    dear Lady Ursula."</p>
<p>"The conversation which I have just had with Lady Broadhem," I went on,
                    "encourages me to lose no time in writing to you to explain the nature of those
                    feelings which she seems to have detected almost as soon as they were called
                    into existence, and which gather strength with such rapidity that a sentiment
                    akin to self-preservation urges me not to lose another moment in placing myself
                    and my fortune at your disposal. If I allude to the latter, it is not because I
                    think such a consideration would influence you in the smallest degree, but
                    because you may not suspect, from my economical habits, the extent of my private
                    resources. I am well aware that my impulsive nature has led me into an apparent
                    precipitancy in writing thus; but if I cannot flatter myself that the short time
                    I have passed in your society has sufficed to inspire you with a reciprocal
                    sentiment, Lady Broadhem's assurance that I may depend upon your acceding to her
                    wishes in this the most important act of your life, affords me the strongest
                    encouragement.—Believe me, yours most faithfully,</p>
<l>"<hi rend="smcap">Frank Vanecourt</hi>." </l>
<p>I have already observed that, when my mind is very deeply absorbed in
                    composition, I become almost insensible to external influences: thus it was not
                    until I had finished my letter, and was reading it over, that I became conscious
                    of sounds in the drawing-room. I was just thinking that I had got the word
                    "sentiment" twice, and was wondering what I could substitute for that expressive
                    term, when I suppose I must have overheard, for I insensibly found myself
                    signing my name "Jewel." Then came the unmistakable sound of Chundango's voice
                    mentioning the name dearest to me. "Remember, Lady Ursula," said that regenerate
                    pagan, "there are very few men who could offer their brides such a collection of
                    jewels as I can. Think, that although of a different complexion from yourself, I
                    am of royal blood. You are surely too enlightened and noble-minded to allow the
                    trivial consideration of colour to influence you."</p>
<p>"Mr Chundango," said Lady Ursula, and I heard the rustle of her dress as she rose
                    from her chair, "you really must excuse me from listening to you any more."</p>
<p>"Stop one moment," said Chundango; and I suspect he tried to get hold of her
                    hand, for I heard a short quick movement; "I have not made this proposal without
                    receiving first the sanction of Lady Broadhem." "Deceitful old hypocrite";
                    thought I, with suppressed fury. "When I told her ladyship that I would settle a
                    million's worth of pounds upon you in jewellery and stock, that my blood was
                    royal, and that all my aspirations were for social distinction, she said she
                    desired no higher qualification. 'What, dear Mr Chundango,' she remarked,
                    'matters the colour of your skin if your blood is pure? If your jewellery and
                    your conversion are both genuine, what more could an anxious mother desire for
                    her beloved daughter?'"</p>
<p>"Spare me, I implore you," said Ursula, in a voice betraying great agitation.
                    "You don't know the pain you are giving me."</p>
<p>Whether Chundango at this moment fell on his knees, which I don't think likely,
                    as natives never thus far humble themselves before the sex, or whether he
                    stumbled over a footstool in trying to prevent her leaving the room—which is
                    more probable—I could not discover. I merely heard a heavy sound and then the
                    door open. I think the Indian must have hurt himself, as the next time I heard
                    his voice it was trembling with passion.</p>
<p>"Lady Broadhem," he said—for it appears she it was who had entered the room—"I do
                    not understand Lady Ursula's conduct. I thought obedience to parents was one of
                    the first precepts of the Christian religion; but when I tell her your wishes on
                    the subject of our marriage, she forbids me to speak. I will now leave her in
                    your hands, and I hope I shall receive her from them in the evening in another
                    and a better frame of mind;" and Chundango marched solemnly out and banged the
                    door after him.</p>
<p>"What have you done, Ursula?" said Lady Broadhem, in a cold, hard voice. "I
                    suppose some absurd prejudice about his colour has influenced you in refusing a
                    fortune that few girls have placed at their feet. He is a man of remarkable
                    ability; in some lights there is a decided richness in his hue; and Lord
                    Dickiefield tells me he fully expects to see him some day Under-Secretary for
                    India, and ultimately perhaps in the Cabinet. Moreover, he is very lavish, and
                    would take a pride in giving you all you could possibly want, and in meeting all
                    our wishes. He would be most useful to Broadhem, whose property, you know, was
                    dreadfully involved by his father in his young days-in fact, he promised me to
                    pay off —300,000 of the debt upon his personal security, and not ask for any
                    interest for the first few years. All this you are throwing away for some
                    girlish fancy for some one else."</p>
<p>Here my heart bounded. "Dear girl," thought I, "she loves me, and I'll rush in
                    and tell her that I return her passion. Moreover, I will overwhelm that old
                    woman with confusion for having so grossly deceived me." A scarcely audible sob
                    from Lady Ursula decided me, and to the astonishment of mother and daughter I
                    suddenly revealed myself. Lady Ursula gave a start and a little exclamation, and
                    before I could explain myself, had hurried from the room. Lady Broadhem
                    confronted me, stern, defiant, and indignant.</p>
<p>"Is it righteous,—Lady Broadhem——" I began, but she interrupted me.</p>
<p>"My indignation? Yes, Lord Frank, it is."</p>
<p>"No, Lady Broadhem; I did not allude to your indignation, which is unjustifiable.
                    I was about to express my feelings in language which I thought might influence
                    you with reference to the deception you have practised upon me. You gave me to
                    understand only half an hour ago that you approved of my attachment to your
                    daughter; you implied that that attachment was returned—indeed, I have just
                    overheard as much from her own lips; and now you deliberately urge her to ally
                    herself with—the thought is too horrible!" and I lifted my handkerchief to my
                    eyes to conceal my unaffected emotion.</p>
<p>"Lord Frank," said Lady Broadhem, calmly, "you had no business to overhear
                    anything; however, I suppose the state of your feelings must be your excuse. It
                    seems that we entirely misunderstood each other this morning. The attachment I
                    then alluded to was the one you have just heard Mr Chundango declare. I did so,
                    because I thought of asking you to find out some particulars about him which I
                    am anxious to know. I was utterly ignorant of your having entertained the same
                    feelings for Ursula. What settlements are you prepared to make?"</p>
<p>This question was put so abruptly that a mixed feeling of indignation and
                    contempt completely mastered me. At these moments I possess the faculty of
                    sublime impertinence.</p>
<p>"I shall make Broadhem a liberal allowance, and settle an annuity upon yourself,
                    which my solicitor will pay you quarterly. I know the family is poor; it will
                    give me great pleasure to keep you all."</p>
<p>Lady Broadhem's lips quivered with anger; but the Duke of Dunderhead's second
                    son, who had inherited all the Flityville property through his mother, was a
                    fish worth landing, so she controlled her feelings with an effort of
                    self-possession which commanded my highest admiration, and said in a gentle tone
                    as she held out her hand with a subdued smile,—</p>
<p>"Forgive the natural anxiety of a mother, Lord Frank, as I forgive you for that
                    last speech." Here she lifted her eyes and remained silent for a few moments,
                    then she sighed deeply. She meant me to understand by this that she had been
                    permitted to overcome her feelings of resentment towards me, and was now
                    overflowing with Christian charity.</p>
<p>"Dear Lady Broadhem," I replied, affectionately, for I felt preternaturally
                    intelligent, and ready for the most elaborate maternal strategy, "how thankful
                    we ought to be that on an occasion of this kind we can both so thoroughly
                    command our feelings! Believe me, your anxiety for your daughter's welfare is
                    only equalled by the fervour of my affection for her. Shall we say —100,000 in
                    stock, and Flityville Park as a dower-house?"</p>
<p>"What stock, Lord Frank?" asked her ladyship, as she subsided languidly into a
                    chair; "not Mexicans or Spanish passives, I do most fervently trust."</p>
<p>"No," said I, maliciously; "nearly all in Confederate and Greek loans."</p>
<p>"Oh!" she ejaculated, with a little scream, as if something had stung her.</p>
<p>"What is the matter, Lady Broadhem?" and she looked so unhappy and disconcerted
                    that I had compassion on her. "I was only joking; you need be under no
                    apprehension as to the securities—they are as sound as your own theology, and
                    would satisfy the Lord Chancellor quite as well."</p>
<p>"Oh, it was not that! Perhaps some day when you and dear Ursula are married, I
                    will tell you all about it; for you have my full consent; and I need not say
                    what an escape I think she has had from that black man. <hi rend="italic">Entre
                        nous</hi>, as it is most important you should understand exactly the
                    situation, I must correct one error into which you have fallen; she is not in
                    love with you, Lord Frank; you must expect a little opposition at first; but
                    that will only add zest to the pursuit, and my wishes will be paramount in the
                    end. The fact is, but this is a profound secret, your friend Lord Grandon has
                    behaved most improperly in the matter. He came down on some pretence of
                    instilling his ridiculous notions into Broadhem, who took a fancy to him when we
                    were all staying at Lady Mundane's, and I strongly opposed it, as I fancied,
                    even then, he was paying Ursula too much attention; but she has such influence
                    with Broadhem that she carried her point, because, she said, her brother could
                    only get good from him. What exactly passed at Broadhem I don't know; but I was
                    so angry at the idea of an almost penniless Irish peer taking advantage of his
                    opportunities as a visitor to entrap my girl's affections, that I told him I
                    expected some people, and should want his bedroom. He left within an hour, and
                    Ursula declares he never uttered a word which warranted this decisive measure;
                    but people can do a good deal without 'uttering,' as she calls it; and I am
                    quite determined not to let them see anything of each other during the season.
                    Fortunately Lord Grandon scarcely ever goes out, and Broadhem, whose eyes are
                    opened at last, has promised to watch him. Whoever Ursula marries must do
                    something for Broadhem."</p>
<p>Although I am able to record this speech word for word, I am quite unable to
                    account for the curious psychological fact, that it has become engraven on my
                    memory, while, at the time, I was unconscious of listening to it. The pattern of
                    the carpet, a particular curl of Lady Broadhem's "front," the fact that the
                    clock struck one, are all stamped upon the plate of my internal perceptive
                    faculties with the vividness of a photograph. The vision of happiness which I
                    had conjured up was changing into a hideous contrast, and reminded me of the
                    Diorama at the Colosseum in my youth, where a fairy landscape, with a pastoral
                    group at lunch in the foreground, became gradually converted into a pandemonium
                    of flames and devils.</p>
<p>I felt borne along by a mighty torrent which was sweeping me from elysian fields
                    into some fathomless abyss. Love and friendship both coming down together in one
                    mighty crash, and the only thing left standing—Lady Broadhem—right in front of
                    me—a very stern reality indeed. I don't the least know the length of time which
                    elapsed between the end of her speech and when I returned to
                    consciousness—probably not many seconds, though it seemed an age. I gasped for
                    breath, so she kindly came to my relief.</p>
<p>"My dear Lord Frank," she said, "after all it might have been worse. Supposing
                    that Lord Grandon had not been your friend, or had not had the absurd Quixotic
                    ideas which I understand he has of the duties of friendship, he might have given
                    you immense trouble; as it is, I am sure he has only to know the exact state of
                    the case to retire. I know him quite well enough for that. I look upon it as
                    providential. Had it been Mr Chundango, Grandon would most probably have
                    persevered. Now he is quite capable of doing all he can to help you with
                    Ursula."</p>
<p>I groaned in spirit. How well had Lady Broadhem judged the character of the man
                    to whom she would not give her daughter!</p>
<p>"I am so glad to think, Lady Broadhem," said I, with a bitter laugh, "that you do
                    not suspect me of such a ridiculous exaggeration of sentiment. So far from it,
                    it seems to impart a peculiar piquancy to the pursuit when success is only
                    possible at the sacrifice of another's happiness; and when that other is one's
                    oldest friend, there is a refinement of emotion, a sort of pleasurable pain,
                    which is quite irresistible. To what element in our nature do you attribute
                    this?"</p>
<p>"To original sin, I am afraid," said Lady Broadhem, looking down, for my manner
                    seemed to puzzle, and make her nervous.</p>
<p>"Oh, it is not at all 'original,'" said I. "Whatever other merit it possesses, it
                    can't claim originality—it is the commonest thing in the world; but I think it
                    is an acquired taste at first—it grows upon you like caviar or olives. I
                    remember some years ago, in Australia, running away with the wife of a charming
                    fellow——"</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord Frank, Lord Frank, please stop! Have you repented? and where is
                    she?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, "I never intend to repent; and I'll tell you where she is after the
                    marriage."</p>
<p>At this crisis the demon of recklessness which had sustained me, and prompted the
                    above atrocious falsehood, deserted me suddenly, so I leant against the
                    mantelpiece and sobbed aloud. I remember deriving a malicious satisfaction from
                    the idea that Lady Broadhem thought I was weeping for my imaginary
                    Australian.</p>
<p>"How very dreadful!" said she, when I became somewhat calmer. "We must forget the
                    past, and try and reform ourselves, mustn't we?" she went on, caressingly; "but
                    I had no idea that you had passed through a <hi rend="italic">jeunesse
                        orageuse</hi>. Do you know, I think men, when they do steady, are always the
                    better for it."</p>
<p>"Well, I hope Lady Ursula may keep me quiet; nothing else ever has yet. I suppose
                    you won't expect me to go to church?"</p>
<p>"We'll talk about that after the marriage, to use your own expression," replied
                    Lady Broadhem, with a smile.</p>
<p>"Because, you know, I am worse than Grandon as regards orthodoxy. Now, Chundango
                    is so thoroughly sound, don't you think, after all, that that is the first
                    consideration?"</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth—but of course I never breathed it to Ursula—I attach a
                    good deal of importance to colour."</p>
<p>"Ah, I see; you classify us somewhat in this way: first, if you can get it, rich,
                    orthodox, and white; second, rich, heterdox, and white; third, rich, orthodox,
                    and black. Now, in my opinion, to attach any importance whatever to colour is
                    wicked. My objections to Mr Chundango do not apply to his skin, which is as good
                    as any other, but to his heart, which I am afraid is black. I prefer a pure
                    heart in a dark skin to a black heart in a white one," and I looked
                    significantly at her ladyship. "Supposing that out of friendship for Grandon I
                    should do the absurd thing of withdrawing my pretensions, what would
                    happen?"</p>
<p>"I should insist upon Ursula's marrying Mr Chundango. I tell you in confidence,
                    Lord Frank, that pecuniary reasons, which I will explain more fully at another
                    time, render it absolutely necessary that she should marry a man with means
                    within the next six months. The credit of our whole family is at stake; but it
                    is impossible for me to enter into details now." At this moment the luncheon was
                    announced. I followed Lady Broadhem mechanically towards the dining-room, but
                    instead of entering it went up-stairs like one in a dream, and ordered my
                    servant to make arrangements for my immediate departure. I pulled an arm-chair
                    near my bedroom fire, and gazed hopelessly into it.</p>
<p>People call me odd. I wonder really whether the conflicts of which my brain is
                    the occasional arena are fiercer than those of others. I wonder whether other
                    people's thoughts are as like clouds as mine are—sometimes, when it is stormy,
                    grouping themselves in wild fantastic forms; sometimes chasing each other
                    through vacancy, for no apparent purpose; sometimes melting away in "intense
                    inane;" and again consolidating themselves, black and lowering, till they burst
                    in a passionate explosion. What are they doing now? and I tried in vain to stop
                    the mental kaleidoscope which shifted itself so rapidly that I could not catch
                    one combination of thought before it was succeeded by another; but always the
                    same prominent figures dodging madly about the chambers of my brain—Chundango,
                    Ursula, Lady Broadhem, and Grandon; Lady Broadhem, Chundango, Grandon, and
                    Ursula—backwards and forwards, forwards and backwards, like some horrid word
                    that I had to spell in a game of letters, and could never bring right. Love,
                    friendship, hate, pity, admiration, treachery—more words to spell, ever
                    combining wrongly, and never letting me rest, till I thought something must
                    crack under the strain. Then mockingly came a voice ringing in my ears—Peace,
                    peace, peace—and I fancied myself lulled to rest in her arms, and I heard the
                    cooing of doves mingle with the soft murmur of her voice as she leant wistfully
                    over me, and I revelled in that most fatal of all nightmares—the nightmare of
                    those who, perishing of hunger and thirst, die of imaginary banquets. "Sweet
                    illusion," I said, "dear to me as reality, brood over my troubled spirit, deaden
                    its pain, heal its wounds, and weave around my being this delicious spell for
                    ever." Then suddenly, as though my brain had been a magazine into which a spark
                    had fallen, it blazed up; my hair bristled, and drops stood upon my forehead,
                    for a great fear had fallen upon me. It had invaded me with the force of an
                    overwhelming torrent, carrying all before it. It said, "Whence is the calm that
                    soothes you? Infatuated dreamer, think you it is the subsiding of the storm, and
                    not rather the lull that precedes it? Beware of the sleep of the frozen, from
                    which there is no waking." What was this? was my mind regaining its balance, or
                    was it going to lose it for ever? Most horrid doubt! the very thought was so
                    much in the scale on the wrong side. Oh for something to lean upon—some strong
                    stay of common-sense to support me! I yearned for the practical—some fact on
                    which to build. "I have got it," I exclaimed suddenly. "There must be some
                    osseous matter behind my dura mater!" I shall never forget the consolation which
                    this notion gave me: it relieved me from any further psychological
                    responsibility, so to speak; I gave up mental analysis. I attributed the keen
                    susceptibility of my —sthetic nature to this cause, and accepted it as I would
                    the gout, without a murmur. Still I needed repose and solitude, so I determined
                    to go to Flityville and arrange my ideas, no longer alarmed at the confusion in
                    which they were, but with the steadfast purpose of disentangling them quietly,
                    as I would an interesting knot. Hitherto I had been tearing at it madly and
                    making it worse; now I had got the end of the skein—"osseous matter"—and would
                    soon unravel it. So I descended calmly to the drawing-room.</p>
<p>I found it empty, but it occurred to me I had left my letter to Lady Ursula in
                    the recess, and in the agitation attending my interview with Lady Broadhem, had
                    forgotten to go back for it. I pushed back the <hi rend="italic">portière</hi>,
                    and saw seated at the writing-table Lady Ursula herself. She looked pale and
                    nervous, while I felt overwhelmed with confusion and embarrassment. This was the
                    more trying, as many years have elapsed since I have experienced any such
                    sensations.</p>
<p>"Oh, you don't happen to have seen a letter lying about anywhere, do you, Lady
                    Ursula?" said I. "It ought to be under your hand, for I left it exactly on that
                    spot."</p>
<p>"No," she said; "I found mamma writing here when I came, and she took a packet of
                    letters away with her; perhaps she put yours among them by mistake. She will be
                    back from her drive almost immediately."</p>
<p>"I hope so," said I. "I should be sorry to leave without seeing her."</p>
<p>"To leave, Lord Frank! I thought you were going to stay till Monday." She looked
                    up rather appealingly, I thought, as if my presence would have been a
                    satisfaction to her under the circumstances; and I saw, as I returned her steady
                    earnest gaze, that she little guessed the purport of the missing letter.</p>
<p>At that moment my head began to swim, and the figures to dance about in my brain
                    again. Chundango and Grandon seemed locked in a death-struggle, and Ursula, with
                    dishevelled hair, trying to separate them, while Lady Broadhem, in the
                    background, was clapping her hands and urging them on. I seemed spinning round
                    the group with such rapidity that I was obliged to steady myself with one hand
                    against the back of Lady Ursula's chair.</p>
<p>"What's the matter? what's the matter, Lord Frank?" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Osseous matter, osseous matter," I murmured mechanically, and it sounded so like
                    an echo of her words that I am sure she thought me going mad. Should I throw
                    myself at her feet and tell her all? If she would only trample upon me and my
                    feelings together, it would be a luxury compared to the agony of self-control I
                    was inflicting upon myself. If I could only pour myself out in a torrent of
                    passionate expression, and wind up with a paroxysm of tears, she was welcome to
                    treat me as a raving lunatic, but I should be much less likely to become one.
                    But how, knowing what I did, could I face Grandon afterwards? Before that fatal
                    conversation with Lady Broadhem, I should have had the satisfaction of hearing
                    my fate from Lady Ursula herself, and I know that she would have treated me so
                    tenderly that rejection would have been a thousand times preferable to this. She
                    would have known then the intensity of my affection, she would have heard from
                    my own lips the burning words with which I would have pleaded my cause, and,
                    whatever might have been the result, would have pitied and felt for me. Now, if
                    I say nothing, and Lady Broadhem tells her when I am gone that she considers us
                    engaged, what will Ursula think of me? Again, if Lady Broadhem thinks I am
                    really going to do what my conscience urges, and sacrifice myself for Grandon,
                    then, poor girl, she will be sacrificed to Chundango.</p>
<p>Nothing but misery will come out of that double event: if I do what is right, it
                    will bring misery; if I do what is wrong, it will bring misery too,—that is one
                    consolation—it makes the straight and narrow path easier. The only difficulty
                    is, I can't find it—and standing here with my hand on her chair, my head
                    swimming, and Lady Ursula looking anxiously up at me, I am not likely to find
                    it.</p>
<p>"Lord Frank, do let me ring the bell and send for a glass of water," she said at
                    last.</p>
<p>"Thanks, no; the fact is, that letter I have lost causes me the greatest anxiety,
                    and when I thought what the consequences might be of its going astray I felt a
                    little faint for a moment."</p>
<p>"Dear me," said Lady Ursula, kindly, "I will make mamma look for it at once, and
                    I am sure if it is a matter in which my sympathy could be of any use, you will
                    appreciate my motive in offering it; but I do think in this world people might
                    be of so much more use to each other than they are, if they would only trust one
                    another, and believe in the sincerity of friendship. Although you did try to
                    shock me last night," she said, with a smile, "I have heard so much of you from
                    Lord Grandon, and know how kind and good you are, although he says you are too
                    enthusiastic and too fond of paradoxes, but I assure you I consider you quite an
                    old friend. You remember, years ago, when I was a little girl, how you used to
                    gallop about with me on my pony in the park at Broadhem? You won't think me
                    inquisitive, I am sure, in saying this, but there are moments sometimes when it
                    is a relief to find a listener to the history of one's troubles."</p>
<p>"But when, by a curious fatality, that listener is the cause of them all, these
                    moments are not likely to arrive," I thought, but did not say. Is it not enough
                    to love a woman to distraction, and be obliged by every principle of honour to
                    conceal it from her, without her pressing upon you her sympathy, and inviting
                    your confidence? and the very tenderness which had prompted her speech rose up
                    against her in judgment in my mind. So ready with her friendship, too! Should I
                    tell her bitterly that she was the only being in the whole world whose
                    friendship could aggravate my misery? Should I congratulate her upon the
                    ingenuity she had displayed in thus torturing me? or should I revenge myself by
                    giving her the confidence she asked, and requesting her to advise me how to act
                    under the circumstances? Then I looked at the gentle earnest face, and my heart
                    melted. My troubles! Do I not know too well what hers are? Perhaps it would be a
                    relief to her to hear, that if worse comes to worst, she can always escape
                    Chundango by falling back upon me. If she is driven to begging me to offer
                    myself up on her shrine, what a very willing sacrifice she would find me! As she
                    knows that I must have overheard what passed between her and Chundango this
                    morning, shall I make a counter-proposition of mutual confidence, and allude
                    delicately to that most painful episode! If she is generous enough to forget her
                    own troubles and think of me, why should not I forget mine and think of her? The
                    idea of this contradiction in terms struck me as so exquisitely ludicrous, that
                    I laughed aloud.</p>
<p>"Ha! ha! ha! Lady Ursula, if you only knew what a comic aspect that last kind
                    speech of yours has given to the whole affair. Don't think me ungrateful or
                    rude, but—ha! ha! ha!" Here I went off again. "When once my sense of humour is
                    really touched, I always seem to see the point of a joke to quite a painful
                    degree. Upon two occasions I have suffered from fits after punning, and riddles
                    always make me hysterical; but I assure you, you unconsciously made a joke just
                    now when you asked me to tell you exactly what I felt, which I shall remember as
                    long as I live, for it will certainly be the death of me—ha! ha! ha!" But Lady
                    Ursula had risen from her chair and rung the bell before I had finished my
                    speech, and I was still laughing when the servant came into the room, followed
                    by Lady Broadhem and Lady Bridget.</p>
<p>"Dear me," said Lady Broadhem, with her most winning smile, "how very merry you
                    are!—at least Lord Frank is. You seem a little pale, dear," turning to Ursula;
                    "what is the matter?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing, mamma. Lord Frank has been looking for a letter in the recess. You
                    don't happen to have put it up with yours, do you?"</p>
<p>"No, my dear, I think not," said Lady Broadhem, looking through a bundle. "Who
                    was it to, Lord Frank, if you will pardon my curiosity? I shall find it more
                    easily if you will give me the address."</p>
<p>"Nobody in particular," said I, "so it does not matter; you can keep it and read
                    it. It is a riddle; that is what has been amusing us so much. Lady Ursula has
                    been making such absurd attempts to guess it. Good-bye, Lady Broadhem. Here is
                    the servant come to say that my fly is at the door."</p>
<p>"Good gracious! Why, where are you going?" said she, evidently imagining that her
                    daughter and I had had some thrilling episode, and that I was going away in a
                    huff, so I determined to mystify her still more.</p>
<p>"Oh, only to Flityville to get everything ready; you know what a state the place
                    is in. Now," and I looked tenderly into the amazed face of Lady Ursula, "I shall
                    indeed have an object in putting it in order, and I shall expect you and Lady
                    Ursula to come some day soon and suggest the improvements. I have only one
                    request to make before leaving, and I do so, Lady Ursula, in the presence of
                    your mother and sister; and that is, that until I see you again, the subject of
                    our conversation just now may never be alluded to between yourselves. Trust in
                    me, Lady Broadhem," I said, taking her hand affectionately, "and promise me you
                    will not ask Lady Ursula what I have just told her; if you do," I whispered,
                    "you will spoil all," and I looked happy and mysterious. "Do you promise?"</p>
<p>"I do," said Lady Broadhem.</p>
<p>"And now, Lady Ursula," I said, crossing over to her and taking her hand, "once
                    more good-bye, and"—I went on in so low a tone that it was impossible for Lady
                    Broadhem to overhear it, but it made her feel sure that all was arranged between
                    us—"you have got the most terrible secret of my life. I know I can trust you.
                    You have seen me"—and I formed the word with my lips rather than uttered it with
                    my breath—"MAD! Hush!" for Lady Ursula gave a quick exclamation, and almost
                    fainted with alarm; "I am myself again now. Remember my happiness is in your
                    keeping"—this out loud for Lady Broadhem's benefit. "I am going to say good-bye
                    to Lady Dickiefield, and you shall hear from me when I can receive you at
                    Flityville."</p>
<p>I am endowed with a somewhat remarkable faculty, which I have not been in the
                    habit of alluding to, partly because my friends think me ridiculous if I do, and
                    partly because I never could see any use in it, but I do nevertheless possess
                    the power of seeing in the dark. Not after the manner of cats—the objects which
                    actually exist—but images which sometimes appear as the condensations of a white
                    misty-looking substance, and sometimes take a distinctly bright luminous
                    appearance. As I gaze into absolute darkness, I first see a cloud, which
                    gradually seems to solidify into a shape, either of an animal or some definite
                    object. In the case of the more brilliant image, the appearance is immediate and
                    evanescent. It comes and goes like a flash, and the subject is generally
                    significant and beautiful. Perhaps some of my readers may be familiar with this
                    phenomenon, and may account for it as being the result of what they call
                    imagination, which is only putting the difficulty one step back; or may adopt
                    the wiser course which I have followed, and not endeavour to account for it at
                    all. Whatever be its origin, the fact remains, and I only advert to it now, as
                    it is the best illustration I can think of to describe the mental process
                    through which I passed in the train on my way to Flityville. My mind seemed at
                    first a white mist—a blank sheet of paper. My interview with Lady Ursula had
                    produced this effect upon it. Gradually, and quite unconsciously to myself, so
                    far as any mental effort was concerned, my thoughts seemed to condense into a
                    definite plan of action; now and then a brilliant idea would appear like a
                    flash, and vanish sometimes before I could catch it; but in so far as the
                    complication in which Grandon, Ursula, the Broadhem family, and myself were
                    concerned, I seemed to see my way, or at all events to feel sure that my way
                    would be shown to me, if I let my inspirations guide me. When once one achieves
                    this thorough confidence in one's inspirations, the journey of life becomes
                    simplified. You never wonder what is round the next corner, and begin to prepare
                    for unknown contingencies; but you wait till the corner is turned, and the
                    contingency arrives, and passively allow your mind to crystallise itself into a
                    plan of action. At this moment, of course, I have no more notion what is going
                    to happen to me than you have. Divest your mind, my friend, that I know anything
                    more of the plot of this story of my life which you are reading than you do. I
                    positively have not the slightest idea what either I or any of the ladies and
                    gentlemen to whom I have introduced you are likely to do, or how it is all going
                    to end. I have told you the mental process under which I act; and, of course,
                    this is the mere record of those inspirations. Very often the most unlikely
                    things occur to me all of a sudden: thus, while my mind was, as it were,
                    trifling with the events which I have recounted, and throwing them into a
                    variety of combinations, it flashed upon me in the most irrelevant manner that I
                    would send —4000 anonymously to the Bishop of London's fund. In another second
                    the unconscious train of thought which led me to this determination revealed
                    itself. "Here," said I, "have I been attacking this poor colonial bishop and the
                    Establishment to which he belongs, and what have I given him in return? I expose
                    the abuses of his theological and ecclesiastical system, but I provide him with
                    no remedy. I fling one big stone at the crystal palace in which Protestantism is
                    shrivelling away, and another big stone at the crystal palace in which
                    Catholicism is rotting, and I offer them in exchange the cucumber-frame under
                    which I am myself squatting uncomfortably. I owe them an apology. Unfortunately
                    I have not yet found either the man or the body of men who do not prefer hard
                    cash to an apology—provided, of course, it be properly proportioned to the
                    susceptibility of their feelings or the delicacy of their sense of honour.
                    Fairly, now," I asked myself, "if it was put to the Bench of Bishops, would they
                    consider —5000 sufficient to compensate the Church for the expressions I made
                    use of to one of their order?" "More than sufficient," myself replied. "Then we
                    will make it four thousand." But the whole merit of the action lies in the
                    anonymous, and so nobody knows till they read this who it was made that
                    munificent donation. That I should have afterwards changed my mind, and answered
                    the advertisement of the committee, which appeared in the "agony" column of the
                    'Times,' who wanted to know how I wished the money applied, by a request that it
                    should be paid back to my account at the Bank, does not affect the question; I
                    merely wished to show the nature of my impulses, and the readiness with which I
                    act upon them.</p>
<p>Some days elapsed after my arrival at Flityville before I felt moved to write to
                    Grandon. The fact is, I was writing this record of my trials for the world in
                    general, and did not know what to say to him in particular. At length, feeling
                    that I owed him an explanation, I wrote as follows:—</p>
<l>"<hi rend="smcap">Flityville</hi>, <hi rend="italic">March 19</hi>. </l>
<p>"You are doubtless surprised, my dear fellow," I began, "at my turning myself
                    into a hermit at this most inopportune season of the year; but the fact is, that
                    shortly after you left Dickiefield, I became so deeply impressed with the
                    responsibility of the great work I had undertaken, that I perceived that a
                    period of retirement and repose was absolutely necessary with a view to the
                    elaboration of some system which should enable me to grapple with the great
                    moral and social questions upon which I am engaged.</p>
<p>"Diverting my anxious gaze from Christendom generally, I concentrated it upon my
                    own country, in the hope that I might discover the root of its disease. Morbid
                    activity of the national brain, utterly deranged action of the national heart.
                    Those were the symptoms—unmistakable. Proximate cause also not difficult to
                    arrive at. Due to the noxious influence of tall chimneys upon broad acres,
                    whereby the commercial effluvium of the Plutocracy has impregnated the upper
                    atmosphere, and overpowered the enfeebled and enervated faculties of the
                    aristocracy; lust of gain has supervened upon love of ease. Hence the utter
                    absence of those noble and generous impulses which are the true indications of
                    healthy national life. Expediency has taken the place of principle; conscience
                    has been crushed out of the system by calculation. The life-blood of the
                    country, instead of bounding along its veins, creeps sluggishly through them,
                    till it threatens to stagnate altogether, and congestion becomes imminent.</p>
<p>"Looked at from what I may term 'externals,' we simply present to the world at
                    large the ignoble spectacle of a nation of usurers trembling over our
                    money-bags; looked at from internals, I perceive that we are suffering from a
                    moral opiate, to the action of which I attribute the unhappy complaints that I
                    have endeavoured to describe. This pernicious narcotic has been absorbed by us
                    for hundreds of years unsuspected and unperceived under the guise of a popular
                    theology. We have become so steeped in the insane delusion, now many centuries
                    old, that we are a Christian nation, that I anticipate with dread the reaction
                    which will take place when men awaken to the true character of the religious
                    quackery with which they have been duped, and, overlooking in their frenzy the
                    distinction which exists between ancient and modern Christianity, will repudiate
                    the former with horror, which, after all, does not deserve to be condemned, for
                    it has never yet been tried as a political system in any country. Individuals
                    only profess to be theoretically governed by it. Nor would it be possible, as
                    society is at present constituted, for any man to carry out its principles in
                    daily life. That any statesman would be instantly ruined who should openly
                    announce that he intended to govern the country on purely Christian principles,
                    may be made clear to the simplest comprehension. For instance, imagine our
                    Foreign Minister getting up in the House of Commons and justifying his last
                    stroke of foreign policy upon the ground that we should 'love our neighbours
                    better than ourselves, or penning a despatch to any power that we felt
                    'persecuted' by blessing it. When do we even do good to anybody in our national
                    capacity, much less to them 'that hate us'? We certainly pray like Chinamen when
                    we want to propitiate an angry Deity about the cattle-plague; but who ever heard
                    of 'a form of prayer to be used' for nations 'who despitefully use us.' Fancy
                    the Chancellor of the Exchequer informing us that instead of laying up for the
                    nation treasures upon earth, he proposed realising all that the country
                    possessed and giving it to the poor. Christian Churchmen and statesmen do not
                    therefore sufficiently believe in the power and efficacy of the Christian moral
                    code to trust the nation to it alone. Hence they have invented ecclesiastical
                    organisations and theological dogmas as anodynes; and the people have been
                    lulled into security by the singular notion, that if they supported the one and
                    professed to believe in the other, they were different from either Mohammedans
                    or Bhuddists. In a word, it is the curse of England that its intellect can see
                    truths which its heart will not embody. The more I think of it the more I am
                    disposed to risk the assertion, that if, as is supposed, the moral code called
                    Christian is divine, it is only not practicable, literally, by the nation for
                    lack of national heart-faith. I tell you this in confidence, for I am already
                    considered so wild and visionary upon all these matters, and so thoroughly
                    unsound, that I should not like it to be generally known, for fear of its
                    injuring my political prospects. In the mean time it will very much assist me in
                    arriving at some of my conclusions, if you will kindly procure for me, from any
                    leading member of the Legislature, lay or clerical, answers to the following
                    questions:—</p>
<p>"First, Whether Jonah could possibly have had anything to say to Nineveh which
                    would not apply with equal force to this Christian metropolis?—and if so,
                    What?</p>
<p>"Second, Specify the sins which were probably committed in Chorazin or Bethsaida,
                    but which have not yet been perpetrated in London.</p>
<p>"Third, As statecraft (assisted by priestcraft) consists not in making the State
                    better but richer, explain why it is easier for a collection of rich men—called
                    a nation—to be saved, than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, but
                    not so easy for one man.</p>
<p>"Fourth, Does the saying that the love of money is the root of all evil apply to
                    a nation as well as to an individual?—and if not, how does it happen that the
                    more we accumulate wealth, the more we increase poverty and misery and
                    crime?</p>
<p>"That is enough for the present. But oh! what a string of questions I could
                    propound to these stumbling pagans, stupefied by the fatuous superstition that
                    their country is safer than other countries which have come to judgment, because
                    they are called by a particular name! Is there among them all not the faintest
                    consciousness of an impending doom? or is the potency of the drug such that it
                    is impossible to raise a cry loud enough to rouse them? Why will they go on
                    vainly trying to solve the impossible problem of Government, never seeing that
                    whatever system is introduced is merely a rearrangement of sinners; that voters
                    are like cards—the more you shuffle them the dirtier they get; and that it is of
                    no use agitating for a reform in the franchise without first agitating for a
                    reform in the consciences of those who are to exercise it, and in the
                    fundamental principles of the policy upon which we are to be governed.</p>
<p>"Wisely saith the greatest poet of the age, as yet, alas! unknown to fame:—</p>
<l>"Reformers fail because they change the letter, </l>
<l>And not the spirit, of the world's design. </l>
<l>Tyrant and slave create the scourge and fetter— </l>
<l>As is the worshipper, will be the shrine. </l>
<l>The ideal fails, though perfect were the plan, </l>
<l>World-harmony springs through the perfect man. </l>
<l>We burn out life in hot impatient striving; </l>
<l>We dash ourselves against the hostile spears: </l>
<l>The bale-tree, that our naked hands are riving, </l>
<l>Unites to crush us. Ere our manhood's years, </l>
<l>We sow the rifled blossoms of the prime, </l>
<l>Then fruitlessly are gathered out of time. </l>
<l>We seek to change souls all unripe for changes; </l>
<l>We build upon a treacherous human soil </l>
<l>Of moral quicksand, and the world avenges </l>
<l>Its crime upon us, while we vainly toil. </l>
<l>In the black coal-pit of the popular heart </l>
<l>Rain falls, light kindles, but no flowers upstart. </l>
<l>Know this! For men of ignoble affection, </l>
<l>The social scheme that is, were better far </l>
<l>Than the orbed sun's most exquisite perfection, </l>
<l>Man needs not heaven till he revolves a star. </l>
<l>Why seek to win the mad world from its strife? </l>
<l>Grow perfect in the sanity of life."<ref target="#ENG18700_N2">[2]</ref>

<p>"Ah, my dear friend! how often, from my humble seat below the gangway, have I
                    gazed upon the Treasury Bench, and wondered how it was that right hon.
                    gentlemen, struggling to retain their dignity by sitting on each other's knees,
                    did not perceive that the reason why great reforms perpetually fail is, not
                    because they have not their root in some radical injustice—not because the
                    despotisms against which they rise are in themselves right—but because those who
                    attempt to inaugurate new and better conditions upon the surfaces of society are
                    themselves, for the most part, desolate, darkened, and chaotic within! I am
                    under the impression, therefore, that no reform-agitation will ever do good
                    which is not preceded by an agitation, throughout the length and breadth of the
                    land, in favour of the introduction, for the first time, of this old original
                    moral code, not merely into the government of the country, but into the life of
                    every individual. Unless that is done, and done speedily, those who are now
                    morally stupefied will die in their torpor, and the rest who are harmless
                    lunatics will become gibbering and shrieking demoniacs.—</p>
<l>Yours affectionately, </l>
<l>"F. V." </l>
<p>I had become so absorbed by the train of considerations into which I had been
                    led, that I never thought of mentioning to Grandon the circumstances which
                    attended my departure from Dickiefield. It was not until after I had posted my
                    letter that it occurred to me how singular, considering the last words which
                    passed between us, this silence would appear. If to be odd has its drawbacks, it
                    also has its advantages; and I felt that Grandon would be as unable to draw any
                    conclusions from my silence as from any other erratic act of my life. After all,
                    what could I have said? It will be time, I thought, to venture upon that very
                    delicate ground when I get his reply. But this I was destined never to receive,
                    and the questions I had propounded are likely to remain unanswered, for on the
                    very next day I received the following telegram from Lady Broadhem:—</p>

                        fatal.</p><p>"<hi rend="smcap">Mary Broadhem.</hi></p><p>"<hi rend="smcap">Grosvenor Square</hi>, <hi rend="italic">20th March</hi>."</p></quote>
