<head>PART V. THE FLESH.</head>
<p>Piccadilly, <hi rend="italic">June</hi>. </p>
<p>Somebody ought to compile a handbook for <hi rend="italic">débutants</hi> and <hi rend="italic">débutantes</hi>, setting forth the most approved modes of
                    procuring invitations to balls and parties during the London season. Not only
                    would it be a very invaluable guide now, but it would be interesting for
                    posterity to refer to as illustrating the manners and customs of their
                    ancestors, and accounting for the hereditary taint of snobbism which is probably
                    destined to characterise in an eminent degree the population of the British
                    Isles. "En Angleterre," said a cynical Dutch diplomatist, "numéro deux va chez
                    numéro un, pour s'en glorifier auprès de numéro trois." Had he gone to the
                    Bodwinkle ball, he would have remarked a curious inversion of his aphorism, for
                    there it was <hi rend="italic">numéro un</hi> who went down to <hi rend="italic">numéro deux</hi>. But I must leave it to Van den Bosch (that, I think, was
                    his name) to discover what there was to boast about to number three. He was
                    evidently a profound philosopher, but I doubt his getting to the bottom of this
                    great social problem. To do so he would have to look at it free from all petty
                    prejudice, recognising its sublime as well as its ridiculous features. Why did
                    Duchesses struggle to be asked to Bodwinkle's? I almost think a new phase of
                    snobbism is cropping out, and the rivalry will be to try, not who can rise
                    highest, but who can sink lowest, in the social scale. The fashionable world is
                    so <hi rend="italic">blasé</hi> of itself that it has positively become tired of
                    worshipping wealth, unless its owners possess the charm of extreme vulgarity.
                    Its taste has become so vitiated by being unnaturally excited and pandered to,
                    that we shall have to invent some new object of ambition. Why, for instance,
                    should not a select clique of Oxford Street shopkeepers give a series of parties
                    which might become the rage for one season? They have only to get two or three
                    leaders of <hi rend="italic">ton</hi> to patronise them at first, and be very
                    exclusive and select in their invitations afterwards, to insure success. A year
                    or two ago the thing to do was Cremorne; why not have an Oxford Street year? The
                    Bodwinkle tendency will result at last in its being the great ambition of a
                    man's life to get his daughters asked to "a little music and a few friends" at
                    his bootmaker's.</p>
<p>In Paris, which is becoming rapidly impregnated with this spirit, that city being
                    in a very receptive condition for everything bad from all parts of the world—in
                    Paris, I say, they have made a very good start, as any of my fair friends who
                    have patronised Mr Worth's afternoon tea-parties in the Rue de la Paix will
                    readily acknowledge. They will bear testimony to the good taste of the milliner,
                    and I to the bad taste of his customers. That vain women in the highest circles
                    of Parisian fashion can, in an eager rivalry to display as much of their backs
                    as possible, endeavour to obtain the especial patronage of a man-dressmaker, by
                    accepting his invitations to tea, should be a warning to you, O gentle English
                    dames! of what you may come to. Why sacrifice self-respect and propriety to
                    shoulder-straps? Why insist upon it that there is only one man in the world who
                    knows how to cut out a dress behind? Supposing he can bring it an inch lower
                    down than anybody else—if you give that inch, beware of the ell. Why, oh why,
                    advertise your clothes in the newspapers? Is it not enough to puff your
                    dinner-parties in the public journals at so much a "notice," without paying 15s.
                    apiece to your dressmaker to put your names into the 'Morning Post,' coupled
                    with your wearing apparel, every time you go to Court? If you persist in the
                    practice, let me recommend you, as a measure of economy, to put in your own
                    advertisements. The press charge is 10s. 6d.; the dressmaker pockets the other
                    4s. 6d. Or else be generous: why keep the whole advertisement to yourself? let
                    the poor dressmaker put her name in as having furnished the raiment, and she
                    will, perhaps, let you off the 4s. 6d.; otherwise, you may do it still cheaper
                    by bills on hoardings—</p>

<p>I am not sure that to attend the professional social gatherings of a Parisian
                    "undressmaker" and pay him twenty francs a "look" is not less objectionable, but
                    this is the British way of worshipping the same idol. This vein of reflection
                    was suggested to me by Bodwinkle's ball. Talk of sermons in stones! they are
                    nothing to the sermons contained in drums and balls.</p>
<p>First, I have already let my readers into the secret history of that ball. I have
                    told them how Lady Broadhem and Spiffy Goldtip combined their resources and
                    launched the Bodwinkles in Vanity Fair with a gorgeous mansion and Lady
                    Mundane's invitation list. To describe all Spiffy's exertions in the Bodwinkle
                    cause for some days prior to the ball would be impossible. To tell of the
                    extraordinary suggestions that Bodwinkle was continually making with reference
                    to the decoration of the banisters, the arrangements for supper, and the utter
                    ignorance he displayed throughout of the nature of the enterprise upon which he
                    had embarked, would occupy more space than I can afford. To give a list of the
                    guests would be superfluous, as they were very accurately reported in the
                    columns of the 'Morning Post.' In spite of all Spiffy could do, Bodwinkle would
                    insist upon inviting a number of his own friends, and nearly ruined the party
                    irretrievably by allowing one man to bring his daughters. However, as Mrs B. did
                    not take the slightest notice of them, and as they knew nobody, they went away
                    early. Nevertheless, as Lady Veriphast said, "There were all kinds of people
                    that one had never seen in one's life before." This was the great mistake.
                    People don't yet humiliate themselves to get invitations to meet people they
                    never saw before. They may come to that, but at present nothing is worth going
                    to unless all society wants to go: then anything is. Now Spiffy had so managed,
                    that by a judicious system of puffing he had excited immense interest in the
                    Bodwinkle ball—he had been morally bill-sticking it in all the clubs for weeks
                    past. He had told the most <hi rend="italic">r—pandu</hi> young dancing men that
                    it would be impossible for him to get them invitations. If Bodwinkle had been
                    General Tom Thumb, and Spiffy had been Barnum, he could not have achieved a
                    greater success. He had insisted upon Bodwinkle having Mrs B. painted by the
                    most fashionable artist and exhibited in the Academy, where the hanging
                    committee, some of whom were at the ball afterwards, gave it a good place, and
                    the 'Times' critic gave it half a column. Until then he had kept her dark. No
                    one had ever seen Mrs Bodwinkle, except three or four literary men, who
                    discreetly and mysteriously alluded to her intellect, and a naughty duke, who
                    indiscreetly and less mysteriously alluded to her charms. People began to want
                    to make Mrs Bodwinkle's acquaintance some time before the ball, but she
                    resolutely denied herself. The only men who were let into the secret were Bower,
                    Scraper, and a few others skilled in the art of socially advertising. Their
                    principal function consisted in asking every one of their friends for some time
                    before whether they were going to the Bodwinkle ball. It oozed out, through
                    Spiffy, that I knew something of Bodwinkle, and the result was that I was
                    bombarded with requests to procure invitations. This was the style of note that
                    arrived incessantly. This is from Mary, Marchioness of Pimlico:—</p>
<quote><p>"<hi rend="smcap">Dear Lord Frank</hi>,—Lady Mundane tells me that you are
                        one of the privileged few who can get invitations to the Bodwinkles'. Please

                        season.—Yours truly,</p><p>"<hi rend="smcap">Mary Pimlico</hi>."</p></quote>
<p>Here is another one:—</p>

                        get an invitation for <hi rend="italic">my very great friend</hi>, Amy
                        Rumsort, for the Bodwinkles'. She is most anxious to go, <hi rend="italic">for very particular</hi> reasons. I will tell you them when we meet.
                        Spiffy Goldtip sent mamma mine, but declines to come to the front about
                        Amy.—Yours most sincerely, <hi rend="smcap">Harriet Wylde</hi>."</p></quote>
<p>"Wild Harrie" is the name by which this young lady is usually known among her
                    sporting friends. She is a promising <hi rend="italic">débutante</hi>, and very
                    properly calls herself "first favourite" of the season.</p>
<p>"Dear me," thought I, as I opened a series of similar epistles, "if I were the
                    head of a public department, who only recommended honours to be given to those
                    who applied for them oftenest, and if all these were meritorious public servants
                    wanting C.B.'s, or gallant soldiers anxious for Victoria Crosses, they could not
                    beg more pertinaciously and unblushingly." And I made a list of the petitioners,
                    leaving out those who had written to me without knowing me, and went to the
                    club, where I intrusted them to Spiffy, with a peremptory request that he would
                    distribute the required invitations upon pain of my financial displeasure.</p>
<p>Spiffy gave me some curious statistics about invitations and the means employed
                    to obtain them. Three ladies who never asked him to their parties, and whom he
                    had therefore left out, though all more or less leaders of the <hi rend="italic">beau monde</hi>, actually wrote to Mrs Bodwinkle in various strains—one was
                    a threatening, the other an appealing letter, and the third assumed that she had
                    been omitted by mistake. Two young gentlemen had the impertinence, after trying
                    every other mode in vain, actually to call on Mrs Bodwinkle, and extract
                    invitations from that bewildered woman, who was too much frightened to refuse
                    them. Bodwinkle was not idle in the House, and two Liberals and an extreme
                    Radical, all young, unable to resist temptation, voted against the Government on
                    the promise of invitations. As for Spiffy, even he was acquiring fresh social
                    experience, and tells me he can scarcely resist entering upon a pecuniary <hi rend="italic">exploitation</hi> of his position in society. "There is," said
                    that enterprising and original individual, "so much to be done by a man of
                    genius. Just look what is open to me in this line,——</p>

                    parties obtained at a reasonable amount. Charges moderate for introductions to
                    Clubs. No charge whatever for introductions to noblemen.'</p>
<p>"Or in this line,—</p>
<p>"'To Debutantes and Others in want of Chaperonage.—Young ladies whose mothers are

                    or who are unexpectedly at the last moment deprived of their natural protectors,
                    on applying to the undersigned will be provided with suitable chaperons. The

                    highest circles of society. No debutante or young lady whose birth and
                    antecedents do not entitle her to the same privilege need apply. <hi rend="smcap">Spiffington Goldtip</hi>.'</p>
<p>"Then the <hi rend="italic">pendant</hi> to this would be,—</p>
<p>"'To Married Women or Widows without Daughters.—Married women, or widows without

                    and who are capable of undertaking the duties of chaperon, are requested to
                    apply to the Honourable Spiffington Goldtip. The Hon. S. G. has a large stock of
                    debutantes, and other young ladies in want of chaperons, always on hand. The
                    strictest references given and required.'</p>
<p>"You may laugh," Spiffy went on, "but I assure you the sort of successes I have
                    in my own line are quite astonishing. Look what a hit I've made with Wild
                    Harrie—her mother, Lady Wylde, you remember, was her husband's brother's
                    governess. Well, I said plainly to her, 'You will ruin that girl's chances if
                    you attempt to force her on society in your own way. You can't afford to
                    entertain upon the right scale, and you won't be asked anywhere unless you do,
                    for there is a set going to be made against Harriet. If you will leave her to
                    me, I know her strong points, and will see her through the whole business as if
                    she was my own sister.'" I must here remark <hi rend="italic">en passant</hi>
                    that Spiffy is apparently capable of doing the most unselfish things, and of
                    taking an infinity of trouble upon himself out of pure good-nature.</p>
<p>"What was your <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi>?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, it was all plain sailing enough. The first thing to provide was a popular
                    chaperon, and the second a special reputation. Now Harrie is a wonderful rider,
                    and knows a horse thoroughly. Then she looks like a high-bred Arab herself,
                    though her mother was a governess, and I felt sure Dick Helter would fall a
                    victim. So I introduced her to the Helters. As Lady Jane goes in for safeness,
                    she does not like married women, and always smiles most kindly upon any girl
                    that pleases her husband; so I knew if I could get Harrie by her side on the top
                    of Helter's drag, the next step was a certainty, and that I had secured my
                    chaperon. The result has fully justified my expectations. Harrie has secured the
                    box-seat <hi rend="italic">en permanence</hi>, went down to the Derby on
                    Helter's drag, and won a pot on the French horse under his judicious advice.
                    Little Haultort, and all the other men who lost to her, adore her of course, and
                    all the girls in London hate her; but whenever the mammas object to asking her
                    on account of 'that horrid Lady Wylde,' I floor all opposition by saying, 'Oh,
                    Lady Jane Helter will bring her.' I wonder," said Spiffy, with a sigh, "when she
                    has made her little game, whether she will remember to whom she owed it?"</p>
<p>"Now, do you find much ingratitude of this kind?" I asked, inquiringly.</p>
<p>"No," said Spiffy. "I must say on the whole my experience of the world in this
                    respect is, that it is not so black as it is painted. It is true that I
                    attribute its gratitude chiefly to laziness. For instance, in my own case, so
                    long as I hold the position I do in society, people who insisted upon being
                    ungrateful to me would find it hard work. By the way, I observe you don't go out
                    as much as you used—how's that?" This was no business of Spiff's, so I said
                    sublimely, "Because the aristocracy bore me, and the middle classes grate upon
                    my nerves.—But about this little girl: she is rather an ally of mine, so you
                    must see that her friend, Miss Rumsort, has the card."</p>
<p>"It is too bad!" broke out Spiffy. "The way that girl and her married sister are
                    trying to take the world by storm is intolerable. It does not matter whether
                    they know the people they apply to or not, it is always the same story. She
                    pretends she is tremendously in love with Larkington because he goes everywhere,
                    and her sister looks sentimental, and tries to work upon your feelings about
                    'poor Amy,' whose only object in life is to meet him; but it is all a dodge to
                    get asked. She cares no more for Larkington than for me. Now, I'll be bound Wild
                    Harrie put something about <hi rend="italic">very particular reasons</hi> in her
                    note to you."</p>
<p>"Well," said I, astonished at Spiffy's penetration, and at the new views of life
                    he was placing before me, "I must admit that that phrase did occur."</p>
<p>"Of course it did; why, it is one of the regular forms of 'extorting invitations
                    under false pretences.' I want the police to interfere, but it seems, although
                    they are doubtless begging-letters, containing fraudulent misrepresentations,
                    there is some difficulty about bringing them within the terms of the Act."</p>
<p>"Never mind—live and let live—send her the invitation. It seems to me, my dear
                    Spiffy, that you and the Bodwinkles and Miss Rumsort are all in the same line of
                    life, so you should not be too hard upon her. As a matter of policy, social
                    adventurers should do what they can for each other."</p>
<p>Spiffy's face flushed, for if he had lost the conscience, he still retained the
                    consciousness, of a gentleman, and he felt the reproach.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, Mr Wog, who had been elected an honorary member of the
                    "Piccadilly," and was standing, unconsciously to us, listening to our
                    conversation, struck in, and averted the retort which was rising to Spiffy's
                    lips.</p>
<p>"I guess," he said, turning to Spiffy, for whose talents he evidently entertained
                    a high admiration, "that I could give you a few hints, from my own experiences
                    in New York, that might help you in your line of business. My own, sir, in that
                    city, was quite similar to yours in this. You operate at night in Mayfair, and
                    by day 'On 'Change.' Well, sir, I had two spheres of operation, one was on Wall
                    Street, and the other on Fifth Avenue. In fact, I may say that Wall Street is
                    the broad and flowery road that leads to Fifth Avenue. The trouble with
                    operators in this country is, they don't understand how to do things on a large
                    scale. Now the first thing I did when I went to do business in New York, was to
                    keep a judge."</p>
<p>"To keep a judge?" said Spiffy with amazement.</p>
<p>"Why, yes. How can you operate freely if you are afraid of the law? Besides his
                    regular monthly allowance, my judge gets a percentage on every one of my
                    financial enterprises which are fraudulent according to the letter of the
                    statute. Then it costs me a good deal to manage to get all my lawsuits tried in
                    his court. Besides, I have to keep a number of members of both the Houses of the
                    Legislature at Albany regularly retained, and to put a big pile on one side for
                    lobby operations at Washington, to say nothing about keeping the pockets of
                    police and custom-house officers and other small fry well lined. The press alone
                    swallows up the fifth of all I make. How do you suppose I could ever have
                    accomplished my celebrated combination by which I got four large railroads under
                    my control, and sold a secret issue of twenty millions of stock for fifteen
                    millions, without ever paying one dime of it to any of the companies, if I had
                    not stopped the mouths of the lawyers, politicians, and newspapers with
                    greenbacks? Why, sir, I have ruined more whole families in one day by one of my
                    financial operations, than any other man in the United States has in a month;
                    and by the extraordinary novelty, grandeur, variety, and success of my
                    undertakings, I have won the admiration, envy, and respect of the majority of my
                    countrymen."</p>
<p>Spiffy seemed deeply impressed by the superior force and originality of
                    conception displayed by Mr Wog—no indication of these qualities appearing on his
                    calm exterior. "Of what nature are your operations in Fifth Avenue?" he
                    asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, purely social," Mr Wog replied. "You see the aristocracy of New York require
                    to be approached in a very special way. You can enter into the ranks of the
                    upper ten, either by becoming a pillar of a fashionable church, or by driving
                    the fastest trotters and handsomest four-in-hand teams in Central Park, or by
                    the help of Mr Pink."</p>
<p>"By the help of Mr Pink?" said I, interrogatively.</p>
<p>"Yes. He corresponds to our friend Spiffy here. He is the sexton of St Grace's,
                    the most fashionable church in New York; and when you have made your pile, and
                    want to start in fashionable life, and don't know who to invite, he makes out
                    your list, and puts the invitations to your first ball in the prayer-books of
                    the congregation. It imparts a sort of odour of sanctity to our entertainments,
                    which is exceedingly gratifying to our most refined circles."</p>
<p>"I suppose," said I, "now that your social and financial position are secured,
                    you will run for Congress."</p>
<p>"Sir," said Mr Wog, sternly, "when I explained to you the nature of my commercial
                    success, it was to convey to you the idea of my smartness, not of my meanness. I
                    am not aware of having said anything to lead you to suppose that I could so far
                    degrade myself as to become a politician."</p>
<p>"What a comfort it will be," I remarked, "when the rotten old despotisms of
                    Europe, and the political ambitions that belong to them, shall have crumbled to
                    the dust, and when we have instead the free and glorious institutions of the
                    West, which seem to offer nothing to tempt a man from the ennobling pursuit of
                    hard cash!" But Mr Wog failed to appreciate the force of my remark, as he was
                    intently endeavouring to catch the purport of a very private conversation
                    carried on by a group a few yards off, towards which he gradually edged, in the
                    hope that he might be able either to acquire or impart some interesting
                    information.</p>
<p>Spiffy looked more humbled and crestfallen than I had ever seen him; but
                    remembering that he had still a score unsettled, in consequence of the remark
                    which Mr Wog's arrival had interrupted, he said, maliciously,—</p>
<p>"By the way, what is the real state of the case about you and Lady Ursula? I
                    don't apologise for asking, as I am sure you must want the right version to be
                    known both for your sake and hers."</p>
<p>"The right version is simply that I neither am at this moment nor ever have been
                    engaged to Lady Ursula."</p>
<p>"Then why did you tell Helter you were, and why are you pulling the family
                    through their difficulties?"</p>
<p>"Because Helter was provoking me almost as much as you are, though I admit that
                    is no reason why I should not have told the truth. As for the motives which
                    actuate me in meddling in those pecuniary transactions in which you and Lady
                    Broadhem are implicated, I am afraid you would not understand them if I were to
                    attempt to explain them. It is a complicated business altogether. We shall get
                    through it most satisfactorily by each minding our own share of it," I said
                    significantly, and I walked off to a table where Broadhem was writing letters. I
                    had not seen him since my interview with his sister. He looked gloomy and
                    discontented, and gave me a cold glance of recognition. "How are you, Broadhem?
                    I suppose Lady Ursula told you the result of our conversation," I said in a low
                    tone, and took a chair by his side.</p>
<p>He nodded sulkily, and showed a disposition to cut me. My last few words with
                    Spiffy had not left me in a mood to be cut unresistingly, so I said sharply,
                    "Well, I hope both you and Lady Broadhem will contradict the perfectly unfounded
                    report you were the means of spreading. I need not say that I shall do my share,
                    and I trust that you will profit by the lesson you have received not to
                    interfere in matters of this sort again."</p>
<p>"I tell you what it is, Frank," said Broadhem, who felt that somehow I was more
                    to blame than he was, but who was taken aback by my turning the tables upon him
                    so suddenly; "if it was not that duelling is exploded, and that it would be
                    against my principles at any rate, I would shoot you."</p>
<p>"By way of helping to clear your property of its encumbrances," I added. "Your
                    mother has put everything into my hands, and I can do pretty much what I please
                    with the whole family."</p>
<p>"Can you?" said Broadhem, with a grim smile. "The only thing that consoles me in
                    the whole affair is, that you will find that you have got a little score to
                    settle with my mother. If you knew her as well as I do, you would not anticipate
                    the interview with pleasure. As for Ursula, I suppose she knows her own business
                    best, but I don't envy her the life she is likely to lead either."</p>
<p>"The alarming interview you threaten me with gives me no uneasiness," I said,
                    "but perhaps it may be as well that you should let Lady Broadhem know that the
                    fact of my not being engaged to her daughter will not interfere with the
                    arrangements I am making to put the money matters of the family right."</p>
<p>"Why! you can't mean that!" said Broadhem, thunderstruck at this unexpected
                    announcement; and he looked at me with a glance of affectionate interest. "You
                    must be mad."</p>
<p>"Did your sister tell you so?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Once she did make a mysterious speech, and I really think she meant to imply
                    something of the sort. However, of course, I am only joking. I need not say I
                    hope, under the circumstances, it will be long before you recover your
                    sanity."</p>
<p>"Are you going to the Bodwinkles' to-morrow?" said I, doing a little of Bower and
                    Scraper's work.</p>
<p>"Good gracious, no! I am bored to death with having to answer the question. The
                    trouble my mother has taken to get those people invitations is something
                    amazing. She even wanted me to go, though she does not approve of balls, and
                    never let me learn to dance."</p>
<p>"Let me introduce you to Miss Geary. You are not too old to begin."</p>
<p>"No," said Broadhem; "I have started on the other tack, and people would say it
                    was inconsistent; besides, none of the young thinking men of the day dance, even
                    though they may not be religious. I don't suppose that there is a single man in
                    the Century dances."</p>
<p>This observation struck me as so preposterous that I could only account for it by
                    supposing that, for the first time in his life, Broadhem had condescended to
                    "chaff."</p>
<p>"Not 'a man' in the ideal sense, I daresay; but the boys are not more backward in
                    this century than in any former one."</p>
<p>"Boys!" said Broadhem, indignantly; "there are no boys in the 'Century;' the
                    'Century' is a club that meets twice a-week. I don't go on Sunday nights myself;
                    but some Thursday night I will take you," and Broadhem plunged back into the
                    correspondence in which I had interrupted him, while I strolled home down
                    Piccadilly moralising on—the Century.</p>
<p>I don't frequent balls now, but I went to Bodwinkle's for a variety of reasons.
                    One was, that I knew I should see everybody, and have an opportunity of
                    informing the public correctly about my own affairs. Another, that I should be
                    able to talk over some business matters with Bodwinkle, at a moment when he
                    might possibly be more pliant than I usually found him in the City.</p>
<p>Every soul was at Bodwinkle's—coroneted carriages filled the square; a crowd of
                    draggled men and women formed a line six or eight deep on each side of the
                    awning, and between them fine ladies hurried across the pavement, encouraged and
                    complimented by familiar linkmen, and very particular that the 'Morning Post'
                    reporter, seated at a table in the hall, should take down their names
                    accurately. The stairs were so crowded that Bodwinkle, who looked like one of
                    his own footmen, and stood at the top of them, facing his wife, was red and
                    apoplectic from pressure. His "lady," as I heard one of his City friends call
                    her, had achieved the greatest object of her ambition in this life, which
                    consisted in grinning vacantly, and curtsying perpetually to people she had
                    never seen in her life before, and every one of whom despised her for
                    entertaining them.</p>
<p>"Curious idea of the climax of earthly enjoyment," I remarked to Lady Veriphast,
                    who was so tightly wedged between the banisters and a rather highly-scented
                    ambassador from Central Asia, that she spoke with difficulty; "I suppose it must
                    be a pleasure to be at the top of one's own ladder, like our hostess there, when
                    so many are trying to climb it."</p>
<p>"Do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> philosophise in that ridiculous way; don't you see
                    I am suffering agonies?" said Lady Veriphast, in a tone of suppressed anguish.
                    "Pinch this horrid barbarian in front of me or I shall faint."</p>
<p>"Madam," I overheard a well-known voice say in a nasal tone close to me, "allow
                    me to remark, that for a hand, arm, and wrist, I have not seen anything since I
                    have been in England like that owned by your daughter Mary;" and Mr Wog
                    complacently edged himself from the side of Lady Mundane to that of the daughter
                    he had eulogised, and who audibly asked Scraper to get between her and that
                    horrid man.</p>
<p>"Just what one deserves for coming to such a place," said Lady Mundane furiously,
                    who, by the way, had repeatedly asked Wog to her own parties.</p>
<p>"I have often remarked, sir," said Mr Wog, who I think overheard this
                    observation, turning to me, "that the ladies in your country allow quite a
                    singular effect to be produced in their hair. If you will cast your eye down the
                    stair you will observe a young person on the landing, the parting of whose hair,
                    for the space of one inch on either side, is black, while the two large bunches
                    on her temples are red. That, sir, is a phenomenon I have not remarked in my own
                    country."</p>
<p>"Don't you know how it happens?" said that spiteful old Lady Catchpole, whose
                    eyes twinkled with malice as she explained to Mr Wog that, when the hair had
                    been thoroughly dyed it could only recover its natural colour by this slow
                    process, but that usually the effect was concealed by a <hi rend="italic">postiche</hi>; and she looked hard at Lady Veriphast, whose hair was
                    suspiciously <hi rend="italic">crep—</hi>, and who wished it to be supposed that
                    she blushed because she was still under the pressure of the Asiatic
                    ambassador.</p>
<p>"What is the exact meaning of the term <hi rend="italic">postiche</hi>?" asked Mr
                    Wog, who observed Lady Veriphast's confusion, and whose thirst for information
                    seemed to increase with his powers of making himself disagreeable; "I guess it
                    must mean some kind of wig."</p>
<p>"No," said Lady Catchpole; "anything false which is well made up we call a <hi rend="italic">postiche</hi>; it need not be exactly a wig."</p>
<p>"Nor yet a Tory," interrupted Wog, with more readiness than I gave him credit
                    for. "I calculate you should call a Liberal Conservative a <hi rend="italic">postiche</hi>. It seems to me the most popular political platform in this
                    country at your next elections is going to be <hi rend="italic">postiche</hi>."</p>
<p>"Look, my dear," said Lady Pimlico to Lady</p>
<p>Mundane, "there are the two Frenchwomen," and she directed universal attention to
                    the last importations from the Continent, Madame la Princesse de Biais—e — la
                    Queue, and La Baronne de Colt—, whose fame had preceded them from Paris, and who
                    created such a sensation that the general hum on the stairs increased, and the
                    whole society collected there audibly criticised the new-comers. "Why,
                    positively the tall one has got her hair done <hi rend="italic">en
                    papillon</hi>—I thought it had gone out—I suppose her face won't bear being <hi rend="italic">coiffé à la grècque</hi>; and the other is outrageously
                    painted." This remark was made so loud that both ladies looked up, but failed to
                    check the running fire of comments which their dress and appearance
                    suggested.</p>
<p>"They say the Princess makes up for her want of looks by her legs," drawled out
                    Larkington to Lady Veriphast; "but I am afraid we shall not have an opportunity
                    of seeing them to-night, it is so crowded."</p>
<p>"They are not worth looking at; I saw them at a fancy ball in Paris," said Lady
                    Veriphast, "and I assure you you would be disappointed. By the way, have you the
                    least notion who the Bodwinkles are?"</p>
<p>"Not I," replied Larkington. "I did not come here to make their acquaintance, nor
                    I hope did you."</p>
<p>I think Mrs Bodwinkle heard the speech—for it is customary in good society to
                    make remarks about one's neighbours in rather a loud tone—as she coloured a
                    little when she was pointed out to Larkington by the fat butler as the person to
                    whom he was expected to bow. Poor woman! she probably thought he would be
                    embarrassed when he found out his proximity; but Larkington is above any such
                    weakness, and sauntered on after Lady Veriphast, with whom he has <hi rend="italic">affichéd</hi> himself for the last few weeks, to the great
                    comfort of Veriphast, who has long been desirous of making his wife share the
                    scandal which has attached to his name for some time past.</p>
<p>"And it is for this, my dear Mrs Bodwinkle," I thought, "that you have given up
                    your villa at Clapham, and the friends that respectfully worshipped at the
                    Bodwinkle shrine, who gazed upon you with reverend upturned eyes, instead of
                    irreverent upturned noses, like the present company! Do you think, when you have
                    blazed for a moment and gone out like a blue-light, that you will know how to
                    find your way in the dark back to Clapham, or that you will be able to collect
                    your old congregation? Will not new Bodwinkles have arisen above the suburban
                    horizon, or will the departed glories of your rapid but bright passage across
                    the firmament of fashion always secure you an audience who will gladly listen to
                    your wonderful experiences in the great world, to whom you will recount the
                    devotion manifested towards you by certain noblemen, and the slights you
                    received at the hands of certain noblewomen, and who will stare when you
                    describe the Broadhem-Spiffy combination which sent you up like a rocket, and
                    the sudden collapse of that combination which will assuredly bring you down like
                    a stick? Never mind, Mrs B.; whatever happens, nothing short of a fire can
                    deprive you of the basket of fashionable cards which will be left upon you
                    during the season, and which, carefully treasured with your dinner <hi rend="italic">menus</hi>, will be a lasting evidence of the reality of that
                    social triumph which might otherwise seem like the 'baseless fabric of a
                    dream.'"</p>
<p>And this consideration reminds me that I possess middle-class readers, who may
                    positively doubt the truth of the picture which I am endeavouring to give them
                    of the society in which Mrs Bodwinkle now found herself. They will not have the
                    advantage of hearing from the lips of that good lady these wonderful traits of
                    the manners and customs of this, to them, mysterious class. And therefore they
                    will fail to see any particular merit in what they may suppose to be merely a
                    flippant delineation of a purely ideal state of society. My dear readers, I
                    should be no more competent to invent a state of society so eccentric in its
                    habits and constitution as this of London cream, than I should be to write an
                    account of lion-hunting like the late lamented Jules Gerard. That was a real
                    strain upon the imaginative and constructive faculties; I aspire to no such
                    talent, but simply contemplate hyperbolically a certain phase of contemporary
                    civilisation. If, by way of a little pastime, I put Mayfair into a fancy dress,
                    it only appears in its true colours and becomes fancy-fair, with a great deal of
                    show and very little substance; so I dress it up as it pleases me, but I invent
                    nothing. I confine myself strictly to the stage properties. You in the pit or
                    gallery may be too far off to see, but I assure you I have avoided anything
                    beyond the exaggeration permissible in a caricature. As I know your imitative
                    faculties, dear middle classes, I can conscientiously assure you that you may
                    take 'Piccadilly' as a guide upon which to frame your own society. Take the most
                    successful costermonger of the neighbourhood and erect him into a Bodwinkle, and
                    fall down upon your knees before the most opulent pawnbroker of your parish; and
                    you will feel that you are only performing, on a humble scale, the same act of
                    worship as those above you.</p>
<p>Lady Jane Helter, followed by Wild Harrie, came up while I was thus musing. "So,
                    Lord Frank," she said, "you are not to be congratulated after all? I suppose you
                    heard of our dinner at the Whitechapels'? We all thought your conduct very
                    incomprehensible. I assure you Lady Broadhem seemed as much in the dark as the
                    rest of us."</p>
<p>"And you want to be enlightened?" said I. "Well, it has been a social <hi rend="italic">canard</hi> throughout, which I did not at first think worth
                    contradicting. There must be a certain number every season."</p>
<p>"I am sure we want them more than ever now," said Wild Harrie. "Was there ever
                    such an utterly flat season? I only went to two balls last week, and, as they
                    say at 'the corner,' 'there was positively nothing doing.'"</p>
<p>"It is not the same in every corner," said I; "look opposite," and I pointed out
                    Larkington and Lady Veriphast snugly ensconced in a recess.</p>
<p>"Poor Amy! I am afraid that won't suit her book," said Wild Harrie. "She is
                    really devoted to Lord Larkington. I told her to hedge, but she says she has too
                    much heart. By the way, I want to have a little private conversation with you.
                    Take me to have a cup of tea, or a quadrille, or something"—this in rather a low
                    tone, not for Lady Jane's benefit; and we sidled off through the throng, leaving
                    Lady Jane at the doorway, which, in the absence of her ladyship, does duty as
                    chaperon.</p>
<p>"Do you know, Lord Frank," said my companion, "that it really was very kind of
                    you to get me the invitation you did, and that I can appreciate kindness; can
                    you guess how?"</p>
<p>"By asking me to do something else for you," I said.</p>
<p>"Exactly," she said, laughing; "but this time it will not perhaps be quite so
                    easy. I want you to get me a card for Lady Broadhem's on Thursday week."</p>
<p>"For Lady Broadhem's!" said I, astounded. "How on earth did you come to hear of
                    it? Why, it is a meeting, not a party. A few Christian friends are going to hear
                    the Bishop of the Caribbee Islands describe the state of mission-work in his
                    diocese. You would be bored to death."</p>
<p>"Indeed I should not," said Wild Harrie. "I have a brother in India; and I have
                    heard so much about the heathen. Besides, I want to make Lady Ursula's
                    acquaintance."</p>
<p>"I really don't think," said I, a good deal puzzled, "that you will find it a
                    very congenial atmosphere, but I am sure nobody can know Lady Ursula without
                    deriving benefit, so I should feel too glad to be the means of making you
                    acquainted; but Lady Jane will never take you."</p>
<p>"Oh, mamma will; you know her brother was a clergyman. Promise. Don't forget—one
                    for me and one for mamma. Now I must leave you; I quite forgot I was engaged to
                    little Haultort for this dance, and there he is hunting for me everywhere," and
                    she dragged me to the spot where that young gentleman was stroking a fluffy
                    mustache, with an imbecile air.</p>
<p>"Do you call that hunting?" said I; "He must be in chase of ideas."</p>
<p>"Of course he is. Now watch him catch big <hi rend="italic">idée fixe</hi>," and
                    she placed herself before him. Poor youth! how he coloured and stammered, as a
                    ray of intelligence illumined his countenance! "So that is the way you keep your
                    engagements, Lord Haultort, is it? Well, you have forfeited your dance"—the ray
                    went out—"but you may take me back to Lady Jane." The ray came back again; he
                    was sufficiently experienced to know what that meant, and Lord Haultort
                    disappeared into the next room with his <hi rend="italic">idée fixe</hi> on his
                    arm, and I looked the other way half an hour after, when I passed the
                    corresponding recess in which Larkington and Lady Veriphast were still sitting,
                    and saw who were there.</p>
<p>"I wonder what that little girl wants to know the Broadhems for?" I ruminated,
                    and for some time I was positively fool enough to continue to wonder.</p>
<p>"I tell you what it is, Goldtip," I overheard Bodwinkle say, "that idea of yours
                    about giving presents is all humbug; we've got the people here, what do you want
                    to give them presents for?"</p>
<p>"In the first place," retorted Spiffy, "they will never come again unless you
                    keep faith with them now, for I have been giving it out specially that no
                    expense was to be spared; and in the second place, as you have got all the
                    presents made up in ribbons, etc., what else are you to do with them? The
                    girls will be terribly disappointed."</p>
<p>Bodwinkle shook his head sulkily, and Spiffy, seeing me, adroitly turned the
                    conversation. "I was talking over the prospects of the approaching election,
                    Frank, with Bodwinkle, and telling him how much you could assist us with your
                    influence in Shuffleborough; it seems to me that he is likely to be turned out
                    unless your brother-in-law, Sir John Stepton, will come to the rescue. It would
                    be well worth your while, Bodwinkle, to let Lady Broadhem's matter stand over
                    until you have made sure of your seat," said Spiffy, looking significantly at
                    me.</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly," said Bodwinkle, "if you will secure your brother-in-law's
                    adhesion to our plans. You will find me very amenable in that unfortunate affair
                    of Lady Broadhem's. I know what an interest you take in it, and I am sure, for
                    your sake, if not for hers—ahem," and Bodwinkle, quite unconscious that he was
                    behaving like a scoundrel, smiled upon me blandly.</p>
<p>"It seems to me," said I, "that, considering what you owe to Lady Broadhem," and
                    I looked round the crowded room, "you ought not to be too hard upon her."</p>
<p>"Ah, well, I must admit that her ladyship and our friend Goldtip here are doing
                    their best to balance the account; but I have made it a principle through life
                    never to be satisfied with anything short of my full money's worth; and I don't
                    even feel now, if you make my election a certainty, that we shall be more than
                    square."</p>
<p>"What are your other principles besides that of getting your full money's worth?"
                    said I, with a sneer, that was lost upon Bodwinkle.</p>
<p>"High Tory," he replied, promptly. "None of your Liberal Conservatives for me
                    this time—that did well enough last election."</p>
<p>"But Stepton is an absolute Radical," said I.</p>
<p>"Exactly: that is why he is so important. You see the fact is—here, Goldtip,
                    explain our little game; it is all his idea, and he can put it better than
                    me."</p>
<p>I knew from the bold defiant way in which Spiffy raised his eyes to mine that his
                    original and unscrupulous genius had conceived a <hi rend="italic">coup
                        d'état</hi> of some kind, so I listened curiously.</p>
<p>"I am going to stand for Shuffleborough, and it is I who want Sir John Stepton's
                    vote and influence," he announced, calmly.</p>
<p>"You!" said I, amazed; "what are you going to stand as? and who is going to pay
                    your expenses?"</p>
<p>"I am going to stand as an extreme Liberal, and Bodwinkle as a regular old Tory.
                    He is going to pay my expenses. We are going to strike out an entirely new line,
                    and have convictions. He can't come the Liberal Conservative this time, as one
                    of the Liberals who is very popular has gone in rather extensively for the
                    Moderate Conservatives. So there is nothing for it but to come forward as an
                    out-and-out Tory, and put me up as a Radical; by these means we hope to floor
                    both the fellows that are trying the trimming game. Of course I am not intended
                    to come in—I only split the party."</p>
<p>"But if you stand, one of the others will retire. Look at what has just happened
                    at Westminster."</p>
<p>"Then Bodwinkle starts his wife's cousin Tom—why, he is rich enough to keep all
                    three Liberals in the field to fight him if necessary; and you are pluck to the
                    backbone, aint you, old fellow?" and Spiffy slapped Bodwinkle on the back.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you would like to see our addresses," he went on,—"here they are; I
                    wrote them both. I shall issue mine first, and Bodwinkle's a day or two
                    after."</p>
<p>"May I take them home to read?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly, and frame your own on their model if you like," said Spiffy,
                    laughing; "they'll be the neatest thing out in addresses, I assure you."</p>
<p>"Mr Goldtip, I wish you would exert yourself, instead of talking politics with Mr
                    B.," said Mrs Bodwinkle, coming up; "there are all sorts of things to arrange,
                    and I am sure I don't know who is to take who down to supper;" and Spiffy was
                    carried away upon special service.</p>
<p>"Good-night, Bodwinkle," said I; "your ball is a great success, but I am an early
                    man, and hot rooms don't suit me. I understand the political situation
                    thoroughly now, and without pledging myself to anything, will see what is to be
                    done."</p>
<p>"Of course, all in the most perfect confidence; it would never do for Stepton to
                    suspect what we were at."</p>
<p>"Oh, it would be absolute ruin. There is just one question I should like to ask,
                    Can you give me your solemn word that in all this you have no other motive but
                    the single one of being of use to your country?"</p>
<p>"Eh!" said Bodwinkle, with his eyes rather wide open.</p>
<p>"I repeat," said I, slowly, "Is your only object in getting into Parliament that
                    you may be of use to the country? or is it that the country may be of use to
                    you?"</p>
<p>"I must ask you one in return," said Bodwinkle: "Will it depend upon my answer
                    whether or not you exert yourself in my favour?"</p>
<p>"Entirely," said I.</p>
<p>"Then, my dear Lord Frank," said Bodwinkle, affectionately grasping my hand,
                    "believe me, that so far as I am concerned, and I can say the same for Goldtip,
                    our only single desire is to do that which England expects of every man at such
                    a crisis,—our duty, entirely irrespective of all personal considerations."</p>
<p>I wrung Bodwinkle's hand warmly (I could have crushed every bone in it), and
                    threw an expression of tender interest into my glance as I said, "I wonder,
                    Bodwinkle, how many candidates are actuated by these lofty views in the coming
                    election; but you must not let yourself be too much carried away by your
                    Quixotic convictions. Remember, my friend, what you owe to your party."</p>
<p>"I never forget it," said Bodwinkle, readily. "I have four things to consider—my
                    country, my party, my family, and my conscience. I begin by asking my conscience
                    what are the interests of my country. My conscience replies promptly that my
                    party should be in power. I then ask my conscience what are the interests of my
                    family, and my conscience invariably says the same thing. I then ask my
                    conscience whether it has any political views of its own, and my conscience
                    responds that it is a mercantile conscience, which has always been absorbed in
                    commerce, and that takes no interest in abstract politics; so that practically,
                    you see, I have no difficulty, so far as my conscience is concerned."</p>
<p>"Wog is right," I mused as I walked home—"<hi rend="italic">postiche</hi> is
                    everywhere. We certainly do 'make up' well. I suppose this country never looked
                    more fair and flourishing in the eyes of the world in general than it does at
                    this moment. We have made a great <hi rend="italic">succès</hi> by means of <hi rend="italic">postiche</hi>—there is no denying it. But we shall fall to
                    pieces all of a sudden like old Lady Pimlico; and the wrinkles will appear
                    before long in the national cheeks in spite of the rouge. Ah, the taunts we
                    shall have to endure when the <hi rend="italic">postiche</hi> is discovered,
                    from the rivals that have always been jealous and are still under the prestige
                    of our former charms! Then the kings of the earth with whom we have lived
                    delicately will turn against us, for they will remember our greed and our pride
                    and our egotism, in the days when we sold our virtue for gold, and our honour
                    for a mess of pottage. Is there no one who will cry aloud in the streets while
                    there is yet time?—will there not be one man in these coming elections who will
                    have the courage to tell the people that their senses are so drugged by
                    prosperity that they are blind to the impending doom, and that the only way to
                    avert it will be by a policy diametrically opposed to that which has fascinated
                    the nation for the last few years, because it has conducted them so pleasantly
                    along those smooth and flowery paths that lead to destruction? Be sure, oh my
                    countrymen, that for you collectively, as well as individually, there is a broad
                    and a narrow way, and that as surely as a nation ignores its duties towards God
                    and its obligations towards its neighbours, so surely will a swift judgment
                    overtake it!" I was interrupted by a policeman at this point, who kindly called
                    my attention to the fact that in my prophetic fervour I had myself been crying
                    aloud in the streets, and accompanying my denunciations with appropriate action.
                    "I will throw off a few of these ideas for the benefit of my constituents, while
                    the sacred fire is still upon me," thought I, as I stood at my bay-window, and
                    watched the grey dawn of the June morning breaking over Green Park. Sleep at
                    such a moment is impossible, and I pulled the addresses of Spiffy and Bodwinkle
                    from my pocket.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," says Spiffy to the independent electors of Shuffleborough, "in
                    soliciting the favour of your suffrages at the approaching general election, I
                    am aware that I labour under the disadvantage of coming before you as an untried
                    man, but I ask you all the more confidently on this account to substitute me for
                    one who has been tried and found wanting. Still more painfully conscious am I of
                    the fact that I am open to the charge of causing a fatal split in that Liberal
                    party to which I have the honour to belong. Gentlemen, I regret to say that in
                    some instances the members of that party have not been true to the principles
                    which they profess, and have issued addresses almost identical in the terms they
                    employ and in the measures they advocate with those of the Liberal Conservative
                    party. It is no satisfaction to me to be told that there are as many false
                    Conservatives as there are false Liberals. As a friend of the people I am
                    opposed to all compromises, and will unflinchingly expose treachery in the camp.
                    You will find that my political views are clear and decided.</p>
<p>"Though a member of the Church of England, I am in favour of the total abolition
                    of Church-rates, as I believe that you will spiritualise the Church precisely in
                    proportion as you starve it.</p>
<p>"I am in favour of an extension of the franchise to such an extent as will
                    comprise all the working-classes, and thus pave the way to that universal
                    suffrage in which I myself shall be included, and for the first time enjoy the
                    privilege of voting.</p>
<p>"Should I fail to be returned as your member upon this occasion, I shall be in
                    favour of a redistribution of seats.</p>
<p>"I believe that an era of universal peace is dawning upon the world, and I am
                    therefore an advocate of the total suppression of our armaments both by sea and
                    land.</p>
<p>"T think that the Christian spirit displayed in our foreign policy which has
                    induced us to court national insult for the purpose of setting an example of
                    forbearance, and which has enabled us humbly but surely to extend our commercial
                    relations, has procured for us the highest moral position which has ever yet
                    been accorded to a people. To increase the wealth of the nation and to foster
                    its Christian spirit, will be recognised by me as a primary duty, if I am
                    honoured with the high trust of being your representative in the Commons House
                    of Parliament."</p>
<p>Now comes Bodwinkle's address, written by the versatile author of the last:—</p>
<p>"<hi rend="smcap">Gentlemen</hi>,—The appearance of a third candidate in the
                    Liberal interest within the last few days induces me to break the silence which
                    I have up to this time preserved. I have observed with pain that in many
                    instances the addresses issued by gentlemen calling themselves Liberal
                    Conservatives or Conservative Reformers, are of the most subversive tendency,
                    and entirely opposed to the spirit of that old and enlightened party to which I
                    have the honour to belong. I repudiate, therefore, entirely that temporising
                    language which a large number of candidates calling themselves Conservatives
                    hold, and which it has suited one of my opponents, who calls himself a Liberal,
                    to adopt. I believe I shall best recommend myself to this constituency by an
                    honest and unswerving advocacy of those views which the Tory party of this
                    country have invariably maintained. More fondly attached, if possible, to the
                    Church of England than I was upon the occasion when I last addressed you, I am
                    more than ever convinced that money is the only thing that keeps it going. I am
                    therefore entirely opposed to the abolition of those rates which form the
                    foundation of that pillar upon which the State has been accustomed securely to
                    repose.</p>
<p>"I am opposed to the enfranchisement of the working man, as, in the probable
                    event of a combination between the labouring classes and the aristocracy, that
                    middle class to which I have the honour to belong would cease to direct the
                    destinies of the country. Any lateral measure of reform, unattended, however, by
                    a vertical movement, which should exclude this possibility, will have my entire
                    concurrence.</p>
<p>"I am in favour of a measure which shall largely increase the armaments of the
                    country, and at the same time reduce the cost of their maintenance.</p>
<p>"I have profound confidence in the policy of the great Conservative party in
                    their relations with foreign nations. The fact that they have hitherto declined
                    to define what that policy is, renders it impossible for me to enter more fully
                    into this subject at present.</p>
<p>"In a word, should you do me the honour to return me as your member, you will
                    find me Liberal only in my views as to the modes in which money may be acquired,
                    and Conservative always when there is a question of expenditure."</p>
<p>It is a grand idea but a great experiment this of having convictions, which
                    Spiffy has just started, thought I. I have been cursed with them all my life,
                    but never could turn them to account. Now in this case, for instance, he is
                    using convictions—<hi rend="italic">postiche</hi> convictions certainly—to get
                    Bodwinkle into Parliament; the result of my convictions is, that if I express
                    them they will turn me out. A prophet is without honour in his own country, more
                    especially when the whole constituency has become sceptical and apathetic. I
                    shall issue an address to the free and independent electors of Dunderhead. And
                    under the inspiration of the moment I wrote as follows:—</p>
<l>"<hi rend="smcap">Piccadilly</hi>, <hi rend="italic">June 20, 1865</hi>. </l>
<p>"<hi rend="smcap">Gentlemen</hi>,—In announcing my intention not to solicit your
                    suffrages at the approaching general election, I feel that it is due to you that
                    I should state the reason why I do not again seek the high honour which you have
                    upon two previous occasions conferred upon me, of representing you in
                    Parliament. The prosperity of the country is now so great that I feel it has no
                    further need of my services. In default of any great question of national
                    importance, the rival political parties are reduced to the lamentable
                    predicament of having nothing to fight for except office. As I have never taken
                    the slightest interest in the fortunes of either party, except as embodying or
                    representing the triumph of certain principles, the disappearance of those
                    principles, and the difficulty of distinguishing by their expressed opinions
                    between one party and the other, renders it quite impossible for me to follow
                    the example of the candidates on both sides, and to stand upon—nothing!
                    Gentlemen, I have no doubt that before very long something will turn up for me
                    to stand upon. I will wait till then. Meantime, I feel that to profess any
                    decided convictions upon matters either of home or foreign politics at this
                    juncture would be considered in bad taste, if not impertinent, and I shall
                    therefore reserve whatever I have to say for a future occasion, when the
                    exigencies of the country may render it absolutely necessary that some
                    individual in it should have an opinion."</p>
<p>There, I don't think I need say anything more. I meant to have written these
                    Dunderheadians something that would have made them remember me after I was gone;
                    but I am getting sleepy, and they would not have understood it. I will give
                    —1000 to be applied to the wants of the municipality instead. "In conclusion," I
                    went on, "I beg to offer a tribute to the only article of political faith in
                    which you still believe, and to place —1000 at the disposal of the mayor and
                    corporation, which, in addition to the money spent in the contest that my
                    retirement will render inevitable, will, I trust, not only be of substantial
                    service to the borough, but secure my re-election upon any future occasion.</p>
<l>"<hi rend="smcap">Frank Vanecourt.</hi>" </l>
<p>Good-night, Dunderheadians. If in spite of this you send me a requisition to
                    stand again, I will decline on a ground simple enough even for your
                    comprehension—It is too hot!</p>
<p>It was no business of mine, after the explanation which I had had with Lady
                    Ursula upon the subject of our rumoured engagement, to revert to the topic with
                    any of her family. If Lady Broadhem was dissatisfied with the position of
                    affairs, I supposed that I should hear of it quite soon enough; my only anxiety
                    was about Ursula herself. I trembled for her domestic peace and comfort.
                    Broadhem's few words about his sister's happiness under the altered
                    circumstances were very significant, and I determined therefore to get her
                    ladyship as much in my power as possible, by exercising to its utmost extent the
                    right which I had wrung from her of a full control over her pecuniary affairs.
                    If my wealth did not enable me to purchase my own happiness, it should at least
                    enable me to secure the happiness of her whom I loved best in the world. I had
                    never wavered in my resolution somehow or other to effect this great end, but my
                    plans must of necessity undergo some change now that Lady Broadhem's eyes were
                    opened to the real state of the case. I was much puzzled what to do about
                    Grandon. Sometimes I felt a yearning to take him fully into my confidence and
                    consult with him upon that delicate topic which touched us both so nearly; but
                    though he was kind and considerate as ever, there was a constraint about our
                    intercourse of which we were both painfully conscious. We avoided all allusion
                    to the Broadhems, and he never called in Grosvenor Square, nor, so far as I
                    know, had met Lady Ursula since the memorable dinner which had terminated so
                    disagreeably for us all. Under the circumstances, I had also thought the wisest,
                    and for many reasons the most proper, course for me was, to abstain from going
                    there until I should hear from Lady Broadhem; and although I was anxious to
                    consult her upon many business matters, I preferred letting them remain in
                    abeyance to courting an interview which I dreaded. At last I began to think Lady
                    Broadhem's silence rather ominous. I felt that a thunder-cloud had been
                    gathering for some time past, and that the sooner it burst the better. I
                    occasionally found myself walking past the door of the house, and wondering what
                    was going on inside it. I felt that there would be something undignified about
                    pumping Broadhem, and yet every time I met him I experienced an irresistible
                    desire to do so.</p>
<p>At last one day he volunteered a remark, from which I gathered that he was as
                    anxious for information as I was. "Have you seen my mother lately?" he
                    began.</p>
<p>"Not for weeks."</p>
<p>"Do you know she is carrying on a lot of things just the same as ever?"</p>
<p>"I don't think that possible," I said; "she could do nothing without my
                    knowledge."</p>
<p>"She is, though," said Broadhem; "I can't quite make out what is going on,
                    because, you know, she never condescends to discuss her affairs with any of us;
                    but I feel certain there is some new scheme afloat."</p>
<p>"Is she kind to your sister?" I asked.</p>
<p>"She is neither kind nor unkind: she is very little at home, and seems to have
                    lost all interest in her own family. She wants us to believe that it is the
                    heathen; but I must say that she never used to neglect her daughters for them,
                    and always said, what so many good people forget, that the first duty of a
                    Christian woman was to attend to her own family. I am getting very uneasy," said
                    Broadhem, with a sigh; "I feel a presentiment that there is some sort of a crash
                    coming; I wish you would go and see her."</p>
<p>"I did not intend going to her conversazione next week, but as she has sent me a
                    card I suppose she wants to see me. I will come and hear my friend Joseph
                    Caribbee Islands hold forth. By the way, I quite forgot I promised to ask Lady
                    Broadhem for a card for Lady Wylde and her daughter; will you send one when you
                    get home? You don't know Miss Wylde, do you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Broadhem, and he coloured and looked away; "I have just met her, and
                    that is all. Did she ask you for the invitation?"</p>
<p>"What! you have met her, and she did not tell you the interest she takes in
                    missions? I see you are half converted already. Take care, Broadhem; you are no
                    great catch; but she does not, perhaps, exactly know that, and all is fish that
                    comes to her net. Nevertheless, don't forget to send her the invitation;" and I
                    saw the flush of gratified vanity mount to the brow of Broadhem, and no longer
                    wondered why Wild Harrie had expressed a wish to make Lady Ursula's
                    acquaintance. Poor Ursula! what Broadhem had said about his mother's change of
                    manner decided me not to neglect the opportunity which presented itself of going
                    to her "meeting," and coming to a distinct understanding with Lady Broadhem upon
                    the present position of affairs. I had no doubt that that veteran campaigner had
                    not been idle; and I was afraid, under the circumstances, that too much time had
                    already been allowed her.</p>
<p>"Do you think Miss Wylde is going down to Ascot?" asked Broadhem, who had
                    maintained an embarrassed silence during this interval.</p>
<p>"She went down yesterday with the Helters; she stays the week with them at their
                    cottage," I replied.</p>
<p>"I have never been to Ascot," he said, awkwardly—"in fact I never saw a race in
                    my life. I think a man, even though he does not approve of racing, ought to have
                    seen it once—don't you?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," said I, "especially when you can see Wild Harrie at the same
                    time."</p>
<p>"I say," said Broadhem, and he stopped short.</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"I wish to goodness there was some way of going to Ascot without being seen. I
                    suppose one is sure to come across a lot of men one knows."</p>
<p>"Not if you go and stay with the clergyman of the parish," I said.</p>
<p>"I don't know him. It is not for myself, but I don't think my mother would like
                    my going."</p>
<p>"Then don't go."</p>
<p>"What an unsatisfactory fellow you are! I shall go and talk over the matter with
                    Ursula—she always helps me out of my difficulties."</p>
<p>"What does she know about Ascot?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, she does not know about Ascot, but somehow or other she always tells me what
                    is the best thing to do about everything."</p>
<p>"I suppose, then, you tell her everything?"</p>
<p>"Almost," he said.</p>
<p>"Take my advice, and make a clean breast of it, my dear boy;" and I felt kindly
                    towards him for the way he spoke about his sister. "Depend upon it, no half
                    confidences do in such a case. Tell her that I shall come to you on Thursday of
                    next week;" and I pressed his hand. I had never cared about him for his own
                    sake, but my heart warmed towards him for hers.</p>
