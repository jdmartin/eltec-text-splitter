<t:head>II.—The Protestant Detectoral Association.</t:head>
<t:p>Ginx's baby was now fed on consecrated pap. But his mother was not a woman to be silent
            under her wrongs. From her husband she hid them, because the subject was forbidden. She
            poured out her complaint to Mrs. Spittal and other Protestant matrons. Thus it came to
            pass that one day, in Ginx's absence, the good woman was surprised by a visit from a
            “gentleman.” He was small, sharp, rapid, dressed in black. He opened his business at
            once.</t:p>
<t:p>“Mrs. Ginx? Ah! I am the agent of the Protestant Detectoral Association.”</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Ginx wiped her best chair and set it for him.</t:p>
<t:p>“By great good fortune the secretary received only half an hour ago intelligence of the
            shocking instance of Papal aggression of which you have been the victim.”</t:p>
<t:p>To hear her case put so grandly was honey to Mrs. Ginx.</t:p>
<t:p>“Well now,” continued the little man, “we are ready to render you every assistance to
            save your child from the claws of the Great Dragon. I wish to know the exact
            circumstances—let me see—(opening a large pocket book) I have this memorandum: the child
            was carried off from his mother's bedside in broad daylight by a nun accompanied by two
            priests and a large body of Irish: is that a correct version?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Law, no, sir, it warn't quite like that,” said Mrs. Ginx. “We've 'ad so many on 'em
            that Ginx was for drownin' the thirteenth”——The little man opened his eyes——</t:p>
<t:p>“An' he went and gave it away, sir,” said she crying, “to a nun, sir—ah! ah! ah!—they
            won't let me see the darlin' now, sir—ah! ah! ah! because I won't let Missis Spishyosir
            mark me with the cross, sir, an' me with as fine a breast o' milk as ever was for 'im,
            sir—ah! ah! ah!”</t:p>
<t:p>“Hem!” said the little man, “that's different from what I understood.”</t:p>
<t:p>He was quite honest, but who does not know how disappointing it is to find a wrong you
            wish to redress is not so bad as you had hoped?</t:p>
<t:p>However, it looked bad enough, and might be made worse. It was the very case for the
            Protestant Detectoral Association.</t:p>
<t:p>“Would Mr. Ginx not join in an effort to recover his child?”</t:p>
<t:p>“No, sir; I should think not: he went an' gave it away.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I know; but he is a Protestant?”</t:p>
<t:p>“I don't think he be much o' anything, sir. I know he hate priests like pison, but he
            don't care about these things as I do.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Oh! I see.” Writes in his memorandum book—husband indifferent.</t:p>
<t:p>“But don't you think he would help you to get the child back again?”</t:p>
<t:p>“No, sir. I wouldn't speak of it to him for the world. He'd knock any one down if they
            was to mention the child to him.”</t:p>
<t:p>The little man mentally determined not to see Ginx.</t:p>
<t:p>“Well; would you like to have your child back?”</t:p>
<t:p>“You see, I couldn't bring it 'ere, sir. Ginx won't 'ave it; but I'd like to see it
            took away from them nunnerys.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Ha! very well then. We can perhaps manage it for you. You would be content to hand it
            over to some Protestant Home, where it would be taken care of and you could see it when
            you liked?”</t:p>
<t:p>“O yes, sir,” cries Mrs. Ginx, brightening.</t:p>
<t:p>“Then we'll have an affidavit and apply for a Habeas Corpus.”</t:p>
<t:p>It was impossible not to be satisfied with such words as these, whatever they meant and
            Mrs. Ginx was cheered, while the little man went on his way.</t:p>
