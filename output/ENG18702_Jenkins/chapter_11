<t:head>III.—The Sacrament of Baptism.</t:head>
<t:p>Mother, or “Mrs.” Suspiciosa, fed Ginx's Baby with holy pap. It seemed proper now that
            he should be christened and formally received into the Church. No small stir was made by
            this ceremony, for which all the resources of the convent were called into action. The
            day selected was that sacred to St. Ambrosius. The chapel was decorated with flowers.
            Mass was celebrated, candles flamed upon the altar surrounding a figure of the Infant
            Jesus, incense was burning around the baby, sisters and novices knelt in serried rows of
            virginity</t:p>
<t:quote><t:l> “like doves Sunning their milky bosoms on the thatch.” </t:l></t:quote>
<t:p>Mother Suspiciosa carried the infant, clothed in a pure white robe, with a red cross
            embroidered on its front. In the absence of the natural parent a wax figure of St.
            Ambrosius did duty for him, and another wax figure stood godfather: but I dare not enter
            into details of matters that may be looked at as awfully profane, or awfully solemn, by
            different spectators. These things are a mystery.</t:p>
<t:p>I have no hesitation about describing the impious behavior of little Ginx. Whatever
            swaddled infant could do in the way of opposition, with hands, and legs, and voice, was
            done by that embryo saint. The incense made him cough and sputter; the lights and
            singing raised the very devil within him. His cries drowned the prayers. He frightened
            his conductress by the redness of his face. He ruined the red cross with ejected matter.
            You would have taken him for an infant demoniac. Mother Suspiciosa, though annoyed, was
            encouraged. She looked upon this as an evident testimony to little Ginx's value. The
            devil and St. Michael were contending for his body. At length he was baptized, and
            carried out. Credat Judaeus. He instantly sank into a deep sleep. It was a miracle:
            Satan had yielded to the sign of the cross!</t:p>
