<t:head>XII.—No Funds—no Faith, no Works.</t:head>
<t:p>The Committee of the Protestant Detectoral Union on Ginx's Baby held twenty-three
            meetings. They were then as far from unity of purpose as when they set out. Variety was
            given to the meetings by the changing combinations of members in attendance. The
            finances were little heeded in the intensity of their zeal for truth. These at length
            fell altogether into the hands of the association's secretary, and we have seen involved
            large items of expense. The twenty-three meetings extended over a year. At the end of
            that time the secretary startled the committee by laying on the table a demand for the
            board and keep of the Protestant baby for three months, amounting to L 36; and adding
            that the sum in hand was L 1, 4s. 4 1/2d. In his report he said: “No effort has been
            spared by means of advertisements, pamphlets, tales, leaders and paragraphs in
            newspapers and religious journals, together with occasional sermons, to maintain the
            public interest in this child; but attention has been diverted from him by the great
            Roman Spozzi case, and the anxiety created throughout the Protestant world by the recent
            discovery made by Dr. Gooddee, of a solitary survivor of the ancient Church of the
            Vieuxbois Protestants in a secluded valley of the Pyrenees.”</t:p>
<t:p>The secretary asked the committee to provide the money to discharge the baby's
            liabilities; but they instantly adjourned, and no effort could afterwards get a quorum
            together. When the persons who had charge of the Protestant foundling discovered the
            state of affairs they began to dun the secretary and to neglect the child, now about
            thirteen months old and preparing to walk. Since no money appeared they sold whatever
            clothes had been provided for him, and absconded from the place where they had been
            farming him for Protestantism. The secretary, by chance hearing of this, was discreet
            enough to make no inquiries. Ginx's Baby, “as a Protestant question,” vanished from the
            world. I never heard that any one was asked what had been done with the funds; but I
            have already furnished the account that ought to have been rendered.</t:p>
