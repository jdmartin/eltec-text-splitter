<t:head>I.—Moved on.</t:head>
<t:p>Ginx's Baby's brothers and sisters would have nothing to say to him. Mrs. Ginx declared
            she could see in him no likeness to her own dear lost one; and her husband swore that
            the brat never was his. The couple had latterly been pinching themselves and their
            children to save enough to emigrate. For this purpose aid and counsel were given to them
            by a neighboring curate, whose name, were my pages destined to immortality, should be
            printed here in golden letters. Rich and full will be his sheaves when many a statesman
            reaps tares. Finding that a thirteenth child was imposed on them by so superior a force
            as the law of England the Ginxes hastened their departure.</t:p>
<t:p>Their last night in London, towards the small hours, Ginx, carrying our hero, went
            along Birdcage Walk. He scarcely knew where he was going, or how he was about to dispose
            of his burden, but he meant to get rid of it. On he went, here and there met by shadowy
            creatures who came towards his footsteps in the uncertain darkness, and when they could
            see that he was no quarry for them flitted away again into the night.</t:p>
<t:p>He passed the dingy houses, since replaced by the Foreign Office, across the open space
            before the Horse Guards, near the house of a popular Prime Minister, and up the broad
            steps till he stood under the York Column. The shadow of this was an inviting place, but
            a policeman turning his lantern suspiciously on the man walking about at that silent
            hour with a child in his arms frustrated his wish. Slowly Ginx tramped along Pall Mall,
            with only one other creature stirring, as it seemed for the moment—a gentleman who
            turned up the steps of a large building. Seating the child on the bottom step and
            telling him not to cry, Ginx instantly crossed the road, turned into St. James's Square,
            passed by the rails, and stealing from corner to corner through the mazes of that
            locality, reached home by way of Piccadilly and Grosvenor Place. Henceforth this history
            shall know him no more.</t:p>
