<t:head>III.—A thorough-paced Reformer—if not a Revolutionary.</t:head>
<t:p>By the kindness and influence of Sir Charles Sterling, Ginx's Baby that night, and long
            after, found shelter in the Radical Club. He gave rise to a discussion in the
            smoking-room next evening that ought to be chronicled. Several members of the committee
            supported his benefactor in urging that the child should be adopted by the Club, as a
            pledge of their resolve to make the questions of which he seemed to be the embodied
            emblem subjects of legislative action. Others said that those questions being, in their
            view, social and not political, were not proper ones to give impulse to a party
            movement, and that the entertainment in the Club of this foundling would be a gross
            irregularity: they did not want samples of the material respecting which they were
            theorizing. To some of the latter Sir Charles had been insisting that, whether they kept
            the child or not, they could not stifle the questions excited by his condition.</t:p>
<t:p>“You may delay, but you cannot dissipate them. We are filling up our sessions with
            party struggles, theoretic discussions, squabbles about foreign politics, debates on
            political machinery, while year by year the condition of the people is becoming more
            invidious and full of peril. Social and political reform ought to be linked; the people
            on whom you confer new political rights cannot enjoy them without health and
            well-being.”</t:p>
<t:p>“But all our legislation is directed to that!” exclaimed Mr. Joshua Hale. “Reform, Free
            Trade, Free Corn—have these not enhanced the wealth of the people?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Partially; yet there are classes unregenerated by their reviving influences. Free
            trade cannot insure work, nor can free corn provide food for every citizen.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Nor any other legislation: let us be practical. I own there is much to be done. I have
            often stated my 'platform.' We must clip the enormous expenditure on soldiers and ships;
            reduce our overweening army of diplomatic spies and busybodies; abstain from meddling in
            everybody's quarrels; redeem from taxation the workman's necessaries—a free
            breakfast-table; peremptorily legislate against the custom of primogeniture; encourage
            the distribution and transfer of land; and, under the aegis of the ballot, protect from
            the tyranny of the landlord and employer their tenants and workmen.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Very good, perhaps, all of them,” replied Sir Charles, “but some not at the moment
            possible, and all together are not exhaustive. Why do you not go to the bottom of social
            needs? You say nothing about Health legislation—are you indifferent to the sanitary
            condition of the people? You have not hinted at Education—Waste Lands—Emigration—”</t:p>
<t:p>“Oh! I am opposed to that altogether.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I forgot, you are a manufacturer; yet the last man of whom I should believe that
            selfishness had warped the judgment. You have done and endured more than any living
            statesman for the advantage of your fellow-citizens, so that I will not cast at you the
            aspersion of class-blindness. Still, I can scarcely think you have looked at this matter
            in the pure light of patriotism, and not within the narrow scope of trade
            interests.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Quite unjust. Our best economists reprehend the policy of depleting our labor-market.
            Emigration is a timely remedy for adversity and to be very sparingly used. Labor is our
            richest vein—”</t:p>
<t:p>“We may have too much of it. Take it as a fact that you now have more than you can use,
            and the unemployed part is starving; what will you do with them?”</t:p>
<t:p>“That is a mere temporary and casual depression, to which all classes are liable.”</t:p>
<t:p>“But,” said Sir Charles, “which none can so ill bear. Nay—what if it is permanent? You
            look to increased trade. Do you suppose we are to retain our manufacturing pre-eminence
            when every country, new and old, is competing with us? Can our trade, I ask you honestly
            to consider, increase at the rate of our population? Besides, for heaven's sake, look at
            the thing as a man. Grant that we have a hundred thousand men out of work, and hundreds
            of thousands more dependent on them—do you think it no small thing that the vast mass
            should be left for one, two, three years seething in sorrow and distress, while they are
            waiting for trade! By the time that comes they may have gone beyond the hope of rescue.
            Ah! if an elastic trade comes back to-morrow, you can never make those people what they
            were; ought we not to have forecast that they should not be what they are? But I contend
            that depression has become chronic, the poverty more wide-spread and persistent—how then
            shall we, who represent these classes among the rest, face the prospect?”</t:p>
<t:p>Here interposed a gentleman high in office, a pure, keen, rigid economist of the
            highest intellectual and political rank.</t:p>
<t:p>“My dear Sterling, pardon me if I say you are talking wildly. Perhaps you don't see
            that you are verging on rank communism. The working of economic laws can be as
            infallibly projected as a solar eclipse. You can secure no class from periodic calamity,
            and so regulate laws of supply and demand by guiding-wheels of legislation and taxation
            as to save every man from penury. You wish us to send away our bone and sinew because we
            have no present employment for it, and next year, or the year after, under a recovered
            trade you will be wringing your hands and cursing the folly that prompted you to do
            it.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I should be too glad of the opportunity,” replied Sir Charles, sturdily, “but in truth
            there is an incubus of excessive numbers that no revival of trade will provide for, even
            if it is beyond our extremest hopes, and I for one will not be guilty of the inhumanity
            of keeping fellow-creatures in misery till we can find a use for them. You have
            forgotten that there are other economic laws besides those you glance at. Several
            millions of acres of unoccupied land belonging in a sense to the people of this country
            are to be kept untilled in defiance of the plainest policy that nature and God have
            indicated to us, namely, that labor should come in contact with land! For want of this
            conjunction our colonies are to be checked, while at home miserable millions are gaping
            for work and food.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Oh! let them take themselves out. There are too many going already. They will follow
            natural laws, and where labor is required thither the stream will flow.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Mere surface talk, my clever friend,” replied the other, “the men who are trooping out
            at their own expense are our most sober, careful, and energetic workmen. Else they could
            not go. They go because here so many indifferent ones are weighing down their shoulders.
            And where do most of them go to? Not to strengthen and develop our colonies, but the
            United States—a not always friendly people, and just now your free-trader's
            bugbear!”</t:p>
<t:p>“Well, well,” said the minister, “drop that question. It's utterly impracticable at
            this time. We couldn't entertain the demand for State-help for an instant. I tell you
            again you're a Fourierite. You virtually propose to put your hand in the pocket of the
            upper classes to pay all sorts of expenses for the lower.”</t:p>
<t:p>“You may call me a communist if you please,” replied Sir Charles Sterling; “I do not
            shrink from shadows. Perhaps I am in favor of something nearer to communism than our
            present form of society. One thing I am clear about: no state of society is healthy
            wherein every man does not own himself to be the guardian of the interests of the
            community as well as his own—does not see that he is bound, morally and as a matter of
            public policy, to add to his neighbor's well-being as well as his own. Does not society,
            by its protection and aggregation, make it possible for the rich to grow rich, the
            genius and the ambitious man to pursue their aims, the merchant to gather his vails, the
            noble to enjoy his lands? For these privileges there is more or less to pay, and it may
            be that the proper proportion which the capable classes should be called upon to
            contribute to the common weal has never been correctly adjusted. The first fruit of
            practical Christianity was community of goods, and but for human selfishness we might
            hope for an Eutopian era—when, while it should be ruled that if a man would not work
            neither should he eat, there should also be brought home to every man the care of his
            poorer, or weaker, or less competent brother. I never expect to see that. I do hope to
            see the men of greatest ability pay more generously for the privileges they enjoy. The
            best policy for them too. The better the condition of the general community the better
            for themselves. You cannot alarm me with epithets. But these views are happily not
            essential to the support of the Emigration policy.”</t:p>
<t:p>“O dear! O dear! mad as a March hare!” cried the minister, as he stumped from the
            room.</t:p>
<t:p>“Sterling is a good fellow,” said he to a colleague with whom he walked down Pall Mall,
            “and a thorough-paced Liberal. Besides, he carries great weight in the House. But he is
            an enthusiast, and, therefore, not always quite practical.”</t:p>
<t:p>By PRACTICAL the minister meant, not that which might well and to advantage be done if
            good and able men would resolve to do it, spite of all hindrances, but that which, upon
            a cunning review of party balances and a judicious probing of public opinion, seemed to
            be a policy fit for his party to pursue. The first, original and masterly statesmen are
            needed to initiate and perform—the other is simply the art of a genius who knows how
            most adroitly to manipulate people and circumstances.</t:p>
