<t:head>IV.—Very Broad Views.</t:head>
<t:p>Sir Charles Sterling, Mr. Joshua Hale, and others continued the conversation
            interrupted by the minister's exit. What was to be done with Ginx's Baby? In the great
            dissected map of society what niches were cut out for him and all like him to fill? Most
            of the politicians were for leaving that to himself to find out. The term “law of supply
            and demand” was freely bandied between them, as it is in many journals nowadays, with
            little object save to shut up avenues of discussion by a high-sounding phrase.</t:p>
<t:p>Then of these “statesmen,” most clung, if not to self-interest, to personal crotchets.
            What is more darling to a man than the child of his intellect or fancy? How the poor
            poetaster hugs his tawdry verses as if they were the imperial ornaments of genius! Just
            in the same way does the politician love the policies himself hath devised, pressing
            them forward at all hazards, while he is blind to the utility of others. This is the
            basis of that aspect of selfishness which often mars in the approbation of a country a
            really honest statesmanship—an egotistic tenacity of one's own creature as the best,
            which yet is not the criminal selfishness of ambition. Still that egotism is not seldom
            disastrous to the people's interests. While these statesmen nursed their own bantlings
            and held them up to national notice, they were apt to avoid or too lightly regard the
            views of men as able as themselves. For instance, Joshua Hale—who is far above these
            remarks generally—had put forth a scheme for the solution of the St. Helena property
            question—very likely a good one, albeit revolutionary, and nothing would convince him
            that any other could succeed. He wished every man in St. Helena—a turbulent adjunct of
            the British Empire—to be a landowner, and I do think, neither desired nor hoped that any
            man in that island should be happy until he was one. Yet there were other men ready to
            offer simpler remedies, and to prove that if every man in St. Helena became a landowner
            it would become a very hell upon earth, and more unmanageable than it was before. If
            these gentlemen do not sacrifice their pet fancies for the sake of a settlement, what
            will become of St. Helena?</t:p>
<t:p>Just now they were discussing Ginx's Baby. One thought that repeal of the Poor-Laws and
            a new system of relief would reach his case; another saw the root of the Baby's sorrow
            in Trades' Unions; a third propounded cooperative manufactures; a fourth suggested that
            a vast source of income lay untouched in the seas about the kingdom, which swarmed with
            porpoises, and showed how certain parts of these animals were available for food, others
            for leather, others for a delicious oil that would be sweeter and more pleasant than
            butter; a fifth desired a law to repress the tendency of Scotch peers to evict tenants
            and convert arable lands into sheep-walks and deer-forests; a sixth maintained that
            there were waste lands in the kingdom of capacity to support hungry millions. In fact
            earth, heaven, and seas were to be regenerated by Act of Parliament for the benefit of
            Ginx's Baby and the people of England. Sir Charles listened impatiently, and at last
            burst forth again.</t:p>
<t:p>He said: “When you consider it, what we are all trying to do nowadays is—vulgarly—to
            improve the breed; but we go to work in a round-about way. At the outset we are met by
            the depreciated state of part of the existing generation; and one problem is to prevent
            these depreciated people from increasing, or to get them to increase healthily. No one
            seems to have gone directly to such a problem as that. The difficulties to be faced are
            tremendous. Your dirtiest British youngster is hedged round with principles of an
            inviolable liberty and rights of Habeas Corpus. You let his father and mother, or any
            one who will save you the trouble of looking after him, mould him in his years of
            tenderness as they please. If they happen to leave him a walking invalid, you take him
            into the poorhouse; if they bring him up a thief, you whip him and keep him at high cost
            at Millbank or Dartmoor; if his passions, never controlled, break out into murder and
            rape, you may hang him, unless his crime has been so atrocious as to attract the
            benevolent interest of the Home Secretary; if he commit suicide, you hold a coroner's
            inquest, which also costs money; and however he dies you give him a deal coffin and bury
            him. Yet I may prove to you that this being, whom you treat like a dog at a fair, never
            had a day's—no, nor an hour's—contact with goodness, purity, truth, or even human
            kindness; never had an opportunity of learning anything better. What right have you then
            to hunt him like a wild beast, and kick him and whip him, and fetter him and hang him by
            expensive complicated machinery, when you have done nothing to teach him any of the
            duties of a citizen?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Stop, stop, Sir Charles! you are too virulent. There are endless means of improving
            your lad—charities without number——”</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes, that will never reach him.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Never mind, they may, you know. Industrial schools, reformatories, asylums, hospitals,
            Peabody-buildings, poor-laws. Everybody is working to improve the condition of the poor
            man. Sanitary administration goes to his house and makes it habitable.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Very,” interjected Sir Charles Sterling, dryly.</t:p>
<t:p>“Factory laws protect and educate factory children——”</t:p>
<t:p>“They don't educate in one case out of ten. They don't feed them, clothe them, give
            them amusement and cultivation, do they?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Certainly not—that would be ridiculous.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Why, the question is whether that would be ridiculous!” replied Sir Charles. “I do not
            say it can be done, but in order to transform the next generation, what we should aim at
            is to provide substitutes for bad homes, evil training, unhealthy air, food and dulness,
            and terrible ignorance, in happier scenes, better teaching, proper conditions of
            physical life, sane amusements, and a higher cultivation. I dare say you would think me
            a lunatic if I proposed that Government should establish music-halls and gymnasia all
            over the country; but you, Mr. Fissure, voted for the Baths and Washhouses.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Who's to pay for all this?” asked Mr. Fissure, pertinently.</t:p>
<t:p>“The State, which means society, the whole of which is directly interested. I tell you
            a million of children are crying to us to set them free from the despotism of a crime
            and ignorance protected by law.”</t:p>
<t:p>“That is striking; but you are treading on delicate ground. The liberty of the
            subject——”</t:p>
<t:p>“Exactly what I expected you to say. These words can be used in defence of almost any
            injustice and tyranny. Such terms as 'political economy,' 'communism,' 'socialism,' are
            bandied about in the same way. Yet propositions coming fairly within these terms are
            often mentioned with approval by the very persons who cast them at you. In a report of a
            recent Royal Commission I find that one of the Commissioners is quite as revolutionary
            as I am. He says it is right by law to secure that no child shall be cruelly treated or
            mentally neglected, over-worked or under-educated. Some people would call that
            communism, I fancy. But I think him to be correct as a political economist in that broad
            proposition. Why? Because a child's relation to the State is wider, more permanent, and
            more important than his relation to his parents. If he is in danger of being depreciated
            and damned for good citizenship, the State must rescue him.”</t:p>
<t:p>“A paternal and maternal government together!” cries Lord Namby—“a government of
            nurses. You know I should like to stop the production of children among the lower
            orders. Your propositions are far in advance of my radicalism. The State must sometimes
            interfere between parent and child; for instance, in education or protection from
            cruelty. But, if I understand you, you actually contemplate a general refining and
            elevation of the working class by legislative means.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Assuredly: I should aim to cultivate their morals, refine their tastes, manners,
            habits. I wish to lift from them that ever-depressing sense of hopelessness which keeps
            them in the dust.”</t:p>
<t:p>“So do most men; but you must do that by personal and private influences, not by State
            enactments. How would you do it?”</t:p>
<t:p>“How? I think I could draw up a programme. For instance: Expatriate a million to reduce
            the competition that keeps poor devils on half-rations or sends them to the poorhouse;
            Take all the sick, maimed, old, and incapable poor into workhouses managed by humane men
            and not by ghouls; Forbid such people to marry and propagate weakness; Legislate for
            compulsory improvements of workmen's dwellings, and, if needful, lend the money to
            execute it; Extend and enforce the health laws; Open free libraries and places of
            rational amusement with an imperial bounty through the country; Instead of spending
            thousands on dilettanti sycophants at one end of the metropolis, distribute your art and
            amusement to the kingdom at large; The rich have their museums, libraries, and clubs,
            provide them for the poor; Establish temporary homes for lying-in women; Multiply your
            baths and washhouses till there is no excuse for a dirty person; Educate; Provide day
            schools for every proper child, and industrial or reformatory schools for every improper
            one; Open advanced High Schools for the best pupils, and found Scholarships to the
            Universities; Erect other schools for technical training; Offer to teach trades and
            agriculture to all comers for nothing—you would soon neutralize your bugbear of
            trades-unionism; Teach morals, teach science, teach art, teach them to amuse themselves
            like men and not like brutes. In a land so wealthy the programme is not impracticable,
            though severe. As the end to be attained is the welfare of future generations, no good
            reason could be urged why they should not contribute towards the cost of it—a better
            debt to leave to posterity than the incubus of an irrational war.”</t:p>
<t:p>Will any sane political practitioner wonder to be told that at the end of this harangue
            the smoking-room party broke up, and that some, as they laughed good-humoredly over
            Sterling's egregia, recalled the number of glasses of inspirited seltzer swallowed by
            the orator? He was so far in advance of the most radical reformer that there was no hope
            of overtaking him for an era or two: so they determined to fancy they had left him
            behind.</t:p>
