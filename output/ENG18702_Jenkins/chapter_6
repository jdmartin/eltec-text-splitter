<t:head>VI.—The Antagonism of Law and Necessity.</t:head>
<t:p>In eighteen months, notwithstanding resolves, menaces, and prophecies, GINX'S BABY was
            born. The mother hid the impending event long, from the father. When he came to know it,
            he fixed his determination by much thought and a little extra drinking. He argued thus:
            “He wouldn't go on the parish. He couldn't keep another youngster to save his life. He
            had never taken charity and never would. There was nothink to do with it but drown it!”
            Female friends of Mrs. Ginx bruited his intentions about the neighborhood, so that her
            “time” was watched for with interest. At last it came. One afternoon Ginx, lounging
            home, saw signs of excitement around his door in Rosemary Street. A knot of women and
            children awaited his coming. Passing through them he soon learned what had happened.
            Poor Mrs. Ginx! Without staying to think or argue, he took up the little stranger and
            bore it from the room——</t:p>
<t:p>“O, O, O, Ginx! Ginx!!”</t:p>
<t:p>She would have risen, but a strong power called weakness pulled her back.</t:p>
<t:p>The man meanwhile had reached the street.</t:p>
<t:p>“Here he comes! There's the baby! He's going to do it, sure enough!” shrieked the
            women. The children stood agape. He stopped to consider. It is very well to talk about
            drowning your baby, but to do it you need two things, water and opportunity. Vauxhall
            Bridge was the nearest way to the former, and towards it Ginx turned.</t:p>
<t:p>“Stop him!”</t:p>
<t:p>“Murder!”</t:p>
<t:p>“Take the child from him!”</t:p>
<t:p>The crowd grew larger, and impeded the man's progress. Some of his fellow-workmen stood
            by regarding the fun.</t:p>
<t:p>“Leave us aloan, naabors,” shouted Ginx; “this is my own baby, and I'll do wot I likes
            with it. I kent keep it; an' if I've got anythin' I kent keep, it's best to get rid of
            it, ain't it? This child's goin' over Wauxhall Bridge.”</t:p>
<t:p>But the women clung to his arms and coattails.</t:p>
<t:p>“Hallo! What's all this about?” said a sharp, strong man, well-dressed, and in good
            condition, coming up to the crowd; “another foundling! Confound the place, the very
            stones produce babies. Where was it found?”</t:p>
<t:p>CHORUS (recognizing a deputy-relieving officer). It warn't found at all; it's Ginx's
            baby.</t:p>
<t:p>OFFICER. Ginx's baby? Who's Ginx?</t:p>
<t:p>GINX. I am.</t:p>
<t:p>OFFICER. Well?</t:p>
<t:p>GINX. Well!</t:p>
<t:p>CHORUS. He's goin' to drown it.</t:p>
<t:p>OFFICER. Going to drown it? Nonsense.</t:p>
<t:p>GINX. I am.</t:p>
<t:p>OFFICER. But, bless my heart, that's murder!</t:p>
<t:p>GINX. No 'tain't. I've twelve already at home. Starvashon's sure to kill this 'un. Best
            save it the trouble.</t:p>
<t:p>CHORUS. Take it away, Mr. Smug, he'll kill it if you don't.</t:p>
<t:p>OFFICER. Stuff and nonsense! Quite contrary to law! Why, man, you're bound to support
            your child. You can't throw it off in that way;—nor on the parish neither. Give me your
            name. I must get a magistrate's order. The act of parliament is as clear as daylight. I
            had a man up under it last week. “Whosoever shall unlawfully abandon or expose any
            child, being under the age of two years whereby the life of such child shall be
            endangered or the health of such child shall have been or shall be likely to be
            permanently injured (drowning comes under that I think) shall be GUILTY OF a MISDEMEANOR
            and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be KEPT IN
            PENAL SERVITUDE for the term of three years or to be imprisoned for any term not
            exceeding two years with or without hard labor.”</t:p>
<t:p>Mr. Smug, the officer, rolled out this section in a sonorous monotone, without stops,
            like a clerk of the court. It was his pride to know by heart all the acts relating to
            his department, and to bring them down upon any obstinate head that he wished to crush.
            Ginx's head, however, was impervious to an act of parliament. In his then temper, the
            Commination Service or St. Ernulphus's curse would have been feathers to him. The only
            feeling aroused in his mind by the words of the legislature was one of resentment. To
            him they seemed unjust, because they were hard and fast, and made no allowance for
            circumstances. So he said:</t:p>
<t:p>GINX. D—— the act of parliament! What's the use of saying I shan't abandon the child,
            when I can't keep it alive?</t:p>
<t:p>OFFICER. But you're bound by law to keep it alive.</t:p>
<t:p>GINX. Bound to keep it alive? How am I to do it? There's the rest on 'em there (nodding
            towards his house) little better nor alive now. If that's an act of Parleyment, why
            don't the act of Parleyment provide for 'em? You know what wages is, and I can't get
            more than is going.</t:p>
<t:p>CHORUS. Yes. Why don't Parleyment provide for 'em? You take the child, Mr. Smug.</t:p>
<t:p>OFFICER (regardless of grammar). ME take the child! The parish has enough to do to take
            care of foundlings and children whose parents can't or don't work. You don't suppose we
            will look after the children of those who can?</t:p>
<t:p>GINX. Jest so. You'll bring up bastards and beggars' pups, but you won't help an honest
            man to keep his head above water. This child's head is goin' under water anyhow!—and he
            prepared to bolt, amid fresh screams from the Chorus.</t:p>
