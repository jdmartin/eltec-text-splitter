<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p>IT was early in the evening, and we were walking slowly along the Boulevard
     Montmartre, when I saw a wayworn woman coming with staggering steps towards us, but at some
     distance yet. Her dress was torn; her pale face was turned anxiously to each passer-by,
     scanning every one with a wild scrutiny, not curious so much as full of yearning; her fair hair
     was hanging in disordered masses about her face and neck; but when I tried to speak, pointing
     her out to Joshua, something in my throat prevented me. There was no need to speak ; she saw
     <pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7083-242"/> us almost as soon as I had recognised her, and, holding out
     her hands, as we came up hurriedly, said with a plaintive kind of weary smile, “I knew that I
     should light on you, Joshua!”</p>
<p>Then she sank in a heap at his feet, her arms stretched out, and her fair hair trailed in the
     dust.</p>
<p>Poor loving, faithful Mary! She had travelled for the last days on foot; and if we men had
     suffered on our journey, she had suffered ten times more. It seems she had set out almost
     immediately after us, though she had been more than three weeks longer on the road. She was but
     an ignorant girl, it must be remembered; she had not come yet to the point of knowing that
     obedience was even a higher quality than love, and that love is best shown by obedience.</p>
<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7083-243"/>
<p>Here she was however, and we took her home to our lodgings in the Rue Blanche; and the
     concierge laughed significantly when asked for a room where she might be lodged. It would have
     been better to have refused her admission altogether, than to have laughed and leered as he
     did. The blood came into Joshua's pale face for just a moment; but there was no likelihood of
     his failing to do right for fear of its looking like wrong, so he gravely gave Mary his hand,
     and led her to our apartment. She was full of self-reproach and contrition when she saw the
     false position in which she had placed him; but he would not hear a word. “If you have been
     less than wise, my girl,” he said, “you have been true of heart; so we will balance the one
     against the other, and cry quits!”</p>
<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7083-244"/>
<p>This concierge was a man who, from the first, inspired me with disgust and a vague dread. He
     was a red-haired, coarse-featured, ruffianly-looking fellow, by name Legros; now in the time of
     the Commune a noisy republican; but one could fancy him under the Empire standing with his
     greasy cap in hand shouting, “Vive l'Empereur!” with the loudest. He was a man who had not, I
     should say, one single guiding principle of life save selfishness—a frank, cynical, unabashed
     selfishness—a selfishness that believed in nothing save self; and to whom amassing miserable
     little sums of money to be spent in sensuality, was the ultimate of human cleverness and
     happiness; a man without faith, honour, justice, or mercy. I do not think I am too hard in my
     judgment of him; for he was one of the men
     <pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7083-245"/> who make the theory of the devil very easy to believe.</p>
<p>Among the sentiments professed by Legros was that of disbelief in womanly virtue. He laughed
     at the idea of purity as possible in the friendship of men and women, and of course had his own
     ideas about Mary; which it seems he expressed pretty plainly. It was some gross insult, I never
     heard precisely what, that he offered to the poor girl which brought the whole thing to a
     conclusion. We had both been out, leaving her at home; and when we came back we found her in a
     state of excitement and indignation at something that had happened during our absence. She told
     Joshua, not me; and indeed, the first I rightly heard of it was when Joshua came back from
     downstairs, where he had been into the porter's
     <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7083-246"/> lodge, and had thrashed Legros to within an inch of his
     life. This was the first and only time he had ever raised his hand against any one; and I was
     sorry he had not left the job to me. I would have done it as well, and he would have kept his
     hands clean. Yet for all this, when Legros, who had been wounded by a chance splinter, was in
     the hospital, Joshua attended to him specially, and mainly kept him alive by his care.</p>
<p>No one worked harder in these days of dread and turmoil than Joshua. This was what he had
     come to do. Among the poor and starving, the wounded and dismayed, there he was, day after day,
     helping all who needed so far as he could, tender as a woman, faithful and strong as a hero. Or
     he did the work of the Commune, as he might be ordered; and they had no more trustworthy
     <pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7083-247"/> official. Never a thought of self came in to weaken or
     distract him. For several nights at a stretch he did not go to bed, and he seemed to have the
     strength of half-a-dozen men, and to be kept up by an almost supernatural power. For the famine
     that was wasting the city was touching him with no tender hand. Day by day he got paler and
     thinner; his eyes, always bright and as if they were looking at something farther off than we
     could see, were sunk and dark and hollow; his cheeks were drawn and pale, his lips blackening
     and parched. But he never complained; he never seemed to think of himself at all; and if he had
     been without food for twelve hours or twenty-four, the chances were that he would share his
     scanty rations with the first passer-by who looked famine-stricken. Mary too was suffering
     <pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7083-248"/> from the want and privation of all kinds with which we were
     afflicted. We did what we could for her, be sure. If my life could have bought hers or his, I
     would have laid it down as willingly as I would have given them my bitter crust. But they bore
     up bravely, both of them; and she helped too with the sick and wounded. She was let to nurse in
     the English ambulances, where she was interpreted when necessary; and even at the worst her
     face as she went softly about the beds was pleasant for the sick and dying to look at. And here
     let me say how entirely in these late years all trace of her former condition had passed out of
     it. Purified by love; that was it; so that she looked now as if she might have come out of a
     convent. This is no fancy of my own. Any one who knew Joshua, and consequently
     <pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7083-249"/> Mary Prinsep whom he had saved, will endorse what I say.</p>
<p>Things were looking wild and stormy, and the day of our doom was coming near. The
     Versaillists were too strong for us, and the hope of European freedom was over for the time;
     only for the time! For so sure as day follows on the night, so surely will the law of human
     rights follow on the tyrannies and oppressions which have so long ruled the world; and the
     faith for which the Commune bled, will be triumphant. But for the present, God help this poor
     sorrowful world of ours.</p>
<p>The Vicaire-Général had gone to Versailles, but he had not returned; and no answer had been
     vouchsafed to the offer made, now I think for the third time, to release the Archbishop and the
     other hostages for the one
     <pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7083-250"/> exchange of Blanqui. How often must the story be told? And
     will it ever be acknowledged by those who care only, right or wrong, to fasten the stain of
     blood-guiltiness on the Commune, that the real murderer of Monseigneur Darboy, and the rest,
     was M. Thiers? He knew what would happen, as well as a man knows will happen if he puts a
     lighted match to a barrel of gunpowder. He knew that the hostages would be sacrificed. Inflamed
     as Paris was, surrounded by an enemy that treated her like a wild beast, and even shook hands
     with the common foe for her destruction, her best men spoken of as creatures below humanity,
     her hour of humiliation and bloody agony at hand—he knew there would be no calm reasoning out
     of consequences, no quiet acceptance of the result. Men's blood was up; and the
     <pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7083-251"/> result was foreseen and played for. It was a heavy stake to
     pay; but to discredit the Commune, and attach to it the ineffaceable stain of blood-guiltiness,
     was worth even an Archbishop and some sixty other lives!</p>
<p>We were at the prison during the time of the execution. It would be impossible to describe
     distinctly how it all took place. No one has, and no one ever will. The whole thing as
     confusion. No person knew exactly what was being done, or by whom; and no one had any
     recognised authority. The leaders of the Commune were fighting singly at the barricades, and
     for the time all executive government was at an end. The tumult and excitement at the prison
     was beyond all power of description. Men went and came; orders were given and contradicted;
     women shrieked, some for blood
     <pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7083-252"/> and some for mercy; youths shouted; and through all, and
     above all, we heard the roar of the cannon, the whistling of the shells, and saw the smoke and
     flame of Paris rising up against the sky.</p>
<p>Joshua, mounted on a gun-barrel, pleaded for the lives of the unfortunate men.</p>
<p>“The work that the Commune had pledged itself to do,” he said, “was to help on the freedom of
     the working classes, by proving to the world their nobility and power of self-government. The
     slaughter of unarmed men would do none of this. It would give their enemies a just handle
     against them, for it was a baseness unworthy of them—an act neither human nor noble, neither
     righteous nor generous. Whatever the wrong committed by the Government at Versailles, the
     innocent ought not to suffer. Let the Commune
     <pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7083-253"/> mune show itself supreme in virtue at this moment of trial,
     and put the temptation of blood-guiltiness away from it.”</p>
<p>While he spoke Legros drew his revolver from his belt.</p>
<p>“Death to the English traitor!” he cried. “Death to the tool of the priests! he believes in
     Jesus Christ!”</p>
<p>“Christ! we want no Christs here? Death to the traitor!” shouted one or two of the mob.</p>
<p>Sick with dread for the safety of the man I loved best on earth, I sprang forward and covered
     Joshua's body with my own; when a fine-looking man—he was one of us then, but, as he is now in
     office under Thiers, I will not say who he was—quietly struck the revolver from Legros's
     hand.</p>
<p>“Keep your bullets for your enemies,
     <pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7083-254"/> fool!—do not give them to your friends,” he said; “this man
     is not a hostage.” Then hurriedly, aside, to Joshua, “Escape while you can; I will cover your
     retreat, and divert their attention.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that I had the voice of a God to teach them wisdom!” cried Joshua.</p>
<p>“Pshaw mon ami!” said our friend, contemptuously. “Your best wisdom is now is to save your
     own life—not to try and teach men anything.”</p>
<p>“Out with you, spies, traitors, priest-ridden Tartuffes! We want no sympathizers with tyranny
     here!” shouted an excited, half-mad looking man close to us. “Out with them, citoyens!”</p>
<p>And at the word half-a-dozen men and women, shrieking, and gesticulating, laid hands on us
     and roughly thrust us out. I
     <pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7083-255"/> thought it fortunate we left with our lives, for indeed, the
     wild, surging crowd was in no mood for mercy just then; and a couple of lives, more or less,
     were of small account at that moment. Howbeit, we were flung out with many a blow and bitter
     word; and just as we were going through the gateway a loud yell burst forth, a volley was
     fired, and we knew that the policy of Versailles had triumphed.</p>
<p>A few Parisians—<emph>not the Commune</emph>—had fallen into the snare prepared for them; and
     the blood was shed which was to cover Liberty with shame, until men can hear and learn the
     truth.</p>
<p>The last day came. The guns of our forts were silent; the men were fighting in the streets,
     desperate, conquered, but not craven. The Versaillists were pouring in
     <pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7083-256"/> like wolves let loose; Paris was drenched with blood, and in
     flames. And then the cry of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">pétroleuses</foreign> went up like the
     fire that shot against the sky. What mattered it that it was a lie? It gave the Party of Order
     another reason, if they had wanted any, to excuse their lust of blood. It was their saturnalia,
     and they did not stint themselves. The arms, that had served them so ill against the Prussians,
     served them but too well against their countrymen; and the short hour of a nation's hope was at
     an end in the bloody reprisals of brothers, that exceeded all we have ever heard or read of in
     a victorious foreign army.</p>
<p>I had been separated from my friends for more than twenty-four hours. The house where we had
     lodged was in flames; and when I went to seek information at a Communist
     <pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7083-257"/> munist friend's, De Lancy, I found a group of three by the
     concierge door—himself, his young wife, and a little daughter not two years old, lying as if
     asleep, save for the blood that was their bed. They had been bound together and shot. Not one,
     but hundreds and thousands of such cases stand recorded in the history of that terrible moment,
     when the victorious Versaillists marched into Paris, and society revenged itself on the men who
     had dared to dream of redressing its wrongs; and among the terrible sights that met me, the
     evidences of brutal, wanton, sickening murder, I had a shuddering dread that I should find
     Joshua and Mary. I was never so nearly mad as I was that day when I wandered about the
     bloody-streets of Paris, looking for my friends; sorrow for the lost cause, horror at
     <pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7083-258"/> the scenes I encountered, and fear for those I loved, all
     combining to render life in that hour simply torture.</p>
<p>At last I caught a glimpse of Mary crossing the street, carrying a wounded child in her arms,
     and making for the ambulance. I called to her, and hurried after her; but, weak as I was with
     excitement and want of food, I could not make my voice reach her.</p>
<p>Just then, cap in hand and bowing low, Jacques Legros rushed out of a ruined house and
     stopped the captain of a troop that came marching down the street. He pointed in a frantic way
     to Mary.</p>
<p>“V'la, mon Capitaine,” he said, weeping and sobbing loudly, as one in the greatest distress;
     “c'est la cocotte d'un Communiste Anglais—c'est une pétroleuse! Elle a fait
     <pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7083-259"/> sauter la maison de ma mère. C'est ce que je sais, moi!”</p>
<p>“Prends-la,” said the Captain in an odd, half bitter, half matter-of-fact way. And Mary was
     seized by a couple of his men, and brought up close to where he stood.</p>
<p>“C'est une jolie cible, ça!” he said with a brutal laugh. “C'est dommage—une belle fille
     comme ça! Mais on ne doit pas être pétroleuse, ma fille. Fi donc!”</p>
<p>“I have done no harm,” said Mary, with her wild eyes searching his in vain for pity. “I have
     done only what good I could to all!”</p>
<p>“Is setting fire to honest women's houses doing good, wretch?” said the Captain, suddenly
     changing his mocking manner for one of ferocious sternness, and speaking in
     <pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7083-260"/> broken English. “A pétroleuse?—you are not fit to live!”</p>
<p>“She is no pétroleuse,” I cried.</p>
<p>But as I spoke a blow laid me senseless; and when I came to myself I found myself lying
     wounded on the ground, with Mary stretched beside me—shot through the heart.</p>
<p>It was then night time; but soon after I recovered, and just as I was in the first agony of
     understanding what had happened, Joshua, and the same man who had saved his life at the time of
     the murder of the hostages in the prison, came up to where we lay, searching for us.</p>
<p>I have no more to tell of this episode. Our Mary was buried tenderly, lovingly; and I laid
     part of my life in her grave. What Joshua felt I never knew exactly.
     <pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7083-261"/> He did not say much; and though once I saw him, when he
     thought I was asleep, lay his head on his hands and weep bitterly, he never gave me a hint as
     to whether he was grieving at the loss of Mary, or at the failure of the cause. Whichever it
     was, it nearly broke him down; and ill as I was myself, with a bad wound and a smashed
     collar-bone, I saw that his distress was greater than my own, and needed more consideration. I
     was desperately afraid more than once that he was going to die. For myself, I felt as if I
     could not die while Joshua lived, perhaps to want me.</p>
<p>However that might be, we neither of us came to grief of that kind. I got well in time; and
     when I could travel, and a fitting opportunity arrived, our friend, who had kept us all this
     time in safety, got us sent off to
     <pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7083-262"/> England. And right glad was I when we landed safe in the Old
     Country once more. Joshua was glad too. He had suffered much from the confinement, inertia, and
     disappointment of the last few weeks;—coming too, after a time of such intense hope and
     excitement; and once in England, he thought he could do something for the Humanity he loved,
     for the Truth to which he had consecrated his life.</p>
