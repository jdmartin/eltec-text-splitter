<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>IN London a new view of life opened to Joshua altogether. The first thing that
     struck him in our workshop was the avowed infidelity of the workmen, with the indifference so
     many of them showed for any spiritual life at all. Having apparently made up their minds that
     Christianity, as taught by the churches and practised in high places, is a humbug throughout,
     they seemed to have stopped there, not caring to go farther, nor to find a truer and better
     religion for themselves. Distrust had penetrated to their inmost
     <pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7083-064"/> most souls, and God was abandoned because man had betrayed
     them. Some of the better class among them had become Unitarians; which gave them the most
     religion with the least dogma of all the sects that go by the name of Christian; and some had
     transferred their whole passion and life of thought and intellectual energy to science, finding
     that consolation in nature which they could not get from revelation. But very few were what is
     called religious men: that is, men believing in the Bible, going to church on Sundays, and
     reverencing the clergy as men placed over them by a higher power to guide their souls as they
     would.</p>
<p>The immense gulf existing between the church and the workmen also surprised the Cornish lad.
     At home, though the cottagers and the clergy stood as wide as the poles
     <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7083-065"/> apart, socially and intellectually, yet there was some kind
     of mutual knowledge and intercourse; which, if it meant little for human wants and less for
     spiritual needs, still was intercourse and knowledge. In London there was none; or so little in
     proportion to the work to be done, it seemed almost as good as none. The parish priest, save in
     some chiefly ritualistic exceptions, scarcely exists, and his place is supplied by all sorts of
     lieutenants, both authorised and irregular; by Bible women, the City missionaries, Baptists,
     Roman Catholics, and the thousand and one odd, obscure sectaries of whom no one in good society
     ever heard the names—anything rather than the fashionable preacher who has invested all his
     store of godliness in his sermons, or the beneficed clergyman who thinks his East-end
     <pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7083-066"/> income dearly bought at the price of his East-end
     residence.</p>
<p>As he grew however, to understand the inner relations of life in the metropolis, he ceased to
     wonder at the wide-spread indifferentism of the working men; and he came further to understand
     how religion, like other things, had followed that class antagonism felt by the artisan, to
     which the exclusiveness of caste cherished by the rich had given birth. Christianity represents
     to the poor, not Christ tender to the sinful, visiting the leprous, the brother of publicans,
     at whose feet sat the harlots and were comforted, but the bishop in his palace and the parson
     in his grand house, the gentleman taking sides with God against the poor and oppressed, as an
     elder brother in the courts of heaven kicking the younger out of doors. It is in
     <pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7083-067"/> fact, he used to say, antagonism not love; Cain not
     Christ.</p>
<p>His religious experiences followed the natural course of such a mind as his, at once so
     earnest and so logical. Attracted by the self-sacrificing lives of so many of the Ritualist
     party, he threw himself with ardour into the congregation of a noted City priest whose name I
     do not feel justified in giving, as I have not asked his consent. If, however, he should read
     these pages he will remember Joshua Davidson well enough. The Superior, as he was called, took
     to him greatly, and Joshua felt all the charm of close intercourse with a cultivated mind. It
     was the first time this great good had been granted him, and it was like a new life to him. At
     one time I thought he would have abandoned the independent line he had
     <pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7083-068"/> chosen and would have gone over to the High Church party; but
     I do not think now that he was ever very near. For, fascinated as he was with the earnestness
     and culture of the Superior and his colleagues, they failed to hold him mainly because of the
     largeness of their assertions, the smallness of their proofs, and the feeling he had that more
     lay behind their position than they acknowledged, and that they used their adherents as tools.
     Added to which, their devotion to the Church rather than to Christianity at large, the
     absorption of the human example of Christ in His mystical character, the deification of the man
     as He lived, as if He had walked about like a God with a halo round His head, and was not a
     real man of the people of his time—of lowly birth, of confessed scientific ignorance, in
     antagonism to all the wealth and
     <pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7083-069"/> culture, and class-refinement and political economy of His
     day, fighting the cause of the poor against the rich, of the outcast against the aristocrats,
     just as any earnest democrat, any single-hearted communist, might be doing at the present
     day—all this repelled him from close union; and all this made him feel that, great and good as
     the men themselves are, in the High Church movement was not his Shekinah. Then again, their
     elaborate system of symbolism seemed to him puerile; a playing with spiritual toys that had
     less reality than ingenuity; and their central creed of sacrifice rather than commemoration in
     the Eucharist, backed by their assumption of a priesthood possessing unproved and mysterious
     powers, failed to convince him.</p>
<p>“You have captivated my heart,” he one
     <pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7083-070"/> day said to the Superior—“you charm my tastes—you delight my
     imagination; but you have not mastered my reason. Fairly reasoned out I do not think your
     position is tenable. You are Roman Catholics under another name; irregulars claiming to be
     received on the footing of the acknowledged Body Guard; you are infallible yet eclectic, and I
     cannot concede infallibility to eclecticism.”</p>
<p>“But have you no reverence for the virtues of obedience and humility?” asked the Superior.
     “Cannot you quell that questioning spirit of yours for the sake of the Church's honour, and to
     maintain a close front? Who can hope to do anything as an isolated unit against a host? Is not
     the whole secret of strength in organisation?”</p>
<p>“But I cannot become part of a system
     <pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7083-071"/> for expediency!” said Joshua mournfully. “Some men may, but
     it is not given to me to be able to stifle my own individual conscience for any considerations
     of party strength. I have got it to do—to find out if practical Christianity is possible in the
     world, and to learn why, being Christians, we are not of Christ. I know I should get something
     of the kind in such institutions as St. Vincent de Paul and the like, but I should have there
     so much in excess of the simple faith I love, that I cannot join them. I must go on my way
     alone.”</p>
<p>“And you will fail,” said the Superior. “No one man can succeed in such a search as yours.
     Guided by wise counsels and supported by authority you might come to satisfactory conclusions;
     but adrift on the wide sea of dissent, and private opinion, and individual
     <pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7083-072"/> vidual interpretation, you are lost. To the Church came the
     promise and the Spirit; believe in the Church is your only ark.”</p>
<p>“If any, then the Roman Catholic at once, frankly and without reserve,” said Joshua. “If the
     keys of life and death are held by a governing body, they are surely held within the Vatican;
     and if I must enter into the virtue of unquestioning obedience, I would rather accept it in its
     totality. Your ritualism seems to me like Canute and the waves. ‘Thus far and no farther,’ you
     say to private inquiry; and ‘only so much and so much will we take of tradition and the
     vitality of past ages.’ Where is your standing-point? where your logical foothold? By what
     authority do you reject and accept at will? and by what measure
     <pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7083-073"/> sure do you set the length of the tether of reason?”</p>
<p>“If you are for the whole history of the Church you must read more closely than you have
     done,” said the Superior a little evasively.</p>
<p>“Forgive me, sir,” continued Joshua earnestly; “I know you will, whatever I say; for I am
     speaking now heart-open, man to man, and there is no question of discourtesy or of courtesy;
     but with all my personal love and admiration for the professors of your creed, the creed itself
     is tainted with an insincerity I cannot digest. And your position, standing as you do in the
     front, between yearning souls demanding the support of authority, the moral protection of
     infallibility, and the only Western Church that can give it logically, is, to my
     <pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7083-074"/> way of thinking, both dangerous to yourselves and cruel to
     the people. Why do you not go over to Rome at once, sir, since your commission is
     self-appointed and irregular?”</p>
<p>The Superior smiled gently. “I never argue,” he said; “for I never found any good to come of
     it. These questions are matters for spiritual reception, not dialectical discussion. Use the
     appointed means and the grace of our Lord will find you.”</p>
<p>“I have used them; I do use them; and yet I cannot get conviction,” Joshua made answer, as
     sorrowfully as frankly.</p>
<p>“Persevere!” said the Superior solemnly; “the promises of God never failed yet.”</p>
<p>Joshua did not speak. He remembered his trial of the material promises and how
     <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7083-075"/> they failed; but he did not go into that with the Superior.
     He had learnt to look back on the phase through which he had passed then as a boyish craze,
     sincere if you will, but a craze all the same. Yet it had struck into him, and, perhaps unknown
     to himself how much, had helped greatly to modify his views. It had broken down his belief in
     the literal exactness of the Scriptures, and the science-lectures he attended event the same
     way; and when one's childlike confidence has received its first shock, it is long before
     anything like an analogous faith is reconstructed out of more mature knowledge.</p>
<p>At this time Joshua's mind was like an unpiloted vessel. He was beset with doubts, in which
     the only thing that kept its shape or place was the character of
     <pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7083-076"/> Christ. For the rest, everything had failed him.</p>
<p>“What,” he said to me at this time, “if the spiritual life is as little real as that act of
     faith in which we all failed?—if what we call conviction is only a state of the mind—a
     subjective condition owning no absolute without—a state as good and righteous for the Buddhist,
     for the Mohammedan, for the Hindoo, as for the various Christian denominations? We are all
     convinced. Every creed has had its martyrs and enthusiasts and its well-trained, well-balanced
     professors, all as firmly convinced of its truth and of its being the one truth only, as the
     Superior is convinced of the absolute rightness of Anglicanism, as the Pope believes in the
     infallibility of his Church, and the whole Christian world in
     <pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7083-077"/> the impregnability of the Bible and its literal exactness. I
     cannot focus God as these men are able to do; and yet I feel it better to be rooted than
     wandering, as I am wandering now, unfixed and unnourished. If you are rooted you can grow; but
     floating, hovering, what is the soul but as one of those winged seeds carried about by the wind
     and fastened nowhere?”</p>
<p>“And yet,” I answered, “it is better to be unfastened from a fallacy than to be rooted on it.
     There must be the moment of suspension when you are in progress. To mount a ladder you must
     leave the rung on which you stand, and before you have your foot on the other it is
     nowhere—only in space. The time of doubt is a time of pain, but it must be passed through if we
     would believe the better thing. To have lost the
     <pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7083-078"/> old land-marks—left them behind us—is not necessarily to have
     lost the right way, Joshua!”</p>
<p>“Ah! but to have been so near to God as I once felt myself—to have lived in the light—and now
     to be so far off—to be in darkness and alone!” he sighed.</p>
<p>“The darkest hour is that before dawn,” was my reply. “Even at this moment God may be
     preparing you for conviction.”</p>
<p>I do not think that what is called the Evangelical school ever warmed Joshua as the
     Ritualists had done. If the assumptions of the Church, clad in her venerable authority, seemed
     to him excessive, the assumptions of sectarianism, where each man is an independent pope and
     quite as bigoted as the real one, were more so. And he could
     <pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7083-079"/> not come to believe that faith, which is a thing we cannot
     give ourselves, which will not come for the seeming, and which, when we have it, is as likely
     to lead us wrong as right—unless all beliefs are true alike; which sectarianism does not
     admit—is the one sole means of salvation, without which we are lost. It seemed to him a theory
     entangled in contradictions. Faith is the gift of God; no one can believe at will, but only as
     God gives him grace to do so; but if you do not believe you are damned, and God punishes you
     for not having what He will not bestow. Again, you have to distinguish between your various
     kinds of faith, and you must discern accurately which kind is sent by God and which by the
     devil. No outward test can tell you: for the Calvinist holds the Romanist in deadly error; the
     Romanist damns
     <pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7083-080"/> the heretic with no hope of mercy; the Anglican talks about
     the deadly sin of dissent; and not one of them all regards the Unitarian, the Jew, or the
     Pagan, as in any sort of possibility a child of God, or as aught but a confirmed, if
     unconscious, son of the devil. What known test then can be applied to all these conflicting
     schools? To Joshua's mind, none; and the more he sought for the unerring truth—truth
     centralised, unified, focussed—the less, it seemed to him, he found it, and the more dignity
     and grandeur and charity he felt resided in the wide creed of Universalism.</p>
<p>During this time he did not neglect what I suppose may be called secular life. He attended
     all such science-classes as he had time for; and being naturally quick in study, he picked up a
     vast deal of knowledge in a
     <pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7083-081"/> very short time; he interested himself in politics, in
     current social questions, specially those relating to labour and capital, and in the condition
     of the poor. This, above all, was his main subject; and perhaps more than any thing else, the
     fact that all the sects and denominations he had searched into accepted the class divisions of
     the present time as final, and thought that it was enough to preach the Gospel to the poor—that
     is, to preach to them submission and patience, and belief that Christ was God, and then leave
     them to their physical wretchedness and social degradation as to things that must be, and with
     which they must make themselves content—had turned him from communion with them, one and all.
     It was such a comfortable way of getting rid of a difficulty, he used to say. It
     <pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7083-082"/> was offering a potential heaven as a bribe to induce the
     starving and the down-trodden to be patient with their sufferings, and submissive to the unjust
     tyranny of circumstances. It was shirking the question of Christian equality altogether, and
     nullifying the whole teaching and tendency of Christ's life.</p>
<p>So his time passed, and his thoughts went more and more into the rationalistic channel; till
     at last one evening, when I and other of his friends were sitting with him, he made his
     declaration.</p>
<p>“Friends,” he said, “I have at last cleared my mind and come to a Belief. I have proved to
     myself the sole meaning of Christ; it is Humanity. I relinquish the miracles, the doctrine of
     the Atonement, the doctrine of the Divinity of Jesus, and the
     <pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7083-083"/> unelastic finality of His knowledge. He was the product of
     His time; and if He went beyond it in some things, He was only abreast of it in others. His
     views of human life were oriental; His images are drawn from the autocratic despotism of the
     great and the slavish submission of the humble, and there is never a word of reprobation of
     these conditions, as conditions, only of the individuals according to their desert. He did His
     best to remedy that injustice, so far as there might be solace in thought, by proclaiming the
     spiritual equality of all men, and the greater value of worth than status; but He left the
     social question where he found it—paying tribute even to Cæsar without reluctance—His mind not
     being ripe to accept the idea of a radical revolution, and His hands not strong enough to
     accomplish it, if even
     <pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7083-084"/> He had imagined it. But neither He nor His disciples imagined
     more than the communism of their own sect; they did not touch the throne of Cæsar, or the power
     of the hereditary irresponsible Lord. Their communism never aimed at the equalization of
     classes throughout all society. Hence, I cannot accept the beginning of Christian politics as
     final, but hold that we have to carry on the work under different forms. The modern Christ
     would be a politician. His aim would be to raise the whole platform of society, he would not
     try to make the poor contented with a lot in which they cannot be much better than savages or
     brutes. He would work at the destruction of caste, which is the vice at the root of all our
     creeds and institutions. He would not content himself with denouncing sin as merely spiritual
     evil; he
     <pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7083-085"/> would go into its economic causes, and destroy the flower by
     cutting at the roots—poverty and ignorance. He would accept the truths of science, and he would
     teach that a man saves his own soul best by helping his neighbour. That, indeed, He did teach;
     and that is the one solid foothold I have. Friends, Christianity according to Christ is the
     creed of human progress, not that of resignation to the avoidable miseries of class; it is the
     confession that society is elastic, and that no social arrangements are final; that morals
     themselves are only experimental, and that no laws are divine—that is, absolute and
     unchangeable by circumstance. It is the doctrine of evolution, of growth; and just as Christ
     was the starting-point of a new era of theological thought, so is the present the
     starting-point of a new era of social fact.
     <pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7083-086"/> Let us then strip our Christianity of all the mythology, the
     fetichism that has grown about it. Let us abandon the idolatry with which we have obscured the
     meaning of the Life; let us go back to the MAN, and carry on His work in its essential spirit
     in the direction suited to our times and social conditions. Those of you who still cling to the
     mystical aspect of the creed, and who prefer to worship the God rather than imitate the Man,
     must here part company with me. You know that, as a youth, I went deep into the life of prayer
     and faith; as a man, I have come out into the upper air of action; into the understanding that
     Christianity is not a creed as dogmatised by churches, but an organization having politics for
     its means and the equalization of classes as its end. It is Communism. Friends! the doctrine
     <pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7083-087"/> trine I have chosen for myself is Christian Communism—and my
     aim will be, the Life after Christ in the service of humanity, without distinction of persons
     or morals. The Man Jesus is my master, and by His example I will walk.”</p>
