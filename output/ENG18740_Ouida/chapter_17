<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<p>Then he took her to dine at one of the wooden cafés under the trees. There was a little sheet
     of water in front of it and a gay garden around. There was a balcony and a wooden stairway;
     there were long trellised arbors, and little white tables, and great rosebushes like her own at
     home. They had an arbor all to themselves; a cool sweet-smelling bower of green, with a glimpse
     of scarlet from the flowers of some twisting beans.</p>
<p>They had a meal, the like of which she had never seen; such a huge melon in the centre of it,
     and curious wines, and coffee or cream in silver pots, or what looked like silver to her—"just
     like the altar-vases in the church," she said to herself.</p>
<p>"If only the Varnhart children were here!" she cried; but he did not echo the wish.</p>
<p>It was just sunset. There was a golden glow on the little bit of water. On the other side of
     the garden some one was playing a guitar. Under a lime-tree some girls were swinging, crying,
     Higher! higher! at each toss.</p>
<p>In a longer avenue of trellised green, at a long table, there was a noisy party of students
     and girls of the city; their laughter was mellowed by distance as it came over the breadth of
     the garden, and they sang, with fresh shrill Flemish voices, songs from an opera bouffe of La
     Monnaie.</p>
<p>It was all pretty, and gay, and pleasant.</p>
<p>There was everywhere about an air of light-hearted enjoyment. Bébée sat with a wondering look
     in her wide-opened eyes, and all the natural instincts of her youth, that were like curled-up
     fruit buds in her, unclosed softly to the light of joy.</p>
<p>"Is life always like this in your Rubes' land?" she asked him; that vague far-away country of
     which she never asked him anything more definite, and which yet was so clear before her
     fancy.</p>
<p>"Yes," he made answer to her. "Only—instead of those leaves, flowers and pomegranates; and in
     lieu of that tinkling guitar, a voice whose notes are esteemed like king's jewels; and in place
     of those little green arbors, great white palaces, cool and still, with ilex woods and orange
     groves and sapphire seas beyond them. Would you like to come there, Bébée?—and wear laces such
     as you weave, and hear singing and laughter all night long, and never work any more in the
     mould of the garden, or spin any more at that tiresome wheel, or go any more out in the wind,
     and the rain, and the winter mud to the market?"</p>
<p>Bébée listened, leaning her round elbows on the table, and her warm cheeks on her hands, as a
     child gravely listens to a fairy story. But the sumptuous picture, and the sensuous phrase he
     had chosen, passed by her.</p>
<p>It is of no use to tempt the little chaffinch of the woods with a ruby instead of a cherry.
     The bird is made to feed on the brown berries, on the morning dews, on the scarlet hips of
     roses, and the blossoms of the wind-tossed pear boughs; the gem, though it be a monarch's, will
     only strike hard and tasteless on its beak.</p>
<p>"I would like to see it all," said Bébée, musingly trying to follow out her thoughts. "But as
     for the garden work and the spinning—that I do not want to leave, because I have done it all my
     life; and I do not think I should care to wear lace—it would tear very soon; one would be
     afraid to run; and do you see I know how it is made—all that lace. I know how blind the eyes
     get over it, and how the hearts ache; I know how the old women starve, and the little children
     cry; I know that there is not a sprig of it that is not stitched with pain; the great ladies do
     not think, I dare say, because they have never worked at it or watched the others: but I have.
     And so, you see, I think if I wore it I should feel sad, and if a nail caught on it I should
     feel as if it were tearing the flesh of my friends. Perhaps I say it badly; but that is what I
     feel."</p>
<p>"You do not say it badly—you speak well, for you speak from the heart," he answered her, and
     felt a tinge of shame that he had tempted her with the gold and purple of a baser world than
     any that she knew.</p>
<p>"And yet you want to see new lands?" he pursued. "What is it you want to see there?"</p>
<p>"Ah, quite other things than these," cried Bébée, still leaning her cheeks on her hands.
     "That dancing and singing is very pretty and merry, but it is just as good when old Claude
     fiddles and the children skip. This wine, you tell me, is something very great; but fresh milk
     is much nicer, I think. It is not these kind of things I want—I want to know all about the
     people who lived before us; I want to know what the stars are, and what the wind is; I want to
     know where the lark goes when you lose him out of sight against the sun; I want to know how the
     old artists got to see God, that they could paint him and all his angels as they have done; I
     want to know how the voices got into the bells, and how they can make one's heart beat, hanging
     up there as they do, all alone among the jackdaws; I want to know what it is when I walk in the
     fields in the morning, and it is all gray and soft and still, and the corn-crake cries in the
     wheat, and the little mice run home to their holes, that makes me so glad and yet so sorrowful,
     as if I were so very near God, and yet so all alone, and such a little thing; because you see
     the mouse she has her hole, and the crake her own people, but I—"</p>
<p>Her voice faltered a little and stopped: she had never before thought out into words her own
     loneliness; from the long green arbor the voices of the girls and the students sang,—</p>
<p>"Ah! le doux son d'un baiser tendre!"</p>
<p>Flamen was silent. The poet in him—and in an artist there is always more or less of the
     poet—kept him back from ridicule, nay, moved him to pity and respect.</p>
<p>They were absurdly simple words no doubt, had little wisdom in them, and were quite childish
     in their utterance, and yet they moved him curiously as a man very base and callous may at
     times be moved by the look in a dying deer's eyes, or by the sound of a song that some lost
     love once sang.</p>
<p>He rose and drew her hands away, and took her small face between his own hands instead.</p>
<p>"Poor little Bébée!" he said gently, looking down on her with a breath that was almost a
     sigh. "Poor little Bébée!—to envy the corncrake and the mouse!"</p>
<p>She was a little startled; her cheeks grew very warm under his touch, but her eyes looked
     still into his without fear.</p>
<p>He stooped and touched her forehead with his lips, gently and without passion, almost
     reverently; she grew rose-hued as the bright bean-flowers, up to the light gold ripples of her
     hair; she trembled a little and drew back, but she was not alarmed nor yet ashamed; she was too
     simple of heart to feel the fear that is born of passion and of consciousness.</p>
<p>It was as Jeannot kissed his sister Marie, who was fifteen years old and sold milk for the
     Krebs people in the villages with a little green cart and a yellow dog—no more.</p>
<p>And yet the sunny arbor leaves and the glimpse of the blue sky swam round her indistinctly,
     and the sounds of the guitar grew dull upon her ear and were lost as in a rushing hiss of
     water, because of the great sudden unintelligible happiness that seemed to bear her little life
     away on it as a sea wave bears a young child off its feet.</p>
<p>"You do not feel alone now, Bébée?" he whispered to her.</p>
<p>"No!" she answered him softly under her breath, and sat still, while all her body quivered
     like a leaf.</p>
<p>No; how could she ever be alone now that this sweet, soft, unutterable touch would always be
     in memory upon her; how could she wish ever again now to be the corn-crake in the summer corn
     or the gray mouse in the hedge of hawthorn?</p>
<p>At that moment a student went by past the entrance of the arbor; he had a sash round his
     loins and a paper feather in his cap; he was playing a fife and dancing; he glanced in as he
     went.</p>
<p>"It is time to go home, Bébée," said Flamen.</p>
