<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<p>It was dark. The May days are short in the north lands of the Scheldt.</p>
<p>She had her little winter cloak of frieze and her wooden shoes and her little white cap with
     the sunny curls rippling out of it in their pretty rebellion. She had her little lantern too;
     and her bundle, and she had put a few fresh eggs in her basket, with some sweet herbs and the
     palm-sheaf that Father Francis had blessed last Easter; for who could tell, she thought, how
     ill he might not be, or how poor?</p>
<p>She hardly gave a look to the hut as she ran by its garden gate; all her heart was on in
     front, in the vague far-off country where he lay sick unto death.</p>
<p>She ran fast through the familiar lanes into the city. She was not very sure where Paris was,
     but she had the name clear and firm, and she knew that people were always coming and going
     thence and thither, so that she had no fear she should not find it.</p>
<p>She went straight to the big, busy, bewildering place in the Leopold quarter where the iron
     horses fumed every day and night along the iron ways. She had never been there before, but she
     knew it was by that great highway that the traffic to Paris was carried on, and she knew that
     it would carry people also as well.</p>
<p>There were bells clanging, lights flashing, and crowds pushing and shouting, as she ran up—a
     little gray figure, with the lantern-spark glimmering like any tiny glow-worm astray in a
     gas-lit city.</p>
<p>"To Paris?" she asked, entreatingly, going where she saw others going, to a little grated
     wicket in a wall.</p>
<p>"Twenty-seven francs—quick!" they demanded of her. Bébée gave a great cry, and stood still,
     trembling and trying not to sob aloud. She had never thought of money; she had forgotten that
     youth and strength and love and willing feet and piteous prayers,—all went for nothing as this
     world is made.</p>
<p>A hope flashed on her and a glad thought. She loosed the silver buckles, and held them
     out.</p>
<p>"Would you take these? They are worth much more."</p>
<p>There was a derisive laughter; some one bade her with an oath begone; rough shoulders jostled
     her away. She stretched her arms out piteously.</p>
<p>"Take me—oh, pray take me! I will go with the sheep, with the cattle—only, only take me!"</p>
<p>But in the rush and roar none heeded her; some thief snatched the silver buckles from her
     hand, and made off with them and was lost in the throng; a great iron beast rushed by her,
     snorting flame and bellowing smoke; there was a roll like thunder, and all was dark; the night
     express had passed on its way to Paris.</p>
<p>Bébée stood still, crushed for a moment with the noise and the cruelty and the sense of
     absolute desolation; she scarcely noticed that the buckles had been stolen; she had only one
     thought—to get to Paris.</p>
<p>"Can I never go without money?" she asked at the wicket; the man there glanced a moment, with
     a touch of pity, at the little wistful face.</p>
<p>"The least is twenty francs—surely you must know that?" he said, and shut his grating with a
     clang.</p>
<p>Bébée turned away and went out of the great cruel, tumultuous place; her heart ached and her
     brain was giddy, but the sturdy courage of her nature rose to need.</p>
<p>"There is no way at all to go without money to Paris, I suppose?" she asked of an old woman
     whom she knew a little, who sold nuts and little pictures of saints and wooden playthings under
     the trees, in the avenue hard by.</p>
<p>The old woman shook her head.</p>
<p>"Eh?—no, dear. There is nothing to be done anywhere in the world without money. Look, I
     cannot get a litre of nuts to sell unless I pay beforehand."</p>
<p>"Would it be far to walk?"</p>
<p>"Far! Holy Jesus! It is right away in the heart of France—over two hundred miles, they say;
     straight out through the forest. Not but what my son did walk it once;—and he a shoemaker, who
     knows what walking costs; and he is well-to-do there now—not that he ever writes. When they
     want nothing people never write."</p>
<p>"And he walked into Paris?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ten years ago. He had nothing but a few sous and an ash stick, and he had a fancy to
     try his luck there. And after all our feet were given us to travel with. If you go there and
     you see him, tell him to send me something—I am tired of selling nuts."</p>
<p>Bébée said nothing, but went on her road; since there was no other way but to walk, she would
     take that way; the distance and the hardship did not appall two little feet that were used to
     traverse so many miles of sun-baked summer dust and of frozen winter mud unblenchingly year
     after year.</p>
<p>The time it would take made her heart sink indeed. He was ill. God knew what might happen.
     But neither the length of leagues nor the fatigue of body daunted her. She only saw his eyes
     dim with pain and his lips burned with fever.</p>
<p>She would walk twenty miles a day, and then, perhaps, she might get lifts here and there on
     hay wagons or in pedlers' carts; people had always used to be kind to her. Anyhow she counted
     she might reach Paris well in fifteen days.</p>
<p>She sat under a shrine in a by street a moment, and counted the copper pieces she had on her;
     they were few, and the poor pretty buckles that she might have sold to get money were
     stolen.</p>
<p>She had some twenty sous and a dozen eggs; she thought she might live on that; she had wanted
     to take the eggs to him, but after all, to keep life in her until she could reach Paris was the
     one great thing.</p>
<p>"What a blessing it is to have been born poor; and to have lived hardly—one wants so little!"
     she thought to herself.</p>
<p>Then she put up the sous in the linen bosom of her gown, and trimmed her little lantern and
     knelt down in the quiet darkness and prayed a moment, with the hot agonized tears rolling down
     her face, and then rose and stepped out bravely in the cool of the night, on the great
     southwest road towards Paris.</p>
<p>The thought never once crossed her to turn back, and go again into the shelter of her own
     little hut among the flowers. He was sick there, dying, for anything she knew; that was the
     only thing she remembered.</p>
<p>It was a clear, starlit night, and everywhere the fragrance of the spring was borne in from
     the wide green plains, and the streams where the rushes were blowing.</p>
<p>She walked ten miles easily, the beautiful gray shadow all about her. She had never been so
     far from home in all her life, except to that one Kermesse at Mechlin. But she was not
     afraid.</p>
<p>With the movement, and the air, and the sense that she was going to him, which made her happy
     even in her misery, something of the old, sweet, lost fancies came to her.</p>
<p>She smiled at the stars through her tears, and as the poplars swayed and murmured in the
     wind, they looked to her like the wings and the swords of a host of angels.</p>
<p>Her way lay out through the forest, and in that sweet green woodland she was not afraid—no
     more afraid than the fawns were.</p>
<p>At Boitsfort she shrank a little, indeed. Here there were the open-air restaurants, and the
     café gardens all alight for the pleasure-seekers from the city; here there were music and
     laughter, and horses with brass bells, and bright colors on high in the wooden balconies, and
     below among the blossoming hawthorn hedges. She had to go through it all, and she shuddered a
     little as she ran, thinking of that one priceless, deathless forest day when he had kissed her
     first.</p>
<p>But the pleasure-people were all busied with their mirth and mischief, and took no notice of
     the little gray figure in the starry night. She went on along the grassy roads, under the high
     arching trees, with the hoot of the owls and the cry of the rabbits on the stillness.</p>
<p>At Groenendael, in the heart of the forest midnight was striking as she entered the village.
     Every one was asleep. The lights were all out The old ruined priory frowned dark under the
     clouds.</p>
<p>She shivered a little again, and began to feel chill and tired, yet did not dare to knock at
     any one of the closed house doors—she had no money.</p>
<p>So she walked on her first ten unknown miles, meeting a few people only, and being altogether
     unmolested—a small gray figure, trotting in two little wooden shoes.</p>
<p>They thought her a peasant going to a fair or a lace mill, and no one did her more harm than
     to wish her good night in rough Flemish.</p>
<p>When the dawn began to whiten above the plains of the east, she saw an empty cow-shed filled
     with hay; she was a little tired, and lay down and rested an hour or two, as a young lamb might
     have lain on the dried clover, for she knew that she must keep her strength and husband her
     power, or never reach across the dreary length of the foreign land to Paris.</p>
<p>But by full sunrise she was on her way again, bathing her face in a brook and buying a sou's
     worth of bread and flet-milk at the first cottage that she passed in bright, leaf-bowered
     Hoey-laert.</p>
<p>The forest was still all around her, with its exquisite life of bough and blossom, and murmur
     of insect and of bird. She told her beads, praying as she went, and was almost happy.</p>
<p>God would not let him die. Oh, no, not till she had kissed him once more, and could die with
     him.</p>
<p>The hares ran across the path, and the blue butterflies flew above-head. There was purple
     gloom of pine wood, and sparkling verdure of aspen and elm. There were distant church carillons
     ringing, and straight golden shafts of sunshine streaming.</p>
<p>She was quite sure God would not let him die.</p>
<p>She hoped that he might be very poor. At times he had talked as if he were, and then she
     might be of so much use. She knew how to deal with fever and suffering. She had sat up many a
     night with the children of the village. The gray sisters had taught her many of their ways of
     battling with disease; and she could make fresh cool drinks, and she could brew beautiful
     remedies from simple herbs. There was so much that she might do; her fancy played with it
     almost happily. And then, only to touch his hand, only to hear his voice; her heart rose at the
     thought, as a lark to its morning song.</p>
<p>At Rixensart, buried in its greenery, as she went through it in morning light, some peasants
     greeted her cheerily, and called to her to rest in a house porch, and gave her honey and bread.
     She could not eat much; her tongue was parched and her throat was dry, but the kindness was
     precious to her, and she went on her road the stronger for it.</p>
<p>"It is a long way to walk to Paris," said the woman, with some curious wonder. Bébée smiled,
     though her eyes grew wet.</p>
<p>"She has the look of the little Gesù," said the Rixensart people; and they watched her away
     with a vague timid pity.</p>
<p>So she went on through Ottignies and La Roche to Villers, and left the great woods and the
     city chimes behind her, and came through the green abbey valleys through Tilly and Ligny, and
     Fleurus, and so into the coal and iron fields that lie round Charleroi.</p>
<p>Here her heart grew sick, and her courage sank under the noise and the haste, before the
     blackness and the hideousness. She had never seen anything like it. She thought it was hell,
     with the naked, swearing, fighting people, and the red fires leaping night and day.
     Nevertheless, if hell it were, since it lay betwixt her and him, she found force to brave and
     cross it.</p>
<p>The miners and glass-blowers and nail-makers, rough and fierce and hard, frightened her. The
     women did not look like women, and the children ran and yelled at her, and set their dogs upon
     her. The soil was thick with dust like soot, and the trees were seared and brown. There was no
     peace in the place, and no loveliness. Eighty thousand folks toiled together in the hopeless
     Tophet, and swarmed, and struggled, and labored, and multiplied, in joyless and endless
     wrestling against hunger and death.</p>
<p>She got through it somehow, hiding often from the ferocious youngsters, and going sleepless
     rather than lie in those dens of filth; but she seemed so many, many years older when Charleroi
     lay at last behind her,—so many, many years older than when she had sat and spun in the garden
     at home.</p>
<p>When she was once in the valley of the Sambre she was more herself again, only she felt
     weaker than she had ever done, because she only dared to spend one of her sous each day, and
     one sou got so little food.</p>
<p>In the woods and fields about Alne she began to breathe again, like a bird loosed to the air
     after being shut in a wooden trap. Green corn, green boughs, green turf, mellow chimes of
     church bells, humming of golden bees, cradle songs of women spinning, homely odors of little
     herb gardens and of orchard trees under cottage walls,—these had been around her all her life;
     she only breathed freely among them.</p>
<p>She often felt tired, and her wooden shoes were wearing so thin that the hot dust of the road
     at noonday burnt her feet through them. Sometimes, too, she felt a curious brief faintness,
     such as she had never known, for the lack of food and the long fatigue began to tell even on
     her hardy little body.</p>
<p>But she went on bravely, rarely doing less than her twenty miles a day, and sometimes more,
     walking often in the night to save time, and lying down in cow-sheds or under haystacks in the
     noontide.</p>
<p>For the most part people were kind to her; they saw she was so very young and so poor.</p>
<p>Women would give her leave to bathe herself in their bedchambers, and children would ask her
     to wait on the village bench under the chestnut-tree, while they brought her their pet lamb or
     their tumbler pigeons to look at, but, for the most part—unless she was very, very tired—she
     would not wait. It took her so long, and who could tell how it fared with him in Paris?</p>
<p>Into the little churches, scattered over the wide countries between Charleroi and
     Erquelinnes, she would turn aside, indeed; but, then, that was only to say a prayer for him;
     that was not loss to him, but gain.</p>
<p>So she walked on until she reached the frontier of France. She began to get a little giddy;
     she began to see the blue sky and the green level always swirling round her as if some one were
     spinning them to frighten her, but still she would not be afraid; she went on, and on, and on,
     till she set her last step on the soil of Flanders.</p>
<p>Here a new, strange, terrible, incomprehensible obstacle opposed her: she had no papers; they
     thrust her back and spoke to her as if she were a criminal. She could not understand what they
     could mean. She had never heard of these laws and rules. She vaguely comprehended that she must
     not enter France, and stunned and heartbroken she dropped down under a tree, and for the first
     time sobbed as if her very life would weep itself away.</p>
<p>She could see nothing, understand nothing. There were the same road, the same hedges, the
     same fields, the same white cottages, and peasants in blue shirts and dun-hued oxen in the
     wagons. She saw no mark, no difference, ere they told her where she stood was Belgium, and
     where they stood was France, and that she must not pass from one into the other.</p>
<p>The men took no notice of her. They went back into their guard-house, and smoked and drank. A
     cat sunned herself under a scarlet bean. The white clouds sailed on before a southerly sky. She
     might die here—he there—and nothing seemed to care.</p>
<p>After a while an old hawker came up; he was travelling with wooden clocks from the Black
     Forest. He stopped and looked at her, and asked her what she ailed.</p>
<p>She knelt down at his feet in the dust.</p>
<p>"Oh, help me!" she cried to him. "Oh, pray, help me! I have walked all the way from
     Brussels—that is my country—and now they will not let me pass that house where the soldiers
     are. They say I have no papers. What papers should I have? I do not know. When one has done no
     harm, and does not owe a sou anywhere, and has walked all the way—Is it money that they want? I
     have none; and they stole my silver clasps in Brussels; and if I do not get to Paris I must
     die—die without seeing him again—ever again, dear God!"</p>
<p>She dropped her head upon the dust and crouched and sobbed there, her courage broken by this
     new barrier that she had never dreamed would come between herself and Paris.</p>
<p>The old hawker looked at her thoughtfully. He had seen much of men and women, and knew truth
     from counterfeit, and he was moved by the child's agony.</p>
<p>He stooped and whispered in her ear,—</p>
<p>"Get up quick, and I will pass you. It is against the law, and I may go to prison for it.
     Never mind; one must risk something in this world, or else be a cur. My daughter has stayed
     behind in Marbais sweethearting; her name is on my passport, and her age and face will do for
     yours. Get up and follow me close, and I will get you through. Poor little soul! Whatever your
     woe is it is real enough, and you are such a young and pretty thing. Get up, the guards are in
     their house, they have not seen; follow me, and you must not speak a word; they must take you
     for a German, dumb as wood."</p>
<p>She got up and obeyed him, not comprehending, but only vaguely seeing that he was friendly to
     her, and would pass her over into France.</p>
<p>The old man made a little comedy at the barrier, and scolded her as though she were his
     daughter for losing her way as she came to meet him, and then crying like a baby.</p>
<p>The guards looked at her carelessly, joked the hawker on her pretty face, looked the papers
     over, and let her through, believing her the child of the clock-maker of the Hartz. Some lies
     are blessed as truth.</p>
<p>"I have done wrong in the law, but not before God, I think, little one," said the pedler.
     "Nay, do not thank me, or go on like that; we are in sight of the customs men still, and if
     they suspected, it would be the four walls of a cell only that you and I should see to-night.
     And now tell me your story, poor maiden: why are you on foot through a strange country?"</p>
<p>But Bébée would not tell him her story: she was confused and dazed still. She did not know
     rightly what had happened to her; but she could not talk of herself, nor of why she travelled
     thus to Paris.</p>
<p>The old hawker got cross at her silence, and called her an unthankful jade, and wished that
     he had left her to her fate, and parted company with her at two cross-roads, saying his path
     did not lie with hers; and then when he had done that, was sorry, and being a tenderhearted
     soul, hobbled back, and would fain press a five-franc piece on her; and Bébée, refusing it all
     the while, kissed his old brown hands and blessed him, and broke away from him, and so went on
     again solitary towards St. Quentin.</p>
<p>The country was very flat and poor, and yet the plains had a likeness in them to her own wide
     Brabant downs, where the tall green wheat was blowing and the barges dropping down the sluggish
     streams.</p>
<p>She was very footsore; very weary; very hungry so often; but she was in France—in his
     country; and her spirit rose with the sense of that nearness to him.</p>
<p>After all, God was so good to her; there were fine bright days and nights; a few showers had
     fallen, but merely passing ones; the air was so cool and so balmy that it served her almost as
     food; and she seldom found people so unkind that they refused for her single little sou to give
     her a crust of bread and let her lie in an outhouse.</p>
<p>After all, God was very good; and by the sixteenth or seventeenth day she would be in the
     city of Paris.</p>
<p>She was a little light-headed at times from insufficient nourishment: especially after waking
     from strange dreams in unfamiliar places; sometimes the soil felt tremulous under her, and the
     sky spun round; but she struggled against the feeling, and kept a brave heart, and tried to be
     afraid of nothing.</p>
<p>Sometimes at night she thought she saw old Annémie. "But what if I do?" she said to herself;
     "Annémie never will hurt me."</p>
<p>And now, as she grew nearer her goal, her natural buoyancy of spirit returned as it had never
     done to her since the evening that he had kissed and left her. As her body grew lighter and
     more exhausted, her fancy grew keener and more dominant. All things of the earth and air spoke
     to her as she went along as they had used to do. All that she had learned from the books in the
     long cold months came to her clear and wonderful. She was not so very ignorant now—ignorant,
     indeed, beside him—but still knowing something that would make her able to read to him if he
     liked it, and to understand if he talked of grave things.</p>
<p>She had no fixed thought of what she would be to him when she reached him.</p>
<p>She fancied she would wait on him, and tend him, and make him well, and be caressed by him,
     and get all gracious pretty things of leaf and blossom about him, and kneel at his feet, and be
     quite happy if he only touched her now and then with his lips;—her thoughts went no further
     than that;—her love for him was of that intensity and absorption in which nothing But itself is
     remembered.</p>
<p>When a creature loves much, even when it is as little and as simple a soul as Bébée, the
     world and all its people and all its laws and ways are as naught. They cease to exist; they are
     as though they had never been.</p>
<p>Whoever recollects an outside world may play with passion, or may idle with sentiment, but
     does not love.</p>
<p>She did not hear what the villagers said to her. She did not see the streets of the towns as
     she passed them. She kept herself clean always, and broke fast now and then by sheer instinct
     of habit, nothing more. She had no perception what she did, except of walking—walking—walking
     always, and seeing the white road go by like pale ribbons unrolled.</p>
<p>She got a dreamy, intense, sleepless light in her blue eyes that frightened some of those she
     passed. They thought she had been fever-stricken, and was not in her senses.</p>
<p>So she went across the dreary lowlands, wearing out her little sabots, but not wearing out
     her patience and her courage.</p>
<p>She was very dusty and jaded. Her woollen skirt was stained with weather and torn with
     briers. But she had managed always to wash her cap white in brook water, and she had managed
     always to keep her pretty bright curls soft and silken—for he had liked them so much, and he
     would soon draw them through his hand again. So she told herself a thousand times to give her
     strength when the mist would come over her sight, and the earth would seem to tremble as she
     went. On the fifteenth day from the night when she had left her hut by the swans' water, Bébée
     saw Paris.</p>
<p>Shining away in the sun; white and gold; among woods and gardens she saw Paris.</p>
<p>She was so tired—oh, so tired—but she could not rest now. There were bells ringing always in
     her ears, and a heavy pain always in her head. But what of that?—she was so near to him.</p>
<p>"Are you ill, you little thing?" a woman asked her who was gathering early cherries in the
     outskirts of the great city.</p>
<p>Bébée looked at her and smiled: "I do not know—I am happy."</p>
<p>And she went onward.</p>
<p>It was evening. The sun had set. She had not eaten for twenty-four hours. But she could not
     pause for anything now. She crossed the gleaming river, and she heard the cathedral chimes.
     Paris in all its glory was about her, but she took no more note of it than a pigeon that flies
     through it intent on reaching home.</p>
<p>No one looked at or stopped her; a little dusty peasant with a bundle on a stick over her
     shoulder.</p>
<p>The click-clack of her wooden shoes on the hot pavements made none look up; little rustics
     came up every day like this to make their fortunes in Paris. Some grew into golden painted
     silken flowers, the convolvuli of their brief summer days; and some drifted into the Seine
     water, rusted, wind-tossed, fallen leaves, that were wanted of no man. Anyhow it was so common
     to see them, pretty but homely things, with their noisy shoes and their little all in a bundle,
     that no one even looked once at Bébée.</p>
<p>She was not bewildered. As she had gone through her own city, only thinking of the roses in
     her basket and of old Annémie in her garret, so she went through Paris, only thinking of him
     for whose sake she had come thither.</p>
<p>Now that she was really in his home she was happy,—happy though her head ached with that dull
     odd pain, and all the sunny glare went round and round like a great gilded humming-top, such as
     the babies clapped their hands at, at the Kermesse.</p>
<p>She was happy: she felt sure now that God would not let him die till she got to him. She was
     quite glad that he had left her all that long, terrible winter, for she had learned so much and
     was so much more fitted to be with him.</p>
<p>Weary as she was, and strange as the pain in her head made her feel, she was happy, very
     happy; a warm flush came on her little pale cheeks as she thought how soon he would kiss them,
     her whole body thrilled with the old sweet nameless joy that she had sickened for in vain so
     long.</p>
<p>Though she saw nothing else that was around her, she saw some little knots of moss-roses that
     a girl was selling on the quay, as she used to sell them in front of the Maison du Roi. She had
     only two sous left, but she stopped and bought two little rosebuds to take to him. He had used
     to care for them so much in the summer in Brabant.</p>
<p>The girl who sold them told her the way to the street he lived in; it was not very far of the
     quay. She seemed to float on air, to have wings like the swallows, to hear beautiful musk all
     around. She felt for her beads, and said aves of praise. God was so good.</p>
<p>It was quite night when she reached the street, and sought the number of his house. She spoke
     his name softly, and trembling very much with joy, not with any fear, but it seemed to her too
     sacred a thing ever to utter aloud.</p>
<p>An old man looked out of a den by the door, and told her to go straight up the stairs to the
     third floor, and then turn to the right. The old man chuckled as he glanced after her, and
     listened to the wooden shoes pattering wearily up the broad stone steps.</p>
<p>Bébée climbed them—ten, twenty, thirty, forty. "He must be very poor!" she thought, "to live
     so high"; and yet the place was wide and handsome, and had a look of riches. Her heart beat so
     fast, she felt suffocated; her limbs shook, her eyes had a red blood-like mist floating before
     them; but she thanked God each step she climbed; a moment, and she would look upon the only
     face she loved.</p>
<p>"He will be glad; oh, I am sure he will be glad!" she said to herself, as a fear that had
     never before come near her touched her for a moment—if he should not care?</p>
<p>But even then, what did it matter? Since he was ill she should be there to watch him night
     and day; and when he was well again, if he should wish her to go away—one could always die.</p>
<p>"But he will be glad—oh, I know he will be glad!" she said to the rosebuds that she carried
     to him. "And if God will only let me save his life, what else do I want more?"</p>
<p>His name was written on a door before her. The handle of a bell hung down; she pulled it
     timidly. The door unclosed; she saw no one, and went through. There were low lights burning.
     There were heavy scents that were strange to her. There was a fantastic gloom from old armor,
     and old weapons, and old pictures in the dull rich chambers. The sound of her wooden shoes was
     lost in the softness and thickness of the carpets.</p>
<p>It was not the home of a poor man. A great terror froze her heart,—if she were not wanted
     here?</p>
<p>She went quickly through three rooms, seeing no one and at the end of the third there were
     folding doors.</p>
<p>"It is I—Bébée." she said softly, as she pushed them gently apart; and she held out the two
     moss-rosebuds.</p>
<p>Then the words died on her lips, and a great horror froze her, still and silent, there.</p>
<p>She saw the dusky room as in a dream. She saw him stretched on the bed, leaning on his elbow,
     laughing, and playing cards upon the lace coverlet. She saw women with loose shining hair and
     bare limbs, and rubies and diamonds glimmering red and white. She saw men lying about upon the
     couch, throwing dice and drinking and laughing one with another.</p>
<p>Beyond all she saw against the pillows of his bed a beautiful brown wicked looking thing like
     some velvet snake, who leaned over him as he threw down the painted cards upon the lace, and
     who had cast about his throat her curved bare arm with the great coils of dead gold all
     a-glitter on it.</p>
<p>And above it all there were odors of wines and flowers, clouds of smoke, shouts of laughter,
     music of shrill gay voices.</p>
<p>She stood like a frozen creature and saw—the rosebuds' in her hand. Then with a great
     piercing cry she let the little roses fall, and turned and fled. At the sound he looked up and
     saw her, and shook his beautiful brown harlot off him with an oath.</p>
<p>But Bébée flew down through the empty chambers and the long stairway as a hare flies from the
     hounds; her tired feet never paused, her aching limbs never slackened; she ran on, and on, and
     on, into the lighted streets, into the fresh night air; on, and on, and on, straight to the
     river.</p>
<p>From its brink some man's strength caught and held her. She struggled with it.</p>
<p>"Let me die! let me die!" she shrieked to him, and strained from him to get at the cool gray
     silent water that waited for her there.</p>
<p>Then she lost all consciousness, and saw the stars no more.</p>
<p>When she came back to any sense of life, the stars were shining still, and the face of
     Jeannot was bending over her, wet with tears.</p>
<p>He had followed her to Paris when they had missed her first, and had come straight by train
     to the city, making sure it was thither she had come, and there had sought her many days,
     watching for her by the house of Flamen.</p>
<p>She shuddered away from him as he held her, and looked at him with blank, tearless eyes.</p>
<p>"Do not touch me—take me home."</p>
<p>That was all she ever said to him. She never asked him or told him anything. She never
     noticed that it was strange that he should have been here upon the river-bank. He let her be,
     and took her silently in the cool night back by the iron ways to Brabant.</p>
