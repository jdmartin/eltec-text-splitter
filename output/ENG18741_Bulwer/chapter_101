<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<p>“I knew I should find you in the Madeleine,” said Lemercier, “and I wished much to know when
      you had news from Duplessis. He and your fair fiancee are with your aunt still staying at
      Rochebriant?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. A pigeon arrived this morning with a few lines. All well there.”</p>
<p>“And Duplessis thinks, despite the war, that he shall be able, when the time comes, to pay
      Louvier the mortgage-sum?”</p>
<p>“He never doubts that. His credit in London is so good. But of course all works of
      improvement are stopped.”</p>
<p>“Pray did he mention me?—anything about the messenger who was to pierce the Prussian
      lines?”</p>
<p>“What! has the man not arrived? It is two weeks since he left.”</p>
<p>“The Uhlans have no doubt shot him—the assassins, and drunk up my 25,000 francs—the
      thieves.”</p>
<p>“I hope not. But in case of delay, Duplessis tells me I am to remit to you 2,000 francs for
      your present wants. I will send them to you this evening.”</p>
<p>“How the deuce do you possess such a sum?”</p>
<p>“I came from Brittany with a purse well filled. Of course I could have no scruples in
      accepting money from my destined father-in-law.”</p>
<p>“And you can spare this sum?”</p>
<p>“Certainly—the State now provides for me; I am in command of a Breton company.”</p>
<p>“True. Come and dine with me and De Breze.”</p>
<p>“Alas! I cannot. I have to see both the Vandemars before I return to the camp for the night.
      And now-hush—come this way (drawing Frederic further from De Breze), I have famous news for
      you. A sortie on a grand scale is imminent; in a few days we may hope for it.”</p>
<p>“I have heard that so often that I am incredulous.”</p>
<p>“Take it as a fact now.”</p>
<p>“What! Trochu has at last matured his plan?”</p>
<p>“He has changed its original design, which was to cut through the Prussian lines to Rouen,
      occupying there the richest country for supplies, guarding the left bank of the Seine and a
      watercourse to convoy them to Paris. The incidents of war prevented that: he has a better plan
      now. The victory of the army of the Loire at Orleans opens a new enterprise. We shall cut our
      way through the Prussians, join that army, and with united forces fall on the enemy at the
      rear. Keep this a secret as yet, but rejoice with me that we shall prove to the invaders what
      men who fight for their native soil can do under the protection of Heaven.”</p>
<p>“Fox, Fox, mon cheri,” said Lemercier, as he walked towards the cafe Riche with De Breze;
      “thou shalt have a festin de Balthazar under the protection of Heaven.”</p>
