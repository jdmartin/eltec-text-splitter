<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>The last book closed with the success of the Parisian sortie on the 30th of November, to be
      followed by the terrible engagements no less honourable to French valour, on the 2nd of
      December. There was the sanguine belief that deliverance was at hand; that Trochu would break
      through the circle of iron, and effect that junction with the army of Aurelles de Paladine
      which would compel the Germans to raise the investment;—belief rudely shaken by Ducrot’s
      proclamation of the 4th, to explain the recrossing of the Marne, and the abandonment of the
      positions conquered, but not altogether dispelled till von Moltke’s letter to Trochu on the
      5th announcing the defeat of the army of the Loire and the recapture of Orleans. Even then the
      Parisians did not lose hope of succour; and even after the desperate and fruitless sortie
      against Le Bourget on the 21st, it was not without witticisms on defeat and predictions of
      triumph, that Winter and Famine settled sullenly on the city.</p>
<p>Our narrative reopens with the last period of the siege.</p>
<p>It was during these dreadful days, that if the vilest and the most hideous aspects of the
      Parisian population showed themselves at the worst, so all its loveliest, its noblest, its
      holiest characteristics—unnoticed by ordinary observers in the prosperous days of the
      capital—became conspicuously prominent. The higher classes, including the remnant of the old
      noblesse, had, during the whole siege, exhibited qualities in notable contrast to those
      assigned them by the enemies of aristocracy. Their sons had been foremost among those soldiers
      who never calumniated a leader, never fled before a foe; their women had been among the most
      zealous and the most tender nurses of the ambulances they had founded and served; their houses
      had been freely opened, whether to the families exiled from the suburbs, or in supplement to
      the hospitals. The amount of relief they afforded unostentatiously, out of means that shared
      the general failure of accustomed resource, when the famine commenced, would be scarcely
      credible if stated. Admirable, too, were the fortitude and resignation of the genuine Parisian
      bourgeoisie,—the thrifty tradesfolk and small rentiers,—that class in which, to judge of its
      timidity when opposed to a mob, courage is not the most conspicuous virtue. Courage became so
      now—courage to bear hourly increasing privation, and to suppress every murmur of suffering
      that would discredit their patriotism, and invoke “peace at any price.” It was on this class
      that the calamities of the siege now pressed the most heavily. The stagnation of trade, and
      the stoppage of the rents, in which they had invested their savings, reduced many of them to
      actual want. Those only of their number who obtained the pay of one-and-a-half franc a day as
      National Guards, could be sure to escape from starvation. But this pay had already begun to
      demoralise the receivers. Scanty for supply of food, it was ample for supply of drink. And
      drunkenness, hitherto rare in that rank of the Parisians, became a prevalent vice, aggravated
      in the case of a National Guard, when it wholly unfitted him for the duties he undertook,
      especially such National Guards as were raised from the most turbulent democracy of the
      working class.</p>
<p>But of all that population; there were two sections in which the most beautiful elements of
      our human nature were most touchingly manifest—the women and the priesthood, including in the
      latter denomination all the various brotherhoods and societies which religion formed and
      inspired.</p>
<p>It was on the 27th of December that Frederic Lemercier stood gazing wistfully on a military
      report affixed to a blank wall, which stated that “the enemy, worn out by a resistance of over
      one hundred days,” had commenced the bombardment. Poor Frederic was sadly altered; he had
      escaped the Prussian’s guns, but not the Parisian winter—the severest known for twenty years.
      He was one of the many frozen at their posts—brought back to the ambulance with Fox in his
      bosom trying to keep him warm. He had only lately been sent forth as convalescent,—ambulances
      were too crowded to retain a patient longer than absolutely needful,—and had been
      hunger-pinched and frost-pinched ever since. The luxurious Frederic had still, somewhere or
      other, a capital yielding above three thousand a year, and of which he could not now realise a
      franc, the title-deeds to various investments being in the hands of Duplessis, the most
      trustworthy of friends, the most upright of men, but who was in Bretagne, and could not be got
      at. And the time had come at Paris when you could not get trust for a pound of horse-flesh, or
      a daily supply of fuel. And Frederic Lemercier, who had long since spent the 2000 francs
      borrowed from Alain (not ignobly, but somewhat ostentatiously, in feasting any acquaintance
      who wanted a feast), and who had sold to any one who could afford to speculate on such dainty
      luxuries,—clocks, bronzes, amber-mounted pipes,—all that had made the envied garniture of his
      bachelor’s apartment—Frederic Lemercier was, so far as the task of keeping body and soul
      together, worse off than any English pauper who can apply to the Union. Of course he might
      have claimed his half-pay of thirty sous as a National Guard. But he little knows the true
      Parisian who imagines a seigneur of the Chaussee d’Antin, the oracle of those with whom he
      lived, and one who knew life so well that he had preached prudence to a seigneur of the
      Faubourg like Alain de Rochebriant, stooping to apply for the wages of thirty sons. Rations
      were only obtained by the wonderful patience of women, who had children to whom they were both
      saints and martyrs. The hours, the weary hours, one had to wait before one could get one’s
      place on the line for the distribution of that atrocious black bread, defeated men,—defeated
      most wives if only for husbands, were defied only by mothers and daughters. Literally
      speaking, Lemercier was starving. Alain had been badly wounded in the sortie of the 21st, and
      was laid up in an ambulance. Even if he could have been got at, he had probably nothing left
      to bestow upon Lemercier.</p>
<p>Lemercier gazed on the announcement of the bombardment, and the Parisian gaiety, which some
      French historian of the siege calls douce philosophie, lingering on him still, he said,
      audibly, turning round to any stranger who heard: “Happiest of mortals that we are! Under the
      present Government we are never warned of anything disagreeable that can happen; we are only
      told of it when it has happened, and then as rather pleasant than otherwise. I get up. I meet
      a civil gendarme. ‘What is that firing? which of our provincial armies is taking Prussia in
      the rear? ‘Monsieur,’ says the gendarme, ‘it is the Prussian Krupp guns.’ I look at the
      proclamation, and my fears varnish,—my heart is relieved. I read that the bombardment is a
      sure sign that the enemy is worn out.”</p>
<p>Some of the men grouped round Frederic ducked their heads in terror; others, who knew that
      the thunderbolt launched from the plateau of Avron would not fall on the pavements of Paris,
      laughed and joked. But in front, with no sign of terror, no sound of laughter, stretched,
      moving inch by inch, the female procession towards the bakery in which the morsel of bread for
      their infants was doled out.</p>
<p>“Hist, mon ami,” said a deep voice beside Lemercier. “Look at those women, and do not wound
      their ears by a jest.”</p>
<p>Lemercier, offended by that rebuke, though too susceptible to good emotions not to recognise
      its justice, tried with feeble fingers to turn up his moustache, and to turn a defiant crest
      upon the rebuker. He was rather startled to see the tall martial form at his side, and to
      recognise Victor de Mauleon. “Don’t you think, M. Lemercier,” resumed the Vicomte, half sadly,
      “that these women are worthy of better husbands and sons than are commonly found among the
      soldiers whose uniform we wear?”</p>
<p>“The National Guard! You ought not to sneer at them, Vicomte,—you whose troop covered itself
      with glory on the great days of Villiers and Champigny,—you in whose praise even the grumblers
      of Paris became eloquent, and in whom a future Marshal of France is foretold.”</p>
<p>“But, alas! more than half of my poor troop was left on the battle-field, or is now
      wrestling for mangled remains of life in the ambulances. And the new recruits with which I
      took the field on the 21st are not likely to cover themselves with glory, or to insure their
      commander the baton of a marshal.”</p>
<p>“Ay, I heard when I was in the hospital that you had publicly shamed some of these recruits,
      and declared that you would rather resign than lead them again to battle.”</p>
<p>“True; and at this moment, for so doing, I am the man most hated by the rabble who supplied
      those recruits.” The men, while thus conversing, had moved slowly on, and were now in front of
      a large cafe, from the interior of which came the sound of loud bravos and clappings of hands.
      Lemercier’s curiosity was excited. “For what can be that applause?” he said; “let us look in
      and see.” The room was thronged. In the distance, on a small raised platform, stood a girl
      dressed in faded theatrical finery, making her obeisance to the crowd.</p>
<p>“Heavens!” exclaimed Frederic—“can I trust my eyes? Surely that is the once superb Julie:
      has she been dancing here?”</p>
<p>One of the loungers, evidently belonging to the same world as Lemercier, overheard the
      question and answered politely: “No, Monsieur: she has been reciting verses, and really
      declaims very well, considering it is not her vocation. She has given us extracts from Victor
      Hugo and De Musset: and crowned all with a patriotic hymn by Gustave Rameau,—her old lover, if
      gossip be true.” Meanwhile De Mauleon, who at first had glanced over the scene with his usual
      air of calm and cold indifference, became suddenly struck by the girl’s beautiful face, and
      gazed on it with a look of startled surprise.</p>
<p>“Who and what did you say that poor fair creature is, M. Lemercier?”</p>
<p>“She is a Mademoiselle Julie Caumartin, and was a very popular coryphee. She has hereditary
      right to be a good dancer, as the daughter of a once more famous ornament of the ballet, la
      belle Leonie—whom you must have seen in your young days.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Leonie—she married a M. Surville, a silly bourgeois gentilhomme, who earned the
      hatred of Paris by taking her off the stage. So that is her daughter I see no likeness to her
      mother—much handsomer. Why does she call herself Caumartin?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Frederic, “a melancholy but trite story.”</p>
<p>“Leonie was left a widow, and died in want. What could the poor young daughter do? She found
      a rich protector, who had influence to get her an appointment in the ballet: and there she did
      as most girls so circumstanced do—appeared under an assumed name, which she has since
      kept.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” said Victor, compassionately. “Poor thing! she has quitted the platform, and
      is coming this way, evidently to speak to you. I saw her eyes brighten as she caught sight of
      your face.”</p>
<p>Lemercier attempted a languid air of modest self-complacency as the girl now approached him.
      “Bonjour, M. Frederic! Ah, mon Dieu! how thin you have grown! You have been ill?”</p>
<p>“The hardships of a military life, Mademoiselle. Ah, for the beaux fours and the peace we
      insisted on destroying under the Empire which we destroyed for listening to us! But you thrive
      well, I trust. I have seen you better dressed, but never in greater beauty.”</p>
<p>The girl blushed as she replied, “Do you really think as you speak?”</p>
<p>“I could not speak more sincerely if I lived in the legendary House of Glass.”</p>
<p>The girl clutched his arm, and said in suppressed tones, “Where is Gustave?”</p>
<p>“Gustave Rameau? I have no idea. Do you never see him now?”</p>
<p>“Never,—perhaps I never shall see him again; but when you do meet him, say that Julie owes
      to him her livelihood. An honest livelihood, Monsieur. He taught her to love verses—told her
      how to recite them. I am engaged at this cafe—you will find me here the same hour every day,
      in case—in case—You are good and kind, and will come and tell me that Gustave is well and
      happy even if he forgets me. Au revoir! Stop, you do look, my poor Frederic, as if—as
      if—pardon me, Monsieur Lemercier, is there anything I can do? Will you condescend to borrow
      from me? I am in funds.”</p>
<p>Lemercier at that offer was nearly moved to tears. Famished though he was, he could not,
      however, have touched that girl’s earnings.</p>
<p>“You are an angel of goodness, Mademoiselle! Ah, how I envy Gustave Rameau! No, I don’t want
      aid. I am always a—rentier.”</p>
<p>“Bien! and if you see Gustave, you will not forget.”</p>
<p>“Rely on me. Come away,” he said to De Mauleon; “I don’t want to hear that girl repeat the
      sort of bombast the poets indite nowadays. It is fustian; and that girl may have a brain of
      feather, but she has a heart of gold.”</p>
<p>“True,” said Victor, as they regained the street. “I overheard what she said to you. What an
      incomprehensible thing is a woman! how more incomprehensible still is a woman’s love! Ah,
      pardon me; I must leave you. I see in the procession a poor woman known to me in better
      days.”</p>
<p>De Mauleon walked towards the woman he spoke of—one of the long procession to the bakery—a
      child clinging to her robe. A pale grief-worn woman, still young, but with the weariness of
      age on her face, and the shadow of death on her child’s.</p>
<p>“I think I see Madame Monnier,” said De Mauleon, softly.</p>
<p>She turned and looked at him drearily. A year ago, she would have blushed if addressed by a
      stranger in a name not lawfully hers.</p>
<p>“Well,” she said, in hollow accents broken by cough; “I don’t know you, Monsieur.”</p>
<p>“Poor woman!” he resumed, walking beside her as she moved slowly on, while the eyes of other
      women in the procession stared at him hungrily. “And your child looks ill too. It is your
      youngest?”</p>
<p>“My only one! The others are in Pere la Chaise. There are but few children alive in my
      street now. God has been very merciful, and taken them to Himself.”</p>
<p>De Mauleon recalled the scene of a neat comfortable apartment, and the healthful happy
      children at play on the floor. The mortality among the little ones, especially in the quartier
      occupied by the working classes, had of late been terrible. The want of food, of fuel, the
      intense severity of the weather, had swept them off as by a pestilence.</p>
<p>“And Monnier—what of him? No doubt he is a National Guard, and has his pay?”</p>
<p>The woman made no answer, but hung down her head. She was stifling a sob. Till then her eyes
      seemed to have exhausted the last source of tears.</p>
<p>“He lives still?” continued Victor, pityingly: “he is not wounded?”</p>
<p>“No: he is well—in health; thank you kindly, Monsieur.”</p>
<p>“But his pay is not enough to help you, and of course he can get no work. Excuse me if I
      stopped you. It is because I owed Armand Monnier a little debt for work, and I am ashamed to
      say that it quite escaped my memory in these terrible events. Allow me, Madame, to pay it to
      you,” and he thrust his purse into her hand. “I think this contains about the sum I owed; if
      more or less, we will settle the difference later. Take care of yourself.”</p>
<p>He was turning away when the woman caught hold of him.</p>
<p>“Stay, Monsieur. May Heaven bless you!—but—but tell me what name I am to give to Armand. I
      can’t think of any one who owed him money. It must have been before that dreadful strike, the
      beginning of all our woes. Ah, if it were allowed to curse any one, I fear my last breath
      would not be a prayer.”</p>
<p>“You would curse the strike, or the master who did not forgive Armand’s share in it?”</p>
<p>“No, no,—the cruel man who talked him into it—into all that has changed the best workman,
      the kindest heart—the—the—” again her voice died in sobs.</p>
<p>“And who was that man?” asked De Mauleon, falteringly.</p>
<p>“His name was Lebeau. If you were a poor man, I should say ‘Shun him.’”</p>
<p>“I have heard of the name you mention; but if we mean the same person, Monnier cannot have
      met him lately. He has not been in Paris since the siege.”</p>
<p>“I suppose not, the coward! He ruined us—us who were so happy before; and then, as Armand
      says, cast us away as instruments he had done with. But—but if you do know him, and do see him
      again, tell him—tell him not to complete his wrong—not to bring murder on Armand’s soul. For
      Armand isn’t what he was—and has become, oh, so violent! I dare not take this money without
      saying who gave it. He would not take money as alms from an aristocrat. Hush! he beat me for
      taking money from the good Monsieur Raoul de Vandemar—my poor Armand beat me!”</p>
<p>De Mauleon shuddered. “Say that it is from a customer whose rooms he decorated in his spare
      hours on his own account before the strike,—Monsieur ————;” here he uttered indistinctly some
      unpronounceable name and hurried off, soon lost as the streets grew darker. Amid groups of a
      higher order of men-military men, nobles, ci-devant deputies—among such ones his name stood
      very high. Not only his bravery in the recent sorties had been signal, but a strong belief in
      his military talents had become prevalent; and conjoined with the name he had before
      established as a political writer, and the remembrance of the vigour and sagacity with which
      he had opposed the war, he seemed certain, when peace and order became established, of a
      brilliant position and career in a future administration: not less because he had steadfastly
      kept aloof from the existing Government, which it was rumoured, rightly or erroneously, that
      he had been solicited to join; and from every combination of the various democratic or
      discontented factions.</p>
<p>Quitting these more distinguished associates, he took his way alone towards the ramparts.
      The day was closing; the thunders of the cannon were dying down.</p>
<p>He passed by a wine-shop round which were gathered many of the worse specimens of the
      Moblots and National Guards, mostly drunk, and loudly talking in vehement abuse of generals
      and officers and commissariat. By one of the men, as he came under the glare of a petroleum
      lamp (there was gas no longer in the dismal city), he was recognised as the commander who had
      dared to insist on discipline, and disgrace honest patriots who claimed to themselves the sole
      option between fight and flight. The man was one of those patriots—one of the new recruits
      whom Victor had shamed and dismissed for mutiny and cowardice. He made a drunken plunge at his
      former chief, shouting, “A bas Pai-isto! Comrades, this is the coquin De Mauleon who is paid
      by the Prussians for getting us killed: a la lanterne!” “A la lanterne!” stammered and
      hiccupped others of the group; but they did not stir to execute their threat. Dimly seen as
      the stern face and sinewy form of the threatened man was by their drowsied eyes, the name of
      De Mauleon, the man without fear of a foe, and without ruth for a mutineer, sufficed to
      protect him from outrage; and with a slight movement of his arm that sent his denouncer
      reeling against the lamp-post, De Mauleon passed on:—when another man, in the uniform of a
      National Guard, bounded from the door of the tavern, crying with a loud voice, “Who said De
      Mauleon?—let me look on him:” and Victor, who had strode on with slow lion-like steps,
      cleaving the crowd, turned, and saw before him in the gleaming light a face, in which the bold
      frank, intelligent aspect of former days was lost in a wild, reckless, savage expression—the
      face of Armand Monnier.</p>
<p>“Ha! are you really Victor de Mauleon?” asked Monnier, not fiercely, but under his
      breath,—in that sort of stage whisper which is the natural utterance of excited men under the
      mingled influence of potent drink and hoarded rage.</p>
<p>“Certainly; I am Victor de Mauleon.”</p>
<p>“And you were in command of the—company of the National Guard on the 30th of November at
      Champigny and Villiers?”</p>
<p>“I was.”</p>
<p>“And you shot with your own hand an officer belonging to another company who refused to join
      yours?”</p>
<p>“I shot a cowardly soldier who ran away from the enemy, and seemed a ringleader of other
      runaways; and in so doing, I saved from dishonour the best part of his comrades.”</p>
<p>“The man was no coward. He was an enlightened Frenchman, and worth fifty of such aristos as
      you; and he knew better than his officers that he was to be led to an idle slaughter. Idle—I
      say idle. What was France the better, how was Paris the safer, for the senseless butchery of
      that day? You mutinied against a wiser general than Saint Trochu when you murdered that
      mutineer.”</p>
<p>“Armand Monnier, you are not quite sober to-night, or I would argue with you that question.
      But you no doubt are brave: how and why do you take the part of a runaway?”</p>
<p>“How and why? He was my brother, and you own you murdered him: my brother—the sagest head in
      Paris. If I had listened to him, I should not be,—bah!—no matter now what I am.”</p>
<p>“I could not know he was your brother; but if he had been mine I would have done the
      same.”</p>
<p>Here Victor’s lip quivered, for Monnier griped him by the arm, and looked him in the face
      with wild stony eyes. “I recollect that voice! Yet—yet—you say you are a noble, a
      Vicomte—Victor de Mauleon, and you shot my brother!”</p>
<p>Here he passed his left hand rapidly over his forehead. The fumes of wine still clouded his
      mind, but rays of intelligence broke through the cloud. Suddenly he said in a loud, and calm,
      and natural voice:</p>
<p>“Mons. le Vicomte, you accost me as Armand Monnier—pray how do you know my name?”</p>
<p>“How should I not know it? I have looked into the meetings of the ‘Clubs rouges.’ I have
      heard you speak, and naturally asked your name. Bon soir M. Monnier! When you reflect in
      cooler moments, you will see that if patriots excuse Brutus for first dishonouring and then
      executing his own son, an officer charged to defend his country may be surely pardoned for
      slaying a runaway to whom he was no relation, when in slaying he saved the man’s name and
      kindred from dishonour—unless, indeed, you insist on telling the world why he was slain.”</p>
<p>“I know your voice—I know it. Every sound becomes clearer to my ear. And if—”</p>
<p>But while Monnier thus spoke, De Mauleon had hastened on. Monnier looked round, saw him
      gone, but did not pursue. He was just intoxicated enough to know that his footsteps were not
      steady, and he turned back to the wine-shop and asked surlily for more wine. Could you have
      seen him then as he leant swinging himself to and fro against the wall,—had you known the man
      two years ago, you would have been a brute if you felt disgust. You could only have felt that
      profound compassion with which we gaze on a great royalty fallen. For the grandest of all
      royalties is that which takes its crown from Nature, needing no accident of birth. And Nature
      made the mind of Armand Monnier king-like; endowed it with lofty scorn of meanness and
      falsehood and dishonour, with warmth and tenderness of heart which had glow enough to spare
      from ties of kindred and hearth and home, to extend to those distant circles of humanity over
      which royal natures would fain extend the shadow of their sceptre.</p>
<p>How had the royalty of the man’s nature fallen thus? Royalty rarely falls from its own
      constitutional faults. It falls when, ceasing to be royal, it becomes subservient to bad
      advisers. And what bad advisers, always appealing to his better qualities and so enlisting his
      worser, had discrowned this mechanic?</p>
<p>“A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,” says the old-fashioned poet.</p>
<p>“Not so,” says the modern philosopher; “a little knowledge; is safer than no knowledge.”
      Possibly, as all individuals and all communities must go through the stage of a little
      knowledge before they can arrive at that of much knowledge, the philosopher’s assertion may be
      right in the long-run, and applied to humankind in general. But there is a period, as there is
      a class, in which a little knowledge tends to terrible demoralisation. And Armand Monnier
      lived in that period and was one of that class. The little knowledge that his mind, impulsive
      and ardent, had picked up out of books that warred with the great foundations of existing
      society, had originated in ill advices. A man stored with much knowledge would never have let
      Madame de Grantmesnil’s denunciations of marriage rites, or Louis Blane’s vindication of
      Robespierre as the representative of the working against the middle class, influence his
      practical life. He would have assessed such opinions at their real worth; and whatever that
      worth might seem to him, would not to such opinions have committed the conduct of his life.
      Opinion is not fateful: conduct is. A little knowledge crazes an earnest, warm-blooded,
      powerful creature like Armand Monnier into a fanatic. He takes an opinion which pleases him as
      a revelation from the gods; that opinion shapes his conduct; that conduct is his fate. Woe to
      the philosopher who serenely flings before the little knowledge of the artisan dogmas as
      harmless as the Atlantis of Plato if only to be discussed by philosophers, and deadly as the
      torches of Ate if seized as articles of a creed by fanatics! But thrice woe to the artisan who
      makes himself the zealot of the Dogma!</p>
<p>Poor Armand acts on the opinions he adopts; proves his contempt for the marriage state by
      living with the wife of another; resents, as natures so inherently manly must do, the Society
      that visits on her his defiance of its laws; throws himself, head foremost, against that
      society altogether; necessarily joins all who have other reasons for hostility to Society; he
      himself having every inducement not to join indiscriminate strikes—high wages, a liberal
      employer, ample savings, the certainty of soon becoming employer himself. No; that is not
      enough to the fanatic: he persists on being dupe and victim. He, this great king of labour,
      crowned by Nature, and cursed with that degree of little knowledge which does not comprehend
      how much more is required before a schoolboy would admit it to be knowledge at all,—he rushes
      into the maddest of all speculations—that of the artisan with little knowledge and enormous
      faith—that which intrusts the safety and repose and dignity of life to some ambitious
      adventurer, who uses his warm heart for the adventurer’s frigid purpose, much as the
      lawyer-government of September used the Communists,—much as, in every revolution of France, a
      Bertrand has used a Raton—much as, till the sound of the last trumpet, men very much worse

      experiment untried.</p>
