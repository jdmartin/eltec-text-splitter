<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>Obtaining from her husband Gustave’s address, Madame Rameau hastened to her son’s apartment
      alone through the darkling streets. The house in which he lodged was in a different quarter
      from that in which Isaura had visited him. Then, the street selected was still in the centre
      of the beau monde—now, it was within the precincts of that section of the many-faced capital
      in which the beau monde was held in detestation or scorn; still the house had certain
      pretensions, boasting a courtyard and a porter’s lodge. Madame Rameau, instructed to mount au
      second, found the door ajar, and, entering, perceived on the table of the little salon the
      remains of a feast which, however untempting it might have been in happier times, contrasted
      strongly with the meagre fare of which Gustave’s parents had deemed themselves fortunate to
      partake at the board of his betrothed; remnants of those viands which offered to the
      inquisitive epicure an experiment in food much too costly for the popular stomach—dainty
      morsels of elephant, hippopotamus, and wolf, interspersed with half-emptied bottles of varied
      and high-priced wines. Passing these evidences of unseasonable extravagance with a mute
      sentiment of anger and disgust, Madame Rameau penetrated into a small cabinet, the door of
      which was also ajar, and saw her son stretched on his bed half dressed, breathing heavily in
      the sleep which follows intoxication. She did not attempt to disturb him. She placed herself
      quietly by his side, gazing mournfully on the face which she had once so proudly contemplated,
      now haggard and faded,—still strangely beautiful, though it was the beauty of ruin.</p>
<p>From time to time he stirred uneasily, and muttered broken words, in which fragments of his
      own delicately-worded verse were incoherently mixed up with ribald slang, addressed to
      imaginary companions. In his dreams he was evidently living over again his late revel, with
      episodical diversions into the poet-world, of which he was rather a vagrant nomad than a
      settled cultivator. Then she would silently bathe his feverish temples with the perfumed water
      she found on his dressing-table. And so she watched till, in the middle of the night, he woke
      up, and recovered the possession of his reason with a quickness that surprised Madame Rameau.
      He was, indeed, one of those men in whom excess of drink, when slept off, is succeeded by
      extreme mildness, the effect of nervous exhaustion, and by a dejected repentance, which, to
      his mother, seemed a propitious lucidity of the moral sense.</p>
<p>Certainly on seeing her he threw himself on her breast, and began to shed tears. Madame
      Rameau had not the heart to reproach him sternly. But by gentle degrees she made him
      comprehend the pain he had given to his father, and the destitution in which he had deserted
      his parents and his affianced. In his present mood Gustave was deeply affected by these
      representations. He excused himself feebly by dwelling on the excitement of the times, the
      preoccupation of his mind, the example of his companions; but with his excuses he mingled
      passionate expressions of remorse, and before daybreak mother and son were completely
      reconciled. Then he fell into a tranquil sleep; and Madame Rameau, quite worn out, slept also
      in the chair beside him, her arm around his neck. He awoke before she did at a late hour in
      the morning; and stealing from her arm, went to his escritoire, and took forth what money he
      found there, half of which he poured into her lap, kissing her till she awoke.</p>
<p>“Mother,” he said, “henceforth I will work for thee and my father. Take this trifle now; the
      rest I reserve for Isaura.”</p>
<p>“Joy! I have found my boy again. But Isaura, I fear that she will not take thy money, and
      all thought of her must also be abandoned.”</p>
<p>Gustave had already turned to his looking-glass, and was arranging with care his dark
      ringlets: his personal vanity—his remorse appeased by this pecuniary oblation—had revived.</p>
<p>“No,” he said gaily, “I don’t think I shall abandon her; and it is not likely, when she sees
      and hears me, that she can wish to abandon me! Now let us breakfast, and then I will go at
      once to her.”</p>
<p>In the mean while, Isaura, on her return to her apartment at the wintry nightfall, found a
      cart stationed at the door, and the Venosta on the threshold, superintending the removal of
      various articles of furniture—indeed, all such articles as were not absolutely required.</p>
<p>“Oh, Piccola!” she said, with an attempt at cheerfulness, “I did not expect thee back so
      soon. Hush! I have made a famous bargain. I have found a broker to buy these things which we
      don’t want just at present, and can replace by new and prettier things when the siege is over
      and we get our money. The broker pays down on the nail and thou wilt not go to bed without
      supper. There are no ills which are not more supportable after food.”</p>
<p>Isaura smiled faintly, kissed the Venosta’s cheek, and ascended with weary steps to the
      sitting-room. There she seated herself quietly, looking with abstracted eyes round the bare
      dismantled space by the light of the single candle.</p>
<p>When the Venosta re-entered, she was followed by the servants, bringing in a daintier meal
      than they had known for days—a genuine rabbit, potatoes, marrons glaces, a bottle of wine, and
      a pannier of wood. The fire was soon lighted, the Venosta plying the bellows. It was not till
      this banquet, of which Isaura, faint as she was, scarcely partook, had been remitted to the
      two Italian women-servants, and another log been thrown on the hearth, that the Venosta opened
      the subject which was pressing on her heart. She did this with a joyous smile, taking both
      Isaura’s hands in her own, and stroking them fondly.</p>
<p>“My child, I have such good news for thee! Thou hast escaped—thou art free!” and then she
      related all that M. Rameau had said, and finished by producing the copy of Gustave’s
      unhallowed journal.</p>
<p>When she had read the latter, which she did with compressed lips and varying colour, the
      girl fell on her knees—not to thank Heaven that she would now escape a union from which her
      soul so recoiled—not that she was indeed free, but to pray, with tears rolling down her
      cheeks, that God would yet save to Himself, and to good ends, the soul that she had failed to
      bring to Him. All previous irritation against Gustave was gone: all had melted into an
      ineffable compassion.</p>
