<head>CHAPTER THE LAST.</head>
<p>Among the refugees which the convoi from Versailles disgorged on the Paris station were two
      men, who, in pushing through the crowd, came suddenly face to face with each other.</p>
<p>“Aha! Bon jour, M. Duplessis,” said a burly voice. “Bon jour, M. Louvier,” replied
      Duplessis.</p>
<p>“How long have you left Bretagne?”</p>
<p>“On the day that the news of the armistice reached it, in order to be able to enter Paris
      the first day its gates were open. And you—where have you been?”</p>
<p>“In London.”</p>
<p>“Ah! in London!” said Duplessis, paling. “I knew I had an enemy there.”</p>
<p>“Enemy! I? Bah! my dear Monsieur. What makes you think me your enemy?”</p>
<p>“I remember your threats.”</p>
<p>“A propos of Rochebriant. By the way, when would it be convenient to you and the dear
      Marquis to let me into prompt possession of that property? You can no longer pretend to buy it

      London have failed. But I may recover myself yet, now that I re-enter Paris. In the mean time,
      we have still six months before us; for, as you will find—if you know it not already—the
      interest due to you has been lodged with Messrs. —— of ———, and you cannot foreclose, even if
      the law did not take into consideration the national calamities as between debtor and
      creditor.”</p>
<p>“Quite true. But if you cannot buy the property it must pass into my hands in a very short
      time. And you and the Marquis had better come to an amicable arrangement with me. Apropos, I
      read in the Times newspaper that Alain was among the wounded in the sortie of December.”</p>
<p>“Yes; we learnt that through a pigeon-post. We were afraid....”</p>
