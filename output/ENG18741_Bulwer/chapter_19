<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>M. Savarin was one of the most brilliant of that galaxy of literary men which shed lustre on
      the reign of Louis Philippe.</p>
<p>His was an intellect peculiarly French in its lightness and grace. Neither England nor
      Germany nor America has produced any resemblance to it. Ireland has, in Thomas Moore; but then
      in Irish genius there is so much that is French.</p>
<p>M. Savarin was free from the ostentatious extravagance which had come into vogue with the
      Empire. His house and establishment were modestly maintained within the limit of an income
      chiefly, perhaps entirely, derived from literary profits.</p>
<p>Though he gave frequent dinners, it was but to few at a time, and without show or pretence.
      Yet the dinners, though simple, were perfect of their kind; and the host so contrived to
      infuse his own playful gayety into the temper of his guests, that the feasts at his house were
      considered the pleasantest at Paris. On this occasion the party extended to ten, the largest
      number his table admitted.</p>
<p>All the French guests belonged to the Liberal party, though in changing tints of the
      tricolor. Place aux dames! first to be named were the Countess de Craon and Madame Vertot,
      both without husbands. The Countess had buried the Count, Madame Vertot had separated from
      Monsieur. The Countess was very handsome, but she was sixty; Madame Vertot was twenty years
      younger, but she was very plain. She had quarrelled with the distinguished author for whose
      sake she had separated from Monsieur, and no man had since presumed to think that he could
      console a lady so plain for the loss of an author so distinguished.</p>
<p>Both these ladies were very clever. The Countess had written lyrical poems entitled “Cries
      of Liberty,” and a drama of which Danton was the hero, and the moral too revolutionary for
      admission to the stage; but at heart the Countess was not at all a revolutionist,—the last
      person in the world to do or desire anything that could bring a washerwoman an inch nearer to
      a countess. She was one of those persons who play with fire in order to appear
      enlightened.</p>
<p>Madame Vertot was of severer mould. She had knelt at the feet of M. Thiers, and went into
      the historico-political line. She had written a remarkable book upon the modern Carthage
      (meaning England), and more recently a work that had excited much attention upon the Balance
      of Power, in which she proved it to be the interest of civilization and the necessity of
      Europe that Belgium should be added to France, and Prussia circumscribed to the bounds of its
      original margraviate. She showed how easily these two objects could have been effected by a
      constitutional monarch instead of an egotistical Emperor. Madame Vertot was a decided
      Orleanist.</p>
<p>Both these ladies condescended to put aside authorship in general society. Next amongst our
      guests let me place the Count de Passy and Madame son espouse. The Count was seventy-one, and,
      it is needless to add, a type of Frenchman rapidly vanishing, and not likely to find itself
      renewed. How shall I describe him so as to make my English reader understand? Let me try by
      analogy. Suppose a man of great birth and fortune, who in his youth had been an enthusiastic
      friend of Lord Byron and a jocund companion of George IV.; who had in him an immense degree of
      lofty romantic sentiment with an equal degree of well-bred worldly cynicism, but who, on
      account of that admixture, which is so rare, kept a high rank in either of the two societies
      into which, speaking broadly, civilized life divides itself,—the romantic and the cynical. The
      Count de Passy had been the most ardent among the young disciples of Chateaubriand, the most
      brilliant among the young courtiers of Charles X. Need I add that he had been a terrible
      lady-killer?</p>
<p>But in spite of his admiration of Chateaubriand and his allegiance to Charles X., the Count
      had been always true to those caprices of the French noblesse from which he
      descended,—caprices which destroyed them in the old Revolution; caprices belonging to the
      splendid ignorance of their nation in general and their order in particular. Speaking without
      regard to partial exceptions, the French gentilhomme is essentially a Parisian; a Parisian is
      essentially impressionable to the impulse or fashion of the moment. Is it a la mode for the
      moment to be Liberal or anti-Liberal? Parisians embrace and kiss each other, and swear through
      life and death to adhere forever to the mode of the moment. The Three Days were the mode of
      the moment,—the Count de Passy became an enthusiastic Orleanist. Louis Philippe was very
      gracious to him. He was decorated; he was named prefet of his department; he was created
      senator; he was about to be sent Minister to a German Court when Louis Philippe fell. The
      Republic was proclaimed. The Count caught the popular contagion, and after exchanging tears
      and kisses with patriots whom a week before he had called canaille, he swore eternal fidelity
      to the Republic. The fashion of the moment suddenly became Napoleonic, and with the coup
      d’etat the Republic was metamorphosed into an Empire. The Count wept on the bosoms of all the
      Vieilles Moustaches he could find, and rejoiced that the sun of Austerlitz had re-arisen. But
      after the affair of Mexico the sun of Austerlitz waxed very sickly. Imperialism was fast going
      out of fashion. The Count transferred his affection to Jules Favre, and joined the ranks of
      the advanced Liberals. During all these political changes, the Count had remained very much
      the same man in private life; agreeable, good-natured, witty, and, above all, a devotee of the
      fair sex. When he had reached the age of sixty-eight he was still fort bel homme, unmarried,
      with a grand presence and charming manner. At that age he said, “Je me range,” and married a
      young lady of eighteen. She adored her husband, and was wildly jealous of him; while the Count
      did not seem at all jealous of her, and submitted to her adoration with a gentle shrug of the
      shoulders.</p>
<p>The three other guests who, with Graham and the two Italian ladies, made up the complement
      of ten, were the German Count von Rudesheim, a celebrated French physician named Bacourt, and
      a young author whom Savarin had admitted into his clique and declared to be of rare promise.
      This author, whose real name was Gustave Rameau, but who, to prove, I suppose, the sincerity
      of that scorn for ancestry which he professed, published his verses under the patrician
      designation of Alphonse de Valcour, was about twenty-four, and might have passed at the first
      glance for younger; but, looking at him closely, the signs of old age were already stamped on
      his visage.</p>
<p>He was undersized, and of a feeble slender frame. In the eyes of women and artists the
      defects of his frame were redeemed by the extraordinary beauty of the face. His black hair,
      carefully parted in the centre, and worn long and flowing, contrasted the whiteness of a high
      though narrow forehead, and the delicate pallor of his cheeks. His feature, were very regular,
      his eyes singularly bright; but the expression of the face spoke of fatigue and exhaustion;
      the silky locks were already thin, and interspersed with threads of silver; the bright eyes
      shone out from sunken orbits; the lines round the mouth were marked as they are in the middle
      age of one who has lived too fast.</p>
<p>It was a countenance that might have excited a compassionate and tender interest but for
      something arrogant and supercilious in the expression,-something that demanded not tender pity
      but enthusiastic admiration. Yet that expression was displeasing rather to men than to women;
      and one could well conceive that, among the latter, the enthusiastic admiration it challenged
      would be largely conceded.</p>
<p>The conversation at dinner was in complete contrast to that at the Americans’ the day
      before. There the talk, though animated, had been chiefly earnest and serious; here it was all
      touch and go, sally and repartee. The subjects were the light on lots and lively anecdotes of
      the day, not free from literature and politics, but both treated as matters of persiflage,
      hovered round with a jest and quitted with an epigram. The two French lady authors, the Count
      de Passy, the physician, and the host far outspoke all the other guests. Now and then,
      however, the German Count struck in with an ironical remark condensing a great deal of grave
      wisdom, and the young author with ruder and more biting sarcasm. If the sarcasm told, he
      showed his triumph by a low-pitched laugh; if it failed, he evinced his displeasure by a
      contemptuous sneer or a grim scowl.</p>
<p>Isaura and Graham were not seated near each other, and were for the most part contented to
      be listeners.</p>
<p>On adjourning to the salon after dinner, Graham, however, was approaching the chair in which
      Isaura had placed herself, when the young author, forestalling him, dropped into the seat next
      to her, and began a conversation in a voice so low that it might have passed for a whisper.
      The Englishman drew back and observed them. He soon perceived, with a pang of jealousy not
      unmingled with scorn, that the author’s talk appeared to interest Isaura. She listened with
      evident attention; and when she spoke in return, though Graham did not hear her words, he
      could observe on her expressive countenance an increased gentleness of aspect.</p>
<p>“I hope,” said the physician, joining Graham, as most of the other guests gathered round
      Savarin, who was in his liveliest vein of anecdote and wit,—“I hope that the fair Italian will
      not allow that ink-bottle imp to persuade her that she has fallen in love with him.”</p>
<p>“Do young ladies generally find him so seductive?” asked Graham, with a forced smile.</p>
<p>“Probably enough. He has the reputation of being very clever and very wicked, and that is a
      sort of character which has the serpent’s fascination for the daughters of Eve.”</p>
<p>“Is the reputation merited?”</p>
<p>“As to the cleverness, I am not a fair judge. I dislike that sort of writing which is
      neither manlike nor womanlike, and in which young Rameau excels. He has the knack of finding
      very exaggerated phrases by which to express commonplace thoughts. He writes verses about love
      in words so stormy that you might fancy that Jove was descending upon Semele; but when you
      examine his words, as a sober pathologist like myself is disposed to do, your fear for the
      peace of households vanishes,—they are Fox et proeterea nihil; no man really in love would use
      them. He writes prose about the wrongs of humanity. You feel for humanity; you say, ‘Grant the
      wrongs, now for the remedy,’—and you find nothing but balderdash. Still I am bound to say that
      both in verse and prose Gustave Rameau is in unison with a corrupt taste of the day, and
      therefore he is coming into vogue. So much as to his writings; as to his wickedness, you have
      only to look at him to feel sure that he is not a hundredth part so wicked as he wishes to
      seem. In a word, then, M. Gustave Rameau is a type of that somewhat numerous class among the
      youth of Paris, which I call ‘the lost Tribe of Absinthe.’ There is a set of men who begin to
      live full gallop while they are still boys. As a general rule, they are originally of the
      sickly frames which can scarcely even trot, much less gallop without the spur of stimulants,
      and no stimulant so fascinates their peculiar nervous system as absinthe. The number of
      patients in this set who at the age of thirty are more worn out than septuagenarians increases
      so rapidly as to make one dread to think what will be the next race of Frenchmen. To the
      predilection for absinthe young Rameau and the writers of his set add the imitation of Heine,
      after, indeed, the manner of caricaturists, who effect a likeness striking in proportion as it
      is ugly. It is not easy to imitate the pathos and the wit of Heine; but it is easy to imitate
      his defiance of the Deity, his mockery of right and wrong, his relentless war on that heroic
      standard of thought and action which the writers who exalt their nation intuitively preserve.
      Rameau cannot be a Heine, but he can be to Heine what a misshapen snarling dwarf is to a
      mangled blaspheming Titan. Yet he interests the women in general, and he evidently interests
      the fair Signorina in especial.”</p>
<p>Just as Bacourt finished that last sentence, Isaura lifted the head which had hitherto bent
      in an earnest listening attitude that seemed to justify the Doctor’s remarks, and looked
      round. Her eyes met Graham’s with the fearless candour which made half the charm of their
      bright yet soft intelligence; but she dropped them suddenly with a half-start and a change of
      colour, for the expression of Graham’s face was unlike that which she had hitherto seen on
      it,—it was hard, stern, and somewhat disdainful. A minute or so afterwards she rose, and in
      passing across the room towards the group round the host, paused at a table covered with books
      and prints near to which Graham was standing alone. The Doctor had departed in company with
      the German Count.</p>
<p>Isaura took up one of the prints.</p>
<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed, “Sorrento, my Sorrento. Have you ever visited Sorrento, Mr. Vane?”</p>
<p>Her question and her movement were evidently in conciliation. Was the conciliation prompted
      by coquetry, or by a sentiment more innocent and artless?</p>
<p>Graham doubted, and replied coldly, as he bent over the print,—</p>
<p>“I once stayed there a few days, but my recollection of it is not sufficiently lively to
      enable me to recognize its features in this design.”</p>
<p>“That is the house, at least so they say, of Tasso’s father; of course you visited
      that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was a hotel in my time; I lodged there.”</p>
<p>“And I too. There I first read ‘The Gerusalemine.’” The last words were said in Italian,
      with a low measured tone, inwardly and dreamily.</p>
<p>A somewhat sharp and incisive voice speaking in French here struck in and prevented Graham’s
      rejoinder: “Quel joli dessin! What is it, Mademoiselle?”</p>
<p>Graham recoiled; the speaker was Gustave Rameau, who had, unobserved, first watched Isaura,
      then rejoined her side.</p>
<p>“A view of Sorrento, Monsieur, but it does not do justice to the place. I was pointing out
      the house which belonged to Tasso’s father.”</p>
<p>“Tasso! Hein! and which is the fair Eleonora’s?”</p>
<p>“Monsieur,” answered Isaura, rather startled at that question, from a professed homme de
      lettres, “Eleonora did not live at Sorrento.”</p>
<p>“Tant pis pour Sorrente,” said the homme de lettres, carelessly. “No one would care for
      Tasso if it were not for Eleonora.”</p>
<p>“I should rather have thought,” said Graham, “that no one would have cared for Eleonora if
      it were not for Tasso.”</p>
<p>Rameau glanced at the Englishman superciliously. “Pardon, Monsieur, in every age a
      love-story keeps its interest; but who cares nowadays for le clinquant du Tasse?”</p>
<p>“Le clinquant du Tasse!” exclaimed Isaura, indignantly.</p>
<p>“The expression is Boileau’s, Mademoiselle, in ridicule of the ‘Sot de qualite,’ who
      prefers—</p>
<quote>
<l> “‘Le clinquant du Tasse a tout l’or de Virgile.’ </l></quote>
<p>“But for my part I have as little faith in the last as the first.”</p>
<p>“I do not know Latin, and have therefore not read Virgil,” said Isaura.</p>
<p>“Possibly,” remarked Graham, “Monsieur does not know Italian, and has therefore not read
      Tasso.”</p>
<p>“If that be meant in sarcasm,” retorted Rameau, “I construe it as a compliment. A Frenchman
      who is contented to study the masterpieces of modern literature need learn no language and
      read no authors but his own.”</p>
<p>Isaura laughed her pleasant silvery laugh. “I should admire the frankness of that boast,
      Monsieur, if in our talk just now you had not spoken as contemptuously of what we are
      accustomed to consider French masterpieces as you have done of Virgil and Tasso.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Mademoiselle! it is not my fault if you have had teachers of taste so rococo as to bid
      you find masterpieces in the tiresome stilted tragedies of Corneille and Racine. Poetry of a
      court, not of a people, one simple novel, one simple stanza that probes the hidden recesses of
      the human heart, reveals the sores of this wretched social state, denounces the evils of
      superstition, kingcraft, and priestcraft, is worth a library of the rubbish which pedagogues
      call ‘the classics.’ We agree, at least, in one thing, Mademoiselle; we both do homage to the
      genius of your friend Madame de Grantmesnil.”</p>
<p>“Your friend, Signorina!” cried Graham, incredulously; “is Madame de Grantmesnil your
      friend?”</p>
<p>“The dearest I have in the world.”</p>
<p>Graham’s face darkened; he turned away in silence, and in another minute vanished from the
      room, persuading himself that he felt not one pang of jealousy in leaving Gustave Rameau by
      the side of Isaura. “Her dearest friend Madame de Grantmesnil!” he muttered.</p>
<p>A word now on Isaura’s chief correspondent. Madame de Grantmesnil was a woman of noble birth
      and ample fortune. She had separated from her husband in the second year after marriage. She
      was a singularly eloquent writer, surpassed among contemporaries of her sex in popularity and
      renown only by Georges Sand.</p>
<p>At least as fearless as that great novelist in the frank exposition of her views, she had
      commenced her career in letters by a work of astonishing power and pathos, directed against
      the institution of marriage as regulated in Roman Catholic communities. I do not know that it
      said more on this delicate subject than the English Milton has said; but then Milton did not
      write for a Roman Catholic community, nor adopt a style likely to captivate the working
      classes. Madame de Grantmesnil’s first book was deemed an attack on the religion of the
      country, and captivated those among the working classes who had already abjured that religion.
      This work was followed up by others more or less in defiance of “received opinions,”—some with
      political, some with social revolutionary aim and tendency, but always with a singular purity
      of style. Search all her books, and however you might revolt from her doctrine, you could not
      find a hazardous expression. The novels of English young ladies are naughty in comparison. Of
      late years, whatever might be hard or audacious in her political or social doctrines softened
      itself into charm amid the golden haze of romance. Her writings had grown more and more purely
      artistic,—poetizing what is good and beautiful in the realities of life rather than creating a
      false ideal out of what is vicious and deformed. Such a woman, separated young from her
      husband, could not enunciate such opinions and lead a life so independent and uncontrolled as
      Madame de Grantmesnil had done, without scandal, without calumny. Nothing, however, in her
      actual life had ever been so proved against her as to lower the high position she occupied in
      right of birth, fortune, renown. Wherever she went she was fetee, as in England foreign
      princes, and in America foreign authors, are fetes. Those who knew her well concurred in
      praise of her lofty, generous, lovable qualities. Madame de Grantmesnil had known Mr. Selby;
      and when, at his death, Isaura, in the innocent age between childhood and youth, had been left
      the most sorrowful and most lonely creature on the face of the earth, this famous woman,
      worshipped by the rich for her intellect, adored by the poor for her beneficence, came to the
      orphan’s friendless side, breathing love once more into her pining heart, and waking for the
      first time the desires of genius, the aspirations of art, in the dim self-consciousness of a
      soul between sleep and waking.</p>
<p>But, my dear Englishman, put yourself in Graham’s place, and suppose that you were beginning
      to fall in love with a girl whom for many good reasons you ought not to marry; suppose that in
      the same hour in which you were angrily conscious of jealousy on account of a man whom it
      wounds your self-esteem to consider a rival, the girl tells you that her dearest friend is a
      woman who is famed for her hostility to the institution of marriage!</p>
