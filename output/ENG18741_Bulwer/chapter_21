<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>“Tell me,” said Raoul, when they were in the carriage, “how you came to know M.
      Louvier.”</p>
<p>“He is my chief mortgagee.”</p>
<p>“H’m! that explains it. But you might be in worse hands; the man has a character for
      liberality.”</p>
<p>“Did your father mention to you my circumstances, and the reason that brings me to
      Paris?”</p>
<p>“Since you put the question point-blank, my dear cousin, he did.”</p>
<p>“He told you how poor I am, and how keen must be my lifelong struggle to keep Rochebriant as
      the home of my race?”</p>
<p>“He told us all that could make us still more respect the Marquis de Rochebriant, and still
      more eagerly long to know our cousin and the head of our house,” answered Raoul, with a
      certain nobleness of tone and manner.</p>
<p>Alain pressed his kinsman’s hand with grateful emotion. “Yet,” he said falteringly, “your
      father agreed with me that my circumstances would not allow me to—”</p>
<p>“Bah!” interrupted Raoul, with a gentle laugh; “my father is a very clever man, doubtless,
      but he knows only the world of his own day, nothing of the world of ours. I and Enguerrand
      will call on you to-morrow, to take you to my mother, and before doing so, to consult as to
      affairs in general. On this last matter Enguerrand is an oracle. Here we are at the
      Contessa’s.”</p>
