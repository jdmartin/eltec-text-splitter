<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>Raul and Enguerrand called on Alain at the hour fixed. “In the first place,” said Raoul, “I
      must beg you to accept my mother’s regrets that she cannot receive you to-day. She and the
      Contessa belong to a society of ladies formed for visiting the poor, and this is their day;
      but to-morrow you must dine with us en famille. Now to business. Allow me to light my cigar
      while you confide the whole state of affairs to Enguerrand. Whatever he counsels, I am sure to
      approve.”</p>
<p>Alain, as briefly as he could, stated his circumstances, his mortgages, and the hopes which
      his avow had encouraged him to place in the friendly disposition of M. Louvier. When he had
      concluded, Enguerrand mused for a few moments before replying. At last he said, “Will you
      trust me to call on Louvier on your behalf? I shall but inquire if he is inclined to take on
      himself the other mortgages; and if so, on what terms. Our relationship gives me the excuse
      for my interference; and to say truth, I have had much familiar intercourse with the man. I
      too am a speculator, and have often profited by Louvier’s advice. You may ask what can be his
      object in serving me; he can gain nothing by it. To this I answer, the key to his good offices
      is in his character. Audacious though he be as a speculator, he is wonderfully prudent as a
      politician. This belle France of ours is like a stage tumbler; one can never be sure whether
      it will stand on its head or its feet. Louvier very wisely wishes to feel himself safe
      whatever party comes uppermost. He has no faith in the duration of the Empire; and as, at all
      events, the Empire will not confiscate his millions, he takes no trouble in conciliating
      Imperialists. But on the principle which induces certain savages to worship the devil and
      neglect the bon Dieu, because the devil is spiteful and the bon Dieu is too beneficent to
      injure them, Louvier, at heart detesting as well as dreading a republic, lays himself out to
      secure friends with the Republicans of all classes, and pretends to espouse their cause; next
      to them, he is very conciliatory to the Orleanists; lastly, though he thinks the Legitimists
      have no chance, he desires to keep well with the nobles of that party, because they exercise a
      considerable influence over that sphere of opinion which belongs to fashion,—for fashion is
      never powerless in Paris. Raoul and myself are no mean authorities in salons and clubs, and a
      good word from us is worth having.</p>
<p>“Besides, Louvier himself in his youth set up for a dandy; and that deposed ruler of
      dandies, our unfortunate kinsman, Victor de Mauleon, shed some of his own radiance on the
      money-lender’s son. But when Victor’s star was eclipsed, Louvier ceased to gleam. The dandies
      cut him. In his heart he exults that the dandies now throng to his soirees.</p>
<p>“Bref, the millionaire is especially civil to me,—the more so as I know intimately two or
      three eminent journalists; and Louvier takes pains to plant garrisons in the press. I trust I
      have explained the grounds on which I may be a better diplomatist to employ than your avoue;
      and with your leave I will go to Louvier at once.”</p>
<p>“Let him go,” said Raoul. “Enguerrand never fails in anything he undertakes; especially,” he
      added, with a smile half sad, half tender, “when one wishes to replenish one’s purse.”</p>
<p>“I too gratefully grant such an ambassador all powers to treat,” said Alain. “I am only
      ashamed to consign to him a post so much beneath his genius,” and “his birth” he was about to
      add, but wisely checked himself. Enguerrand said, shrugging his shoulders, “You can’t do me a
      greater kindness than by setting my wits at work. I fall a martyr to ennui when I am not in
      action;” he said, and was gone.</p>
<p>“It makes me very melancholy at times,” said Raoul, flinging away the end of his cigar, “to
      think that a man so clever and so energetic as Enguerrand should be as much excluded from the
      service of his country as if he were an Iroquois Indian. He would have made a great
      diplomatist.”</p>
<p>“Alas!” replied Alain, with a sigh, “I begin to doubt whether we Legitimists are justified
      in maintaining a useless loyalty to a sovereign who renders us morally exiles in the land of
      our birth.”</p>
<p>“I have no doubt on the subject,” said Raoul. “We are not justified on the score of policy,
      but we have no option at present on the score of honour. We should gain so much for ourselves
      if we adopted the State livery and took the State wages that no man would esteem us as
      patriots; we should only be despised as apostates. So long as Henry V. lives, and does not
      resign his claim, we cannot be active citizens; we must be mournful lookers-on. But what
      matters it? We nobles of the old race are becoming rapidly extinct. Under any form of
      government likely to be established in France we are equally doomed. The French people, aiming
      at an impossible equality, will never again tolerate a race of gentilshommes. They cannot
      prevent, without destroying commerce and capital altogether, a quick succession of men of the
      day, who form nominal aristocracies much more opposed to equality than any hereditary class of
      nobles; but they refuse these fleeting substitutes of born patricians all permanent stake in
      the country, since whatever estate they buy must be subdivided at their death my poor Alain,
      you are making it the one ambition of your life to preserve to your posterity the home and
      lands of your forefathers. How is that possible, even supposing you could redeem the
      mortgages? You marry some day; you have children, and Rochebriant must then be sold to pay for
      their separate portions. How this condition of things, while rendering us so ineffective to
      perform the normal functions of a noblesse in public life, affects us in private life, may be
      easily conceived.</p>
<p>“Condemned to a career of pleasure and frivolity, we can scarcely escape from the contagion
      of extravagant luxury which forms the vice of the time. With grand names to keep up, and small
      fortunes whereon to keep them, we readily incur embarrassment and debt. Then neediness
      conquers pride. We cannot be great merchants, but we can be small gamblers on the Bourse, or,
      thanks to the Credit Mobilier, imitate a cabinet minister, and keep a shop under another name.
      Perhaps you have heard that Enguerrand and I keep a shop. Pray, buy your gloves there. Strange
      fate for men whose ancestors fought in the first Crusade—mais que voulez-vous?”</p>
<p>“I was told of the shop,” said Alain; “but the moment I knew you I disbelieved the
      story.”</p>
<p>“Quite true. Shall I confide to you why we resorted to that means of finding ourselves in
      pocket-money? My father gives us rooms in his hotel; the use of his table, which we do not
      much profit by; and an allowance, on which we could not live as young men of our class live at
      Paris. Enguerrand had his means of spending pocket-money, I mine; but it came to the same
      thing,—the pockets were emptied. We incurred debts. Two years ago my father straitened himself
      to pay them, saying, ‘The next time you come to me with debts, however small, you must pay
      them yourselves, or you must marry, and leave it to me to find you wives.’ This threat
      appalled us both. A month afterwards, Enguerrand made a lucky hit at the Bourse, and proposed
      to invest the proceeds in a shop. I resisted as long as I could; but Enguerrand triumphed over
      me, as he always does. He found an excellent deputy in a bonne who had nursed us in childhood,
      and married a journeyman perfumer who understands the business. It answers well; we are not in
      debt, and we have preserved our freedom.”</p>
<p>After these confessions Raoul went away, and Alain fell into a mournful revery, from which
      he was roused by a loud ring at his bell. He opened the door, and beheld M. Louvier. The burly
      financier was much out of breath after making so steep an ascent. It was in gasps that he
      muttered, “Bon jour; excuse me if I derange you.” Then entering and seating himself on a
      chair, he took some minutes to recover speech, rolling his eyes staringly round the meagre,
      unluxurious room, and then concentrating their gaze upon its occupier.</p>
<p>“Peste, my dear Marquis!” he said at last, “I hope the next time I visit you the ascent may
      be less arduous. One would think you were in training to ascend the Himalaya.”</p>
<p>The haughty noble writhed under this jest, and the spirit inborn in his order spoke in his
      answer.</p>
<p>“I am accustomed to dwell on heights, Monsieur Louvier; the castle of Rochebriant is not on
      a level with the town.” An angry gleam shot out from the eyes of the millionaire, but there
      was no other sign of displeasure in his answer. “Bien dit, mon cher; how you remind me of your
      father! Now, give me leave to speak on affairs. I have seen your cousin Enguerrand de
      Vandemar. Homme de moyens, though joli garcon. He proposed that you should call on me. I said
      ‘no’ to the cher petit Enguerrand,—a visit from me was due to you. To cut matters short, M.
      Gandrin has allowed me to look into your papers. I was disposed to serve you from the first; I
      am still more disposed to serve you now. I undertake to pay off all your other mortgages, and
      become sole mortgagee, and on terms that I have jotted down on this paper, and which I hope
      will content you.”</p>
<p>He placed a paper in Alain’s hand, and took out a box, from which he extracted a jujube,
      placed it in his mouth, folded his hands, and reclined back in his chair, with his eyes half
      closed, as if exhausted alike by his ascent and his generosity.</p>
<p>In effect, the terms were unexpectedly liberal. The reduced interest on the mortgages would
      leave the Marquis an income of L1,000 a year instead of L400. Louvier proposed to take on
      himself the legal cost of transfer, and to pay to the Marquis 25,000 francs, on the completion
      of the deed, as a bonus. The mortgage did not exempt the building-land, as Hebert desired. In
      all else it was singularly advantageous, and Alain could but feel a thrill of grateful delight
      at an offer by which his stinted income was raised to comparative affluence.</p>
<p>“Well, Marquis,” said Louvier, “what does the castle say to the town?”</p>
<p>“Monsieur Louvier,” answered Alain, extending his hand with cordial eagerness, “accept my
      sincere apologies for the indiscretion of my metaphor. Poverty is proverbially sensitive to
      jests on it. I owe it to you if I cannot hereafter make that excuse for any words of mine that
      may displease you. The terms you propose are most liberal, and I close with them at once.”</p>
<p>“Bon,” said Louvier, shaking vehemently the hand offered to him; “I will take the paper to
      Gandrin, and instruct him accordingly. And now, may I attach a condition to the agreement
      which is not put down on paper? It may have surprised you perhaps that I should propose a
      gratuity of 25,000 francs on completion of the contract. It is a droll thing to do, and not in
      the ordinary way of business, therefore I must explain. Marquis, pardon the liberty I take,
      but you have inspired me with an interest in your future. With your birth, connections, and
      figure you should push your way in the world far and fast. But you can’t do so in a province.
      You must find your opening at Paris. I wish you to spend a year in the capital, and live, not
      extravagantly, like a nouveau riche, but in a way not unsuited to your rank, and permitting
      you all the social advantages that belong to it. These 25,000 francs, in addition to your
      improved income, will enable you to gratify my wish in this respect. Spend the money in Paris;
      you will want every sou of it in the course of the year. It will be money well spent. Take my
      advice, cher Marquis. Au plaisir.”</p>
<p>The financier bowed himself out. The young Marquis forgot all the mournful reflections with
      which Raoul’s conversation had inspired him. He gave a new touch to his toilette, and sallied
      forth with the air of a man on whose morning of life a sun heretofore clouded has burst forth
      and bathed the landscape in its light.</p>
