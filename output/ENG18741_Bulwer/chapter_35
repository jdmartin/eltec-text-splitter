<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p>Punctually at eight o’clock Graham Vane had taken his seat at a corner table at the remote
      end of the cafe Jean Jacques, called for his cup of coffee and his evening journal, and
      awaited the arrival of M. Lebeau. His patience was not tasked long. In a few minutes the
      Frenchman entered, paused at the comptoir, as was his habit, to address a polite salutation to
      the well-dressed lady who there presided, nodded as usual to Armand Monnier, then glanced
      round, recognized Graham with a smile, and approached his table with the quiet grace of
      movement by which he was distinguished.</p>
<p>Seating himself opposite to Graham, and speaking in a voice too low to be heard by others,
      and in French, he then said,</p>
<p>“In thinking over your communication this morning, it strikes me as probable, perhaps as
      certain, that this Louise Duval or her children, if she have any, must be entitled to some
      moneys bequeathed to her by a relation or friend in England. What say you to that assumption,
      Monsieur Lamb?”</p>
<p>“You are a sharp fellow,” answered Graham. “Just what I say to myself. Why else should I be
      instructed to go to such expense in finding her out? Most likely, if one can’t trace her, or
      her children born before the date named, any such moneys will go to some one else; and that
      some one else, whoever he be, has commissioned my employer to find out. But I don’t imagine
      any sum due to her or her heirs can be much, or that the matter is very important; for, if so,
      the thing would not be carelessly left in the hands of one of the small fry like myself, and
      clapped in along with a lot of other business as an off-hand job.”</p>
<p>“Will you tell me who employed you?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t feel authorized to do that at present; and I don’t see the necessity of it. It
      seems to me, on consideration, a matter for the police to ferret out; only, as I asked before,
      how should I get at the police?”</p>
<p>“That is not difficult. It is just possible that I might help you better than any lawyer or
      any detective.”</p>
<p>“Why, did you ever know this Louise Duval?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Monsieur Lamb; you refuse me your full confidence; allow me to imitate your
      reserve.”</p>
<p>“Oho!” said Graham; “shut up as close as you like; it is nothing to me. Only observe, there
      is this difference between us, that I am employed by another. He does not authorize me to name
      him, and if I did commit that indiscretion, I might lose my bread and cheese. Whereas you have
      nobody’s secret to guard but your own, in saying whether or not you ever knew a Madame or
      Mademoiselle Duval; and if you have some reason for not getting me the information I am
      instructed to obtain, that is also a reason for not troubling you further. And after all, old
      boy” (with a familiar slap on Lebeau’s stately shoulder), “after all, it is I who would employ
      you; you don’t employ me. And if you find out the lady, it is you who would get the L100., not
      I.”</p>
<p>M. Lebeau mechanically brushed, with a light movement of hand, the shoulder which the
      Englishman had so pleasantly touched, drew himself and chair some inches back, and said
      slowly,—</p>
<p>“Monsieur Lamb, let us talk as gentleman to gentleman. Put aside the question of money
      altogether; I must first know why your employer wants to hunt out this poor Louise Duval. It
      may be to her injury, and I would do her none if you offered thousands where you offer pounds.
      I forestall the condition of mutual confidence; I own that I have known her,—it is many years
      ago; and, Monsieur Lamb, though a Frenchman very often injures a woman from love, he is in a
      worse plight for bread and cheese than I am if he injures her for money.”</p>
<p>“Is he thinking of the duchess’s jewels?” thought Graham. “Bravo, mon vieux,” he said aloud;
      “but as I don’t know what my employer’s motive in his commission is, perhaps you can enlighten
      me. How could his inquiry injure Louise Duval?”</p>
<p>“I cannot say; but you English have the power to divorce your wives. Louise Duval may have
      married an Englishman, separated from him, and he wants to know where he can find, in order to
      criminate and divorce her, or it may be to insist on her return to him.”</p>
<p>“Bosh! that is not likely.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, then, some English friend she may have known has left her a bequest, which would
      of course lapse to some one else if she be not living.”</p>
<p>“By gad!” cried Graham, “I think you hit the right nail on the head: c’est cela. But what
      then?”</p>
<p>“Well, if I thought any substantial benefit to Louise Duval might result from the success of
      your inquiry, I would really see if it were in my power to help you. But I must have time to
      consider.”</p>
<p>“How long?”</p>
<p>“I can’t exactly say; perhaps three or four days.”</p>
<p>“Bon! I will wait. Here comes M. Georges. I leave you to dominos and him. Good-night.”</p>
<p>Late that night M. Lebeau was seated alone in a chamber connected with the cabinet in which
      he received visitors. A ledger was open before him, which he scanned with careful eyes, no
      longer screened by spectacles. The survey seemed to satisfy him. He murmured, “It suffices,
      the time has come,” closed the book, returned it to his bureau, which he locked up, and then
      wrote in cipher the letter here reduced into English:—</p>

<l> “DEAR AND NOBLE FRIEND,—Events march; the Empire is everywhere undermined. Our treasury
      has thriven in my hands; the sums subscribed and received by me through you have become more
      than quadrupled by advantageous speculations, in which M. Georges has been a most trustworthy
      agent. A portion of them I have continued to employ in the mode suggested,—namely, in bringing
      together men discreetly chosen as being in their various ways representatives and ringleaders
      of the motley varieties that, when united at the right moment, form a Parisian mob. But from
      that right moment we are as yet distant. Before we can call passion into action, we must
      prepare opinion for change. I propose now to devote no inconsiderable portion of our fund
      towards the inauguration of a journal which shall gradually give voice to our designs. Trust
      me to insure its success, and obtain the aid of writers who will have no notion of the uses to
      which they ultimately contribute. Now that the time has come to establish for ourselves an
      organ in the press, addressing higher orders of intelligence than those which are needed to
      destroy and incapable of reconstructing, the time has also arrived for the reappearance in his
      proper name and rank of the man in whom you take so gracious an interest. In vain you have
      pressed him to do so before; till now he had not amassed together, by the slow process of
      petty gains and constant savings, with such additions as prudent speculations on his own
      account might contribute, the modest means necessary to his resumed position; and as he always
      contended against your generous offers, no consideration should ever tempt him either to
      appropriate to his personal use a single sou intrusted to him for a public purpose, or to
      accept from friendship the pecuniary aid which would abase him into the hireling of a cause.
      No! Victor de Mauleon despises too much the tools that he employs to allow any man hereafter
      to say, ‘Thou also wert a tool, and hast been paid for thy uses.’ “But to restore the victim
      of calumny to his rightful place in this gaudy world, stripped of youth and reduced in
      fortune, is a task that may well seem impossible. To-morrow he takes the first step towards
      the achievement of the impossible. Experience is no bad substitute for youth, and ambition is
      made stronger by the goad of poverty. “Thou shalt hear of his news soon.” </l></quote>
