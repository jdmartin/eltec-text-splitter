<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p>At night, after this final interview with Lebeau, Graham took leave for good of his lodgings
      in Montmartre, and returned to his apartment in the Rue d’Anjou. He spent several hours of the
      next morning in answering numerous letters accumulated during his absence. Late in the
      afternoon he had an interview with M. Renard, who, as at that season of the year he was not
      over-busied with other affairs, engaged to obtain leave to place his services at Graham’s
      command during the time requisite for inquiries at Aix, and to be in readiness to start the
      next day. Graham then went forth to pay one or two farewell visits; and these over, bent his
      way through the Champs Elysees towards Isaura’s villa, when he suddenly encountered
      Rochebriant on horseback. The Marquis courteously dismounted, committing his horse to the care
      of the groom, and linking his arm in Graham’s, expressed his pleasure at seeing him again;
      then, with some visible hesitation and embarrassment, he turned the conversation towards the
      political aspects of France.</p>
<p>“There was,” he said, “much in certain words of yours, when we last walked together in this
      very path, that sank deeply into my mind at the time, and over which I have of late still more
      earnestly reflected. You spoke of the duties a Frenchman owed to France, and the ‘impolicy’ of
      remaining aloof from all public employment on the part of those attached to the Legitimist
      cause.”</p>
<p>“True; it cannot be the policy of any party to forget that between the irrevocable past and
      the uncertain future there intervenes the action of the present time.”</p>
<p>“Should you, as an impartial bystander, consider it dishonourable in me if I entered the
      military service under the ruling sovereign?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not, if your country needed you.”</p>
<p>“And it may, may it not? I hear vague rumours of coming war in almost every salon I
      frequent. There has been gunpowder in the atmosphere we breathe ever since the battle of
      Sadowa. What think you of German arrogance and ambition? Will they suffer the swords of France
      to rust in their scabbards?”</p>
<p>“My dear Marquis, I should incline to put the question otherwise. Will the jealous amour
      propre of France permit the swords of Germany to remain sheathed? But in either case, no
      politician can see without grave apprehension two nations so warlike, close to each other,
      divided by a borderland that one covets and the other will not yield, each armed to the
      teeth,—the one resolved to brook no rival, the other equally determined to resist all
      aggression. And therefore, as you say, war is in the atmosphere; and we may also hear, in the
      clouds that give no sign of dispersion, the growl of the gathering thunder. War may come any
      day; and if France be not at once the victor—”</p>
<p>“France not at once the victor?” interrupted Alain, passionately; “and against a Prussian!
      Permit me to say no Frenchman can believe that.”</p>
<p>“Let no man despise a foe,” said Graham, smiling half sadly. “However, I must not incur the
      danger of wounding your national susceptibilities. To return to the point you raise. If France
      needed the aid of her best and bravest, a true descendant of Henri Quatre ought to blush for
      his ancient noblesse were a Rochebriant to say, ‘But I don’t like the colour of the
      flag.’”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Alain, simply; “that is enough.” There was a pause, the young men walking
      on slowly, arm in arm. And then there flashed across Graham’s mind the recollection of talk on
      another subject in that very path. Here he had spoken to Alain in deprecation of any possible
      alliance with Isaura Cicogna, the destined actress and public; singer. His cheek flushed; his
      heart smote him. What! had he spoken slightingly of her—of her? What if she became his own
      wife? What! had he himself failed in the respect which he would demand as her right from the
      loftiest of his high-born kindred? What, too, would this man, of fairer youth than himself,
      think of that disparaging counsel, when he heard that the monitor had won the prize from which
      he had warned another? Would it not seem that he had but spoken in the mean cunning dictated
      by the fear of a worthier rival? Stung by these thoughts, he arrested his steps, and, looking
      the Marquis full in the face, said, “You remind me of one subject in our talk many weeks
      since; it is my duty to remind you of another. At that time you, and, speaking frankly, I
      myself, acknowledged the charm in the face of a young Italian lady. I told you then that, on
      learning she was intended for the stage, the charm for me had vanished. I said bluntly that it
      should vanish perhaps still more utterly for a noble of your illustrious name; you
      remember?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered Alain, hesitatingly, and with a look of surprise.</p>
<p>“I wish now to retract all I said thereon. Mademoiselle Cicogna is not bent on the
      profession for which she was educated. She would willingly renounce all idea of entering it.
      The only counterweight which, viewed whether by my reason or my prejudices, could be placed in
      the opposite scale to that of the excellences which might make any man proud to win her, is
      withdrawn. I have become acquainted with her since the date of our conversation. Hers is a
      mind which harmonizes with the loveliness of her face. In one word, Marquis, I should deem
      myself honoured, as well as blest, by such a bride. It was due to her that I should say this;
      it was due also to you, in case you should retain the impression I sought in ignorance to
      efface. And I am bound, as a gentleman, to obey this twofold duty, even though in so doing I
      bring upon myself the affliction of a candidate for the hand to which I would fain myself
      aspire,—a candidate with pretensions in every way far superior to my own.”</p>
<p>An older or a more cynical man than Alain de Rochebriant might well have found something
      suspicious in a confession thus singularly volunteered; but the Marquis was himself so loyal
      that he had no doubt of the loyalty of Graham.</p>
<p>“I reply to you,” he said, “with a frankness which finds an example in your own. The first
      fair face which attracted my fancy since my arrival at Paris was that of the Italian
      demoiselle of whom you speak in terms of such respect. I do think if I had then been thrown
      into her society, and found her to be such as you no doubt truthfully describe, that fancy
      might have become a very grave emotion. I was then so poor, so friendless, so despondent! Your
      words of warning impressed me at the time, but less durably than you might suppose; for that
      very night as I sat in my solitary attic I said to myself, ‘Why should I shrink, with an
      obsolete old-world prejudice, from what my forefathers would have termed a mesalliance? What
      is the value of my birthright now? None,—worse than none. It excludes me from all careers; my
      name is but a load that weighs me down. Why should I make that name a curse as well as a
      burden? Nothing is left to me but that which is permitted to all men,—wedded and holy love.
      Could I win to my heart the smile of a woman who brings me that dower, the home of my fathers
      would lose its gloom.’ And therefore, if at that time I had become familiarly acquainted with
      her who had thus attracted my eye and engaged my thoughts, she might have become my destiny;
      but now!”</p>
<p>“But now?”</p>
<p>“Things have changed. I am no longer poor, friendless, solitary. I have entered the world of
      my equals as a Rochebriant; I have made myself responsible for the dignity of my name. I could
      not give that name to one, however peerless in herself, of whom the world would say, ‘But for
      her marriage she would have been a singer on the stage!’ I will own more: the fancy I
      conceived for the first fair face, other fair faces have dispelled. At this moment, however, I
      have no thought of marriage; and having known the anguish of struggle, the privations of
      poverty, I would ask no woman to share the hazard of my return to them. You might present me,
      then, safely to this beautiful Italian,—certain, indeed, that I should be her admirer; equally
      certain that I could not become your rival.”</p>
<p>There was something in this speech that jarred upon Graham’s sensitive pride; but on the
      whole, he felt relieved, both in honour and in heart. After a few more words, the two young
      men shook hands and parted. Alain remounted his horse. The day was now declining. Graham
      hailed a vacant fiacre, and directed the driver to Isaura’s villa.</p>
