<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>Nothing could be simpler than the apartment of the Vicomte de Mauleon, in the second story
      of a quiet old-fashioned street. It had been furnished at small cost out of his savings. Yet,
      on the whole, it evinced the good taste of a man who had once been among the exquisites of the
      polite world. You felt that you were in the apartment of a gentleman, and a gentleman of
      somewhat severe tastes, and of sober matured years. He was sitting the next morning in the
      room which he used as a private study. Along the walls were arranged dwarf bookcases, as yet
      occupied by few books, most of them books of reference, others cheap editions of the French
      classics in prose—no poets, no romance-writers, with a few Latin authors also in
      prose,—Cicero, Sallust, Tacitus. He was engaged at his desk writing,—a book with its leaves
      open before him, “Paul Louis Courier,” that model of political irony and masculine style of
      composition. There was a ring at his door-bell. The Vicomte kept no servant. He rose and
      answered the summons. He recoiled a few paces on recognizing his visitor in M. Hennequin.</p>
<p>The Prefet this time did not withdraw his hand; he extended it, but it was with a certain
      awkwardness and timidity. “I thought it my duty to call on you, Vicomte, thus early, having
      already seen M. Enguerrand de Vandemar. He has shown me the copies of the pieces which were
      inspected by your distinguished kinsmen, and which completely clear you of the charge
      that—grant me your pardon when I say—seemed to me still to remain unanswered when I had the
      honour to meet you last night.”</p>
<p>“It appears to me, Monsieur Hennequin, that you, as an avocat so eminent, might have
      convinced yourself very readily of that fact.”</p>
<p>“Monsieur le Vicomte, I was in Switzerland with my wife at the time of the unfortunate
      affair in which you were involved.”</p>
<p>“But when you returned to Paris, you might perhaps have deigned to make inquiries so
      affecting the honour of one you had called a friend, and for whom you had professed”—De
      Mauleon paused; he disdained to add—“an eternal gratitude.”</p>
<p>Hennequin coloured slightly, but replied with self-possession.</p>
<p>“I certainly did inquire. I did hear that the charge against you with regard to the
      abstraction of the jewels was withdrawn, that you were therefore acquitted by law; but I heard
      also that society did not acquit you, and that, finding this, you had quitted France. Pardon
      me again, no one would listen to me when I attempted to speak on your behalf but now that so
      many years have elapsed, that the story is imperfectly remembered, that relations so
      high-placed receive you so cordially,—now I rejoice to think that you will have no difficulty
      in regaining a social position never really lost, but for a time resigned.”</p>
<p>“I am duly sensible of the friendly joy you express. I was reading the other day in a lively
      author some pleasant remarks on the effects of medisance or calumny upon our impressionable
      Parisian public. ‘If,’ says the writer, ‘I found myself accused of having put the two towers
      of Notre Dame into my waistcoat-pocket I should not dream of defending myself; I should take
      to flight. And,’ adds the writer, ‘if my best friend were under the same accusation, I should
      be so afraid of being considered his accomplice that I should put my best friend outside the
      door.’ Perhaps, Monsieur Hennequin, I was seized with the first alarm. Why should I blame you
      if seized with the second? Happily, this good city of Paris has its reactions. And you can now
      offer me your hand. Paris has by this time discovered that the two towers of Notre Dame are
      not in my pocket.”</p>
<p>There was a pause. De Mauleon had resettled himself at his desk, bending over his papers,
      and his manner seemed to imply that he considered the conversation at an end.</p>
<p>But a pang of shame, of remorse, of tender remembrance, shot across the heart of the
      decorous, worldly, self-seeking man, who owed all that he now was to the ci-devant vaurien
      before him. Again he stretched forth his hand, and this time grasped De Mauleon’s warmly.
      “Forgive me,” he said, feelingly and hoarsely; “forgive me, I was to blame. By character, and
      perhaps by the necessities of my career, I am over-timid to public opinion, public scandal.
      Forgive me. Say if in anything now I can requite, though but slightly, the service I owe
      you.”</p>
<p>De Mauleon looked steadily at the Prefet, and said slowly, “Would you serve me in turn? Are
      you sincere?”</p>
<p>The Prefet hesitated a moment, then answered firmly, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, what I ask of you is a frank opinion,—not as lawyer, not as Prefet, but as a
      man who knows the present state of French society. Give that opinion without respect to my
      feelings one way or other. Let it emanate solely from your practised judgment.”</p>
<p>“Be it so,” said Hennequin, wondering what was to come. De Mauleon resumed, “As you may
      remember, during my former career I had no political ambition. I did not meddle with politics.
      In the troubled times that immediately succeeded the fall of Louis Philippe I was but an
      epicurean looker-on. Grant that, so far as admission to the salons is concerned, I shall
      encounter no difficulty in regaining position; but as regards the Chamber, public life, a
      political career, can I have my fair opening under the Empire? You pause. Answer as you have
      promised, frankly.”</p>
<p>“The difficulties in the way of a political career would be very great.”</p>
<p>“Insuperable?”</p>
<p>“I fear so. Of course, in my capacity of Prefet, I have no small influence in my department
      in support of a Government candidate. But I do not think that the Imperial Government could,
      at this time especially, in which it must be very cautious in selecting its candidates, be
      induced to recommend you. The affair of the jewels would be raked up; your vindication
      disputed, denied; the fact that for so many years you have acquiesced in that charge without
      taking steps to refute it; your antecedents, even apart from that charge; your present want of
      property (M. Enguerrand tells me your income is but moderate); the absence of all previous
      repute in public life. No; relinquish the idea of political contest,—it would expose you to
      inevitable mortifications, to a failure that would even jeopardize the admission to the salons
      which you are now gaining. You could not be a Government candidate.”</p>
<p>“Granted. I may have no desire to be one; but an opposition candidate, one of the Liberal
      party?”</p>
<p>“As an Imperialist,” said Hennequin, smiling gravely, “and holding the office I do, it would
      not become me to encourage a candidate against the Emperor’s Government. But speaking with the
      frankness you solicit, I should say that your chances there are infinitely worse. The
      Opposition are in a pitiful minority,—the most eminent of the Liberals can scarcely gain seats
      for themselves; great local popularity or property, high established repute for established
      patriotism, or proved talents of oratory and statesmanship, are essential qualifications for a
      seat in the Opposition; and even these do not suffice for a third of the persons who possess
      them. Be again what you were before,—the hero of salons remote from the turbulent vulgarity of
      politics.”</p>
<p>“I am answered. Thank you once more. The service I rendered you once is requited now.”</p>
<p>“No, indeed,—no; but will you dine with me quietly today, and allow me to present to you my
      wife and two children, born since we parted? I say to-day, for to-morrow I return to my
      Prefecture.”</p>
<p>“I am infinitely obliged by your invitation, but to-day I dine with the Comte de
      Beauvilliers to meet some of the Corps Diplomatique. I must make good my place in the salons,
      since you so clearly show me that I have no chance of one in the Legislature—unless—”</p>
<p>“Unless what?”</p>
<p>“Unless there happen one of those revolutions in which the scum comes uppermost.”</p>
<p>“No fear of that. The subterranean barracks and railway have ended forever the rise of the
      scum, the reign of the canaille and its barricades.”</p>
<p>“Adieu, my dear Hennequin. My respectful hommages a Madame.”</p>
<p>After that day the writing of Pierre Firmin in “Le Sens Commun,” though still keeping within
      the pale of the law, became more decidedly hostile to the Imperial system, still without
      committing their author to any definite programme of the sort of government that should
      succeed it.</p>
