<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>Yes, celebrities are of rapid growth in the salons of Paris. Far more solid than that of
      Rameau, far more brilliant than that of De Mauleon, was the celebrity which Isaura had now
      acquired. She had been unable to retain the pretty suburban villa at A———. The owner wanted to
      alter and enlarge it for his own residence, and she had been persuaded by Signora Venosta, who
      was always sighing for fresh salons to conquer, to remove (towards the close of the previous
      year) to apartments in the centre of the Parisian beau monde. Without formally professing to
      receive, on one evening in the week her salon was open to those who had eagerly sought her
      acquaintance—comprising many stars in the world of fashion, as well as those in the world of
      art and letters. And as she had now wholly abandoned the idea of the profession for which her
      voice had been cultivated, she no longer shrank from the exercise of her surpassing gift of
      song for the delight of private friends. Her physician had withdrawn the interdict on such
      exercise. His skill, aided by the rich vitality of her constitution, had triumphed over all
      tendencies to the malady for which he had been consulted. To hear Isaura Cicogna sing in her
      own house was a privilege sought and prized by many who never read a word of her literary
      compositions. A good critic of a book is rare; but good judges of a voice are numberless.
      Adding this attraction of song to her youth, her beauty, her frank powers of converse—an
      innocent sweetness of manner free from all conventional affectation—and to the fresh novelty
      of a genius which inspired the young with enthusiast and beguiled the old to indulgence, it
      was no wonder that Isaura became a celebrity at Paris.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a wonder that her head was not turned by the adulation that surrounded her.
      But I believe, be it said with diffidence, that a woman of mind so superior that the mind
      never pretends to efface the heart, is less intoxicated with flattery than a man equally
      exposed to it.</p>
<p>It is the strength of her heart that keeps her head sober. Isaura had never yet overcome her
      first romance of love; as yet, amid all her triumphs, there was not a day in which her
      thoughts did not wistfully, mournfully, fly back to those blessed moments in which she felt
      her cheek colour before a look, her heart beat at the sound of a footfall. Perhaps if there
      had been the customary finis to this young romance—the lover’s deliberate renunciation, his
      formal farewell—the girl’s pride would ere this have conquered her affection,—possibly—who
      knows?—replaced it.</p>
<p>But, reader, be you male or female, have you ever known this sore trial of affection and
      pride, that from some cause or other, to you mysterious, the dear intercourse to which you had
      accustomed the secret life of your life, abruptly ceases; you know that a something has come
      between you and the beloved which you cannot distinguish, cannot measure, cannot guess, and
      therefore cannot surmount; and you say to yourself at the dead of solitary night, “Oh for an
      explanation! Oh for one meeting more! All might be so easily set right; or if not, I should
      know the worst, and knowing it, could conquer!”</p>
<p>This trial was Isaura’s. There had been no explanation, no last farewell between her and
      Graham. She divined—no woman lightly makes a mistake there—that he loved her! She knew that
      this dread something had intervened between her and him when he took leave of her before
      others so many months ago; that this dread something still continued—what was it? She was
      certain that it would vanish, could they but once meet again and not before others. Oh for
      such a meeting!</p>
<p>She could not herself destroy hope. She could not marry another. She would have no heart to
      give to another while he was free, while in doubt if his heart was still her own. And thus her
      pride did not help her to conquer her affection.</p>
<p>Of Graham Vane she heard occasionally. He had ceased to correspond with Savarin; but among
      those who most frequented her salon were the Morleys. Americans so well educated and so well
      placed as the Morleys knew something about every Englishman of the social station of Graham
      Vane. Isaura learned from them that Graham, after a tour on the Continent, had returned to
      England at the commencement of the year, had been invited to stand for Parliament, had
      refused, that his name was in the list published by the Morning Post of the elite whose
      arrivals in London, or whose presence at dinner-tables, is recorded as an event. That the
      Athenaeum had mentioned a rumour that Graham Vane was the author of a political pamphlet
      which, published anonymously, had made no inconsiderable sensation. Isaura sent to England for
      that pamphlet: the subject was somewhat dry, and the style, though clear and vigorous, was
      scarcely of the eloquence which wins the admiration of women; and yet she learned every word
      of it by heart.</p>
<p>We know how little she dreamed that the celebrity which she hailed as an approach to him was
      daily making her more remote. The sweet labours she undertook for that celebrity continued to
      be sweetened yet more by secret associations with the absent one. How many of the passages
      most admired could never have been written had he been never known!</p>
<p>And she blessed those labours the more that they upheld her from the absolute feebleness of
      sickened reverie, beguiled her from the gnawing torture of unsatisfied conjecture. She did
      comply with Madame de Grantmesnil’s command—did pass from the dusty beaten road of life into
      green fields and along flowery river-banks, and did enjoy that ideal by-world.</p>
<p>But still the one image which reigned over her human heart moved beside her in the gardens
      of fairyland.</p>
