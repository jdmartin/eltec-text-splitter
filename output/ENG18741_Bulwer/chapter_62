<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>The Marquis de Rochebriant was seated in his pleasant apartment, glancing carelessly at the
      envelopes of many notes and letters lying yet unopened on his breakfast-table. He had risen
      late at noon, for he had not gone to bed till dawn. The night had been spent at his club—over
      the card-table—by no means to the pecuniary advantage of the Marquis. The reader will have
      learned, through the conversation recorded in a former chapter between De Mauleon and
      Enguerrand de Vandemar, that the austere Seigneur Breton had become a fast viveur of Paris. He
      had long since spent the remnant of Louvier’s premium of L10,000., and he owed a year’s
      interest. For this last there was an excuse. M. Collot, the contractor to whom he had been
      advised to sell the yearly fall of his forest-trees, had removed the trees, but had never paid
      a sou beyond the preliminary deposit; so that the revenue, out of which the mortgagee should
      be paid his interest, was not forthcoming. Alain had instructed M. Hebert to press the
      contractor; the contractor had replied, that if not pressed he could soon settle all claims—if
      pressed, he must declare himself bankrupt. The Chevalier de Finisterre had laughed at the
      alarm which Alain conceived when he first found himself in the condition of debtor for a sum
      he could not pay—creditor for a sum he could not recover.</p>
<p>“Bagatelle!” said the Chevalier. “Tschu! Collot, if you give him time, is as safe as the
      Bank of France, and Louvier knows it. Louvier will not trouble you—Louvier, the best fellow in
      the world! I’ll call on him and explain matters.”</p>
<p>It is to be presumed that the Chevalier did so explain; for though both at the first, and
      quite recently at the second default of payment, Alain received letters from M. Louvier’s
      professional agent, as reminders of interest due, and as requests for its payment, the
      Chevalier assured him that these applications were formalities of convention—that Louvier, in
      fact, knew nothing about them; and when dining with the great financier himself, and cordially
      welcomed and called “Mon cher,” Alain had taken him aside and commenced explanation and
      excuse, Louvier had cut him short. “Peste! don’t mention such trifles. There is such a thing
      as business—that concerns my agent; such a thing as friendship—that concerns me. Allez!”</p>
<p>Thus M. de Rochebriant, confiding in debtor and in creditor, had suffered twelve months to
      glide by without much heed of either, and more than live up to an income amply sufficient
      indeed for the wants of an ordinary bachelor, but needing more careful thrift than could well
      be expected from the head of one of the most illustrious houses in France, cast so young into
      the vortex of the most expensive capital in the world.</p>
<p>The poor Marquis glided into the grooves that slant downward, much as the French Marquis of
      tradition was wont to glide; not that he appeared to live extravagantly, but he needed all he
      had for his pocket-money, and had lost that dread of being in debt which he had brought up
      from the purer atmosphere of Bretagne.</p>
<p>But there were some debts which; of course, a Rochebriant must pay—debts of honour—and Alain
      had, on the previous night, incurred such a debt and must pay it that day. He had been
      strongly tempted, when the debt rose to the figure it had attained, to risk a change of luck;
      but whatever his imprudence, he was incapable of dishonesty. If the luck did not change, and
      he lost more, he would be without means to meet his obligations. As the debt now stood, he
      calculated that he could just discharge it by the sale of his coupe and horses. It is no
      wonder he left his letters unopened, however charming they might be; he was quite sure they
      would contain no cheque which would enable him to pay his debt and retain his equipage.</p>
<p>The door opened, and the valet announced M. le Chevalier de Finisterre—a man with smooth
      countenance and air distinque, a pleasant voice and perpetual smile.</p>
<p>“Well, mon cher,” cried the Chevalier, “I hope that you recovered the favour of Fortune
      before you quitted her green table last night. When I left she seemed very cross with
      you.”</p>
<p>“And so continued to the end,” answered Alain, with well-simulated gaiety—much too bon
      gentilhomme to betray rage or anguish for pecuniary loss.</p>
<p>“After all,” said de Finisterre, lighting his cigarette, “the uncertain goddess could not do
      you much harm; the stakes were small, and your adversary, the Prince, never goes double or
      quits.”</p>
<p>“Nor I either. ‘Small,’ however, is a word of relative import; the stakes might be small to
      you, to me large. Entre nous, cher ami, I am at the end of my purse, and I have only this
      consolation-I am cured of play: not that I leave the complaint, the complaint leaves me; it
      can no more feed on me than a fever can feed on a skeleton.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“As serious as a mourner who has just buried his all.”</p>
<p>“His all? Tut, with such an estate as Rochebriant!”</p>
<p>For the first time in that talk Alain’s countenance became overcast.</p>
<p>“And how long will Rochebriant be mine? You know that I hold it at the mercy of the
      mortgagee, whose interest has not been paid, and who could if, he so pleased, issue notice,
      take proceedings—that—”</p>
<p>“Peste!” interrupted de Finisterre; “Louvier take proceedings! Louvier, the best fellow in
      the world! But don’t I see his handwriting on that envelope? No doubt an invitation to
      dinner.”</p>
<p>Alain took up the letter thus singled forth from a miscellany of epistles, some in female
      handwritings, unsealed but ingeniously twisted into Gordian knots—some also in female
      handwritings, carefully sealed—others in ill-looking envelopes, addressed in bold, legible,
      clerk-like caligraphy. Taken altogether, these epistles had a character in common; they
      betokened the correspondence of a viveur, regarded from the female side as young, handsome,
      well-born—on the male side, as a viveur who had forgotten to pay his hosier and tailor.</p>
<p>Louvier wrote a small, not very intelligible, but very masculine hand, as most men who think
      cautiously and act promptly do write. The letter ran thus:</p>
<p>“Cher petit Marquis” (at that commencement Alain haughtily raised his head and bit his
      lips).</p>
<quote>
<l> “CHER PETIT MARQUIS,—It is an age since I have seen you. No doubt my humble soirees are
      too dull for a beau seigueur so courted. I forgive you. Would I were a beau seigneur at your
      age! Alas! I am only a commonplace man of business, growing old, too. Aloft from the world in
      which I dwell, you can scarcely be aware that I have embarked a great part of my capital in
      building speculations. There is a Rue de Louvier that runs its drains right through my purse.
      I am obliged to call in the moneys due to me. My agent informs me that I am just 7000 louis
      short of the total I need—all other debts being paid in—and that there is a trifle more than
      7000 louis owned to me as interest on my hypotheque on Rochebriant: kindly pay into his hands
      before the end of this week that sum. You have been too lenient to Collot, who must owe you
      more than that. Send agent to him. Desole to trouble you, and am au desespoir to think that my
      own pressing necessities compel me to urge you to take so much trouble. Mais que faire? The
      Rue de Louvier stops the way, and I must leave it to my agent to clear it. “Accept all my
      excuses, with the assurance of my sentiments the most cordial. PAUL LOUVIER.” </l></quote>
<p>Alain tossed the letter to De Finisterre. “Read that from the best fellow in the world.”</p>
<p>The Chevalier laid down his cigarette and read. “Diable!” he said, when he returned the
      letter and resumed the cigarette—“Diable! Louvier must be much pressed for money, or he would
      not have written in this strain. What does it matter? Collot owes you more than 7000 louis.
      Let your lawyer get them, and go to sleep with both ears on your pillow.”</p>
<p>“Ah! you think Collot can pay if he will?”</p>
<p>“Ah! foi! did not M. Gandrin tell you that M. Collot was safe to buy your wood at more money
      than any one else would give?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said Alain, comforted. “Gandrin left that impression on my mind. I will set him
      on the man. All will come right, I dare say; but if it does not come right, what would Louvier
      do?”</p>
<p>“Louvier do!” answered Finisterre, reflectively. “Well do you ask my opinion and
      advice?”</p>
<p>“Earnestly, I ask.”</p>
<p>“Honestly, then, I answer. I am a little on the Bourse myself—most Parisians are. Louvier
      has made a gigantic speculation in this new street, and with so many other irons in the fire
      he must want all the money he can get at. I dare say that if you do not pay him what you owe,
      he must leave it to his agent to take steps for announcing the sale of Rochebriant. But he
      detests scandal; he hates the notion of being severe; rather than that, in spite of his
      difficulties, he will buy Rochebriant of you at a better price than it can command at public
      sale. Sell it to him. Appeal to him to act generously, and you will flatter him. You will get
      more than the old place is worth. Invest the surplus—live as you have done, or better—and
      marry an heiress. Morbleu! a Marquis de Rochebriant, if he were sixty years old, would rank
      high in the matrimonial market. The more the democrats have sought to impoverish titles and
      laugh down historical names, the more do rich democrat fathers-in-law seek to decorate their
      daughters with titles and give their grandchildren the heritage of historical names. You look
      shocked, pauvre anti. Let us hope, then, that Collot will pay. Set your dog—I mean your
      lawyer—at him; seize him by the throat!”</p>
<p>Before Alain had recovered from the stately silence with which he had heard this very
      practical counsel, the valet again appeared, and ushered in M. Frederic Lemercier.</p>
<p>There was no cordial acquaintance between the visitors. Lemercier was chafed at finding
      himself supplanted in Alain’s intimate companionship by so new a friend, and De Finisterre
      affected to regard Lemercier as a would-be exquisite of low birth and bad taste.</p>
<p>Alain, too, was a little discomposed at the sight of Lemercier, remembering the wise
      cautious which that old college friend had wasted on him at the commencement of his Parisian
      career, and smitten with vain remorse that the cautions had been so arrogantly slighted.</p>
<p>It was with some timidity that he extended his hand to Frederic, and he was surprised as
      well as moved by the more than usual warmth with which it was grasped by the friend he had
      long neglected. Such affectionate greeting was scarcely in keeping with the pride which
      characterised Frederic Lemercier.</p>
<p>“Ma foi!” said the Chevalier, glancing towards the clock, “how time flies! I had no idea it
      was so late. I must leave you now, my dear Rochebriant. Perhaps we shall meet at the club
      later—I dine there to-day. Au plaisir, M. Lemercier.”</p>
