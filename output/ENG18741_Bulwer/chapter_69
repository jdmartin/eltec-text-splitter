<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>There is somewhere in Lord Lytton’s writings—writings so numerous that I may be pardoned if
      I cannot remember where-a critical definition of the difference between dramatic and narrative
      art of story, instanced by that marvellous passage in the loftiest of Sir Walter Scott’s
      works, in which all the anguish of Ravenswood on the night before he has to meet Lucy’s
      brother in mortal combat is conveyed without the spoken words required in tragedy. It is only
      to be conjectured by the tramp of his heavy boots to and fro all the night long in his
      solitary chamber, heard below by the faithful Caleb. The drama could not have allowed that
      treatment; the drama must have put into words, as “soliloquy,” agonies which the non-dramatic
      narrator knows that no soliloquy can describe. Humbly do I imitate, then, the great master of
      narrative in declining to put into words the conflict between love and reason that tortured
      the heart of Graham Vane when, dropping noiselessly the letter I have just transcribed, he
      covered his face with his hands and remained—I know not how long—in the same position, his
      head bowed, not a sound escaping from his lips.</p>
<p>He did not stir from his rooms that day; and had there been a Caleb’s faithful ear to
      listen, his tread, too, might have been heard all that sleepless night passing to and fro, but
      pausing oft, along his solitary floors.</p>
<p>Possibly love would have borne down all opposing seasonings, doubts, and prejudices, but for
      incidents that occurred the following evening. On that evening Graham dined en famille with
      his cousins the Altons. After dinner, the Duke produced the design for a cenotaph inscribed to
      the memory of his aunt, Lady Janet King, which he proposed to place in the family chapel at
      Alton.</p>
<p>“I know,” said the Duke, kindly, “you would wish the old house from which she sprang to
      preserve some such record of her who loved you as her son; and even putting you out of the
      question, it gratifies me to attest the claim of our family to a daughter who continues to be
      famous for her goodness, and made the goodness so lovable that envy forgave it for being
      famous. It was a pang to me when poor Richard King decided on placing her tomb among
      strangers; but in conceding his rights as to her resting-place, I retain mine to her
      name,—Nostris liberis virtutis exemplar.”</p>
<p>Graham wrung his cousin’s hand-he could not speak, choked by suppressed tears.</p>
<p>The Duchess, who loved and honoured Lady Janet almost as much as did her husband, fairly
      sobbed aloud. She had, indeed, reason for grateful memories of the deceased: there had been
      some obstacles to her marriage with the man who had won her heart, arising from political
      differences and family feuds between their parents, which the gentle meditation of Lady Janet
      had smoothed away. And never did union founded on mutual and ardent love more belie the
      assertions of the great Bichat (esteemed by Dr. Buckle the finest intellect which practical
      philosophy has exhibited since Aristotle), that “Love is a sort of fever which does not last
      beyond two years,” than that between those eccentric specimens of a class denounced as
      frivolous and artless by philosophers, English and French, who have certainly never heard of
      Bichat.</p>
<p>When the emotion the Duke had exhibited was calmed down, his wife pushed towards Graham a
      sheet of paper, inscribed with the epitaph composed by his hand. “Is it not beautiful,” she
      said, falteringly—“not a word too much or too little?”</p>
<p>Graham read the inscription slowly, and with very dimmed eyes. It deserved the praise
      bestowed on it; for the Duke, though a shy and awkward speaker, was an incisive and graceful
      writer.</p>
<p>Yet, in his innermost self, Graham shivered when he read that epitaph, it expressed so
      emphatically the reverential nature of the love which Lady Janet had inspired—the genial
      influences which the holiness of a character so active in doing good had diffused around it.
      It brought vividly before Graham that image of perfect spotless womanhood. And a voice within
      him asked, “Would that cenotaph be placed amid the monuments of an illustrious lineage if the
      secret known to thee could transpire? What though the lost one were really as unsullied by sin
      as the world deems, would the name now treasured as an heirloom not be a memory of gall and a
      sound of shame?”</p>
<p>He remained so silent after putting down the inscription, that the Duke said modestly: “My
      dear Graham, I see that you do not like what I have written. Your pen is much more practised
      than mine. If I did not ask you to compose the epitaph, it was because I thought it would
      please you more in coming, as a spontaneous tribute due to her, from the representative of her
      family. But will you correct my sketch, or give me another according to your own ideas?”</p>
<p>“I see not a word to alter,” said Graham; “forgive me if my silence wronged my emotion; the
      truest eloquence is that which holds us too mute for applause.”</p>
<p>“I knew you would like it. Leopold is always so disposed to underrate himself,” said the
      duchess, whose hand was resting fondly on her husband’s shoulder. “Epitaphs are so difficult
      to write-especially epitaphs on women of whom in life the least said the better. Janet was the
      only woman I ever knew whom one could praise in safety.”</p>
<p>“Well expressed,” said the Duke, smiling: “and I wish you would make that safety clear to
      some lady friends of yours, to whom it might serve as a lesson. Proof against every breath of
      scandal herself, Janet King never uttered and never encouraged one ill-natured word against
      another. But I am afraid, my dear fellow, that I must leave you to a tete-a-tete with Eleanor.
      You know that I must be at the House this evening—I only paired till half-past nine.”</p>
<p>“I will walk down to the House with you, if you are going on foot.”</p>
<p>“No,” said the Duchess; “you must resign yourself to me for at least half an hour. I was
      looking over your aunt’s letters to-day, and I found one which I wish to show you; it is all
      about yourself, and written within the last few months of her life.” Here she put her arm into
      Graham’s, and led him into her own private drawing-room, which, though others might call it a
      boudoir, she dignified by the name of her study. The Duke remained for some minutes
      thoughtfully leaning his arm on the mantelpiece. It was no unimportant debate in the Lords
      that night, and on a subject in which he took great interest, and the details of which he had
      thoroughly mastered. He had been requested to speak, if only a few words, for his high
      character and his reputation for good sense gave weight to the mere utterance of his opinion.
      But though no one had more moral courage in action, the Duke had a terror at the very thought
      of addressing an audience, which made him despise himself.</p>
<p>“Ah!” he muttered, “if Graham Vane were but in Parliament, I could trust him to say exactly
      what I would rather be swallowed up by an earthquake than stand up and say for myself. But now
      he has got money he seems to think of nothing but saving it.”</p>
