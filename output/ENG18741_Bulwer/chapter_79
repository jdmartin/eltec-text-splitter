<p>When they were alone, Madame Rameau took Isaura’s hand in both her own, and, gazing
      wistfully into her face, said, “No wonder you are so loved—yours is the beauty that sinks into
      the hearts and rests there. I prize my boy more, now that I have seen you. But, oh,
      Mademoiselle! pardon me—do not withdraw your hand—pardon the mother who comes from the
      sick-bed of her only son and asks if you will assist to save him! A word from you is life or
      death to him!”</p>
<p>“Nay, nay, do not speak thus, Madame; your son knows how much I value, how sincerely I
      return, his friendship; but—but,” she paused a moment, and continued sadly and with tearful
      eyes—“I have no heart to give to him-to any one.”</p>
<p>“I do not—I would not if I dared—ask what it would be violence to yourself to promise. I do
      not ask you to bid me return to my son and say, ‘Hope and recover,’ but let me take some
      healing message from your lips. If I understand your words rightly, I at least may say that
      you do not give to another the hopes you, deny to him?”</p>
<p>“So far you understand me rightly, Madame. It has been said, that romance-writers give away
      so much of their hearts to heroes or heroines of their own creation, that they leave nothing
      worth the giving to human beings like themselves. Perhaps it is so; yet, Madame,” added
      Isaura, with a smile of exquisite sweetness in its melancholy, “I have heart enough left to
      feel for you.”</p>
<p>Madame Rameau was touched. “Ah, Mademoiselle, I do not believe in the saying you have
      quoted. But I must not abuse your goodness by pressing further upon you subjects from which
      you shrink. Only one word more: you know that my husband and I are but quiet tradesfolks, not
      in the society, nor aspiring to it, to which my son’s talents have raised himself; yet dare I
      ask that you will not close here the acquaintance that I have obtruded on you?—dare I ask,
      that I may, now and then, call on you—that now and then I may see you at my own home? Believe
      that I would not here ask anything which your own mother would disapprove if she overlooked
      disparities of station. Humble as our home is, slander never passed its threshold.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Madame, I and the Signora Venosta, whom in our Italian tongue I call mother, can but
      feel honoured and grateful whenever it pleases you to receive visits from us.”</p>
<p>“It would be a base return for such gracious compliance with my request if I concealed from
      you the reason why I pray Heaven to bless you for that answer. The physician says that it may
      be long before my son is sufficiently convalescent to dispense with a mother’s care, and
      resume his former life and occupation in the great world. It is everything for us if we can
      coax him into coming under our own roof-tree. This is difficult to do. It is natural for a
      young man launched into the world to like his own chez lui. Then what will happen to Gustave?
      He, lonely and heart-stricken, will ask friends, young as himself, but far stronger, to come
      and cheer him; or he will seek to distract his thoughts by the overwork of his brain; in
      either case he is doomed. But I have stronger motives yet to fix him a while at our hearth.
      This is just the moment, once lost never to be regained, when soothing companionship, gentle
      reproachless advice, can fix him lastingly in the habits and modes of life which will banish
      all fears of his future from the hearts of his parents. You at least honour him with
      friendship, with kindly interest—you at least would desire to wean him from all that a friend
      may disapprove or lament—a creature whom Providence meant to be good, and perhaps great. If I
      say to him, ‘It will be long before you can go out and see your friends, but at my house your
      friends shall come and see you—among them Signora Venosta and Mademoiselle Cicogna will now
      and then drop in’—my victory is gained, and my son is saved.”</p>
<p>“Madame,” said Isaura, half sobbing, “what a blessing to have a mother like you! Love so
      noble ennobles those who hear its voice. Tell your son how ardently I wish him to be well, and
      to fulfil more than the promise of his genius; tell him also this—how I envy him his
      mother.”</p>
