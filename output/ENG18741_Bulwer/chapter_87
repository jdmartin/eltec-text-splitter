<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>All the earlier part of that next day, Graham Vane remained in-doors—a lovely day at Paris
      that 8th of July, and with that summer day all hearts at Paris were in unison. Discontent was
      charmed into enthusiasm—Belleville and Montmartre forgot the visions of Communism and
      Socialism and other “isms” not to be realised except in some undiscovered Atlantis!</p>
<p>The Emperor was the idol of the day—the names of Jules Favre and Gambetta were by-words of
      scorn. Even Armand Monnier, still out of work, beginning to feel the pinch of want, and fierce
      for any revolution that might turn topsy-turvy the conditions of labour,—even Armand Monnier
      was found among groups that were laying immortelles at the foot of the column in the Place
      Vendome, and heard to say to a fellow malcontent, with eyes uplifted to the statue of the
      First Napoleon, “Do you not feel at this moment that no Frenchman can be long angry with the
      Little Corporal? He denied La Liberte, but he gave La Gloire.”</p>
<p>Heeding not the stir of the world without, Graham was compelling into one resolve the doubts
      and scruples which had so long warred against the heart which they ravaged, but could not
      wholly subdue.</p>
<p>The conversations with Mrs. Morley and Rochebriant had placed in a light in which he had not
      before regarded it, the image of Isaura.</p>
<p>He had reasoned from the starting-point of his love for her, and had sought to convince
      himself that against that love it was his duty to strive.</p>
<p>But now a new question was addressed to his conscience as well as to his heart. What though
      he had never formally declared to her his affection—never, in open words, wooed her as his
      own—never even hinted to her the hopes of a union which at one time he had fondly
      entertained,—still was it true that his love had been too transparent not to be detected by
      her, and not to have led her on to return it?</p>
<p>Certainly he had, as we know, divined that he was not indifferent to her: at Enghien, a year
      ago, that he had gained her esteem, and perhaps interested her fancy.</p>
<p>We know also how he had tried to persuade himself that the artistic temperament, especially
      when developed in women, is too elastic to suffer the things of real life to have lasting
      influence over happiness or sorrow,—that in the pursuits in which her thought and imagination
      found employ, in the excitement they sustained, and the fame to which they conduced, Isaura
      would be readily consoled for a momentary pang of disappointed affection. And that a man so
      alien as himself, both by nature and by habit, from the artistic world, was the very last
      person who could maintain deep and permanent impression on her actual life or her ideal
      dreams. But what if, as he gathered from the words of the fair American—what if, in all these
      assumptions, she was wholly mistaken? What if, in previously revealing his own heart, he had
      decoyed hers—what if, by a desertion she had no right to anticipate, he had blighted her
      future? What if this brilliant child of genius could love as warmly, as deeply, as enduringly
      as any simple village girl to whom there is no poetry except love? If this were so—what became
      the first claim on his honour, his conscience, his duty?</p>
<p>The force which but a few days ago his reasonings had given to the arguments that forbade
      him to think of Isaura, became weaker and weaker, as now in an altered mood of reflection he
      resummoned and reweighed them.</p>
<p>All those prejudices—which had seemed to him such rational common-sense truths, when
      translated from his own mind into the words of Lady Janet’s letter,—was not Mrs. Morley right
      in denouncing them as the crotchets of an insolent egotism? Was it not rather to the favour
      than to the disparagement of Isaura, regarded even in the man’s narrow-minded view of woman’s
      dignity, that this orphan girl could, with character so unscathed, pass through the trying
      ordeal of the public babble, the public gaze-command alike the esteem of a woman so pure as
      Mrs. Morley, the reverence of a man so chivalrously sensitive to honour as Alain de
      Rochebriant?</p>
<p>Musing thus, Graham’s countenance at last brightened—a glorious joy entered into and
      possessed him. He felt as a man who had burst asunder the swathes and trammels which had kept
      him galled and miserable with the sense of captivity, and from which some wizard spell that
      took strength from his own superstition had forbidden to struggle.</p>
<p>He was free!—and that freedom was rapture!—yes, his resolve was taken.</p>
<p>The day was now far advanced. He should have just time before the dinner with Duplessis to
      drive to A———, where he still supposed Isaura resided. How, as his fiacre rolled along the
      well-remembered road—how completely he lived in that world of romance of which he denied
      himself to be a denizen.</p>
<p>Arrived at the little villa, he found it occupied only by workmen—it was under repair. No
      one could tell him to what residence the ladies who occupied it the last year had removed.</p>
<p>“I shall learn from Mrs. Morley,” thought Graham, and at her house he called in going back,
      but Mrs. Morley was not at home; he had only just time, after regaining his apartment, to
      change his dress for the dinner to which he was invited. As it was, he arrived late, and while
      apologising to his host for his want of punctuality, his tongue faltered. At the farther end
      of the room he saw a face, paler and thinner than when he had seen it last—a face across which
      a something of grief had gone.</p>
<p>The servant announced that dinner was served.</p>
<p>“Mr. Vane,” said Duplessis, “will you take into dinner Mademoiselle Cicogna?”</p>
