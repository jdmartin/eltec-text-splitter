<t:head>CHAPTER V. — BOSCOBEL.</t:head>
<t:p>Two days and two nights passed without fear of fire, and then Harry Heathcote was again on
     the alert. The earth was parched as though no drop of rain had fallen. The fences were dry as
     tinder, and the ground was strewed with broken atoms of timber from the trees, each of which a
     spark would ignite. Two nights Harry slept in his bed, but on the third he was on horseback
     about the run, watching, thinking, endeavoring to make provision, directing others, and hoping
     to make it believed that his eyes were every where. In this way an entire week was passed, and
     now it wanted but four days to Christmas. He would come home to breakfast about seven in the
     morning, very tired, but never owning that he was tired, and then sleep heavily for an hour or
     two in a chair. After that he would go out again on the run, would sleep perhaps for another
     hour after dinner, and then would start for his night’s patrol. During this week he saw nothing
     of Medlicot, and never mentioned his name but once. On that occasion his wife told him that
     during his absence Medlicot had been at the station.</t:p>
<t:p>“What brought him here?” Harry asked, fiercely.</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Heathcote explained that he had called in a friendly way, and had said that if there
     were any fear of fire he would be happy himself to lend assistance.</t:p>
<t:p>Then the young squatter forgot himself in his wrath. “Confound his hypocrisy!” said Harry,
     aloud. “I don’t think he’s a hypocrite,” said the wife.</t:p>
<t:p>“I’m sure he’s not,” said Kate Daly.</t:p>
<t:p>Not a word more was spoken, and Harry immediately left the house. The two women did not as
     usual go to the gate to see him mount his horse, not refraining from doing so in any anger, or
     as wishing to exhibit displeasure at Harry’s violence, but because they were afraid of him.
     They had found themselves compelled to differ from him, but were oppressed at finding
     themselves in opposition to him.</t:p>
<t:p>The feeling that his wife should in any way take part against him added greatly to
     Heathcote’s trouble. It produced in his mind a terrible feeling of loneliness in his sorrow. He
     bore a brave outside to all his men, and to any stranger whom in these days he met about the
     run—to his wife and sister also, and to the old woman at home. He forced upon them all an idea
     that he was not only autocratic, but self-sufficient also—that he wanted neither help nor
     sympathy. He never cried out in his pain, being heartily ashamed even of the appeal which he
     had made to Medlicot. He spoke aloud and laughed with the men, and never acknowledged that his
     trials were almost too much for him. But he was painfully conscious of his own weakness. He
     sometimes felt, when alone in the bush, that he would fain get off his horse, and lie upon the
     ground and weep till he slept. It was not that he trusted no one. He suspected no one with a
     positive suspicion, except Nokes, and Medlicot as the supporter of Nokes. But he had no one
     with whom he could converse freely—none whom he had not been accustomed to treat as the mere
     ministers of his will—except his wife and his wife’s sister; and now he was disjoined from them
     by their sympathy with Medlicot! He had chosen to manage every thing himself without
     contradiction and almost without counsel; but, like other such imperious masters, he now found
     that when trouble came the privilege of dictatorship brought with it an almost unsupportable
     burden.</t:p>
<t:p>Old Bates was an excellent man, of whose fidelity the young squatter was quite assured. No
     one understood foot-rot better than Old Bates, or was less sparing of himself in curing it. He
     was a second mother to all the lambs, and when shearing came watched with the eyes of Argus to
     see that the sheep were not wounded by the shearers, or the wool left on their backs. But he
     had no conversation, none of that imagination which in such a time as this might have assisted
     in devising safeguards, and but little enthusiasm. Shepherds, so called, Harry kept none upon
     the run; and would have felt himself insulted had any one suggested that he was so backward in
     his ways as to employ men of that denomination. He had fenced his run, and dispensed with
     shepherds and shepherding as old-fashioned and unprofitable. He had two mounted men, whom he
     called boundary riders, one an Irishman and the other a German—and them he trusted fully, the
     German altogether, and the Irishman equally as regarded his honesty. But he could not explain
     to them the thoughts that loaded his brain. He could instigate them to eagerness; but he could
     not condescend to tell Karl Bender, the German, that if his fences were destroyed neither his
     means nor his credit would be sufficient to put them up again, and that if the scanty herbage
     were burned off any large proportion of his run, he must sell his flocks at a great sacrifice.
     Nor could he explain to Mickey O’Dowd, the Irishman, that his peace of mind was destroyed by
     his fear of one man. He had to bear it all alone. And there was heavy on him also the great
     misery of feeling that every thing might depend on own exertions, and that yet he did not know
     how or where to exert himself. When he had ridden about all night and discovered nothing, he
     might just as well have been in bed. And he was continually riding about all night and
     discovering nothing.</t:p>
<t:p>After leaving the station on the evening of the day on which he had expressed himself to the
     women so vehemently respecting Medlicot, he met Bates coming home from his day’s work. It was
     then past eight o’clock, and the old man was sitting wearily on his horse, with his head low
     down between his shoulders, and the reins hardly held within his grasp.</t:p>
<t:p>“You’re late, Mr. Bates,” said Harry; “you take too much out of yourself this hot
     weather.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I’ve got to move slower, Mr. Heathcote, as I grow older. That’s about it. And the beast I’m
     on is not much good.” Now Mr. Bates was always complaining of his horse, and yet was allowed to
     choose any on the run for his own use.</t:p>
<t:p>“If you don’t like him, why don’t you take another?”</t:p>
<t:p>“There ain’t much difference in ’em, Mr. Heathcote. Better the devil you know than the devil
     you don’t. It’s getting uncommon close shaving for them wethers in the new paddock. They’re
     down upon the roots pretty well already.”</t:p>
<t:p>“There’s grass along the bush on the north side.”</t:p>
<t:p>“They won’t go there; it’s rank and sour. They won’t feed up there as long as they can live
     lower down and nearer the water. Weather like this, they’d sooner die near the water than
     travel to fill their bellies. It’s about the hottest day we’ve had, and the nights a’most
     hotter. Are you going to be out, Mr. Heathcote?”</t:p>
<t:p>“I think so.”</t:p>
<t:p>“What’s the good of it, Mr. Heathcote? There is no use in it. Lord love you, what can yon do?
     You can’t be every side at once.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Fire can only travel with the wind, Mr. Bates.”</t:p>
<t:p>“And there isn’t any wind, and so there can’t be any fire. I never did think, and I don’t
     think now, there ever was any use in a man fashing himself as you fash yourself. You can’t
     alter things, Mr. Heathcote.”</t:p>
<t:p>“But that’s just what I can do—what a man has to do. If a match were thrown there at your
     feet, and the grass was aflame, couldn’t you alter that by putting your foot on it? If you find
     a ewe on her back, can’t you alter that by putting her on her legs?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes, I can do that, I suppose.”</t:p>
<t:p>“What does a man live for except to alter things? When a man clears the forest and sows corn,
     does he not alter things?”</t:p>
<t:p>“That’s not your line, Mr. Heathcote,” said the cunning old man.</t:p>
<t:p>“If I send wool to market, I alter things.”</t:p>
<t:p>“You’ll excuse me, Mr. Heathcote. Of course I’m old, but I just give you my experience.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I’m much obliged to you; though we can’t always agree, you know. Good-night. Go in and say a
     word to my wife, and tell them you saw me all right.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I’ll have a crack with ’em, Mr. Heathcote, before I turn in.”</t:p>
<t:p>“And tell Mary I sent my love.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I will, Mr. Heathcote; I will.”</t:p>
<t:p>He was thinking always of his wife during his solitary rides, and of her fear and deep
     anxiety. It was for her sake and for the children that he was so care-worn, not for his own.
     Had he been alone in the world he would not have fretted himself in this fashion because of the
     malice of any man. But how would it be with her should he be forced to move her from Gangoil?
     And yet, with all his love, they had parted almost in anger. Surely she would understand the
     tenderness of the message he had just sent her.</t:p>
<t:p>Of a sudden, as he was riding, he stopped his horse and listened attentively. From a great
     distance there fell upon his accustomed ear a sound which he recognized, though he was aware
     that the place from whence it came was at least two miles distant. It was the thud of an axe
     against a tree. He listened still, and was sure that it was so, and turned at once toward the
     sound, though in doing so he left his course at a right angle. He had been going directly away
     from the river, with his back to the wool-shed; but now he changed his course, riding in the
     direction of the spot at which Jacko had nearly fallen in jumping over the fence. As he
     continued on, the sounds became plainer, till at last, reining in his horse, he could see the
     form of the woodman, who was still at work ringing the trees. This was a job which the man did
     by contract, receiving so much an acre for the depopulation of the timber. It was now bright
     moonlight, almost as clear as day—a very different night, indeed, from that on which the rain
     had come—and Harry could see at a glance that it was the man called Boscobel still at work. Now
     there were, as he thought, very good reasons why Boscobel at the present moment should not be
     so employed. Boscobel was receiving wages for work of another kind.</t:p>
<t:p>“Bos,” said the squatter, riding up, and addressing the man by the customary abbreviation of
     his nickname, “I thought you were watching at Brownbie’s boundary?” Boscobel lowered his axe,
     and stood for a while contemplating the proposition made to him. “You are drawing three
     shillings a night for watching; isn’t that so?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes, that’s so. Anyways, I shall draw it.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Then why ain’t you watching?”</t:p>
<t:p>“There’s nothing to watch that I knows on—not just now.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Then why should I pay you for it? I’m to pay you for ringing these trees, ain’t I?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Certainly, Mr. Heathcote.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Then you’re to make double use of your time, and sell it twice over, are you? Don’t try to
     look like a fool, as though you didn’t understand. You know that what you’re doing isn’t
     honest.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Nobody ever said as I wasn’t honest before.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I tell you so now. You’re robbing me of the time you’ve sold to me, and for which I’m to pay
     you.”</t:p>
<t:p>“There ain’t nothing to watch while the wind’s as it is now, and that chap ain’t any where
     about to-night.”</t:p>
<t:p>“What chap?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Oh, I know. I’m all right. What’s the use of dawdling about up there in the broad moonlight,
     and the wind like this?”</t:p>
<t:p>“That’s for me to judge. If you engage to do my work and take my money, you’re swindling me
     when you go about another job as you are now. You needn’t scratch your head. You understand it
     all as well as I do.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I never was told I swindled before, and I ain’t a-going to put up with it. You may ring your
     own trees, and watch your own fences, and the whole place may be burned for me. I ain’t a-going
     to do another turn in Gangoil. Swindle, indeed!” So Boscobel shouldered his axe, and marched
     off through the forest, visible in the moonlight till the trees hid him.</t:p>
<t:p>There was another enemy made! He had never felt quite sure of this man, but had been glad to
     have him about the place as being thoroughly efficient in his own business. It was only during
     the last ten days that he had agreed to pay him for night-watching, leaving the man to do as
     much additional day-work as he pleased—for which, of course, he would be paid at the regular
     contract price. There was a double purpose intended in this watching—as was well understood by
     all the hands employed: first, that of preventing incendiary fire by the mere presence of the
     watchers; and secondly, that of being at hand to extinguish fire in case of need. Now a man
     ringing trees five or six miles away from the beat on which he was stationed could not serve
     either of these purposes. Boscobel therefore had been fraudulently at work for his own
     dishonest purposes, and knew well that his employment was of that nature. All this was quite
     clear to Heathcote; and it was clear to him, also, that when he detected fraud he was bound to
     expose it. Had the man acknowledged his fault and been submissive, there would have been an end
     of the matter. Heathcote would have said no word about it to any one, and would not have
     stopped a farthing from the week’s unearned wages. That he had to encounter a certain amount of
     ill usage from the rough men about him, and to forgive it, he could understand; but it could
     not be his duty, either as a man or a master, to pass over dishonesty without noticing it. No;
     that he would not do, though Gangoil should burn from end to end. He did not much mind being
     robbed. He knew that to a certain extent he must endure to be cheated. He would endure it. But
     he would never teach his men to think that he passed over such matters because he was afraid of
     them, or that dishonesty on their part was indifferent to him.</t:p>
<t:p>But now he had made another enemy—an enemy of a man who had declared to him that he knew the
     movements of “that chap,” meaning Nokes! How hard the world was! It seemed that all around were
     trouble to him. He turned his horse back, and made again for the spot which was his original
     destination. As he cantered on among the trees, twisting here and there, and regulating his way
     by the stars, he asked himself whether it would not be better for him to go home and lay
     himself down by his wife and sleep, and await the worst that these men could do to him. This
     idea was so strong upon him that at one spot he made his horse stop till he had thought it all
     out. No one encouraged him in his work. Every one about the place, friend or foe, Bates, his
     wife, Medlicot, and this Boscobel, spoke to him as though he were fussy and fidgety in his
     anxiety. “If fires must come, they will come; and if they are not to come, you are simply
     losing your labor.” This was the upshot of all they said to him. Why should he be wiser than
     they? If the ruin came, let it come. Old Bates had been ruined, but still had enough to eat and
     drink, and clothes to wear, and did not work half as hard as his employer. He thought that if
     he could only find some one person who would sympathize with him and support him, he would not
     mind. But the mental loneliness of his position almost broke his heart.</t:p>
<t:p>Then there came across his mind the dim remembrance of certain old school words, and he
     touched his horse with his spur and hurried onward: “Let there be no steps backward.” A thought
     as to the manliness of persevering, of the want of manliness in yielding to depression, came to
     his rescue. Let him, at any rate, have the comfort of thinking that he had done his best
     according to his lights. After some dim fashion, he did come to recognize it as a fact that
     nothing could really support him but self-approbation. Though he fell from his horse in utter
     weariness, he would persevere.</t:p>
<t:p>As the night wore on he came to the German’s hut, and finding it empty, as he expected, rode
     on to the outside fence of his run. When he reached this he got off his horse, and taking a key
     out of his pocket, whistled upon it loudly. A few minutes afterward the German came up to
     him.</t:p>
<t:p>“There’s been no one about, I suppose?” he asked.</t:p>
<t:p>“Not a one,” said the man.</t:p>
<t:p>“You’ve been across on Brownbie’s run?”</t:p>
<t:p>“We’re on it now, Mr. ‘Eathcote.” They were both on the side of the fence away from Gangoil
     station.</t:p>
<t:p>“I don’t know how that is, Karl. I think Gangoil goes a quarter of a mile beyond this. But we
     did not quite strike the boundary when we put up the fence.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Brownbie’s cattle is allays here, Mr. ‘Eathcote, and is knocking down the fence every day.
     Brownbie is a rascal, and ‘is cattle as bad as ‘isself.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Never mind that, Karl, now. When we’ve got through the heats, we’ll put a mile or two of
     better fencing along here. You know Boscobel?”</t:p>
<t:p>“In course I know Bos.”</t:p>
<t:p>“What sort of a fellow is he?” Then Harry told his German dependent exactly what had taken
     place between him and the other man.</t:p>
<t:p>“He’s in and in wid all them young Brownbies,” said Karl.</t:p>
<t:p>“The Brownbies are a bad lot, but I don’t think they’d do any thing of this kind,” said
     Harry, whose mind was still dwelling on the dangers of fire.</t:p>
<t:p>“They likes muttons, Mr. ‘Eathcote.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I suppose they do take a sheep or two now and then. They wouldn’t do worse than that, would
     they?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Not’ing too ‘ot for ’em; not’ing too ‘eavy,” said Karl, smoking his pipe. “The vind, vat
     there is, comes just here, Mr. ‘Eathcote.” And the man lifted up his arm, and pointed across in
     the direction of Brownbie’s run.</t:p>
<t:p>“And you don’t think much of Boscobel?”</t:p>
<t:p>Karl Bender shook his head.</t:p>
<t:p>“He was always well treated here,” said Harry, “and has had plenty of work, and earned large
     wages. The man will be a fool to quarrel with me.”</t:p>
<t:p>Karl again shook his head. With Karl Bender, Harry was quite sure of his man, but not on that
     account need he be quite sure of the correctness of the man’s opinion.</t:p>
<t:p>Thence he went on till he met his other lieutenant, O’Dowd, and so, having completed his
     work, he made his way home, reaching the station at sunrise.</t:p>
<t:p>“Did Bates tell you he’d met me?” he asked his wife.</t:p>
<t:p>“Yes, Harry; kiss me, Harry. I was so glad you sent a word. Promise me, Harry, not to think
     that I don’t agree with you in every thing.”</t:p>
