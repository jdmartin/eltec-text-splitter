<head>CHAPTER XXIV. IN THE SHADOW OF ST. PAUL’S.</head>
<head>In ten days I was at home again—and my mother’s arms were round
                                   me.</head>
<p>I had left her for my sea-voyage very unwillingly—seeing that she
                                   was in delicate health. On my return, I was grieved to observe a
                                   change for the worse, for which her letters had not prepared me.
                                   Consulting our medical friend, Mr. MacGlue, I found that he, too,
                                   had noticed my mother’s failing health, but that he attributed it
                                   to an easily removable cause—to the climate of Scotland. My
                                   mother’s childhood and early life had been passed on the southern
                                   shores of England. The change to the raw, keen air of the North
                                   had been a trying change to a person at her age. In Mr. MacGlue’s
                                   opinion, the wise course to take would be to return to the South
                                   before the autumn was further advanced, and to make our
                                   arrangements for passing the coming winter at Penzance or
                                   Torquay.</p>
<p>Resolved as I was to keep the mysterious appointment which summoned
                                   me to London at the month’s end, Mr. MacGlue’s suggestion met
                                   with no opposition on my part. It had, to my mind, the great
                                   merit of obviating the necessity of a second separation from my
                                   mother—assuming that she approved of the doctor’s advice. I put
                                   the question to her the same day. To my infinite relief, she was
                                   not only ready, but eager to take the journey to the South. The
                                   season had been unusually wet, even for Scotland; and my mother
                                   reluctantly confessed that she “did feel a certain longing” for
                                   the mild air and genial sunshine of the Devonshire coast.</p>
<p>We arranged to travel in our own comfortable carriage by
                                   post—resting, of course, at inns on the road at night. In the
                                   days before railways it was no easy matter for an invalid to
                                   travel from Perthshire to London—even with a light carriage and
                                   four horses. Calculating our rate of progress from the date of
                                   our departure, I found that we had just time, and no more, to
                                   reach London on the last day of the month.</p>
<p>I shall say nothing of the secret anxieties which weighed on my
                                   mind, under these circumstances. Happily for me, on every
                                   account, my mother’s strength held out. The easy and (as we then
                                   thought) the rapid rate of traveling had its invigorating effect
                                   on her nerves. She slept better when we rested for the night than
                                   she had slept at home. After twice being delayed on the road, we
                                   arrived in London at three o’clock on the afternoon of the last
                                   day of the month. Had I reached my destination in time?</p>
<p>As I interpreted the writing of the apparition, I had still some
                                   hours at my disposal. The phrase, “at the month’s end,” meant, as
                                   I understood it, at the last hour of the last day in the month.
                                   If I took up my position “under the shadow of Saint Paul’s,” say,
                                   at ten that night, I should arrive at the place of meeting with
                                   two hours to spare, before the last stroke of the clock marked
                                   the beginning of the new month.</p>
<p>At half-past nine, I left my mother to rest after her long journey,
                                   and privately quit the house. Before ten, I was at my post. The
                                   night was fine and clear; and the huge shadow of the cathedral
                                   marked distinctly the limits within which I had been bid to wait,
                                   on the watch for events.</p>
<p>The great clock of Saint Paul’s struck ten—and nothing
                                   happened.</p>
<p>The next hour passed very slowly. I walked up and down; at one time
                                   absorbed in my own thoughts; at another, engaged in watching the
                                   gradual diminution in the number of foot passengers who passed me
                                   as the night advanced. The City (as it is called) is the most
                                   populous part of London in the daytime; but at night, when it
                                   ceases to be the center of commerce, its busy population melts
                                   away, and the empty streets assume the appearance of a remote and
                                   deserted quarter of the metropolis. As the half hour after ten
                                   struck—then the quarter to eleven—then the hour—the pavement
                                   steadily became more and more deserted. I could count the foot
                                   passengers now by twos and threes; and I could see the places of
                                   public refreshment within my view beginning already to close for
                                   the night.</p>
<p>I looked at the clock; it pointed to ten minutes past eleven. At
                                   that hour, could I hope to meet Mrs. Van Brandt alone in the
                                   public street?</p>
<p>The more I thought of it, the less likely such an event seemed to
                                   be. The more reasonable probability was that I might meet her
                                   once more, accompanied by some friend—perhaps under the escort of
                                   Van Brandt himself. I wondered whether I should preserve my
                                   self-control, in the presence of that man, for the second
                                   time.</p>
<p>While my thoughts were still pursuing this direction, my attention
                                   was recalled to passing events by a sad little voice, putting a
                                   strange little question, close at my side.</p>
<p>“If you please, sir, do you know where I can find a chemist’s shop
                                   open at this time of night?”</p>
<p>I looked round, and discovered a poorly clad little boy, with a
                                   basket over his arm, and a morsel of paper in his hand.</p>
<p>“The chemists’ shops are all shut,” I said. “If you want any
                                   medicine, you must ring the night-bell.”</p>
<p>“I dursn’t do it, sir,” replied the small stranger. “I am such a
                                   little boy, I’m afraid of their beating me if I ring them up out
                                   of their beds, without somebody to speak for me.”</p>
<p>The little creature looked at me under the street lamp with such a
                                   forlorn experience of being beaten for trifling offenses in his
                                   face, that it was impossible to resist the impulse to help
                                   him.</p>
<p>“Is it a serious case of illness?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>
<p>“Have you got a doctor’s prescription?”</p>
<p>He held out his morsel of paper.</p>
<p>“I have got this,” he said.</p>
<p>I took the paper from him, and looked at it.</p>
<p>It was an ordinary prescription for a tonic mixture. I looked first
                                   at the doctor’s signature; it was the name of a perfectly obscure
                                   person in the profession. Below it was written the name of the
                                   patient for whom the medicine had been prescribed. I started as I
                                   read it. The name was “Mrs. Brand.”</p>
<p>The idea instantly struck me that this (so far as sound went, at
                                   any rate) was the English equivalent of Van Brandt.</p>
<p>“Do you know the lady who sent you for the medicine?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, sir! She lodges with mother—and she owes for rent. I have
                                   done everything she told me, except getting the physic. I’ve
                                   pawned her ring, and I’ve bought the bread and butter and eggs,
                                   and I’ve taken care of the change. Mother looks to the change for
                                   her rent. It isn’t my fault, sir, that I’ve lost myself. I am but
                                   ten years old—and all the chemists’ shops are shut up!”</p>
<p>Here my little friend’s sense of his unmerited misfortunes
                                   overpowered him, and he began to cry.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry, my man!” I said; “I’ll help you. Tell me something more
                                   about the lady first. Is she alone?”</p>
<p>“She’s got her little girl with her, sir.”</p>
<p>My heart quickened its beat. The boy’s answer reminded me of that
                                   other little girl whom my mother had once seen.</p>
<p>“Is the lady’s husband with her?” I asked next.</p>
<p>“No, sir—not now. He was with her; but he went away—and he hasn’t
                                   come back yet.”</p>
<p>I put a last conclusive question.</p>
<p>“Is her husband an Englishman?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“Mother says he’s a foreigner,” the boy answered.</p>
<p>I turned away to hide my agitation. Even the child might have
                                   noticed it!</p>
<p>Passing under the name of “Mrs. Brand”—poor, so poor that she was
                                   obliged to pawn her ring—left, by a man who was a foreigner,
                                   alone with her little girl—was I on the trace of her at that
                                   moment? Was this lost child destined to be the innocent means of
                                   leading me back to the woman I loved, in her direst need of
                                   sympathy and help? The more I thought of it, the more strongly
                                   the idea of returning with the boy to the house in which his
                                   mother’s lodger lived fastened itself on my mind. The clock
                                   struck the quarter past eleven. If my anticipations ended in
                                   misleading me, I had still three-quarters of an hour to spare
                                   before the month reached its end.</p>
<p>“Where do you live?” I asked.</p>
<p>The boy mentioned a street, the name of which I then heard for the
                                   first time. All he could say, when I asked for further
                                   particulars, was that he lived close by the river—in which
                                   direction, he was too confused and too frightened to be able to
                                   tell me.</p>
<p>While we were still trying to understand each other, a cab passed
                                   slowly at some little distance. I hailed the man, and mentioned
                                   the name of the street to him. He knew it perfectly well. The
                                   street was rather more than a mile away from us, in an easterly
                                   direction. He undertook to drive me there and to bring me back
                                   again to Saint Paul’s (if necessary), in less than twenty
                                   minutes. I opened the door of the cab, and told my little friend
                                   to get in. The boy hesitated.</p>
<p>“Are we going to the chemist’s, if you please, sir?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No. You are going home first, with me.”</p>
<p>The boy began to cry again.</p>
<p>“Mother will beat me, sir, if I go back without the medicine.”</p>
<p>“I will take care that your mother doesn’t beat you. I am a doctor
                                   myself; and I want to see the lady before we get the
                                   medicine.”</p>
<p>The announcement of my profession appeared to inspire the boy with
                                   a certain confidence. But he still showed no disposition to
                                   accompany me to his mother’s house.</p>
<p>“Do you mean to charge the lady anything?” he asked. “The money
                                   I’ve got on the ring isn’t much. Mother won’t like having it
                                   taken out of her rent.”</p>
<p>“I won’t charge the lady a farthing,” I answered.</p>
<p>The boy instantly got into the cab. “All right,” he said, “as long
                                   as mother gets her money.”</p>
<p>Alas for the poor! The child’s education in the sordid anxieties of
                                   life was completed already at ten years old!</p>
<p>We drove away.</p>
