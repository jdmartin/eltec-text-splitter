<head>CHAPTER XXVI. CONVERSATION WITH MY MOTHER.</head>
<p>I REACHED my own house in time to snatch two or three hours of
                                   repose, before I paid my customary morning visit to my mother in
                                   her own room. I observed, in her reception of me on this
                                   occasion, certain peculiarities of look and manner which were far
                                   from being familiar in my experience of her.</p>
<p>When our eyes first met, she regarded me with a wistful,
                                   questioning look, as if she were troubled by some doubt which she
                                   shrunk from expressing in words. And when I inquired after her
                                   health, as usual, she surprised me by answering as impatiently as
                                   if she resented my having mentioned the subject. For a moment, I
                                   was inclined to think these changes signified that she had
                                   discovered my absence from home during the night, and that she
                                   had some suspicion of the true cause of it. But she never
                                   alluded, even in the most distant manner, to Mrs. Van Brandt; and
                                   not a word dropped from her lips which implied, directly or
                                   indirectly, that I had pained or disappointed her. I could only
                                   conclude that she had something important to say in relation to
                                   herself or to me—and that for reasons of her own she unwillingly
                                   abstained from giving expression to it at that time.</p>
<p>Reverting to our ordinary topics of conversation, we touched on the
                                   subject (always interesting to my mother) of my visit to
                                   Shetland. Speaking of this, we naturally spoke also of Miss
                                   Dunross. Here, again, when I least expected it, there was another
                                   surprise in store for me.</p>
<p>“You were talking the other day,” said my mother, “of the green
                                   flag which poor Dermody’s daughter worked for you, when you were
                                   both children. Have you really kept it all this time?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Where have you left it? In Scotland?”</p>
<p>“I have brought it with me to London.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I promised Miss Dunross to take the green flag with me, wherever I
                                   might go.”</p>
<p>My mother smiled.</p>
<p>“Is it possible, George, that you think about this as the young
                                   lady in Shetland thinks? After all the years that have passed,
                                   you believe in the green flag being the means of bringing Mary
                                   Dermody and yourself together again?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not! I am only humoring one of the fancies of poor Miss
                                   Dunross. Could I refuse to grant her trifling request, after all
                                   I owed to her kindness?”</p>
<p>The smile left my mother’s face. She looked at me attentively.</p>
<p>“Miss Dunross seems to have produced a very favorable impression on
                                   you,” she said.</p>
<p>“I own it. I feel deeply interested in her.”</p>
<p>“If she had not been an incurable invalid, George, I too might have
                                   become interested in Miss Dunross—perhaps in the character of my
                                   daughter-in-law?”</p>
<p>“It is useless, mother, to speculate on what <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have happened. The sad reality is enough.”</p>
<p>My mother paused a little before she put her next question to
                                   me.</p>
<p>“Did Miss Dunross always keep her veil drawn in your presence, when
                                   there happened to be light in the room?”</p>
<p>“Always.”</p>
<p>“She never even let you catch a momentary glance at her face?”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>“And the only reason she gave you was that the light caused her a
                                   painful sensation if it fell on her uncovered skin?”</p>
<p>“You say that, mother, as if you doubt whether Miss Dunross told me
                                   the truth.”</p>
<p>“No, George. I only doubt whether she told you <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the truth.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be offended, my dear. I believe Miss Dunross has some more
                                   serious reason for keeping her face hidden than the reason that
                                   she gave <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.”</p>
<p>I was silent. The suspicion which those words implied had never
                                   occurred to my mind. I had read in medical books of cases of
                                   morbid nervous sensitiveness exactly similar to the case of Miss
                                   Dunross, as described by herself—and that had been enough for me.
                                   Now that my mother’s idea had found its way from her mind to
                                   mine, the impression produced on me was painful in the last
                                   degree. Horrible imaginings of deformity possessed my brain, and
                                   profaned all that was purest and dearest in my recollections of
                                   Miss Dunross. It was useless to change the subject—the evil
                                   influence that was on me was too potent to be charmed away by
                                   talk. Making the best excuse that I could think of for leaving my
                                   mother’s room, I hurried away to seek a refuge from myself, where
                                   alone I could hope to find it, in the presence of Mrs. Van
                                   Brandt.</p>
