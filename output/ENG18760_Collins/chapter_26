<head>CHAPTER XXVIII. LOVE AND MONEY.</head>
<p>FEELING the embarrassment of the moment most painfully on her side,
                                   Mrs. Van Brandt spoke first.</p>
<p>“You have said nothing to me about yourself,” she began. “Is your
                                   life a happier one than it was when we last met?”</p>
<p>“I cannot honestly say that it is,” I answered.</p>
<p>“Is there any prospect of your being married?”</p>
<p>“My prospect of being married still rests with you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that!” she exclaimed, with an entreating look at me.
                                   “Don’t spoil my pleasure in seeing you again by speaking of what
                                   can never be! Have you still to be told how it is that you find
                                   me here alone with my child?”</p>
<p>I forced myself to mention Van Brandt’s name, rather than hear it
                                   pass <hi rend="italic">her</hi> lips.</p>
<p>“I have been told that Mr. Van Brandt is in prison for debt,” I
                                   said. “And I saw for myself last night that he had left you
                                   helpless.”</p>
<p>“He left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested,”
                                   she rejoined, sadly. “His cruel creditors are more to blame than
                                   he is for the poverty that has fallen on us.”</p>
<p>Even this negative defense of Van Brandt stung me to the quick.</p>
<p>“I ought to have spoken more guardedly of him,” I said, bitterly.
                                   “I ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any
                                   wrong that a man can inflict on her—when he is the man whom she
                                   loves.”</p>
<p>She put her hand on my mouth, and stopped me before I could say any
                                   more.</p>
<p>“How can you speak so cruelly to me?” she asked. “You know—to my
                                   shame I confessed it to you the last time we met—you know that my
                                   heart, in secret, is all yours. What ‘wrong’ are you talking of?
                                   Is it the wrong I suffered when Van Brandt married me, with a
                                   wife living at the time (and living still)? Do you think I can
                                   ever forget the great misfortune of my life—the misfortune that
                                   has made me unworthy of you? It is no fault of mine, God knows;
                                   but it is not the less true that I am not married, and that the
                                   little darling who is playing out there with her doll is my
                                   child. And you talk of my being your wife—knowing that!”</p>
<p>“The child accepts me as her second father,” I said. “It would be
                                   better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as the
                                   child.”</p>
<p>“Pride?” she repeated. “In such a position as mine? A helpless
                                   woman, with a mock-husband in prison for debt! Say that I have
                                   not fallen quite so low yet as to forget what is due to you, and
                                   you will pay me a compliment that will be nearer to the truth. Am
                                   I to marry you for my food and shelter? Am I to marry you,
                                   because there is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my
                                   child? Cruelly as he has behaved, he has still <hi rend="italic">that</hi> claim upon me. Bad as he is, he has not forsaken
                                   me; he has been forced away. My only friend, is it possible that
                                   you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife? The
                                   woman (in my situation) must be heartless indeed who could
                                   destroy your place in the estimation of the world and the regard
                                   of your friends! The wretchedest creature that walks the streets
                                   would shrink from treating you in that way. Oh, what are men made
                                   of? How <hi rend="italic">can</hi> you—how <hi rend="italic">can</hi> you speak of it!”</p>
<p>I yielded—-and spoke of it no more. Every word she uttered only
                                   increased my admiration of the noble creature whom I had loved,
                                   and lost. What refuge was now left to me? But one refuge; I could
                                   still offer to her the sacrifice of myself. Bitterly as I hated
                                   the man who had parted us, I loved her dearly enough to be even
                                   capable of helping him for her sake. Hopeless infatuation! I
                                   don’t deny it; I don’t excuse it—hopeless infatuation!</p>
<p>“You have forgiven me,” I said. “Let me deserve to be forgiven. It
                                   is something to be your only friend. You must have plans for the
                                   future; tell me unreservedly how I can help you.”</p>
<p>“Complete the good work that you have begun,” she answered,
                                   gratefully. “Help me back to health. Make me strong enough to
                                   submit to a doctor’s estimate of my chances of living for some
                                   years yet.”</p>
<p>“A doctor’s estimate of your chances of living?” I repeated. “What
                                   do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I hardly know how to tell you,” she said, “without speaking again
                                   of Mr. Van Brandt.”</p>
<p>“Does speaking of him again mean speaking of his debts?” I asked.
                                   “Why need you hesitate? You know that there is nothing I will not
                                   do to relieve <hi rend="italic">your</hi> anxieties.”</p>
<p>She looked at me for a moment, in silent distress.</p>
<p>“Oh! do you think I would let you give your money to Van Brandt?”
                                   she asked, as soon as she could speak. “I, who owe everything to
                                   your devotion to me? Never! Let me tell you the plain truth.
                                   There is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison. He
                                   must pay his creditors; and he has found out a way of doing
                                   it—with my help.”</p>
<p>“Your help?” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Yes. This is his position, in two words: A little while since, he
                                   obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad, from a rich
                                   relative of his, and he had made all his arrangements to accept
                                   it. Unhappily, he returned to tell me of his good fortune, and
                                   the same day he was arrested for debt. His relative has offered
                                   to keep the situation open for a certain time, and the time has
                                   not yet expired. If he can pay a dividend to his creditors, they
                                   will give him his freedom; and he believes he can raise the money
                                   if I consent to insure my life.”</p>
<p>To insure her life! The snare that had been set for her was plainly
                                   revealed in those four words.</p>
<p>In the eye of the law she was, of course, a single woman: she was
                                   of age; she was, to all intents and purposes, her own mistress.
                                   What was there to prevent her from insuring her life, if she
                                   pleased, and from so disposing of the insurance as to give Van
                                   Brandt a direct interest in her death? Knowing what I knew of
                                   him—believing him, as I did, to be capable of any atrocity—I
                                   trembled at the bare idea of what might have happened if I had
                                   failed to find my way back to her until a later date. Thanks to
                                   the happy accident of my position, the one certain way of
                                   protecting her lay easily within my reach. I could offer to lend
                                   the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hour’s notice, and
                                   he was the man to accept my proposal quite as easily as I could
                                   make it.</p>
<p>“You don’t seem to approve of our idea,” she said, noticing, in
                                   evident perplexity, the effect which she had produced on me. “I
                                   am very unfortunate; I seem to have innocently disturbed and
                                   annoyed you for the second time.”</p>
<p>“You are quite mistaken,” I replied. “I am only doubting whether
                                   your plan for relieving Mr. Van Brandt of his embarrassments is
                                   quite so simple as you suppose. Are you aware of the delays that
                                   are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow
                                   money on your policy of insurance?”</p>
<p>“I know nothing about it,” she said, sadly.</p>
<p>“Will you let me ask the advice of my lawyers? They are trustworthy
                                   and experienced men, and I am sure they can be of use to
                                   you.”</p>
<p>Cautiously as I had expressed myself, her delicacy took the
                                   alarm.</p>
<p>“Promise that you won’t ask me to borrow money of you for Mr. Van
                                   Brandt,” she rejoined, “and I will accept your help
                                   gratefully.”</p>
<p>I could honestly promise that. My one chance of saving her lay in
                                   keeping from her knowledge the course that I had now determined
                                   to pursue. I rose to go, while my resolution still sustained me.
                                   The sooner I made my inquiries (I reminded her) the more speedily
                                   our present doubts and difficulties would be resolved.</p>
<p>She rose, as I rose—with the tears in her eyes, and the blush on
                                   her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Kiss me,” she whispered, “before you go! And don’t mind my crying.
                                   I am quite happy now. It is only your goodness that overpowers
                                   me.”</p>
<p>I pressed her to my heart, with the unacknowledged tenderness of a
                                   parting embrace. It was impossible to disguise the position in
                                   which I had now placed myself. I had, so to speak, pronounced my
                                   own sentence of banishment. When my interference had restored my
                                   unworthy rival to his freedom, could I submit to the degrading
                                   necessity of seeing her in his presence, of speaking to her under
                                   his eyes? <hi rend="italic">That</hi> sacrifice of myself was
                                   beyond me—and I knew it. “For the last time!” I thought, as I
                                   held her to me for a moment longer—“for the last time!”</p>
<p>The child ran to meet me with open arms when I stepped out on the
                                   landing. My manhood had sustained me through the parting with the
                                   mother. It was only when the child’s round, innocent little face
                                   laid itself lovingly against mine that my fortitude gave way. I
                                   was past speaking; I put her down gently in silence, and waited
                                   on the lower flight of stairs until I was fit to face the world
                                   outside.</p>
