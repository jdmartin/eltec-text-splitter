<head>CHAPTER XXXV. UNDER THE WINDOW.</head>
<p>I SET the position of the harbor by my pocket-compass, and then
                                   followed the course of the first street that lay before me.</p>
<p>On either side, as I advanced, the desolate old houses frowned on
                                   me. There were no lights in the windows, no lamps in the streets.
                                   For a quarter of an hour at least I penetrated deeper and deeper
                                   into the city, without encountering a living creature on my
                                   way—with only the starlight to guide me. Turning by chance into a
                                   street broader than the rest, I at last saw a moving figure, just
                                   visible ahead, under the shadows of the houses. I quickened my
                                   pace, and found myself following a man in the dress of a peasant.
                                   Hearing my footsteps behind him, he turned and looked at me.
                                   Discovering that I was a stranger, he lifted a thick cudgel that
                                   he carried with him, shook it threateningly, and called to me in
                                   his own language (as I gathered by his actions) to stand back. A
                                   stranger in Eukhuizen at that time of night was evidently
                                   reckoned as a robber in the estimation of this citizen! I had
                                   learned on the voyage, from the captain of the boat, how to ask
                                   my way in Dutch, if I happened to be by myself in a strange town;
                                   and I now repeated my lesson, asking my way to the fishing office
                                   of Messrs. Van Brandt. Either my foreign accent made me
                                   unintelligible, or the man’s suspicions disinclined him to trust
                                   me. Again he shook his cudgel, and again he signed to me to stand
                                   back. It was useless to persist. I crossed to the opposite side
                                   of the way, and soon afterward lost sight of him under the
                                   portico of a house.</p>
<p>Still following the windings of the deserted streets, I reached
                                   what I at first supposed to be the end of the town.</p>
<p>Before me, for half a mile or more (as well as I could guess), rose
                                   a tract of meadow-land, with sheep dotted over it at intervals
                                   reposing for the night. I advanced over the grass, and observed
                                   here and there, where the ground rose a little, some moldering
                                   fragments of brickwork. Looking onward as I reached the middle of
                                   the meadow, I perceived on its further side, towering gaunt and
                                   black in the night, a lofty arch or gateway, without walls at its
                                   sides, without a neighboring building of any sort, far or near.
                                   This (as I afterward learned) was one of the ancient gates of the
                                   city. The walls, crumbling to ruin, had been destroyed as useless
                                   obstacles that cumbered the ground. On the waste meadow-land
                                   round me had once stood the shops of the richest merchants, the
                                   palaces of the proudest nobles of North Holland. I was actually
                                   standing on what had been formerly the wealthy quarter of
                                   Enkhuizen! And what was left of it now? A few mounds of broken
                                   bricks, a pasture-land of sweet-smelling grass, and a little
                                   flock of sheep sleeping.</p>
<p>The mere desolation of the view (apart altogether from its history)
                                   struck me with a feeling of horror. My mind seemed to lose its
                                   balance in the dreadful stillness that was round me. I felt
                                   unutterable forebodings of calamities to come. For the first
                                   time, I repented having left England. My thoughts turned
                                   regretfully to the woody shores of Greenwater Broad. If I had
                                   only held to my resolution, I might have been at rest now in the
                                   deep waters of the lake. For what had I lived and planned and
                                   traveled since I left Dermody’s cottage? Perhaps only to find
                                   that I had lost the woman whom I loved—now that I was in the same
                                   town with her!</p>
<p>Regaining the outer rows of houses still left standing, I looked
                                   about me, intending to return by the street which was known to me
                                   already. Just as I thought I had discovered it, I noticed another
                                   living creature in the solitary city. A man was standing at the
                                   door of one of the outermost houses on my right hand, looking at
                                   me.</p>
<p>At the risk of meeting with another rough reception, I determined
                                   to make a last effort to discover Mrs. Van Brandt before I
                                   returned to the boat.</p>
<p>Seeing that I was approaching him, the stranger met me midway. His
                                   dress and manner showed plainly that I had not encountered this
                                   time a person in the lower ranks of life. He answered my question
                                   civilly in his own language. Seeing that I was at a loss to
                                   understand what he said, he invited me by signs to follow him.
                                   After walking for a few minutes in a direction which was quite
                                   new to me, we stopped in a gloomy little square, with a plot of
                                   neglected garden-ground in the middle of it. Pointing to a lower
                                   window in one of the houses, in which a light dimly appeared, my
                                   guide said in Dutch: “Office of Van Brandt, sir,” bowed, and left
                                   me.</p>
<p>I advanced to the window. It was open, and it was just high enough
                                   to be above my head. The light in the room found its way outward
                                   through the interstices of closed wooden shutters. Still haunted
                                   by misgivings of trouble to come, I hesitated to announce my
                                   arrival precipitately by ringing the house-bell. How did I know
                                   what new calamity might not confront me when the door was opened?
                                   I waited under the window and listened.</p>
<p>Hardly a minute passed before I heard a woman’s voice in the room.
                                   There was no mistaking the charm of those tones. It was the voice
                                   of Mrs. Van Brandt.</p>
<p>“Come, darling,” she said. “It is very late—you ought to have been
                                   in bed two hours ago.”</p>
<p>The child’s voice answered, “I am not sleepy, mamma.”</p>
<p>“But, my dear, remember you have been ill. You may be ill again if
                                   you keep out of bed so late as this. Only lie down, and you will
                                   soon fall asleep when I put the candle out.”</p>
<p>“You must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> put the candle out!” the child
                                   returned, with strong emphasis. “My new papa is coming. How is he
                                   to find his way to us, if you put out the light?”</p>
<p>The mother answered sharply, as if the child’s strange words had
                                   irritated her.</p>
<p>“You are talking nonsense,” she said; “and you must go to bed. Mr.
                                   Germaine knows nothing about us. Mr. Germaine is in England.”</p>
<p>I could restrain myself no longer. I called out under the
                                   window:</p>
<p>“Mr. Germaine is here!”</p>
