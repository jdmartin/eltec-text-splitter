<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p> THE following morning Miss Merton had risen early, and was sauntering slowly
                        before breakfast up and down the broad terrace in front of the house. She
                        inhaled the fresh delightful air; she looked out over the breezy sea; she
                        scanned the splendid villa, now shining in the sunlight, with its marble
                        porticoes, and its long rows of windows; and she thought over yesterday with
                        all its conversations and incidents. In especial, she thought of Laurence.
                        She thought of him as he was now, and as he had been in former times, when
                        they had known each other so well; and as she thought of him, she sighed. </p>
<p> ‘And he might do so much,’ she said to herself, ‘and yet he is so weak and
                        so irresolute; wasting his time in Paris and in London, reading poetry and
                        buying pictures, and talking philosophy he doesn’t believe in with his
                        dilettante friends. And this place—this lovely place—how often does he come
                        here? What does he do for his tenants and dependants—for all who ought to
                        look for help to him? I have no patience with a man who keeps moaning about
                        religion as he does, and yet won’t act up to the light which he must have.’ </p>
<p> Whilst she was thus meditating, the subject of her meditations appeared upon
                        the terrace. </p>
<p> ‘You are out early,’ he said. ‘I have been just seeing Herbert off. He has
                        had to go before, everybody else, for he is <foreign>en route</foreign> for
                        Italy.’ </p>
<p> ‘You look very tired,’ said Miss Merton sympathetically. </p>
<p> ‘Oh, it is nothing,’ said Laurence, turning the subject. ‘Did you notice
                        Leslie last evening in the garden, and how odd his manner was? Do you
                        remember, too, the pretty song he sang the night before, and how surprised
                        we all were at it? Well, I had a letter yesterday, from a friend both of his
                        and mine, which explains it. The heroine of the song was not an ideal young
                        lady, though whether one can call her real any longer is more than I can
                        say. She is dead. I don’t know all the story; but my friend just gave me the
                        outline, and enclosed a note for Leslie, to tell the news to him himself. He
                        never fancies he feels anything; but what he won’t admit to himself, his
                        manner, I am sure admitted to me, and I dare say to you too.’ </p>
<p> ‘Yes,’ said Miss Merton thoughtfully, ‘I felt sure it must be something of
                        that kind. But you,’ she said, turning to Laurence, ‘how utterly tired and
                        worn-out you look.’ </p>
<p> ‘To say the truth,’ Laurence answered, ‘I slept very little last night. I
                        was thinking of our culture and our enlightenment. I was thinking of—God
                        knows what; and why should I tell you? I’m sorry,’ he said, ‘that we’re all
                        breaking up to-day. I wish we could have kept the party together for a
                        little longer. I don’t know what I shall do. I can’t stop here; I shan’t go
                        to London—I hate London. I had almost resolved, an hour ago, to go off to
                        Italy with Herbert.’ </p>
<p> ‘By way of finding some duty to do?’ asked Miss Merton quietly. </p>
<p> ‘I <emph>have</emph> no duties,’ said Laurence. ‘Didn’t Herbert very truly
                        tell us so last night? But in Italy I should at least forget that I ever
                        might have had any. And I should be then, at any rate, with a congenial
                        friend. Herbert and I, you see, are two fools. We both of us want to pray,
                        and we neither of us can.’ </p>
<p> There was a long pause. At last Miss Merton said with some embarrassment,
                        stooping as she did so to smell a red geranium: </p>
<p> ‘I’m sure I wish I could be of any use to you; but really I don’t quite see
                        how I can.’ </p>
<p> There was another pause. At last Laurence said in a very low tone: </p>
<p> ‘I cannot pray, because I do not believe in God. Will you pray for me? ’ </p>
<p> Miss Merton turned and looked at him with a soft, serious smile. </p>
<p> ‘I did last night, if you wish very much to know,’ she said, and her cheek
                        grew slowly tinted with an unconscious blush. </p>
<p> ‘Did you?’ exclaimed Laurence with a sudden eagerness. ‘Then, if you cared
                        enough for me to do that, will you care enough for me to do something far
                        better than praying for me? Will you—’ he said, pausing and looking at her;
                        ‘will you—’ But at that instant the gong for breakfast sounded, and the
                        sentence died unfinished. Both he and she were perhaps a little grateful for
                        this interruption. It relieved a sudden sense of shyness that had become
                        painful, and to all intents and purposes their looks had already said all
                        that need be said. It might, both felt, be securely left to find its way
                        into words at a more convenient season. In another moment they were in the
                        midst of that most matter-of-fact bustle that precedes in country-houses the
                        settling down to breakfast of a large party. </p>
<p> ‘Well, Mr. Laurence,’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, ‘all pleasant things come to
                        an end at last. But this visit to you has really been positively delightful.
                        And now, you must be careful not to forget me—that we are expecting you in
                        September in Gloucestershire, to take part in our private theatricals.
                        By-the-by,’ she added, sinking her voice to a fit solemnity, ‘I think I told
                        you, didn’t I, how ill the poor Duchess of ——— had been last week, though
                        she’s better now, I am happy to hear this morning.
                        Ham—tongue—pigeon-pie—omelette,’ she went on, as she sat down at the table;
                        ‘why, amongst all this host of good things, I don’t know really what to
                        choose. Well, suppose, Mr. Laurence, you were to bring me just the
                        little—least bit of omelette. My dear,’ she whispered to Miss Merton, who
                        was on one side of her, ‘what a dreadful blowing-up Mr. Herbert gave us last
                        night, didn’t he? Now that, you know, I think is all very well in a sermon,
                        but in a lecture, where the things are supposed to be taken more or less
                        literally, I think it is a little out of place.’ </p>
<p> ‘Did you say just now,’ said Leslie, who found himself on the other side of
                        Lady Ambrose, ‘that the Duchess of ——— was ill?’ </p>
<p> ‘Oh, it was just something I was telling Mr. Laurence,’ said Lady Ambrose
                        coldly. ‘She’s much better now, thank you. Do you know her?’ </p>
<p> ‘She’s my aunt,’ said Leslie. </p>
<p> Lady Ambrose turned round and looked Leslie full in the face. As she looked,
                        a smile began to dimple her cheek, and light up her sweet grey eyes. </p>
<p> ‘You <emph>don’t</emph> say so!’ she exclaimed at last. ‘Why, of course you
                        are. How stupid of me not to have found that out before. To be sure—you are
                        the redoubtable Eton boy, who made such a dreadful commotion at Daleham by
                        wanting to run away with the nursery governess. And to think that I have
                        only discovered you at this last moment, when we are all of us going to say
                        good-bye!’ </p>
<p> ‘Your carriage is at the door, my Lady,’ said a servant. </p>
<p> ‘Already!’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘How time flies! Dr. Jenkinson, you and I are
                        going to the train together, I believe. And now, Mr. Leslie,’ she went on,
                        ‘Mr. Laurence is coming to us, in September, for some private theatricals. I
                        don’t know if you do anything in that way yourself. But perhaps if you are
                        in England, and have no better engagements, you will come with him. At any
                        rate, if you won’t, please to remember I shall think it very ill-natured of
                        you.’ </p>
<p> ‘Thank you,’ said Leslie, smiling, ‘I am not ill-natured.’ </p>
<p> ‘I’m quite ready, Lady Ambrose, if you are,’ said Dr. Jenkinson briskly;
                        ‘and now, Laurence,’ he said, as he was standing in the portico, whilst Lady
                        Ambrose was getting into the carriage, ‘good-bye; I’ve had a most pleasant
                        visit. But as to your Utopia, your ideal of the future—’ he added
                        confidentially, ‘it has been said, foolishly enough, that God was the
                        Brocken-phantom of self, projected on the mists of the
                            <foreign>non-ego</foreign>. Well—your Utopia was the Brocken-phantom of
                        the present, projected on the mists of the impracticable. It was simply the
                        present with its homelier details left out. Good-bye—good-bye.’ </p>
<p> ‘Then in that case,’ said Laurence, as he bade adieu to the Doctor, ‘it is a
                        comfort to know from you that the Present, as it is, is the highest state of
                        things conceivable.’ </p>
<p> ‘Good-bye,’ said Lady Ambrose, with a smile in her beautiful frank eyes.
                        ‘Good-bye, Mr. Leslie, and mind that you don’t forget September.’ </p>
