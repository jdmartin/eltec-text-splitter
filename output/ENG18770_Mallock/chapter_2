<p> IT was half-past eight, and the party were fast assembling in the twilight
                        drawing-room. Leslie was lounging in one of the windows, by a large stand of
                        flowers and broad-leaved plants, and was studying the company with
                        considerable interest. His first impression was of little more than of a
                        number of men’s dark coats and white shirt-fronts, tables, couches, and
                        gilded chairs, and the pleasant many-coloured glimmerings of female apparel.
                        But before long he had observed more minutely. There were men who he
                        instinctively felt were celebrities, discoursing to groups of ladies; there
                        were ladies who he at once saw were attractive, being discoursed to by
                        groups of men. He very soon detected Lady Ambrose, a fine handsome woman of
                        perhaps thirty, with the large grey eyes of which Laurence had spoken, and a
                        very clear complexion. Leslie was much prepossessed by her frank manner, and
                        by her charming voice, as she was talking with some animation to a tall
                        distinguished-looking young man, whose fine features, keen earnest glance,
                        and thoughtful expression prepossessed him still more. Forming a third in
                        this group, dropping in a word or two at intervals, he recognised the
                        celebrated Dr. Jenkinson—still full of vigour, though his hair was
                        silver—the sharp and restless sparkle of whose eyes, strangely joined with
                        the most benevolent of smiles, Leslie remembered to have noticed at Baron
                        Isaacs’ festival. He had just identified Lady Ambrose and the Doctor, when
                        Laurence came up to him in the window, and began to tell him who was who. </p>
<p> ‘Dr. Jenkinson is the only one I know,’ said Leslie, ‘and, naturally enough,
                        he forgets me.’ </p>
<p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘that man by himself, turning over the books on the
                        table—the man with the black whiskers, spectacles, and bushy eyebrows—is Mr.
                        Storks of the Royal Society, who is great on the physical basis of life and
                        the imaginative basis of God. The man with long locks in the window,
                        explaining a microscope in so eager a way to that dark-haired girl, is
                        Professor Stockton—of the Royal Society also; and member and president of
                        many Societies more. The girl—child, rather, I ought to call her—that he is
                        talking to, is Lady Violet Gresham—my second cousin. You see my aunt, the
                        old lady with grey curls, on the ottoman near the fire-place? Well—the
                        supercilious-looking man, talking rather loudly and rather slowly to her
                        about the dust in London, is Mr. Luke, the great critic and apostle of
                        culture. That, too, is another critic close by him—the pale creature, with
                        large moustache, looking out of the window at the sunset. He is Mr. Rose,
                        the pre-Raphaelite. He always speaks in an undertone, and his two topics are
                        self-indulgence and art. The young man there with Lady Ambrose and Dr.
                        Jenkinson, is Lord Allen. He is only two- or three-and-twenty; still, had
                        you been in England lately, you would often have heard his name. He has come
                        early into an immense property, and he yet is conscious that he has duties
                        in life. But,’ said Laurence, sighing, ‘he too feels, as I do, that he has
                        fallen on evil days, in which there can be no peace for us—little but doubt
                        and confusion, and what seems to me a losing battle against the spiritual
                        darkness of this world. However—that redheaded youth thinks very
                        differently. He is Mr. Saunders from Oxford, supposed to be very clever and
                        advanced. Next him is Donald Gordon, who has deserted deer-stalking and the
                        Kirk, for literature and German metaphysics.’ </p>
<p> ‘And who is that,’ said Leslie,’ the young lady with those large and rather
                        sad-looking eyes, and the delicate, proud mouth?’ </p>
<p> ‘Which?’ said Laurence. </p>
<p> ‘The one on the sofa,’ said Leslie, ‘who looks so like a Reynolds
                        portrait—like a duchess of the last century—the lady in the pale blue dress,
                        talking to that man with such a curiously attractive smile and the worn
                        melancholy look?’ </p>
<p> ‘That,’ said Laurence, ‘is Miss Merton. I am glad you admire her. And don’t
                        you know who it is she is talking to? He is almost the only man of these
                        days for whom I feel a real reverence—almost the only one of our teachers
                        who seems to me to speak with the least breath of inspiration. But he is too
                        impressionable, perhaps—too much like me, in that way. And now, as the years
                        come, it seems that hope is more and more leaving him, and things look
                        darker to him than ever. That is Herbert.’ </p>
<p> ‘Herbert!’ exclaimed Leslie, ‘so it is. I thought I recollected the face. I
                        have heard him lecture several times at the Royal Institution; and that
                        singular voice of his, which would often hold all the theatre breathless,
                        haunts me still, sometimes. There was something strange and aërial in its
                        exquisite modulations, that seemed as if it came from a disconsolate spirit,
                        hovering over the waters of Babylon, and remembering Sion. I can’t tell
                        exactly why it was that—but, ah!—my dear Laurence—who is this, that is
                        coming into the room now—this lovely creature, with a dress like a red
                        azalea? What speaking eyes! And what hair, too—deep dead black, with those
                        white starry blossoms in it. I don’t think I ever saw anyone move so
                        gracefully; and how proudly and piquantly she poises <quote>On her neck the
                            small head buoyant, like a bell-flower on its bed!’</quote>
</p>
<p> ‘That,’ said Laurence, when Leslie had done, ‘is Mrs. Sinclair, who has
                        published a volume of poems, and is a sort of fashionable London Sappho. But
                        come,—we shall be going into dinner directly. You shall have Lady Ambrose on
                        one side of you, and shall take in Miss Merton.’ </p>
