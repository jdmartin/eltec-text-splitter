<head>CHAPTER XV</head>
<p>The dark deep hints that had reached Mr. Ferrars at the beginning of 1834 were the
      harbingers of startling events. In the spring it began to be rumoured among the initiated,
      that the mighty Reform Cabinet with its colossal majority, and its testimonial goblets of
      gold, raised by the penny subscriptions of the grateful people, was in convulsions, and before
      the month of July had elapsed Lord Grey had resigned, under circumstances which exhibited the
      entire demoralisation of his party. Except Zenobia, every one was of the opinion that the King
      acted wisely in entrusting the reconstruction of the Whig ministry to his late Secretary of
      State, Lord Melbourne. Nevertheless, it could no longer be concealed, nay, it was invariably
      admitted, that the political situation had been largely and most unexpectedly changed, and
      that there was a prospect, dim, perhaps, yet not undefinable, of the conduct of public affairs
      again falling to the alternate management of two rival constitutional parties.</p>
<p>Zenobia was so full of hope, and almost of triumph, that she induced her lord in the autumn
      to assemble their political friends at one of his great seats, and Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars were
      urgently invited to join the party. But, after some hesitation, they declined this proposal.
      Had Mr. Ferrars been as sanguine as his wife, he would perhaps have overcome his strong
      disinclination to re-enter the world, but though no longer despairing of a Tory revival, he
      was of opinion that a considerable period, even several years, must elapse before its
      occurrence. Strange to say, he found no difficulty in following his own humour through any
      contrary disposition on the part of Mrs. Ferrars. With all her ambition and passionate love of
      society, she was unwilling to return to that stage, where she once had blazed, in a subdued
      and almost subordinate position. In fact, it was an affair of the wardrobe. The queen of
      costumes, whose fanciful and gorgeous attire even Zenobia was wont to praise, could not endure
      a reappearance in old dresses. “I do not so much care about my jewels, William,” she said to
      her husband, “but one must have new dresses.”</p>
<p>It was a still mild day in November, a month which in the country, and especially on the
      light soils, has many charms, and the whole Ferrars family were returning home after an
      afternoon ramble on the chase. The leaf had changed but had not fallen, and the vast spiral
      masses of the dark green juniper effectively contrasted with the rich brown foliage of the
      beech, varied occasionally by the scarlet leaves of the wild cherry tree, that always mingles
      with these woods. Around the house were some lime trees of large size, and at this period of
      the year their foliage, still perfect, was literally quite golden. They seemed like trees in
      some fairy tale of imprisoned princesses or wandering cavaliers, and such they would remain,
      until the fatal night that brings the first frost.</p>
<p>“There is a parcel from London,” said the servant to Mr. Ferrars, as they entered the house.
      “It is on your desk.”</p>
<p>A parcel from London was one of the great events of their life. What could it be? Perhaps
      some proofs, probably some books. Mr. Ferrars entered his room alone. It was a very small
      brown paper parcel, evidently not books. He opened it hastily, and disencumbered its contents
      of several coverings. The contents took the form of a letter—a single letter.</p>
<p>The handwriting was recognised, and he read the letter with an agitated countenance, and
      then he opened the door of his room, and called loudly for his wife, who was by his side in a
      few moments.</p>
<p>“A letter, my love, from Barron,” he cried. “The King has dismissed Lord Melbourne and sent
      for the Duke of Wellington, who has accepted the conduct of affairs.”</p>
<p>“You must go to town directly,” said his wife. “He offered you the Cabinet in 1832. No
      person has such a strong claim on him as you have.”</p>
<p>“It does not appear that he is exactly prime minister,” said Mr. Ferrars, looking again at
      the letter. “They have sent for Peel, who is at Rome, but the Duke is to conduct the
      government till he arrives.”</p>
<p>“You must go to town immediately,” repeated Mrs. Ferrars. “There is not a moment to be lost.
      Send down to the Horse Shoe and secure an inside place in the Salisbury coach. It reaches this
      place at nine to-morrow morning. I will have everything ready. You must take a portmanteau and
      a carpet-bag. I wonder if you could get a bedroom at the Rodneys’. It would be so nice to be
      among old friends; they must feel for you. And then it will be near the Carlton, which is a
      great thing. I wonder how he will form his cabinet. What a pity he is not here!”</p>
<p>“It is a wonderful event, but the difficulties must be immense,” observed Ferrars.</p>
<p>“Oh! you always see difficulties. I see none. The King is with us, the country is disgusted.
      It is what I always said would be; the reaction is complete.”</p>
<p>“Well, we had better now go and tell the children,” said Ferrars. “I leave you all here for
      the first time,” and he seemed to sigh.</p>
<p>“Well, I hope we shall soon join you,” said Mrs. Ferrars. “It is the very best time for
      hiring a house. What I have set my heart upon is the Green Park. It will be near your office
      and not too near. I am sure I could not live again in a street.”</p>
<p>The children were informed that public events of importance had occurred, that the King had
      changed his ministry, and that papa must go up to town immediately and see the Duke of
      Wellington. The eyes of Mrs. Ferrars danced with excitement as she communicated to them all
      this intelligence, and much more, with a volubility in which of late years she had rarely
      indulged. Mr. Ferrars looked grave and said little. Then he patted Endymion on the head, and
      kissed Myra, who returned his embrace with a warmth unusual with her.</p>
<p>The whole household soon became in a state of bustle with the preparations for the early
      departure of Mr. Ferrars. It seemed difficult to comprehend how filling a portmanteau and a
      carpet-bag could induce such excited and continuous exertions. But then there was so much to
      remember, and then there was always something forgotten. Mrs. Ferrars was in her bedroom
      surrounded by all her maids; Mr. Ferrars was in his study looking out some papers which it was
      necessary to take with him. The children were alone.</p>
<p>“I wonder if we shall be restored to our greatness,” said Myra to Endymion.</p>
<p>“Well, I shall be sorry to leave the old place; I have been happy here.”</p>
<p>“I have not,” said Myra; “and I do not think I could have borne this life had it not been
      for you.”</p>
<p>“It will be a wonderful change,” said Endymion.</p>
<p>“If it comes; I fear papa is not daring enough. However, if we get out of this hole, it will
      be something.”</p>
<p>Tea-time brought them all together again, but when the meal was over, none of the usual
      occupations of the evening were pursued; no work, no books, no reading aloud. Mr. Ferrars was
      to get up very early, and that was a reason for all retiring soon. And yet neither the husband
      nor the wife really cared to sleep. Mrs. Ferrars sate by the fire in his dressing-room,
      speculating on all possible combinations, and infusing into him all her suggestions and all
      her schemes. She was still prudent, and still would have preferred a great government—India if
      possible; but had made up her mind that he must accept the cabinet. Considering what had
      occurred in 1832, she thought he was bound in honour to do so. Her husband listened rather
      than conversed, and seemed lost in thought. At last he rose, and, embracing her with much
      affection, said, “You forget I am to rise with the lark. I shall write to you every day. Best
      and dearest of women, you have always been right, and all my good fortune has come from
      you.”</p>
