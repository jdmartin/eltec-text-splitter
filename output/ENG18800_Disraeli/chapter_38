<head>CHAPTER XXXVIII</head>
<p>When parliament reassembled in February, the Neuchatels quitted Hainault for their London
      residence in Portland Place. Mrs. Neuchatel was sadly troubled at leaving her country home,
      which, notwithstanding its distressing splendour, had still some forms of compensatory
      innocence in its flowers and sylvan glades. Adriana sighed when she called to mind the
      manifold and mortifying snares and pitfalls that awaited her, and had even framed a highly
      practical and sensible scheme which would permit her parents to settle in town and allow Myra
      and herself to remain permanently in the country; but Myra brushed away the project like a
      fly, and Adriana yielding, embraced her with tearful eyes.</p>
<p>The Neuchatel mansion in Portland Place was one of the noblest in that comely quarter of the
      town, and replete with every charm and convenience that wealth and taste could provide. Myra,
      who, like her brother, had a tenacious memory, was interested in recalling as fully and as
      accurately as possible her previous experience of London life. She was then indeed only a
      child, but a child who was often admitted to brilliant circles, and had enjoyed opportunities
      of social observation which the very youthful seldom possess. Her retrospection was not as
      profitable as she could have desired, and she was astonished, after a severe analysis of the
      past, to find how entirely at that early age she appeared to have been engrossed with herself
      and with Endymion. Hill Street and Wimbledon, and all their various life, figured as shadowy
      scenes; she could realise nothing very definite for her present guidance; the past seemed a
      phantom of fine dresses, and bright equipages, and endless indulgence. All that had happened
      after their fall was distinct and full of meaning. It would seem that adversity had taught
      Myra to feel and think.</p>
<p>Forty years ago the great financiers had not that commanding, not to say predominant,
      position in society which they possess at present, but the Neuchatels were an exception to
      this general condition. They were a family which not only had the art of accumulating wealth,
      but of expending it with taste and generosity—an extremely rare combination. Their great
      riches, their political influence, their high integrity and their social accomplishments,
      combined to render their house not only splendid, but interesting and agreeable, and gave them
      a great hold upon the world. At first the fine ladies of their political party called on them
      as a homage of condescending gratitude for the public support which the Neuchatel family gave
      to their sons and husbands, but they soon discovered that this amiable descent from their
      Olympian heights on their part did not amount exactly to the sacrifice or service which they
      had contemplated. They found their host as refined as themselves, and much more magnificent,
      and in a very short time it was not merely the wives of ambassadors and ministers of state
      that were found at the garden fetes of Hainault, or the balls, and banquets, and concerts of
      Portland Place, but the fitful and capricious realm of fashion surrendered like a fair country
      conquered as it were by surprise. To visit the Neuchatels became the mode; all solicited to be
      their guests, and some solicited in vain.</p>
<p>Although it was only February, the world began to move, and some of the ministers’ wives,
      who were socially strong enough to venture on such a step, received their friends. Mr.
      Neuchatel particularly liked this form of society. “I cannot manage balls,” he used to say,
      “but I like a ministerial reception. There is some chance of sensible conversation and doing a
      little business. I like talking with ambassadors after dinner. Besides, in this country you
      meet the leaders of the opposition, because, as they are not invited by the minister, but by
      his wife, anybody can come without committing himself.”</p>
<p>Myra, faithful to her original resolution, not to enter society while she was in mourning,
      declined all the solicitudes of her friends to accompany them to these assemblies. Mrs.
      Neuchatel always wished Myra should be her substitute, and it was only at Myra’s instance that
      Adriana accompanied her parents. In the meantime, Myra saw much of Endymion. He was always a
      welcome guest by the family, and could call upon his sister at all the odds and ends of time
      that were at his command, and chat with her at pleasant ease in her pretty room. Sometimes
      they walked out together, and sometimes they went together to see some exhibition that
      everybody went to see. Adriana became almost as intimate with Endymion as his sister, and
      altogether the Neuchatel family became by degrees to him as a kind of home. Talking with
      Endymion, Myra heard a good deal of Colonel Albert, for he was her brother’s hero—but she
      rarely saw that gentleman. She was aware from her brother, and from some occasional words of
      Mr. Neuchatel, that the great banker still saw Colonel Albert and not unfrequently, but the
      change of residence from Hainault to London made a difference in their mode of communication.
      Business was transacted in Bishopsgate Street, and no longer combined with a pleasant ride to
      an Essex forest. More than once Colonel Albert had dined in Portland Place, but at irregular
      and miscellaneous parties. Myra observed that he was never asked to meet the grand personages
      who attended the celebrated banquets of Mr. Neuchatel. And why not? His manners were
      distinguished, but his whole bearing that of one accustomed to consideration. The
      irrepressible curiosity of woman impelled her once to feel her way on the subject with Mr.
      Neuchatel, but with the utmost dexterity and delicacy.</p>
<p>“No,” said Mr. Neuchatel with a laughing eye, and who saw through everybody’s purpose,
      though his own manner was one of simplicity amounting almost to innocence, “I did not say
      Colonel Albert was going to dine here on Wednesday; I have asked him to dine here on Sunday.
      On Wednesday I am going to have the premier and some of his colleagues. I must insist upon
      Miss Ferrars dining at table. You will meet Lord Roehampton; all the ladies admire him and he
      admires all the ladies. It will not do to ask Colonel Albert to meet such a party, though
      perhaps,” added Mr. Neuchatel with a merry smile, “some day they may be asked to meet Colonel
      Albert. Who knows, Miss Ferrars? The wheel of Fortune turns round very strangely.”</p>
<p>“And who then is Colonel Albert?” asked Myra with decision.</p>
<p>“Colonel Albert is Colonel Albert, and nobody else, so far as I know,” replied Mr.
      Neuchatel; “he has brought a letter of credit on my house in that name, and I am happy to
      honour his drafts to the amount in question, and as he is a foreigner, I think it is but kind
      and courteous occasionally to ask him to dinner.”</p>
<p>Miss Ferrars did not pursue the inquiry, for she was sufficiently acquainted with Mr.
      Neuchatel to feel that he did not intend to gratify her curiosity.</p>
<p>The banquet of the Neuchatels to the premier, and some of the principal ambassadors and
      their wives, and to those of the premier’s colleagues who were fashionable enough to be asked,
      and to some of the dukes and duchesses and other ethereal beings who supported the ministry,
      was the first event of the season. The table blazed with rare flowers and rarer porcelain and
      precious candelabra of sculptured beauty glittering with light; the gold plate was less
      remarkable than the delicate ware that had been alike moulded and adorned for a Du Barri or a
      Marie Antoinette, and which now found a permanent and peaceful home in the proverbial land of
      purity and order; and amid the stars and ribbons, not the least remarkable feature of the
      whole was Mr. Neuchatel himself, seated at the centre of his table, alike free from
      ostentation or over-deference, talking to the great ladies on each side of him, as if he had
      nothing to do in life but whisper in gentle ears, and partaking of his own dainties as if he
      were eating bread and cheese at a country inn.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mrs. Neuchatel might have afforded a companion picture. Partly in deference to their
      host, and partly because this evening the first dance of the season was to be given, the great
      ladies in general wore their diamonds, and Myra was amused as she watched their dazzling
      tiaras and flashing rivieres, while not a single ornament adorned the graceful presence of
      their hostess, who was more content to be brilliant only by her conversation. As Mr. Neuchatel
      had only a few days before presented his wife with another diamond necklace, he might be
      excused were he slightly annoyed. Nothing of the sort; he only shrugged his shoulders, and
      said to his nephew, “Your aunt must feel that I give her diamonds from love and not from
      vanity, as she never lets me have the pleasure of seeing them.” The sole ornament of Adriana
      was an orchid, which had arrived that morning from Hainault, and she had presented its fellow
      to Myra.</p>
<p>There was one lady who much attracted the attention of Myra, interested in all she observed.
      This lady was evidently a person of importance, for she sate between an ambassador and a
      knight of the garter, and they vied in homage to her. They watched her every word, and seemed
      delighted with all she said. Without being strictly beautiful, there was an expression of
      sweet animation in her physiognomy which was highly attractive: her eye was full of summer
      lightning, and there was an arch dimple in her smile, which seemed to irradiate her whole
      countenance. She was quite a young woman, hardly older than Myra. What most distinguished her
      was the harmony of her whole person; her graceful figure, her fair and finely moulded
      shoulders, her pretty teeth, and her small extremities, seemed to blend with and become the
      soft vivacity of her winning glance.</p>
<p>“Lady Montfort looks well to-night,” said the neighbour of Myra.</p>
<p>“And is that Lady Montfort? Do you know, I never saw her before.”</p>
<p>“Yes; that is the famous Berengaria, the Queen of Society, and the genius of Whiggism.”</p>
<p>In the evening, a great lady, who was held to have the finest voice in society, favoured
      them with a splendid specimen of her commanding skill, and then Adriana was induced to gratify
      her friends with a song, “only one song,” and that only on condition that Myra should
      accompany her. Miss Neuchatel had a sweet and tender voice, and it had been finely cultivated;
      she would have been more than charming if she had only taken interest in anything she herself
      did, or believed for a moment that she could interest others. When she ceased, a gentleman
      approached the instrument and addressed her in terms of sympathy and deferential praise. Myra
      recognised the knight of the garter who had sat next to Lady Montfort. He was somewhat
      advanced in middle life, tall and of a stately presence, with a voice more musical even than
      the tones which had recently enchanted every one. His countenance was impressive, a truly
      Olympian brow, but the lower part of the face indicated not feebleness, but flexibility, and
      his mouth was somewhat sensuous. His manner was at once winning; natural, and singularly
      unaffected, and seemed to sympathise entirely with those whom he addressed.</p>
<p>“But I have never been at Hainault,” said the gentleman, continuing a conversation, “and
      therefore could not hear the nightingales. I am content you have brought one of them to
      town.”</p>
<p>“Nightingales disappear in June,” said Miss Ferrars; “so our season will be short.”</p>
<p>“And where do they travel to?” asked the gentleman.</p>
<p>“Ah! that is a mystery,” said Myra. “You must ask Miss Neuchatel.”</p>
<p>“But she will not tell me,” said the gentleman, for in truth Miss Neuchatel, though he had
      frequently addressed her, had scarcely opened her lips.</p>
<p>“Tell your secret, Adriana,” said Miss Ferrars, trying to force her to converse.</p>
<p>“Adriana!” said the gentleman. “What a beautiful name! You look with that flower, Miss
      Neuchatel, like a bride of Venice.”</p>
<p>“Nay,” said Myra; “the bride of Venice was a stormy ocean.”</p>
<p>“And have you a Venetian name?” asked the gentleman.</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Miss Neuchatel, with an effort, murmured, “She has a very pretty
      name. Her name is Myra.”</p>
<p>“She seems to deserve it,” said the gentleman.</p>
<p>“So you like my daughter’s singing,” said Mr. Neuchatel, coming up to them. “She does not
      much like singing in public, but she is a very good girl, and always gives me a song when I
      come home from business.”</p>
<p>“Fortunate man!” said the gentleman. “I wish somebody would sing to me when I come home from
      business.”</p>
<p>“You should marry, my lord,” said Mr. Neuchatel, “and get your wife to sing to you. Is it
      not so, Miss Ferrars? By the by, I ought to introduce you to—Lord Roehampton.”</p>
