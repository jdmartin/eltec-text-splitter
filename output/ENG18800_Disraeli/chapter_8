<head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
<p>What unexpectedly took place in the southern part of England, and especially in the maritime
      counties, during the autumn of 1830, seemed rather to confirm the intimations of Baron
      Sergius. The people in the rural districts had become disaffected. Their discontent was
      generally attributed to the abuses of the Poor Law, and to the lowness of their wages. But the
      abuses of the Poor Law, though intolerable, were generally in favour of the labourer, and
      though wages in some parts were unquestionably low, it was observed that the tumultuous
      assemblies, ending frequently in riot, were held in districts where this cause did not
      prevail. The most fearful feature of the approaching anarchy was the frequent acts of
      incendiaries. The blazing homesteads baffled the feeble police and the helpless magistrates;
      and the government had reason to believe that foreign agents were actively promoting these
      mysterious crimes.</p>
<p>Amid partial discontent and general dejection came the crash of the Wellington ministry, and
      it required all the inspiration of Zenobia to sustain William Ferrars under the trial. But she
      was undaunted and sanguine as a morning in spring. Nothing could persuade her that the Whigs
      could ever form a government, and she was quite sure that the clerks in the public offices
      alone could turn them out. When the Whig government was formed, and its terrible programme
      announced, she laughed it to scorn, and derided with inexhaustible merriment the idea of the
      House of Commons passing a Reform Bill. She held a great assembly the night that General
      Gascoyne defeated the first measure, and passed an evening of ecstasy in giving and receiving
      congratulations. The morrow brought a graver brow, but still an indomitable spirit, and
      through all these tempestuous times Zenobia never quailed, though mobs burnt the castles of
      dukes and the palaces of bishops.</p>
<p>Serious as was the state of affairs to William Ferrars, his condition was not so desperate
      as that of some of his friends. His seat at least was safe in the new parliament that was to
      pass a Reform Bill. As for the Tories generally, they were swept off the board. Scarcely a
      constituency, in which was a popular element, was faithful to them. The counties in those days
      were the great expounders of popular principles, and whenever England was excited, which was
      rare, she spoke through her freeholders. In this instance almost every Tory knight of the
      shire lost his seat except Lord Chandos, the member for Buckinghamshire, who owed his success
      entirely to his personal popularity. “Never mind,” said Zenobia, “what does it signify? The
      Lords will throw it out.”</p>
<p>And bravely and unceasingly she worked for this end. To assist this purpose it was necessary
      that a lengthened and powerful resistance to the measure should be made in the Commons; that
      the public mind should be impressed with its dangerous principles, and its promoters cheapened
      by the exposure of their corrupt arrangements and their inaccurate details. It must be
      confessed that these objects were resolutely kept in view, and that the Tory opposition
      evinced energy and abilities not unworthy of a great parliamentary occasion. Ferrars
      particularly distinguished himself. He rose immensely in the estimation of the House, and soon
      the public began to talk of him. His statistics about the condemned boroughs were astounding
      and unanswerable: he was the only man who seemed to know anything of the elements of the new
      ones. He was as eloquent too as exact,—sometimes as fervent as Burke, and always as accurate
      as Cocker.</p>
<p>“I never thought it was in William Ferrars,” said a member, musingly, to a companion as they
      walked home one night; “I always thought him a good man of business, and all that sort of
      thing—but, somehow or other, I did not think this was in him.”</p>
<p>“Well, he has a good deal at stake, and that brings it out of a fellow,” said his
      friend.</p>
<p>It was, however, pouring water upon sand. Any substantial resistance to the measure was from
      the first out of the question. Lord Chandos accomplished the only important feat, and that was
      the enfranchisement of the farmers. This perpetual struggle, however, occasioned a vast deal
      of excitement, and the actors in it often indulged in the wild credulity of impossible
      expectations. The saloon of Zenobia was ever thronged, and she was never more confident than
      when the bill passed the Commons. She knew that the King would never give his assent to the
      bill. His Majesty had had quite enough of going down in hackney coaches to carry revolutions.
      After all, he was the son of good King George, and the court would save the country, as it had
      often done before. “But it will not come to that,” she added. “The Lords will do their
      duty.”</p>
<p>“But Lord Waverley tells me,” said Ferrars, “that there are forty of them who were against
      the bill last year who will vote for the second reading.”</p>
<p>“Never mind Lord Waverley and such addlebrains,” said Zenobia, with a smile of triumphant
      mystery. “So long as we have the court, the Duke, and Lord Lyndhurst on our side, we can
      afford to laugh at such conceited poltroons. His mother was my dearest friend, and I know he
      used to have fits. Look bright,” she continued; “things never were better. Before a week has
      passed these people will be nowhere.”</p>
<p>“But how it is possible?”</p>
<p>“Trust me.”</p>
<p>“I always do—and yet”——</p>
<p>“You never were nearer being a cabinet minister,” she said, with a radiant glance.</p>
<p>And Zenobia was right. Though the government, with the aid of the waverers, carried the
      second reading of the bill, a week afterwards, on May 7, Lord Lyndhurst rallied the waverers
      again to his standard and carried his famous resolution, that the enfranchising clauses should
      precede the disenfranchisement in the great measure. Lord Grey and his colleagues resigned,
      and the King sent for Lord Lyndhurst. The bold chief baron advised His Majesty to consult the
      Duke of Wellington, and was himself the bearer of the King’s message to Apsley House. The Duke
      found the King “in great distress,” and he therefore did not hesitate in promising to
      endeavour to form a ministry.</p>
<p>“Who was right?” said Zenobia to Mr. Ferrars. “He is so busy he could not write to you, but
      he told me to tell you to call at Apsley House at twelve to-morrow. You will be in the
      cabinet.”</p>
<p>“I have got it at last!” said Ferrars to himself. “It is worth living for and at any peril.
      All the cares of life sink into insignificance under such circumstances. The difficulties are
      great, but their very greatness will furnish the means of their solution. The Crown cannot be
      dragged in the mud, and the Duke was born for conquest.”</p>
<p>A day passed, and another day, and Ferrars was not again summoned. The affair seemed to hang
      fire. Zenobia was still brave, but Ferrars, who knew her thoroughly, could detect her lurking
      anxiety. Then she told him in confidence that Sir Robert made difficulties, “but there is
      nothing in it,” she added. “The Duke has provided for everything, and he means Sir Robert to
      be Premier. He could not refuse that; it would be almost an act of treason.” Two days after
      she sent for Mr. Ferrars, early in the morning, and received him in her boudoir. Her
      countenance was excited, but serious. “Don’t be alarmed,” she said; “nothing will prevent a
      government being formed, but Sir Robert has thrown us over; I never had confidence in him. It
      is most provoking, as Mr. Baring had joined us, and it was such a good name for the City. But
      the failure of one man is the opportunity of another. We want a leader in the House of
      Commons. He must be a man who can speak; of experience, who knows the House, its forms, and
      all that. There is only one man indicated. You cannot doubt about him. I told you honours
      would be tumbling on your head. You are the man; you are to have one of the highest offices in
      the cabinet, and lead the House of Commons.”</p>
<p>“Peel declines,” said Ferrars, speaking slowly and shaking his head. “That is very
      serious.”</p>
<p>“For himself,” said Zenobia, “not for you. It makes your fortune.”</p>
<p>“The difficulties seem too great to contend with.”</p>
<p>“What difficulties are there? You have got the court, and you have got the House of Lords.
      Mr. Pitt was not nearly so well off, for he had never been in office, and had at the same time
      to fight Lord North and that wicked Mr. Fox, the orator of the day, while you have only got
      Lord Althorp, who can’t order his own dinner.”</p>
<p>“I am in amazement,” said Ferrars, and he seemed plunged in thought.</p>
<p>“But you do not hesitate?”</p>
<p>“No,” he said, looking up dreamily, for he had been lost in abstraction; and speaking in a
      measured and hollow voice, “I do not hesitate.” Then resuming a brisk tone he said, “This is
      not an age for hesitation; if asked, I will do the deed.”</p>
<p>At this moment there was a tap at the door, and the groom of the chambers brought in a note
      for Mr. Ferrars, which had been forwarded from his own residence, and which requested his
      presence at Apsley House. Having read it, he gave it to Zenobia, who exclaimed with delight,
      “Do not lose a moment. I am so glad to have got rid of Sir Robert with his doubts and his
      difficulties. We want new blood.”</p>
<p>That was a wonderful walk for William Ferrars, from St. James’ Square to Apsley House. As he
      moved along, he was testing his courage and capacity for the sharp trials that awaited him. He
      felt himself not unequal to conjectures in which he had never previously indulged even in
      imagination. His had been an ambitious, rather than a soaring spirit. He had never
      contemplated the possession of power except under the aegis of some commanding chief. Now it
      was for him to control senates and guide councils. He screwed himself up to the
      sticking-point. Desperation is sometimes as powerful an inspirer as genius.</p>
<p>The great man was alone,—calm, easy, and courteous. He had sent for Mr. Ferrars, because
      having had one interview with him, in which his co-operation had been requested in the conduct
      of affairs, the Duke thought it was due to him to give him the earliest intimation of the
      change of circumstances. The vote of the house of Commons on the motion of Lord Ebrington had
      placed an insurmountable barrier to the formation of a government, and his Grace had
      accordingly relinquished the commission with which he had been entrusted by the King.</p>
