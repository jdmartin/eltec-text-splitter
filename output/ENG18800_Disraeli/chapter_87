<head>CHAPTER XIX</head>
<p>As time flew on, the friends of Lady Roehampton thought and spoke, with anxiety about her
      re-entrance into society. Mr. Sidney Wilton had lent Gaydene to her for the autumn, when he
      always visited Scotland, and the winter had passed away uninterruptedly, at a charming and
      almost unknown watering-place, where she seemed the only visitant, and where she wandered
      about in silence on the sands. The time was fast approaching when the inevitable year of
      seclusion would expire, and Lady Roehampton gave no indication of any change in her life and
      habits. At length, after many appeals, and expostulations, and entreaties, and little scenes,
      the second year of the widowhood having advanced some months, it was decided that Lady
      Roehampton should re-enter society, and the occasion on which this was to take place was no
      mean one.</p>
<p>Lady Montfort was to give a ball early in June, and Royalty itself was to be her guests. The
      entertainments at Montfort House were always magnificent, but this was to exceed accustomed
      splendour. All the world was to be there, and all the world, who were not invited, were in as
      much despair as if they had lost their fortune or their character.</p>
<p>Lady Roehampton had a passion for light, provided the light was not supplied by gas or oil.
      Her saloons, even when alone, were always brilliantly illuminated. She held that the moral
      effect of such a circumstance on her temperament was beneficial, and not slight. It is a rare,
      but by no means a singular, belief. When she descended into her drawing-room on the critical
      night, its resplendence was some preparation for the scene which awaited her. She stood for a
      moment before the tall mirror which reflected her whole person. What were her thoughts? What
      was the impression that the fair vision conveyed?</p>
<p>Her countenance was grave, but it was not sad. Myra had now completed, or was on the point
      of completing, her thirtieth year. She was a woman of transcendent beauty; perhaps she might
      justly be described as the most beautiful woman then alive. Time had even improved her
      commanding mien, the graceful sweep of her figure and the voluptuous undulation of her
      shoulders; but time also had spared those charms which are more incidental to early youth, the
      splendour of her complexion, the whiteness of her teeth, and the lustre of her violet eyes.
      She had cut off in her grief the profusion of her dark chestnut locks, that once reached to
      her feet, and she wore her hair as, what was then and perhaps is now called, a crop, but it
      was luxuriant in natural quantity and rich in colour, and most effectively set off her arched
      brow, and the oval of her fresh and beauteous cheek. The crop was crowned to-night by a
      coronet of brilliants.</p>
<p>“Your carriage is ready, my lady,” said a servant; “but there is a gentleman below who has
      brought a letter for your ladyship, and which, he says, he must personally deliver to you,
      madam. I told him your ladyship was going out and could not see him, but he put his card in
      this envelope, and requested that I would hand it to you, madam. He says he will only deliver
      the letter to your ladyship, and not detain you a moment.”</p>
<p>Lady Roehampton opened the envelope, and read the card, “The Duke of St. Angelo.”</p>
<p>“The Duke of St. Angelo!” she murmured to herself, and looked for a moment abstracted. Then
      turning to the servant, she said, “He must be shown up.”</p>
<p>“Madam,” said the duke as he entered, and bowed with much ceremony, “I am ashamed of
      appearing to be an intruder, but my commands were to deliver this letter to your ladyship
      immediately on my arrival, whatever the hour. I have only this instant arrived. We had a bad
      passage. I know your ladyship’s carriage is at the door. I will redeem my pledge and not
      trespass on your time for one instant. If your ladyship requires me, I am ever at your
      command.”</p>
<p>“At Carlton Gardens?”</p>
<p>“No; at our embassy.”</p>
<p>“His Majesty, I hope, is well?”</p>
<p>“In every sense, my lady,” and bowing to the ground the duke withdrew.</p>
<p>She broke the seal of the letter while still standing, and held it to a sconce that was on
      the mantel-piece, and then she read:</p>
<p>“You were the only person I called upon when I suddenly left England. I had no hope of
      seeing you, but it was the homage of gratitude and adoration. Great events have happened since
      we last met. I have realised my dreams, dreams which I sometimes fancied you, and you alone,
      did not depreciate or discredit, and, in the sweetness of your charity, would not have been
      sorry were they accomplished.</p>
<p>“I have established what I believe to be a strong and just government in a great kingdom. I
      have not been uninfluenced by the lessons of wisdom I gained in your illustrious land. I have
      done some things which it was a solace for me to believe you would not altogether
      disapprove.</p>
<p>“My subjects are anxious that the dynasty I have re-established should not be evanescent. Is
      it too bold to hope that I may find a companion in you to charm and to counsel me? I can offer
      you nothing equal to your transcendent merit, but I can offer you the heart and the throne
      of</p>
<p>“Florestan.”</p>
<p>Still holding the letter in one hand, she looked around as if some one might be present. Her
      cheek was scarlet, and there was for a moment an expression of wildness in her glance. Then
      she paced the saloon with an agitated step, and then she read the letter again and again, and
      still she paced the saloon. The whole history of her life revolved before her; every scene,
      every character, every thought, and sentiment, and passion. The brightness of her nursery
      days, and Hurstley with all its miseries, and Hainault with its gardens, and the critical
      hour, which had opened to her a future of such unexpected lustre and happiness.</p>
<p>The clock had struck more than once during this long and terrible soliloquy, wherein she had
      to search and penetrate her inmost heart, and now it struck two. She started, and hurriedly
      rang the bell.</p>
<p>“I shall not want the carriage to-night,” she said, and when again alone, she sat down and,
      burying her face in her alabaster arms, for a long time remained motionless.</p>
