<p>Mr. Bultitude had meant to achieve a double stroke of diplomacy—to undeceive Dulcie and
     conciliate the lovesick Tipping. But whatever his success may have been in the former respect,
     the latter object failed conspicuously.</p>
<p>"You shan't get off by a shabby trick like that," said Tipping, exasperated by the sight of
     Dulcie's emotion; "you've made her cry now, and you shall smart for it. So, now, are you going
     to stand up to me like a man, or will you take a licking?"</p>
<p>"I'm not going to help you to commit a breach of the peace," said Paul with great dignity.
     "Go away, you quarrelsome young ruffian! Get one of your schoolfellows to fight you, if you
     must fight. I don't want to be mixed up with you in any way."</p>
<p>But at this Tipping, whose blood was evidently at boiling point, came prancing down on him in
     a Zulu-like fashion, swinging his long arms like a windmill, and finding that his enemy made no
     attempt at receiving him, but only moved away apprehensively, he seized him by the collar as a
     prelude to dealing him a series of kicks behind.</p>
<p>
<pb n="147"/></p>
<p>Although Mr. Bultitude, as we have seen, was opposed to fighting as a system he could not
     submit to this sort of thing without at least some attempt to defend himself; and judging it of
     the highest importance to disable his adversary in the most effectual manner before the latter
     had time to carry out his offensive designs, he turned sharply round and hit him a very severe
     blow in the lower part of his waistcoat.</p>
<p>The result fulfilled his highest expectations. Tipping collapsed like a pocket-rule, and
     staggered away speechless, and purple with pain, while Paul stood calm and triumphant. He had
     shown these fellows that he wasn't going to stand any nonsense. They would leave him alone
     after this, perhaps.</p>
<p>But once more there were cries and murmurs of "Shame!" "No hitting below the belt!"
     "Cad—coward!"</p>
<p>It appeared that, somehow, he had managed to offend their prejudices even in this. "It's very
     odd," he thought; "when I didn't fight they called me a coward, and now, when I do, I don't
     seem to have pleased them much. I don't care, though. I've settled <hi>him</hi>."</p>
<p>But after a season of protracted writhing by the parallel bars, Tipping came out, still
     gasping and deadly pale, leaning on Biddlecomb's shoulder, and was met with universal sympathy
     and condolence.</p>
<p>"Thanks!" he said with considerable effort. "Of course—I'm not going—to fight him after a low
     trick like that; but perhaps you fellows will see that he doesn't escape quite as easily as he
     fancies?"</p>
<p>There was a general shout. "No; he shall pay for it! We'll teach him to fight fair! We'll see
     if he tries that on again!"</p>
<p>Paul heard it with much uneasiness. What new devilry were they about to practise upon him? He
     was not left long in doubt.</p>
<p>"I vote," suggested Biddlecomb, as if he were proposing a testimonial, "we make him run the gauntlet.
     <pb n="148"/> Grim won't come out and catch us. I saw him go out for a drive an hour ago." And
     the idea was very favourably entertained.</p>
<p>Paul had heard of "running the gauntlet," and dimly suspected that it was not an experience
     he was likely to enjoy, particularly when he saw everyone busying himself with tying the end of
     his pocket-handkerchief into a hard knot. He tried in vain to excuse himself, declaring again
     and again that he had never meant to injure the boy. He had only defended himself, and was
     under the impression that he was at perfect liberty to hit him wherever he could, and so on.
     But they were in no mood for excuses.</p>
<p>With a stern magisterial formality worthy of a Vehm-Gericht, they formed in two long lines
     down the centre of the playground; and while Paul was still staring in wonder at what this
     strange manœuvre might mean, somebody pounced upon him and carried him up to one end of the
     ranks, where Tipping had by this time sufficiently recovered to be able to "set him going," as
     he chose to call it, with a fairly effective kick.</p>
<p>After that he had a confused sense of flying madly along the double line of avengers under a
     hail of blows which caught him on every part of his head, shoulders, and back till he reached
     the end, where he was dexterously turned and sent spinning up to Tipping again, who in his turn
     headed him back on his arrival, and forced him to brave the terrible lane once more.</p>
<p>Never before had Mr. Bultitude felt so sore and insulted. But they kept it up long after the
     thing had lost its first freshness—until at last exhaustion made them lean to mercy, and they
     cuffed him ignominiously into a corner, and left him to lament his ill-treatment there till the
     bell rang for dinner, for which, contrary to precedent, his recent violent exercise had excited
     little appetite.</p>
<p>"I shall be killed soon if I stay here," he moaned; "I know I shall. These young brigands
     would murder me
     <pb n="149"/> cheerfully, if they were not afraid of being caned for it. I'm a miserable man,
     and I wish I was dead!"</p>
<p>Although that afternoon, being Saturday, was a half-holiday, Mr. Bultitude was spared the
     ordeal of another game at football; for a smart storm of rain and sleet coming on about three
     o'clock kept the school—not altogether unwilling prisoners—within doors for the day.</p>
<p>The boys sat in their places in their schoolroom, amusing themselves after their several
     fashions—some reading, some making libellous copies of drawings that took their fancy in the
     illustrated papers, some playing games; others, too listless to play and too dull to find
     pleasure in the simplest books, filled up the time as well as they could by quarrelling and
     getting into various depths of hot water. Paul sat in a corner pretending to read a story
     relating the experiences of certain infants of phenomenal courage and coolness in the Arctic
     regions. They killed bears and tamed walruses all through the book; but for the first time,
     perhaps, since their appearance in print their exploits fell flat. Not, however, that this
     reflected any discredit upon the author's powers, which are justly admired by all
     healthy-minded boys; but it was beyond the power of literature just then to charm Mr.
     Bultitude's thoughts from the recollection of his misfortunes.</p>
<p>As he took in all the details of his surroundings—the warm close room; the raw-toned desks
     and tables at which a rabble of unsympathetic boys were noisily whispering and chattering, with
     occasional glances in his direction, from which, taught by experience, he augured no good; the
     high uncurtained windows, blurred with little stars of half-frozen rain, and the bare, bleak
     branches of the trees outside tossing drearily against a low leaden sky—he tried in vain to
     cheat himself into a dreamy persuasion that all this misery could not be real, but would fade
     away as suddenly and mysteriously as it had stolen upon him.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the afternoon the Doctor came
     <pb n="150"/> in and took his place at the writing-table, where he was apparently very busy
     with the composition of some sort of document, which he finished at last with evident
     satisfaction at the result of his labour. Then he observed that, according to their custom of a
     Saturday afternoon, the hour before tea-time should be devoted to "writing home."</p>
<p>So the books, chess-boards, and dominoes were all put away, and a new steel pen and a sheet
     of notepaper, neatly embossed with the heading "Crichton House School" in old English letters,
     having been served out to everyone, each boy prepared himself to write down such things as
     filial affection, strict truthfulness, and the desire of imparting information might inspire
     between them.</p>
<p>Paul felt, as he clutched his writing materials, much as a shipwrecked mariner might be
     expected to do at finding on his desolate island a good-sized flag and a case of rockets. His
     hopes revived once more; he forgot the smarts left by the knots in the handkerchiefs, he had a
     whole hour before him—it was possible to set several wires in motion for his release in an
     hour.</p>
<p>Yes, he must write several letters. First, one to his solicitor detailing, as calmly and
     concisely as his feelings would allow, the shameful way in which he had been treated, and
     imploring him to take measures of some sort for getting him out of his false and awkward
     position; one to his head clerk, to press upon him the necessity of prudence and caution in
     dealing with the impostor; notes to Bangle and Fishwick putting them off—they should not be
     outraged by an introduction to a vulgar pantomime clown under his roof; and lastly (this was an
     outburst he could not deny himself), a solemn impressive appeal to the common humanity, if not
     to the ordinary filial instincts, of his undutiful son.</p>
<p>His fingers tingled to begin. Sentences of burning, indignant eloquence crowded confusedly
     into his head—he would write such letters as would carry instant
     <pb n="151"/>conviction to the most practical and matter-of-fact minds. The pathos and dignity
     of his remonstrances should melt even Dick's selfish, callous heart.</p>
<p>Perhaps he overrated the power of his pen—perhaps it would have required more than mere ink
     to persuade his friends to disbelieve their own senses, and see a portly citizen of over fifty
     packed into the frame of a chubby urchin of fourteen. But, at all events, no one's faith was
     put to so hard a test—those letters were never written.</p>
<p>"Don't begin to write yet, any of you," said the Doctor; "I have a few words to say to you
     first. In most cases, and as a general rule, I think it wisest to let every boy commit to paper
     whatever his feelings may dictate to him. I wish to claim no censorship over the style and
     diction of your letters. But there have been so many complaints lately from the parents of some
     of the less advanced of you, that I find myself obliged to make a change. Your father
     particularly, Richard Bultitude," he added, turning suddenly upon the unlucky Paul, "has
     complained bitterly of the slovenly tone and phrasing of your correspondence; he said very
     justly that they would disgrace a stable-boy, and unless I could induce you to improve them, he
     begged he might not be annoyed by them in future."</p>
<p>It was by no means the least galling part of Mr. Bultitude's trials, that former forgotten
     words and deeds of his in his original condition were constantly turning up at critical
     seasons, and plunging him deeper into the morass just when he saw some prospect of gaining firm
     ground.</p>
<p>So, on this occasion, he did remember that, being in a more than usually bad temper one day
     last year, he had, on receiving a sprawling, ill-spelt application from Dick for more
     pocket-money, to buy fireworks for the 5th of November, written to make some such complaint to
     the schoolmaster. He waited anxiously for the Doctor's next words; he might want to read the letters
     <pb n="152"/> before they were sent off, in which case Paul would not be displeased, for it
     would be an easier and less dangerous way of putting the Doctor in possession of the facts.</p>
<p>But his complaints were to be honoured by a much more effectual remedy, for it naturally
     piqued the Doctor to be told that boys instructed under his auspices wrote like stable-boys.
     "However," he went on, "I wish your people at home to be assured from time to time of your
     welfare, and to prevent them from being shocked and distressed in future by the crudity of your
     communications, I have drawn up a short form of letter for the use of the lower boys in the
     second form—which I shall now proceed to dictate. Of course all boys in the first form, and all
     in the second above Bultitude and Jolland, will write as they please, as usual. Richard, I
     expect you to take particular pains to write this out neatly. Are you all ready? Very well
     then, ... now;" and he read out the following letter, slowly—</p>
<p>"My dear Parents (or parent according to circumstances) comma" (all of which several took
     down most industriously)—"You will be rejoiced to hear that, having arrived with safety at our
     destination, we have by this time fully resumed our customary regular round of earnest work
     relieved and sweetened by hearty play. ('Have you all got "hearty play" down?'" inquired the
     Doctor rather suspiciously, while Jolland observed in an undertone that it would take some time
     to get <hi>that</hi> down.) "I hope, I trust I may say without undue conceit, to have made
     considerable progress in my school-tasks before I rejoin the family circle for the Easter
     vacation, as I think you will admit when I inform you of the programme we intend" ('D.V. in
     brackets and capital letters'—as before, this was taken down verbatim by Jolland, who probably
     knew very much better), "intend to work out during the term.</p>
<p>"In Latin, the class of which I am a member propose to thoroughly master the first book of
     Virgil's magnificent Epic, need I say I refer to the soul-moving story of
     <pb n="153"/> the Pious Æneas?" (Jolland was understood by his near neighbours to remark that
     he thought the explanation distinctly advisable), "whilst, in Greek, we have already commenced
     the thrilling account of the 'Anabasis' of Xenophon, that master of strategy! nor shall we, of
     course, neglect in either branch of study the syntax and construction of those two noble
     languages"—("noble languages," echoed the writers mechanically, contriving to insinuate a touch
     of irony into the words).</p>
<p>"In German under the able tutelage of Herr Stohwasser, who, as I may possibly have mentioned
     to you in casual conversation, is a graduate of the University of Heidelberg" ("and a silly old
     hass," added Jolland parenthetically), "we have resigned ourselves to the spell of the
     Teutonian Shakespeare" (there was much difference of opinion as to the manner of spelling the
     "Teutonian Shakespeare"), "as, in my opinion, Schiller may be not inaptly termed, and our
     French studies comprise such exercises, and short poems and tales, as are best calculated to
     afford an insight into the intricacies of the Gallic tongue.</p>
<p>"But I would not have you imagine, my dear parents (or parent, as before), that, because the
     claims of the intellect have been thus amply provided for, the requirements of the body are
     necessarily overlooked!</p>
<p>"I have no intention of becoming a mere bookworm, and, on the contrary, we have had one
     excessively brisk and pleasant game at football already this season, and should, but for the
     unfortunate inclemency of the weather, have engaged again this afternoon in the mimic
     warfare.</p>
<p>"In the playground our favourite diversion is the game of 'chevy,' so called from the
     engagement famed in ballad and history (I allude to the battle of Chevy Chase), and indeed, my
     dear parents, in the rapid alternations of its fortunes and the diversity of its incident, the
     game (to my mind) bears a striking resemblance to the accounts of that ever-memorable
     contest.</p>
<p>
<pb n="154"/></p>
<p>"I fear I must now relinquish my pen, as the time allotted for correspondence is fast waning
     to its close, and tea-time is approaching. Pray give my kindest remembrance to all my numerous
     friends and relatives, and accept my fondest love and affection for yourselves, and the various
     other members of the family circle.</p>
<p>"I am, I am rejoiced to say, in the enjoyment of excellent health, and surrounded as I am by
     congenial companions, and employed in interesting and agreeable pursuits, it is superfluous to
     add that I am happy.</p>
<p>"And now, my dear parents, believe me, your dutiful and affectionate son, so and so."</p>
<p>The Doctor finished his dictation with a roll in his voice, as much as to say, "I think that
     will strike your respective parents as a chaste and classical composition; I think so!"</p>
<p>But unexceptionable as its tone and sentiments undoubtedly were, it was far from expressing
     the feelings of Mr. Bultitude. The rest accepted it not unwillingly as an escape from the
     fatigue of original composition, but to him the neat, well-balanced sentences seemed a hollow
     mockery. As he wrote down each successive phrase, he wondered what Dick would think of it, and
     when at last it was finished, the precious hour had gone for another week!</p>
<p>In speechless disgust but without protest, for his spirit was too broken by this last cruel
     disappointment, he had to fold, put into an envelope and direct this most misleading letter
     under the Doctor's superintending eye, which of course allowed him no chance of introducing a
     line or even a word to counteract the tone of self-satisfaction and contentment which breathed
     in every sentence of it.</p>
<p>He saw it stamped, and put into the postbag, and then his last gleam of hope flickered out;
     he must give up struggling against the Inevitable; he must resign himself to be educated, and
     perhaps flogged here, while Dick was filling his house with clowns and pantaloons,
     <pb n="155"/> destroying his reputation and damaging his credit at home. Perhaps, in course of
     time, he would grow accustomed to it, and, meanwhile, he would be as careful as possible to do
     and say nothing to make himself remarkable in any way, by which means he trusted, at least, to
     avoid any fresh calamity.</p>
<p>And with this resolution he went to bed on Saturday night, feeling that this was a dreary
     finish to a most unpleasant week.</p>
