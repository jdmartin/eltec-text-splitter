<head>2. A Grand Transformation Scene</head>
<quote>
<p>"Magnaque numinibus vota exaudita malignis."</p></quote>
<p>Paul Bultitude put on his glasses to examine the stone more carefully, for it was some time
     since he had last seen or thought about it. Then he looked up and said once more, "What use
     would a thing like this be to you?"</p>
<p>Dick would have considered it a very valuable prize
     <pb n="16"/> indeed; he could have exhibited it to admiring friends—during lessons, of course,
     when it would prove a most agreeable distraction; he could have played with and fingered it
     incessantly, invented astonishing legends of its powers and virtues; and, at last, when he had
     grown tired of it, have bartered it for any more desirable article that might take his fancy.
     All these advantages were present to his mind in a vague shifting form, but he could not find
     either courage or words to explain them.</p>
<p>Consequently he only said awkwardly, "Oh, I don't know, I should like it."</p>
<p>"Well, any way," said Paul, "you certainly won't have it. It's worth keeping, whatever it is,
     as the only thing your uncle Marmaduke was ever known to give to anybody."</p>
<p>Marmaduke Paradine, his brother-in-law, was not a connection of whom he had much reason to
     feel particularly proud. One of those persons endowed with what are known as "insinuating
     manners and address," he had, after some futile attempts to enter the army, been sent out to
     Bombay as agent for a Manchester firm, and in that capacity had contrived to be mixed up in
     some more than shady transactions with rival exporters and native dealers up the country, which
     led to an unceremonious dismissal by his employers.</p>
<p>He had brought home the stone from India as a propitiatory token of remembrance, more
     portable and less expensive than the lacquered cabinets, brasses, stuffs and carved work which
     are expected from friends at such a distance, and he had been received with pardon and started
     once more, until certain other proceedings of his, shadier still, had obliged Paul to forbid
     him the house at Westbourne Terrace.</p>
<p>Since then little had been heard of him, and the reports which reached Mr. Bultitude of his
     disreputable relative's connection with the promotion of a series of companies of the kind
     affected by the widow and curate,
     <pb n="17"/> and exposed in money articles and law courts, gave him no desire to renew his
     acquaintance.</p>
<p>"Isn't it a talisman, though?" said Dick, rather unfortunately for any hopes he might have of
     persuading his father to entrust him with the coveted treasure.</p>
<p>"I'm sure I can't tell you," yawned Paul, "how do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, only Uncle Duke once said something about it. Barbara heard him tell mamma. I
     say, perhaps it's like the one in Scott, and cures people of things, though I don't think it's
     that sort of talisman either, because I tried it once on my chilblains, and it wasn't a bit of
     good. If you would only let me have it, perhaps I might find out, you know."</p>
<p>"You might," said his father drily, apparently not much influenced by this inducement, "but
     you won't have the chance. If it has a secret, I will find it out for myself" (he little knew
     how literally he was to be taken at his word), "and, by the way, there's your cab—at last."</p>
<p>There was a sound of wheels outside, and, as Dick heard them, he grew desperate in his
     extremity; a wish he had long secretly cherished unspoken, without ever hoping for courage to
     give it words, rose to his lips now; he got up and moved timidly towards his father.</p>
<p>"Father," he said, "there's something I want to say to you so much before I go. Do let me ask
     you now."</p>
<p>"Well, what is it?" said Paul. "Make haste, you haven't much time."</p>
<p>"It's this. I want you to—to let me leave Grimstone's at the end of the term."</p>
<p>Paul stared at him, angry and incredulous, "Let you leave Dr. Grimstone's (oblige me by
     giving him his full title when you speak of him)," he said slowly. "Why, what do you mean? It's
     an excellent school—never saw a better expressed prospectus in my life. And my old friend
     Bangle, Sir Benjamin Bangle, who's a member of the School Board, and ought to know
     <pb n="18"/>something about schools, strongly recommended it—would have sent his own son there,
     if he hadn't entered him at Eton. And when I pay for most of the extras for you too. Dancing,
     by Gad, and meat for breakfast. I'm sure I don't know what you would have."</p>
<p>"I'd like to go to Marlborough, or Harrow, or somewhere," whimpered Dick. "Jolland's going to
     Harrow at Easter. (Jolland's one of the fellows at Grimstone's—Dr. Grimstone's I mean.) And
     what does old Bangle know about it? He hasn't got to go there himself! And—and Grimstone's
     jolly enough to fellows he likes, but he doesn't like <hi>me</hi>—he's always sitting on me for
     something—and I hate some of the fellows there, and altogether it's beastly. Do let me leave!
     If you don't want me to go to a public school, I—I could stop at home and have a private
     tutor—like Joe Twitterley!"</p>
<p>"It's all ridiculous nonsense, I tell you," said Paul angrily, "ridiculous nonsense! And,
     once for all, I'll put a stop to it. I don't approve of public schools for boys like you, and,
     what's more, I can't afford it. As for private tutors, that's absurd! So you will just make up
     your mind to stay at Crichton House as long as I think proper to keep you there, and there's an
     end of that!"</p>
<p>At this final blow to all his hopes, Dick began to sob in a subdued hopeless kind of way,
     which was more than his father could bear. To do Paul justice, he had not meant to be quite so
     harsh when the boy was about to set out for school, and, a little ashamed of his irritation, he
     sought to justify his decision.</p>
<p>He chose to do this by delivering a short homily on the advantages of school, by which he
     might lead Dick to look on the matter in the calm light of reason and common sense, and
     commonplaces on the subject began to rise to the surface of his mind, from the rather muddy
     depths to which they had long since sunk.</p>
<p>He began to give Dick the benefit of all this stagnant wisdom, with a feeling of surprise as
     he went on, at his own powerful and original way of putting things.</p>
<p>
<pb n="19"/></p>
<p>"Now, you know, it's no use to cry like that," he began. "It's—ah—the usual thing for boys at
     school, I'm quite aware, to go about fancying they're very ill-used, and miserable, and all the
     rest of it, just as if people in my position had their sons educated out of spite! It's one of
     those petty troubles all boys have to go through. And you mark my words, my boy, when they go
     out into the world and have real trials to put up with, and grow middle-aged men, like me, why,
     they see what fools they've been, Dick; they see what fools they've been. All the—hum, the
     innocent games and delights of boyhood, and that sort of thing, you know—come back to them—and
     then they look back to those hours passed at school as the happiest, aye, the very happiest
     time of their life!"</p>
<p>"Well," said Dick, "then I hope it won't be the happiest time in mine, that's all! And you
     may have been happy at the school you went to, perhaps, but I don't believe you would very much
     care about being a boy again like me, and going back to Grimstone's, you know you
     wouldn't!"</p>
<p>This put Paul on his mettle; he had warmed well to his subject, and could not let this open
     challenge pass unnoticed—it gave him such an opening for a cheap and easy effect.</p>
<p>He still had the stone in his hand as he sank back into his chair, smiling with a tolerant
     superiority.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you will believe me," he said, impressively, "when I tell you, old as I am and much
     as you envy me, I only wish, at this very moment, I could be a boy again, like you. Going back
     to school wouldn't make me unhappy, I can tell you."</p>
<p>It is so fatally easy to say more than we mean in the desire to make as strong an impression
     as possible. Well for most of us that—more fortunate than Mr. Bultitude—we can generally do so
     without fear of being taken too strictly at our word.</p>
<p>As he spoke these unlucky words, he felt a slight
     <pb n="20"/> shiver, followed by a curious shrinking sensation all over him. It was odd, too,
     but the arm-chair in which he sat seemed to have grown so much bigger all at once. He felt a
     passing surprise, but concluded it must be fancy, and went on as comfortably as before.</p>
<p>"I should like it, my boy, but what's the good of wishing? I only mention it to prove that I
     was not speaking at random. I'm an old man and you're a young boy, and, that being so, why, of
     course—What the dooce are you giggling about?"</p>
<p>For Dick, after some seconds of half-frightened open-mouthed staring, had suddenly burst into
     a violent fit of almost hysterical giggling, which he seemed trying vainly to suppress.</p>
<p>This naturally annoyed Mr. Bultitude, and he went on with immense dignity, "I—ah—I'm not
     aware that I've been saying anything particularly ridiculous. You seem to be amused?"</p>
<p>"Don't!" gasped Dick. "It, it isn't anything you're saying—it's, it's—oh, can't you feel any
     difference?"</p>
<p>"The sooner you go back to school the better!" said Paul angrily. "I wash my hands of you.
     When I do take the trouble to give you any advice, it's received with ridicule. You always were
     an ill-mannered little cub. I've had quite enough of this. Leave the room, sir!"</p>
<p>The wheels must have belonged to some other cab, for none had stopped at the pavement as yet;
     but Mr. Bultitude was justly indignant, and could stand the interview no longer. Dick, however,
     made no attempt to move; he remained there, choking and shaking with laughter, while his father
     sat stiffly on his chair, trying to ignore his son's unmannerly conduct, but only partially
     succeeding.</p>
<p>No one can calmly endure watching other people laughing at him like idiots, while he is left
     perfectly incapable of guessing what he has said or done to amuse
     <pb n="21"/> them. Even when this is known, it requires a peculiarly keen sense of humour to
     see the point of a joke against oneself.</p>
<p>At last his patience gave out, and he said coldly, "Now, perhaps, if you are quite yourself
     again, you will be good enough to let me know what the joke is?"</p>
<p>Dick, looking flushed and half-ashamed, tried again and again to speak, but each time the
     attempt was too much for him. After a time he did succeed, but his voice was hoarse and shaken
     with laughter as he spoke. "Haven't you found it out yet? Go and look at yourself in the
     glass—it will make you roar!"</p>
<p>There was the usual narrow sheet of plate glass at the back of the sideboard, and to this Mr.
     Bultitude walked, almost under protest, and with a cold dignity. It occurred to him that he
     might have a smudge on his face or something wrong with his collar and tie—something to account
     to some extent for his son's frivolous and insulting behaviour. No suspicion of the terrible
     truth crossed his mind as yet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dick was looking on eagerly with a chuckle of anticipation, as one who watches the
     dawning appreciation of an excellent joke.</p>
<p>But no sooner had Paul met the reflection in the glass than he started back in incredulous
     horror—then returned and stared again and again.</p>
<p>Surely, surely, this could not be he!</p>
<p>He had expected to see his own familiar portly bow-windowed presence there—but somehow, look
     as he would, the mirror insisted upon reflecting the figure of his son Dick. Could he possibly
     have become invisible and have lost the power of casting a reflection—or how was it that Dick,
     and only Dick, was to be seen there?</p>
<p>How was it, too, when he looked round, there was the boy still sitting there? It could not be
     Dick, evidently, that he saw in the glass. Besides, the
     <pb n="22"/> reflection opposite him moved when he moved, returned when he returned, copied his
     every gesture!</p>
<p>He turned round upon his son with angry and yet hopeful suspicion. "You, you've been playing
     some of your infernal tricks with this mirror, sir," he cried fiercely. "What have you done to
     it?"</p>
<p>"Done! how could I do anything to it? As if you didn't know that!"</p>
<p>"Then," stammered Paul, determined to know the worst, "then do you, do you mean to tell me
     you can see any—alteration in me? Tell me the truth now!"</p>
<p>"I should just think I could!" said Dick emphatically. "It's very queer, but just look here,"
     and he came up to the sideboard and placed himself by the side of his horrified father. "Why,"
     he said, with another giggle, "we're—he-he—as like as two peas!"</p>
<p>They were indeed; the glass reflected now two small boys, each with chubby cheeks and auburn
     hair, both dressed, too, exactly alike, in Eton jackets and broad white collars; the only
     difference to be seen between them was that, while one face wore an expression of intense glee
     and satisfaction, the other—the one which Mr. Bultitude was beginning to fear must belong to
     him—was lengthened and drawn with dismay and bewilderment.</p>
<p>"Dick," said Paul faintly, "what is all this? Who has been, been taking these liberties with
     me?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't know," protested Dick. "It wasn't me. I believe you did it all
     yourself."</p>
<p>"Did it all myself!" repeated Paul indignantly. "Is it likely I should? It's some trickery, I
     tell you, some villainous plot. The worst of it is," he added plaintively, "I don't understand
     who I'm supposed to be now. Dick, who am I?"</p>
<p>"You can't be me," said Dick, "because here I am, you know. And you're not yourself, that's
     very plain. You must be <hi>somebody</hi>, I suppose," he added dubiously.</p>
<p>
<pb n="23"/></p>
<p>"Of course I am. What do you mean?" said Paul angrily. "Never mind who I am. I feel just the
     same as I always did. Tell me when you first began to notice any change. Could you see it
     coming on at all, eh?"</p>
<p>"It was all at once, just as you were talking about school and all that. You said you only
     wished—— Why of course; look here, it must be the stone that did it!"</p>
<p>"Stone! what stone?" said Paul. "I don't know what you're talking about."</p>
<p>"Yes, you do—the Garudâ Stone! You've got it in your hand still. Don't you see? It's a real
     talisman after all! How jolly!"</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything to set it off; and besides, oh, it's perfectly absurd! How can there be
     such things as talismans nowadays, eh? Tell me that."</p>
<p>"Well, something's happened to you, hasn't it? And it must have been done somehow," argued
     Dick.</p>
<p>"I was holding the confounded thing, certainly," said Paul, "here it is. But what could I
     have said to start it? What has it done this to me for?"</p>
<p>"I know!" cried Dick. "Don't you remember? You said you wished you were a boy again, like me.
     So you are, you see, exactly like me! What a lark it is, isn't it? But, I say, you can't go up
     to business like that, you know, can you? I tell you what, you'd better come to Grimstone's
     with me now, and see how you like it. I shouldn't mind so much if you came too. Grimstone's
     face would be splendid when he saw two of us. Do come!"</p>
<p>"That's ridiculous nonsense you're talking," said Paul, "and you know it. What should I do at
     school at my age? I tell you I'm the same as ever inside, though I may have shrunk into a
     little rascally boy to look at. And it's simply an abominable nuisance, Dick, that's what it
     is! Why on earth couldn't you let the stone alone? Just see what mischief you've
     <pb n="24"/> done by meddling now—put me to all this inconvenience!"</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have wished," said Dick.</p>
<p>"Wished!" echoed Mr. Bultitude. "Why, to be sure," he said, with a gleam of returning
     hopefulness, "of course—I never thought of that. The thing's a wishing stone; it must be! You
     have to hold it, I suppose, and then say what you wish aloud, and there you are. If that's the
     case, I can soon put it all right by simply wishing myself back again. I—I shall have a good
     laugh at all this by and by—I know I shall!"</p>
<p>He took the stone, and got into a corner by himself where he began repeating the words, "I
     wish I was back again," "I wish I was the man I was five minutes ago," "I wish all this had not
     happened," and so on, until he was very exhausted and red in the face. He tried with the stone
     held in his left hand, as well as his right, sitting and standing, under all the various
     conditions he could think of, but absolutely nothing came of it; he was just as exasperatingly
     boyish and youthful as ever at the end of it.</p>
<p>"I don't like this," he said at last, giving it up with a rather crestfallen air. "It seems
     to me that this diabolical invention has got out of order somehow; I can't make it work any
     more!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps," suggested Dick, who had shown throughout the most unsympathetic cheerfulness,
     "perhaps it's one of those talismans that only give you one wish, and you've had it, you
     know?"</p>
<p>"Then it's all over!" groaned Paul. "What the dooce am I to do? What shall I do? Suggest
     something, for Heaven's sake; don't stand cackling there in that unfeeling manner. Can't you
     see what a terrible, mess I've got into? Suppose—only suppose your sister or one of the
     servants were to come in, and see me like this!"</p>
<p>This suggestion simply enchanted Dick. "Let's have 'em all up," he laughed; "it would be such
     fun! How
     <pb n="25"/> they will laugh when we tell them!" And he rushed to the bell.</p>
<p>"Touch that bell if you dare!" screamed Paul. "I won't be seen in this condition by anybody!
     What on earth could have induced that scoundrelly uncle of yours to bring such a horrible thing
     as this over I can't imagine! I never heard of such a situation as this in my life. I can't
     stay like this, you know—it's not to be thought of! I—I wonder whether it would be any use to
     send over to Dr. Bustard and ask him to step in; he might give me something to bring me round.
     But then the whole neighbourhood would hear about it! If I don't see my way out of this soon, I
     shall go raving mad!"</p>
<p>And he paced restlessly up and down the room with his brain on fire.</p>
<p>All at once, as he became able to think more coherently, there occurred to him a chance,
     slender and desperate enough, but still a chance, of escaping even yet the consequences of his
     folly.</p>
<p>He was forced to conclude that, however improbable and fantastic it might appear in this
     rationalistic age, there must be some hidden power in this Garudâ Stone which had put him in
     his present very unpleasant position. It was plain too that the virtues of the talisman refused
     to exert themselves any more at his bidding.</p>
<p>But it did not follow that in another's hands the spell would remain as powerless. At all
     events, it was an experiment well worth the trial, and he lost no time in explaining the notion
     to Dick, who, by the sparkle in his eyes and suppressed excitement in his manner, seemed to
     think there might be something in it.</p>
<p>"I may as well try," he said, "give it to me."</p>
<p>"Take it, my dear boy," said Paul, with a paternal air that sorely tried Dick's recovered
     gravity, it contrasted so absurdly with his altered appearance. "Take it, and wish your poor
     old father himself again!"</p>
<p>Dick took it, and held it thoughtfully for some
     <pb n="26"/> moments, while Paul waited in nervous impatience. "Isn't it any use?" he said
     dolefully at last, as nothing happened.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Dick calmly, "I haven't wished yet."</p>
<p>"Then do so at once," said Paul fussily, "do so at once. There's no time to waste, every
     moment is of importance—your cab will be here directly. Although, although I'm altered in this
     ridiculous way, I hope I still retain my authority as a father, and as a father, by Gad, I
     expect you to obey me, sir!"</p>
<p>"Oh, all right," said Dick indifferently, "you may keep the authority if you like."</p>
<p>"Then do what I tell you. Can't you see how urgent it is that a scandal like this shouldn't
     get about? I should be the laughing-stock of the city. Not a soul must ever guess that such a
     thing has happened. You must see that yourself."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dick, who all this time was sitting on a corner of the table, swinging his legs,
     "I see that. It will be all right. I'm going to wish in a minute, and no one will guess there
     has been anything the matter."</p>
<p>"That's a good boy!" said Paul, much relieved, "I know your heart is in the right place—only
     do make haste."</p>
<p>"I suppose," Dick asked, "when you are yourself again, things would go on just as usual?"</p>
<p>"I—I hope so."</p>
<p>"I mean you will go on sitting here, and I shall go off to Grimstone's?"</p>
<p>"Of course, of course," said Paul; "don't ask so many questions. I'm sure you quite
     understand what has to be done, so get on. We might be found like this any minute."</p>
<p>"That settles it," said Dick, "any fellow would do it after that."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, but you're so slow about it!"</p>
<p>"Don't be in a hurry," said Dick, "you mayn't like it after all when I've done it."</p>
<p>
<pb n="27"/></p>
<p>"Done what?" asked Mr. Bultitude sharply, struck by something sinister and peculiar in the
     boy's manner.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't mind telling you," said Dick, "it's fairer. You see, you wished to be a boy
     just like me, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"I didn't mean it," protested Paul.</p>
<p>"Ah, you couldn't expect a stone to know that; at any rate, it made you into a boy like me
     directly. Now, if I wish myself a man just like you were ten minutes ago, before you took the
     stone, that will put things all right again, won't it?"</p>
<p>"Is the boy mad?" cried Paul, horrified at this proposal. "Why, why, that would be worse than
     ever!"</p>
<p>"I don't see that," objected Dick, stubbornly. "No one would know anything about it
     then."</p>
<p>"But, you little blockhead, can't I make you understand? It wouldn't do at all. We should
     both of us be wrong then—each with the other's personal appearance."</p>
<p>"Well," said Dick blandly, "I shouldn't mind that."</p>
<p>"But I should—I mind very much. I object strongly to such a—such a preposterous arrangement.
     And what's more, I won't have it. Do you hear, I forbid you to think of any such thing. Give me
     back that stone. I can't trust you with it after this."</p>
<p>"I can't help it," said Dick doggedly. "You've had your wish, and I don't see why I shouldn't
     have mine. I mean to have it, too."</p>
<p>"Why, you unnatural little rascal!" cried the justly-enraged father, "do you mean to defy me?
     I tell you I will have that stone! Give it up this instant!" and he made a movement towards his
     son, as if he meant to recover the talisman by main force.</p>
<p>But Dick was too quick for him. Slipping off the table with great agility, he planted himself
     firmly on the hearth-rug, with the hand that held the stone clenched behind his back, and the
     other raised in self-defence.</p>
<p>"I'd much rather you wouldn't make me hit you, you
     <pb n="28"/> know," he said, "because, in spite of what's happened, you're still my father, I
     suppose. But if you interfere with me before I've done with this stone, I'm afraid I shall have
     to punch your head."</p>
<p>Mr. Bultitude retreated a few steps apprehensively, feeling himself no match for his son,
     except in size and general appearance; and for some moments of really frightful intensity they
     stood panting on the hearth-rug, each cautiously watching the other, on his guard against
     stratagem and surprise.</p>
<p>It was one of those painful domestic scenes which are fortunately rare between father and
     son.</p>
<p>Overhead, the latest rollicking French polka was being rattled out, with a savage irony of
     which pianos, even by the best makers, can at times be capable.</p>
<p>Suddenly Dick drew himself up. "Stand out of my way!" he cried excitedly, "I am going to do
     it. I wish I was a man like you were just now!"</p>
<p>And as he spoke, Mr. Bultitude had the bitterness of seeing his unscrupulous son swell out
     like the frog in the fable, till he stood there before him the exact duplicate of what Paul had
     so lately been!</p>
<p>The transformed Dick began to skip and dance round the room in high glee, with as much
     agility as his increased bulk would allow. "It's all right, you see," he said. "The old stone's
     as good as ever. You can't say anyone would ever know, to look at us."</p>
<p>And then he threw himself panting into a chair, and began to laugh excitedly at the success
     of his unprincipled manœuvres.</p>
<p>As for Paul, he was perfectly furious at having been so outwitted and overreached. It was a
     long time before he could command his voice sufficiently to say, savagely: "Well, you've had
     your way, and a pretty mess you've made of it. We're both of us in false positions now. I hope
     you're satisfied, I'm sure. Do you think you'll care about going back to Crichton House in that
     state?"</p>
<p>
<pb n="29"/></p>
<p>"No," said Dick, very decidedly: "I'm quite sure I shouldn't."</p>
<p>"Well, I can't help it. You've brought it on yourself; and, provided the Doctor sees no
     objection to take you back as you are and receive you as one of his pupils, I shall most
     certainly send you there."</p>
<p>Paul did not really mean this, he only meant to frighten him; for he still trusted that, by
     letting Boaler into the secret, the charm might be set in motion once more, and the difficulty
     comfortably overcome. But his threat had a most unfortunate effect upon Dick; it hardened him
     to take a course he might otherwise have shrunk from.</p>
<p>"Oh," he said, "you're going to do that? But doesn't it strike you that things are rather
     altered with us now?"</p>
<p>"They are, to a certain extent, of course," said Paul, "through my folly and your wicked
     cunning; but a word or two of explanation from me——"</p>
<p>"You'll find it will take more explanation than you think," said Dick; "but, of course, you
     can try, if you think it worth while—when you get to Grimstone's."</p>
<p>"When I,—I don't understand. When I,—what did you say?" gasped Paul.</p>
<p>"Why, you see," exclaimed Dick, "it would never have done for us both to go back; the chaps
     would have humbugged us so, and as I hate the place and you seem so fond of being a boy and
     going back to school and that, I thought perhaps it would be best for you to go and see how you
     liked it!"</p>
<p>"I never will! I'll not stir from this room! I dare you to try to move me!" cried Paul. And
     just then there was the sound of wheels outside once more. They stopped before the house, the
     bell rang sharply—the long-expected cab had come at last.</p>
<p>"You've no time to lose," said Dick, "get your coat on."</p>
<p>Mr. Bultitude tried to treat the affair as a joke. He laughed a ghastly little laugh.</p>
<p>
<pb n="30"/></p>
<p>"Ha! ha! you've fairly caught your poor father this time; you've proved him in the wrong. I
     admit I said more than I exactly meant. But that's enough. Don't drive a good joke too far;
     shake hands, and let us see if we can't find a way out of this!"</p>
<p>But Dick only warmed his coat tails at the fire as he said, with a very ungenerous
     reminiscence of his father's manner: "You are going back to an excellent establishment, where
     you will enjoy all the comforts of home—I can specially recommend the stickjaw; look out for it
     on Tuesdays and Fridays. You will once more take part in the games and lessons of happy
     boyhood. (Did you ever play 'chevy' when you were a boy before? You'll enjoy chevy.) And you
     will find your companions easy enough to get on with, if you don't go giving yourself airs;
     they won't stand airs. Now good-bye, my boy, and bless you!"</p>
<p>Paul stood staring stupidly at this outrageous assumption; he could scarcely believe yet that
     it was meant in cruel earnest. Before he could answer, the door opened and Boaler appeared.</p>
<p>"Had a deal of trouble to find a keb, sir, on a night like this," he said to the false Dick,
     "but the luggage is all on top, and the man says there's plenty of time still."</p>
<p>"Good-bye then, my boy," said Dick, with well-assumed tenderness, but a rather dangerous
     light in his eye. "My compliments to the Doctor, remember."</p>
<p>Paul turned indignantly from him to the butler; he, at least, would stand by him. Boaler
     would not see a master who had always been fair, if not indulgent, to him driven from his home
     in this cold-blooded manner!</p>
<p>He made two or three attempts to speak, for his brain whirled so with scathing, burning
     things to say. He would expose the fraud then and there, and defy the impudent usurper; he
     would warn every one against this spurious pinchbeck imitation of himself. The whole household
     should be summoned and called upon to judge between the two!</p>
<p>
<pb n="31"/></p>
<p>No doubt, if he had had enough self-command to do all this effectually, while Dick had as yet
     not had the time thoroughly to adapt himself to his altered circumstances, he might have turned
     the situation at the outset, and spared himself some very painful experiences.</p>
<p>But it is very often precisely those words which are the most vitally important to be said
     that refuse to pass our lips on a sudden emergency. We feel all the necessity of saying
     something at once, but the necessary words unaccountably desert us at the critical moment.</p>
<p>Mr. Bultitude felt himself in this unfortunate position. He made more wild efforts to
     explain, but the sense of his danger only petrified his mind instead of stimulating it. Then he
     was spared further conflict. A dark mist rose before his eyes; the walls of the room receded
     into infinite space; and, with a loud singing in his ears, he fell, and seemed to himself to be
     sinking down, down, through the earth to the very crust of the antipodes. Then the blackness
     closed over him—and he knew no more.</p>
