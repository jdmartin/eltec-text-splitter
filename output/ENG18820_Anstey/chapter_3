<p>"I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation,
     for I never knew so young a body with so old a head."—<hi>Merchant of Venice</hi>, Act
     iv.</p></quote>
<p>When Mr. Bultitude recovered his senses, which was not for a considerable time, he found that
     he was being jolted along through a broad well-lit thoroughfare, in a musty four-wheeler.</p>
<p>His head was by no means clear yet, and for some minutes he could hardly be said to think at
     all; he merely lay back dreamily listening to the hard grinding jar of the cab windows
     vibrating in their grooves.</p>
<p>His first distinct sensation was a vague wonder what Barbara might be intending to give him
     for dinner,
     <pb n="32"/> for, oddly enough, he felt far from hungry, and was conscious that his palate
     would require the adroitest witching.</p>
<p>With the thought of dinner his dining-room was almost inseparably associated, and then, with
     an instant rush of recollection, the whole scene there with the Garudâ Stone surged into his
     brain. He shuddered as he did so; it had all been so real, so hideously vivid and coherent
     throughout. But all unpleasant impressions soon yielded to the delicious luxury of his present
     security.</p>
<p>As his last conscious moment had been passed in his own dining-room, the fact that he opened
     his eyes in a cab, instead of confirming his worst fears, actually helped to restore the
     unfortunate gentleman's serenity; for he frequently drove home from the city in this manner,
     and believed himself now, instead of being, as was actually the case, in that marvellous region
     of cheap photography, rocking-horses, mild stone lions, and wheels and ladders—the Euston
     Road—to be bowling along Holborn.</p>
<p>Now that he was thoroughly awake he found positive amusement in going over each successive
     incident of his nightmare experience with the talisman, and smiling at the tricks his
     imagination had played him.</p>
<p>"I wonder now how the dickens I came to dream such outrageous nonsense!" he said to himself,
     for even his dreams were, as a rule, within the bounds of probability. But he was not long in
     tracing it to the devilled kidneys he had had at the club for lunch, and some curious old brown
     sherry Robinson had given him afterwards at his office.</p>
<p>"Gad, what a shock the thing has given me!" he thought. "I can hardly shake off the feeling
     even now."</p>
<p>As a rule, after waking up on the verge of a fearful crisis, the effect of the horror fades
     swiftly away, as one detail after another evades a memory which is never
     <pb n="33"/> too anxious to retain them, and each moment brings a deeper sense of relief and
     self-congratulation.</p>
<p>But in Paul's case, curiously enough, as he could not help thinking, the more completely
     roused he became, the greater grew his uneasiness.</p>
<p>Perhaps the first indication of the truth was suggested to him by a lurking suspicion—which
     he tried to dismiss as mere fancy—that he filled rather less of the cab than he had always been
     accustomed to do.</p>
<p>To reassure himself he set his thoughts to review all the proceedings of that day, feeling
     that if he could satisfactorily account for the time up to his taking the cab, that would be
     conclusive as to the unreality of any thing that appeared to have happened later in his own
     house. He got on well enough till he came to the hour at which he had left the office, and
     then, search his memory as he would, he could not remember hailing any cab!</p>
<p>Could it be another delusion, too, or was it the fact that he had found himself much pressed
     for time and had come home by the Underground to Praed Street? It must have been the day
     before, but that was Sunday. Saturday, then? But the recollection seemed too recent and fresh;
     and besides, on Saturday, he had left at two, and had taken Barbara to see Messrs. Maskelyne
     and Cooke's performance.</p>
<p>Slowly, insidiously, but with irresistible force, the conviction crept upon him that he had
     dined, and dined well.</p>
<p>"If I have dined already," he told himself, "I can't be going home to dinner; and if I am not
     going home to dinner, what—what am I doing in this cab?"</p>
<p>The bare idea that something might be wrong with him after all made him impatient to put an
     end to all suspense. He must knock this scotched nightmare once for all on the head by a
     deliberate appeal to his senses.</p>
<p>The cab had passed the lighted shops now, and was
     <pb n="34"/> driving between squares and private houses, so that Mr. Bultitude had to wait
     until the sickly rays of a street lamp glanced into the cab for a moment, and, as they did so,
     he put his feet up on the opposite seat and examined his boots and trousers with breathless
     eagerness.</p>
<p>It was not to be denied; they were not his ordinary boots, nor did he ever wear such trousers
     as he saw above them! Always a careful and punctiliously neat person, he was more than commonly
     exacting concerning the make and polish of his boots and the set of his trousers.</p>
<p>These boots were clumsy, square-toed, and thick-soled; one was even patched on the side. The
     trousers were heavy and rough, of the kind advertised as "wear-resisting fabrics, suitable for
     youths at school," frayed at the ends, and shiny—shamefully shiny—about the knees!</p>
<p>In hot despair he rapidly passed his hands over his body. It felt unusually small and slim,
     Mr. Bultitude being endowed with what is euphemistically termed a "presence," and it was with
     an agony rarely felt at such a discovery that he realised that, for the first time for more
     than twenty years, he actually had a waist.</p>
<p>Then, as a last resource, he took off his hat and felt for the broad, smooth, egg-like
     surface, garnished by scanty side patches of thin hair, which he knew he ought to find.</p>
<p>It was gone—hidden under a crop of thick close curling locks!</p>
<p>This last disappointment completely overcame him; he had a kind of short fit in the cab as
     the bitter truth was brought home to him unmistakably.</p>
<p>Yes, this was no dream of a distempered digestion, but sober reality. The whole of that
     horrible scene in the dining-room had really taken place; and now he, Paul Bultitude, the
     widely-respected merchant of Mincing Lane, a man of means and position, was being ignominiously
     packed off to school as if he were actually
     <pb n="35"/> the schoolboy some hideous juggle had made him appear!</p>
<p>It was only with a violent effort that he could succeed in commanding his thoughts
     sufficiently to decide on some immediate action. "I must be cool," he kept muttering to
     himself, with shaking lips, "quite cool and collected. Everything will depend on that now!"</p>
<p>It was some comfort to him in this extremity to recognise on the box the well-known broad
     back of Clegg, a cabman who stabled his two horses in some mews near Praed Street, and whom he
     had been accustomed to patronise in bad weather for several years.</p>
<p>Clegg would know him, in spite of his ridiculous transformation.</p>
<p>His idea was to stop the cab, and turn round and drive home again, when they would find that
     he was not to be got rid of again quite so easily. If Dick imagined he meant to put up tamely
     with this kind of treatment, he was vastly mistaken; he would return home boldly and claim his
     rights!</p>
<p>No reasonable person could be perverse enough to doubt his identity when once matters came to
     the proof; though at first, of course, he might find a difficulty in establishing it. His
     children, his clerks, and his servants would soon get used to his appearance, and would learn
     to look below the mere surface, and then there was always the possibility of putting everything
     right by means of the magic stone.</p>
<p>"I won't lose a minute!" he said aloud; and letting down the window, leaned out and shouted
     "Stop!" till he was hoarse.</p>
<p>But Clegg either could not or would not hear; he drove on at full speed, a faster rate of
     progress than that adopted by most drivers of four-wheeled cabs being one of his chief
     recommendations.</p>
<p>They were now passing Euston. It was a muggy, slushy night, with a thin brown fog wreathing
     the houses and fading away above their tops into a dull,
     <pb n="36"/> slate-blue sky. The wet street looked like a black canal; the blurred forms, less
     like vehicles than nondescript boats, moving over its inky surface, were indistinctly reflected
     therein; the gas-lights flared redly through the murky haze. It was not a pleasant evening in
     which to be out-of-doors.</p>
<p>Paul would have opened the cab-door and jumped out had he dared, but his nerve failed him,
     and, indeed, considering the speed of the cab, the leap would have been dangerous to a far more
     active person. So he was forced to wait resignedly until the station should be reached, when he
     determined to make Clegg understand his purpose with as little loss of time as possible.</p>
<p>"I must pay him something extra," he thought; "I'll give him a sovereign to take me back."
     And he searched his pockets for the loose coin he usually carried about with him in such
     abundance; there was no gold in any of them.</p>
<p>He found, however, a variety of minor and less negotiable articles, which he fished out one
     by one from unknown depths—a curious collection. There was a stumpy German-silver pencil case,
     a broken prism from a crystal chandelier, a gilded Jew's harp, a little book in which the
     leaves on being turned briskly, gave a semblance of motion to the sails of a black windmill
     drawn therein, a broken tin soldier, some Hong-Kong coppers with holes in them, and a quantity
     of little cogged wheels from the inside of a watch; while a further search was rewarded by an
     irregular lump of toffee imperfectly enfolded in sticky brown paper.</p>
<p>He threw the whole of these treasures out of the window with indescribable disgust, and,
     feeling something like a purse in a side pocket, opened it eagerly.</p>
<p>It held five shillings exactly, the coins corresponding to those he had pushed across to his
     son such a little while ago! It did not seem to him quite such a magnificent sum now as it had
     done then; he had shifted his point of view.</p>
<p>
<pb n="37"/></p>
<p>It was too clear that the stone must have carried out his thoughtless wish with scrupulous
     and conscientious exactness in every detail. He had wanted, or said he wanted, to be a boy
     again like Dick, and accordingly he had become a perfect duplicate, even to the contents of the
     pockets. Evidently nothing on the face of things showed the slightest difference. Yet—and here
     lay the sting of the metamorphosis—he was conscious under it all of being his old original
     self, in utter discordance with the youthful form in which he was an unwilling prisoner.</p>
<p>By this time the cab had driven up the sharp incline, and under the high pointed archway of
     St. Pancras terminus, and now drew up with a jerk against the steps leading to the booking
     office.</p>
<p>Paul sprang out at once in a violent passion. "Here, you, Clegg!" he said, "why the devil
     didn't you pull up when I told you? eh?"</p>
<p>Clegg was a burly, red-faced man, with a husky voice and a general manner which conveyed the
     impression that he regarded teetotalism, as a principle, with something more than
     disapproval.</p>
<p>"Why didn't I pull up?" he said, bending stiffly down from his box. "'Cause I didn't want to
     lose a good customer, that's why I didn't pull up!"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say you don't know me?"</p>
<p>"Know yer?" said Clegg, with an approach to sentiment: "I've knowed yer when you was a babby
     in frocks. I've knowed yer fust nuss (and a fine young woman she were till she took to
     drinking, as has been the ruin of many). I've knowed yer in Infancy's hour and in yer byhood's
     bloom! I've druv yer to this 'ere werry station twice afore. Know yer!"</p>
<p>Paul saw the uselessness of arguing with him. "Then, ah—drive me back at once. Let those
     boxes alone. I—I've important business at home which I'd forgotten."</p>
<p>Clegg gave a vinous wink. "Lor, yer at it agin," he said with admiration. "What a artful
     young limb it is!
     <pb n="38"/> But it ain't what yer may call good enough, so to speak, it ain't. Clegg don't do
     that no more!"</p>
<p>"Don't do what?" asked Paul.</p>
<p>"Don't drive no young gents as is a-bein' sent to school back agin into their family's
     bosims," said Clegg sententiously. "You was took ill sudden in my cab the larst time. Offal bad
     you was, to be sure—to hear ye, and I druv' yer back; and I never got no return fare, I didn't,
     and yer par he made hisself downright nasty over it, said as if it occurred agin he shouldn't
     employ me no more. I durstn't go and offend yer par; he's a good customer to me, he is."</p>
<p>"I'll give you a sovereign to do it," said Paul.</p>
<p>"If yer wouldn't tell no tales, I might put yer down at the corner p'raps," said Clegg,
     hesitating, to Paul's joy; "not as it ain't cheap at that, but let's see yer suffering fust.
     Why," he cried with lofty contempt as he saw from Paul's face that the coin was not producible,
     "y'ain't got no suffering! Garn away, and don't try to tempt a pore cabby as has his livin' to
     make. What d'ye think of this, porter, now? 'Ere's a young gent a tryin' to back out o' going
     to school when he ought to be glad and thankful as he's receivin' the blessin's of a good
     eddication. Look at me. I'm a 'ard-workin' man. I am. I ain't 'ad no eddication. The kids,
     they're a learnin' French, and free'and drorin, and the bones on a skellington at the Board
     School, and I pays my coppers down every week cheerful. And why, porter? Why, young master?
     'Cause I knows the vally on it! But when I sees a real young gent a despisin' of the
     oppertoonities as a bountiful Providence and a excellent par has 'eaped on his 'ed, it—it makes
     me sick, it inspires Clegg with a pity and a contemp' for such ingratitood, which he cares not
     for to 'ide from public voo!"</p>
<p>Clegg delivered this harangue with much gesture and in a loud tone, which greatly edified the
     porters and disgusted Mr. Bultitude.</p>
<p>
<pb n="39"/></p>
<p>"Go away," said the latter, "that's enough. You're drunk!"</p>
<p>"Drunk!" bellowed the outraged Clegg, rising on the box in his wrath. "'Ear that. 'Ark at
     this 'ere young cock sparrer as tells a fam'ly man like Clegg as he's drunk! Drunk, after
     drivin' his par in this 'ere werry cab through frost and fine fifteen year and more! I wonder
     yer don't say the old 'orse is drunk; you'll be sayin' that next! Drunk! oh, cert'nly, by all
     means. Never you darken my cab doors no more. I shall take and tell your par, I shall. Drunk,
     indeed! A ill-conditioned young wiper as ever I see. Drunk! yah!"</p>
<p>And with much cursing and growling, Clegg gathered up his reins and drove off into the fog,
     Boaler having apparently pre-paid the fare.</p>
<p>"Where for, sir, please?" said a porter, who had been putting the playbox and portmanteau on
     a truck during the altercation.</p>
<p>"Nowhere," said Mr. Bultitude. "I—I'm not going by this train; find me a cab with a sober
     driver."</p>
<p>The porter looked round. A moment before there had been several cabs discharging their loads
     at the steps; now the last had rolled away empty.</p>
<p>"You might find one inside the station by the arrival platform," he suggested; "but there'll
     be sure to be one comin' up here in another minute, sir, if you like to wait."</p>
<p>Paul thought the other course might be the longer one, and decided to stay where he was. So
     he walked into the lofty hall in which the booking offices are placed and waited there by the
     huge fire that blazed in the stove until he should hear the cab arrive which could take him
     back to Westbourne Terrace.</p>
<p>One or two trains were about to start, and the place was full. There were several Cambridge
     men "going up" after the Christmas vacation, in every variety of ulster; some tugging at
     refractory white terriers, one or two entrusting bicycles to dubious porters with many
     <pb n="40"/> cautions and directions. There were burly old farmers going back to their quiet
     countryside, flushed with the prestige of a successful stand under cross-examination in some
     witness-box at the Law Courts; to tell and retell the story over hill and dale, in the
     market-place and bar-parlour, every week for the rest of their honest lives. There was the
     usual pantomime "rally" on a mild scale, with real frantic passengers, and porters, and trucks,
     and trays of lighted lamps.</p>
<p>Presently, out of the crowd and confusion, a small boy in a thick pilot jacket and an
     immensely tall hat, whom Paul had observed looking at him intently for some time, walked up to
     the stove and greeted him familiarly.</p>
<p>"Hallo, Bultitude!" he said, "I thought it was you. Here we are again, eh? Ugh!" and he
     giggled dismally.</p>
<p>He was a pale-faced boy with freckles, very light green eyes, long, rather ragged black hair,
     a slouching walk, and a smile half-simpering, half-impudent.</p>
<p>Mr. Bultitude was greatly staggered by the presumption of so small a boy venturing to address
     him in this way. He could only stare haughtily.</p>
<p>"You might find a word to say to a fellow!" said the boy in an aggrieved tone. "Look here;
     come and get your luggage labelled."</p>
<p>"I don't want it labelled," said Paul stiffly, feeling bound to say something. "I'm waiting
     for a cab to take me home again."</p>
<p>The other gave a loud whistle. "That'll make it rather a short term, won't it, if you're
     going home for the holidays already? You're a cool chap, Bultitude! If I were to go back to my
     governor now, he wouldn't see it. It would put him in no end of a bait. But you're
     chaffing——"</p>
<p>Paul walked away from him with marked coolness. He was not going to trouble himself to talk
     to his son's schoolfellows.</p>
<p>
<pb n="41"/></p>
<p>"Aren't you well?" said the boy, not at all discouraged by his reception, following him and
     taking his arm. "Down in the mouth? It is beastly, isn't it, having to go back to old
     Grimstone's! The snow gave us an extra week, though—we've that much to be thankful for. I wish
     it was the first day of the holidays again, don't you? What's the matter with you? What have I
     done to put you in a wax?"</p>
<p>"Nothing at present," said Paul. "I don't speak to you merely because I don't happen to have
     the—ah—pleasure of your acquaintance."</p>
<p>"Oh, very well, then; I daresay you know best," said the other huffily. "Only I
     thought—considering we came the same half, and have been chums, and always sat next one another
     ever since—you might perhaps just recollect having met me before, you know."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't," said Mr. Bultitude. "I tell you I haven't the least idea what your name is.
     The fact is there has been a slight mistake, which I can't stop to talk about now. There's a
     cab just driven up outside now. You must excuse me, really, my boy, I want to go."</p>
<p>He tried to work his arm free from the close and affectionate grip of his unwelcome
     companion, who was regarding him with a sort of admiring leer.</p>
<p>"What a fellow you are, Bultitude!" he said; "always up to something or other. You know me
     well enough. What is the use of keeping it up any longer? Let's talk, and stop humbugging. How
     much grub have you brought back this time?"</p>
<p>To be advised to stop humbugging, and be persecuted with such idle questions as these,
     maddened the poor gentleman. A hansom really had rolled up to the steps outside. He must put an
     end to this waste of precious time, and escape from this highly inconvenient small boy.</p>
<p>He forced his way to the door, the boy still keeping fast hold of his arm. Fortunately the
     cab was still there, and its late occupant, a tall, broad man, was
     <pb n="42"/> standing with his back to them paying the driver. Paul was only just in time.</p>
<p>"Porter!" he cried. "Where's that porter? I want my box put on that cab. No, I don't care
     about the luggage; engage the cab. Now, you little ruffian, are you going to let me go? Can't
     you see I'm anxious to get away?"</p>
<p>Jolland giggled more impishly than ever. "Well, you <hi>have</hi> got cheek!" he said. "Go
     on, I wish you may get that cab, I'm sure!"</p>
<p>Paul, thus released, was just hurrying towards the cab, when the stranger who had got out of
     it settled the fare with satisfaction to himself and turned sharply round.</p>
<p>The gas-light fell full on his face, and Mr. Bultitude recognised that the form and features
     were those of no stranger—he had stumbled upon the very last person he had expected or desired
     to meet just then—his flight was intercepted by his son's schoolmaster, Dr. Grimstone
     himself!</p>
<p>The suddenness of the shock threw him completely off his balance. In an ordinary way the
     encounter would not of course have discomposed him, but now he would have given worlds for
     presence of mind enough either to rush past to the cab and secure his only chance of freedom
     before the Doctor had fully realised his intention, or else greet him affably and calmly, and,
     taking him quietly aside, explain his awkward position with an easy man-of-the-world air, which
     would ensure instant conviction.</p>
<p>But both courses were equally impossible. He stood there, right in Dr. Grimstone's path, with
     terrified starting eyes and quivering limbs, more like an unhappy guinea-pig expecting the
     advances of a boa, than a British merchant in the presence of his son's schoolmaster! He was
     sick and faint with alarm, and the consciousness that appearances were all against him.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the least extraordinary in the fact of the Doctor's presence at the
     station. Mr.
     <pb n="43"/>Bultitude might easily have taken this into account as a very likely contingency
     and have provided accordingly, had he troubled to think, for it was Dr. Grimstone's custom,
     upon the first day of the term, to come up to town and meet as many of his pupils upon the
     platform as intended to return by a train previously specified at the foot of the school-bills;
     and Paul had even expressly insisted upon Dick's travelling under surveillance in this manner,
     thinking it necessary to keep him out of premature mischief.</p>
<p>It makes a calamity doubly hard to bear when one looks back and sees by what a trivial chance
     it has come upon us, and how slight an effort would have averted it altogether; and Mr.
     Bultitude cursed his own stupidity as he stood there, rooted to the ground, and saw the hansom
     (a "patent safety" to him in sober earnest) drive off and abandon him to his fate.</p>
<p>Dr. Grimstone bore down heavily upon him and Jolland, who had by this time come up. He was a
     tall and imposing personage, with a strong black beard and small angry grey eyes, slightly
     blood-tinged; he wore garments of a semi-clerical cut and colour, though he was not in orders.
     He held out a hand to each with elaborate geniality.</p>
<p>"Ha, Bultitude, my boy, how are you? How are you, Jolland? Come back braced in body and mind
     by your vacation, eh? That's as it should be. Have you tickets? No? follow me then. You're both
     over age, I believe. There you are; take care of them."</p>
<p>And before Paul could protest, he had purchased tickets for all three, after which he laid an
     authoritative hand upon Mr. Bultitude's shoulder and walked him out through the booking hall
     upon the platform.</p>
<p>"This is awful," thought Paul, shrinking involuntarily; "simply awful. He evidently has no
     idea who I really am. Unless I'm very careful I shall be dragged off to Crichton House before I
     can put him right. If I could only get him away alone somewhere."</p>
<p>
<pb n="44"/></p>
<p>As if in answer to the wish, the Doctor guided him by a slight pressure straight along by the
     end of the station, saying to Jolland as he did so, "I wish to have a little serious
     conversation with Richard in private. Suppose you go to the bookstall and see if you can find
     out any of our young friends. Tell them to wait for me there."</p>
<p>When they were alone the Doctor paced solemnly along in silence for some moments, while Paul,
     who had always been used to consider himself a fairly prominent object, whatever might be his
     surroundings, began to feel an altogether novel sensation of utter insignificance upon that
     immense brown plain of platform and under the huge span of the arches whose girders were lost
     in wreaths of mingled fog and smoke.</p>
<p>Still he had some hope. Was it not possible, after all, that the Doctor had divined his
     secret and was searching for words delicate enough to convey his condolences?</p>
<p>"I wished to tell you, Bultitude," said the Doctor presently, and his first words dashed all
     Paul's rising hopes, "that I hope you are returning this term with the resolve to do better
     things. You have caused your excellent father much pain in the past. You little know the grief
     a wilful boy can inflict on his parent."</p>
<p>"I think I have a very fair idea of it," thought Paul, but he said nothing.</p>
<p>"I hope you left him in good health? Such a devoted parent, Richard—such a noble heart!"</p>
<p>At any other time Mr. Bultitude might have felt gratified by these eulogies, but just then he
     was conscious that he could lay no claim to them. It was Dick who had the noble heart now, and
     he himself felt even less of a devoted parent than he looked.</p>
<p>"I had a letter from him during the vacation," continued Dr. Grimstone, "a sweet letter,
     Richard, breathing in every line a father's anxiety and concern for your welfare."</p>
<p>Paul was a little staggered. He remembered having written, but he would scarcely perhaps have described
     <pb n="45"/> his letter as "sweet," as he had not done much more than enclose a cheque for his
     son's account and object to the items for pew-rent and scientific lectures with the diorama as
     excessive.</p>
<p>"But—and this is what I wanted to say to you, Bultitude—his is no blind doting affection. He
     has implored me, for your own sake, if I see you diverging ever so slightly from the path of
     duty, not to stay my hand. And I shall not forget his injunctions."</p>
<p>A few minutes ago, and it would have seemed to Paul so simple and easy a matter to point out
     to the Doctor the very excusable error into which he had fallen. It was no more than he would
     have to do repeatedly upon his return, and here was an excellent opportunity for an
     explanation.</p>
<p>But, somehow the words would not come. The schoolmaster's form seemed so tremendous and
     towering, and he so feeble and powerless before him, that he soon persuaded himself that a
     public place, like a station platform, was no scene for domestic revelations of so painful a
     character.</p>
<p>He gave up all idea of resistance at present. "Perhaps I had better leave him in his error
     till we get into the train," he thought; "then we will get rid of that other boy, and I can
     break it to him gradually in the railway carriage as I get more accustomed to him."</p>
<p>But in spite of his determination to unbosom himself without further delay, he knew that a
     kind of fascinated resignation was growing upon him and gaining firmer hold each minute.</p>
<p>Something must be done to break the spell and burst the toils which were being woven round
     him before all effort became impossible.</p>
<p>"And now," said the Doctor, glancing up at the great clock-face on which a reflector cast a
     patch of dim yellow light, "we must be thinking of starting. But don't forget what I have
     said."</p>
<p>And they walked back towards the book-stalls with
     <pb n="46"/> their cheery warmth of colour, past the glittering buffet, and on up the platform,
     to a part where six boys of various sizes were standing huddled forlornly together under a
     gaslight.</p>
<p>"Aha!" said Dr. Grimstone, with a slight touch of the ogre in his tone, "more of my fellows,
     eh? We shall be quite a party. How do you do, boys? Welcome back to your studies."</p>
<p>And the six boys came forward, all evidently in the lowest spirits, and raised their tall
     hats with a studied politeness.</p>
<p>"Some old friends here, Bultitude," said the Doctor, impelling the unwilling Paul towards the
     group. "You know Tipping, of course; Coker, too, you've met before—and Coggs. How are you,
     Siggers? You're looking well. Ah, by the way, I see a new face—Kiffin, I think? Kiffin, this is
     Bultitude, who will make himself your mentor, I hope, and initiate you into our various manners
     and customs."</p>
<p>And, with a horrible dream-like sense of unreality, Mr. Bultitude found himself being greeted
     by several entire strangers with a degree of warmth embarrassing in the extreme.</p>
<p>He would have liked to protest and declare himself there and then in his true colours, but if
     this had been difficult alone with the Doctor under the clock, it was impossible now, and he
     submitted ruefully enough to their unwelcome advances.</p>
<p>Tipping, a tall, red-haired, raw-boned boy, with sleeves and trousers he had outgrown, and
     immense boots, wrung Paul's hand with misdirected energy, saying "how-de-do?" with a gruff
     superiority, mercifully tempered by a touch of sheepishness.</p>
<p>Coggs and Coker welcomed him with open arms as an equal, while Siggers, a short, slight,
     sharp-featured boy, with a very fashionable hat and shirt-collars, and a horse-shoe pin,
     drawled, "How are you, old boy?" with the languor of a confirmed man about town.</p>
<p>
<pb n="47"/></p>
<p>The other two were Biddlecomb, a boy with a blooming complexion and a singularly sweet voice,
     and the new-comer, Kiffin, who did not seem much more at home in the society of other boys than
     Mr. Bultitude himself, for he kept nervously away from them, shivering with the piteous
     self-abandonment of an Italian greyhound.</p>
<p>Paul was now convinced that unless he exerted himself considerably, his identity with his son
     would never even be questioned, and the danger roused him to a sudden determination.</p>
<p>However his face and figure might belie him, nothing in his speech or conduct should
     encourage the mistake. Whatever it might cost him to overcome his fear of the Doctor, he would
     force himself to act and talk ostentatiously, as much like his own ordinary self as possible,
     during the journey down to Market Rodwell, so as to prepare the Doctor's mind for the
     disclosures he meant to make at the earliest opportunity. He was beginning to see that the
     railway carriage, with all those boys sitting by and staring, would be an inconvenient place
     for so delicate and difficult a confession.</p>
<p>The guard having warned intending passengers to take their seats, and Jolland, who had been
     unaccountably missing all this time, having appeared from the direction of the refreshment
     buffet, furtively brushing away some suspicious-looking flakes and crumbs from his coat, and
     contrived to join the party unperceived, they all got into a first-class compartment—Paul with
     the rest.</p>
<p>He longed for moral courage to stand out boldly and refuse to leave town, but, as we have
     seen, it was beyond his powers, and he temporised. Very soon the whistle had sounded and the
     train had begun to glide slowly out beyond the platform and arch, past the signal boxes and
     long low sheds and offices which are the suburbs of a large terminus—and then it was too
     late.</p>
