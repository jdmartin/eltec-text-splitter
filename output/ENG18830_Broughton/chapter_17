<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>The year declines towards its mirk close. Every day a little more is taken from the
      light and added to the dark. London is full and cheerful; with a pleasanter, friendlier, more
      leisurely social stir than the overpowering June one. Two or three good pieces are running at
      the theatres, and the shop-windows are warm with furs. Round the Churchills a crop of small
      dinners and dances has sprung up.</p>
<p>The time nears mid-December. Mrs. Churchill's wish as to the non-repetition of Professor
      Forth's visit has met with the usual fate of wishes. He has come again repeatedly; so
      repeatedly that the dogs
      <pb/> have ceased barking at him, though they are not so hypocritical as to wag their tails on
      his approach; nor, indeed, does he ever, by kind pats or well-chosen civilities, give them any
      cause to do so. Even the obtuse Tommy has learned that he is to be shown, not into the
      drawing-room, but into the little back litter-room, which has been arbitrarily cleared of
      Sarah's paint- pots, and the promiscuous rubbish in which her soul delights; has been
      furnished with pens, ink, and dictionaries, and raised and dignified by the name of study. For
      Belinda's fervour for learning rages with a feverish heat that might make a thoughtful
      looker-on inclined to question its solidity or its continuance.</p>
<p>She is learning Latin Syntax; she is being taught Greek; she has undertaken a course of
      Universal History; she devotes her spare moments to the Elements of Algebra. Very seldom now
      does she join her family in the evening. Mostly she remains downstairs, writing Latin
      Exercises, learning Irregular Greek Verbs;
      <pb/> working, working on until late into the night. She would like never to stop; to leave no
      single chink or cranny by which memory may enter.</p>
<p>And is the charm working? Is the remedy beginning to make its healing virtue felt? This is
      the question that she never dares ask herself. Sometimes, indeed, it thrusts itself upon her
      in the sadness of the night. Sometimes the pen drops from her stiffened fingers, or her tired
      brain relaxes its hold upon the hardconned page, and she groans out to herself —she alone
      awake, with her melancholy gas-jet burning above her in the silence of the sleeping house—"Of
      what use? what use?" Has it given back to life its sweet and wholesome taste? Has it helped
      her to dominate that terrible irritability which makes no person and no moment safe from some
      senseless outbreak of her temper? Has it conquered that gloom which renders her the kill-joy
      of her little circle. There is not one of these questions that she can honestly answer in the
      affirmative.</p>
<pb/>
<p>But perhaps there has not yet been time enough to test the efficacy of this cure. Its action
      will doubtless be slow, but all the more lasting and solid for that. She must persevere; it
      would be madness not to persevere. She passes her hand across her weary, throbbing temples,
      and catches up the pen again.</p>
<p>The clocks strike two, and she still writes. It is not night now; it is afternoon. Mrs.
      Churchill and Sarah, furred and feathered, with their bonnets nicely tied on, and their faces
      alight with placid good-humour, have set off in the brougham on their daily career of calls
      and shops.</p>
<p>Belinda remains behind in the little dingy back room, with her copy-books. Not once to-day
      has she tasted the wholesome outside air—wholesome with all its blacks, and fog-charged as it
      is. She has been alone here the whole day, except for a couple of ten minutes grudgingly
      snatched for breakfast and luncheon.</p>
<p>She has been alone, but she is so no longer. Professor Forth has just been
      <pb/> ushered in to partake her solitude. She meets him with a complaint.</p>
<p>"I expected you yesterday."</p>
<p>"I was detained by a College meeting, and by other engagements," he answers. "I hope,"
      ceremoniously, "that you were not inconvenienced by the deferring of my visit?"</p>
<p>"I was," she answered brusquely. "As it happened, I wanted you badly. I was completely
      puzzled by a passage here," laying her hand upon a school edition of "Cæsar's Commentaries."
      "I worried over it till I felt quite dazed and woolly."</p>
<p>As she speaks she draws the volume towards her, and they both stoop their heads over the
      page; his with its old, sparse, colourless hair, thriftily drawn across the baldening crown;
      hers with its unregarded riches of nut-brown. The difficulty dissipated, she leans back in her
      chair.</p>
<p>"It is hopeless to make any real progress," she says morosely, "as long as our
      <pb/> lessons are so interrupted. How much better it would be if we lived in Oxbridge! How I
      wish we lived in Oxbridge!"</p>
<p>She is sitting alongside of him, and does not look at him as she expresses this wish. It
      seems to be addressed with a general vagueness to the air.</p>
<p>He glances at her, sidelong and suspiciously; at the beautiful blooming profile, the
      discontented mouth, the fine, petulant, small nose, the veiled, unglad eyes. He has almost
      given up suspecting her of late, but her last aspiration has rearoused his distrust. Was not
      Sarah once fervent and constant in her longings to inhabit a university town?</p>
<p>"It would make things so much easier," she continues plaintively, quite unconscious of his
      disquieting doubts. "If I were in difficulties I could go straight to you. I had much rather
      live in Oxbridge than here."</p>
<p>He is still observing her covertly, and makes no answer.</p>
<p>"It must be a good life!" she says, with
      <pb/> the same restless longing as a sick person's for strange food; "so full of intelligent
      interests, so absorbing, and must take one so out of one's self!"</p>
<p>As she speaks she clasps both hands at the back of her neck, and stares dreamily up at the
      ceiling. He has moved his eyes away from her. Perhaps they are satisfied with the result of
      their investigation. They now look straight before him on Cæsar's open page. Upon his fingers
      he balances a paper-knife, and an unusual expression has crept about his narrow lips.</p>
<p>"If you are sincere in your desire for a—" he begins rather slowly; but she breaks in upon
      him hotly.</p>
<p>"Sincere!" she repeats, with an angry intonation; "I cannot imagine why you preface all your
      remarks with a doubt of my sincerity! What could I possibly gain by being insincere?"</p>
<p>She looks at him full and irately as she speaks, and their eyes meet; the dull old cautious
      eyes, and the unhappy flashing young ones.</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<p>"If my phrase offends you, I will change it!" he answers formally. " <hi>Since</hi> you are
      sincere in your desire for a—"</p>
<p>But again he breaks off. There is a ring at the door-bell.</p>
<p>"You have visitors," he says, in an annoyed voice. "We shall be interrupted."</p>
<p>"No, we shall not," she replies, shaking her head. "Tommy knows that when you are here, I am
      not at home to anyone."</p>
<p>It is a sentence susceptible of a flattering interpretation, that, indeed, would seem to
      bear no other, but it is uttered as such indifferent matter-of-fact that he would be indeed a
      coxcomb who was elated by it.</p>
<p>"Please go on," smiling faintly. "Since I am sincere in my desire for—what?"</p>
<p>But apparently he has lost the thread of his twice-begun speech.</p>
<p>"Your servant must have mistaken your directions," he says, with a vexed look; "he is
      evidently admitting some one."</p>
<pb n="11"/>
<p>Both listen, and as she listens Belinda's colour changes.</p>
<p>"If we were at Dresden," she says in a suppressed and troubled voice, "and if I did not hope
      that it were impossible, I should say that the voice was—"</p>
<p>The door flies open.</p>
<p>"Here I am!" cries Miss Watson, bursting into the room, in apparently the identical large
      black and white plaid gown and grizzled fringe, and in certainly the same burly red
      face—perhaps a shade worsened by the battle and breeze—as of yore.</p>
<p>She is not ushered in, but helplessly followed by the baffled Tommy, who is raising his puny
      infant voice in futile protestations, as his predecessor had so often done before him.</p>
<p>"I knew by Tommy's manner that you were at home!" cries she joyfully. "By-the-bye, he is a
      new Tommy! What have you done with the old one? I would not give him my card; I said, 'No, I
      will surprise them!'"</p>
<pb n="12"/>
<p>She has succeeded. Both Mr. Forth and his disciple have risen to their feet, and now stand
      regarding their visitor with a —for the first moments—entirely silent dismay.</p>
<p>"Mr. Forth, too!" cries Miss Watson, snatching his reluctant hand. "Why, this is Dresden
      over again! If we had but Sarah and Rivers here, we might think ourselves back there."</p>
<p>Neither of Belinda's companions perceives it, but she shudders. Ever since Miss Watson's
      voice first fell on her shocked ears, she has known that she would have to endure the sound of
      Rivers' name. In reality not two minutes have elapsed since then, but it seems to her as if
      for hours she had been dreading it.</p>
<p>"How snug you are!" says the visitor, patronizingly looking round; "but why do you sit here?
      Why do not you sit in the drawing-room? Is not the fire lit there? Oh, I suppose Sarah sits
      there, and grandmamma? I must go and pay them a little visit just now."</p>
<pb n="13"/>
<p>"They are out."</p>
<p>"Out!" repeats the other, laughing; "Sarah is always out. I wish they would come back! How
      soon do you expect them? We should be just our Dresden party, then—all but Rivers!"</p>
<p>Again that shudder, but she sets her teeth. She <hi>must</hi> endure it— <hi>must</hi> steel
      herself to hear his name—to pronounce it if need be.</p>
<p>"Shocking thing about his father, was it not?" continues Miss Watson, cheerfully pursuing
      the course of thought suggested by the mention of Rivers. "Failed for over a million, and cut
      his throat. They say that he has left his large family— twelve? ten? nine?—how many used young
      Rivers to tell us there were of them?—upon the parish. But I do not believe it; one hears of
      people bankrupt one day, and rolling in their carriages the next."</p>
<p>Belinda's heart is beating sickeningly, and her hands are trembling so violently that she
      has to clench them fast together,
      <pb n="14"/> to hide their aguish shaking; but she is nerving herself up. Here is an
      opportunity for obtaining information about him such as may probably not recur for weeks,
      months, possibly years. Here, too, is an occasion for practising that indifferent naming of
      him to which she is resolved to attain.</p>
<p>"Does Mr. Rivers roll in his carriage?" she asks, with a strained smile.</p>
<p>The effort to speak is so great that it seems to her as if, when it is overcome, she speaks
      unnaturally loud; but, as her companions show no surprise, she concludes that it cannot be so
      really.</p>
<p>"I do not know about rolling in his carriage," answers Miss Watson, with her loud,
      ever-ready laugh; "I know that he can treat himself to stalls at the theatre, which is more
      than I can. I always go to the dress circle; one's legs are a little cramped in the front row,
      but one can see as well as in the best place in the house."</p>
<p>Belinda has stooped over the table, and is nervously arranging, rearranging, disarranging
      <pb n="15"/> the exercise-books, grammars, pen-wipers upon it.</p>
<p>"Did you see him at the play?" she asks hurriedly.</p>
<p>"I saw him the other night at the St. James's," returns Miss Watson, inquisitively following
      with her eyes Belinda's unaccountable fidgetings. "What are you looking for? have you lost
      anything? No?—At the St. James. 'The Squire'— have you seen it? it is so well put on the
      stage—Mrs. Kendal quite at her best!"</p>
<p>"I—I think not," answers Belinda incoherently. "I mean no; I—I have not seen it. You were
      saying—"</p>
<p>"What was I saying?" (her eyes still fastened curiously on the girl's purposeless
      movements)—"you <hi>must</hi> have lost something! —oh! that I had seen young Rivers at the
      play. He was in the stalls with a lady—his sister, we will presume—though she was not at all
      like him," with a knowing look. "If <hi>she</hi> was on the parish, it managed to dress her
      uncommonly well!"</p>
<p>Even Belinda's lips have turned white.
      <pb n="16"/> She is conscious of it, and rubs them hard with her fingers. He is in London! He
      can go to the play, can take his pleasure with other women! She has long known in theory that
      he must have been frequently in London during the past eighteen months; but never before has
      it come home to her with such cruel practical certitude. Lightning-quick the contrast between
      their evenings—his and hers—has sprung before her eyes: her melancholy vigils, devoted to
      distasteful studies in the vain hope of wrenching her thoughts away from him; and <hi>his</hi>
      , reclining in mirthful ease in a comfortable fauteuil in the lit theatre, beside a beautiful,
      strange, fond woman. The beauty and the fondness her sick imagination has at once supplied.
      That she may possibly have been his sister, her bitter soul refuses for one instant to
      admit.</p>
<p>"I tried to get to him as we were going out," pursues Miss Watson narratively. "I saw him on
      ahead with his lady. He is a most attentive <hi>brother</hi> !" with a laughing
      <pb n="17"/> accent on the word; "he was wrapping her up like a mummy! But though I made a
      great push for it I could not come up with him; there was such a crowd. I never saw a fuller
      house. I called out to him, and once I thought he had heard, for he looked round and caught my
      eye; but it could not have been so, for he posted on faster than before!"</p>
<p>At this in happier moments Belinda would have smiled. She cannot smile now.</p>
<p>"Have not you seen anything of him?" asks the other, exploring the girl's wan face with the
      unflinching inquisitiveness of her eyes; "has not he been to call—not once? I must tell him
      that there is a hole in his manners; I shall be sure to fall in with him again before long,
      and I will send him here. I will tell him that you expect him."</p>
<p>"You will not," says Belinda hoarsely, stretching out her hand and turning livid. "I mean,"
      helped back to self-possession by the expression of astonished
      <pb n="18"/> and eager curiosity painted all over her guest's broad face—"I mean that I think
      I had rather you did not. If he wishes to call, he—he—knows our address."</p>
