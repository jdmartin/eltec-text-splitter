<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>Dinner has been early, and is over. The sisters stand, each cooling a fiery cheek
      against the woodwork of the drawing-room window, while the latest blackbird is singing his
      version of "Glory to Thee, my God, this night," and the laburnum's lithe bunches hang yellow
      against almost as yellow a sunset.</p>
<p>"Does he <hi>never</hi> open a window?" asks Sarah, greedily thrusting out her head into the
      cool greenness of the very respectably grown clematis and jessamine that climb the
      house-wall.</p>
<p>" <hi>Never</hi> !"</p>
<p>"Then I should make a point of falling
      <pb n="176"/> off my chair in a faint regularly every day, at dinner, until he did."</p>
<p>"You would fall off your chair in a faint every day until the Day of Judgment, in that
      case," replies Belinda, with stony quiet.</p>
<p>" <hi>But</hi> for the stewpan atmosphere," continues Sarah, heaving her white chest in a
      deep and vigorous inhalation, "it really did not go off so badly; at first there seemed a
      trifling awkwardness—I think, Punchy, that you would have done as well on the whole to remain
      at your town house—but my fine tact soon smoothed it over."</p>
<p>"You did not call him 'James,' however," replies Belinda, with a short sarcastic laugh.</p>
<p>"Well, no," replies Sarah a little blankly, and for once in her life making no attempt at
      repartee or explanation. "I did not." But the next moment—"How soon do we go?" cries she
      joyously. "St. Ursula's is the largest college in Oxbridge, is it not? Will all Oxbridge be
      there to meet the Duke? But I suppose you are all much
      <pb n="177"/> above setting any store by royalties! It is only the empire of the mind,"
      pompously, "to which you attach any value!"</p>
<p>" <hi>Is it</hi> ?" replies Belinda expressively.</p>
<p>"Now I am the common British flunkey," continues Sarah confidentially; "and so used you to
      be! I <hi>love</hi> royalties; there is nothing too small for me to hear about them. I should
      be thoroughly interested to learn how many pairs of stockings the Queen has, and whether she
      takes sugar in her tea."</p>
<p>Belinda laughs.</p>
<p>" <hi>Everybody</hi> will be there, then?" resumes Sarah in a voice of the extremest
      exhilaration, "and you will introduce me to <hi>everybody</hi> . What will they think of me?
      Will they expect me to say anything clever? Will they like me?"</p>
<p>"H—m!" replies Belinda dubiously, scanning affectionately from head to foot the seductive
      but not altogether academic figure before her; "I doubt it!"</p>
<p>"After all, they must be human," says Sarah philosophically. "When one has
      <pb n="178"/> pierced the thick crust of their erudition—"</p>
<p>"Perhaps in some cases not so very thick," interposes Belinda ironically.</p>
<p>"One will find a human heart beating beneath—a heart that may be punctured by my little
      darts, eh?"</p>
<p>"Possibly!" in a by no means confident tone.</p>
<p>"I shall devote myself chiefly to the undergraduates, I think," says Sarah thoughtfully. "Do
      you know many? do you see much of them?"</p>
<p>Belinda shrugs her handsome shoulders indifferently.</p>
<p>"Poor boys! they come to call; but they are too much afraid of me to open their lips. I have
      lost none of my power of inspiring terror," she adds with a bitter smile. "It is the one of my
      gifts that I keep in its entirety."</p>
<p>"We will change all that," says Sarah piously: "the reign of fear is over; that of love is
      begun!"</p>
<p>Belinda has moved to the middle of the
      <pb n="179"/> room, and is occupied in pulling down the central gas-jet, and lowering the gas,
      harshly glaring under its globes. Her <hi>pose</hi> — wreathed head thrown back, and long bare
      arm roundly lifted—brings into evidence the finest curves of her noble figure.</p>
<p>"And do not they admire you either, <hi>par hasard</hi> ?" asks Sarah, in a voice of
      affectionate incredulity.</p>
<p>Belinda shakes her head.</p>
<p>"If they do, they disguise it admirably. Stay!" with a gesture of recollection; "now I come
      to think of it, I believe that one young person of an æsthetic tendency was once heard to
      observe that I was 'great and still'; but that is the only civil speech I have reaped in six
      months, and even that one is perhaps a little ambiguous."</p>
<p>" <hi>Great and still</hi> !" repeats Sarah, giggling; "well, at all events they shall not
      say that of me!"</p>
<p>She is still chuckling, when the opening door admits her brother-in-law. At once
      <pb n="180"/> her chuckle has an inclination to die, but she bravely resists it.</p>
<p>"I appeal to you," she says, going boldly up to him. "Belinda has been taking away your
      town's character; she says that she is not at all admired here, and that neither shall I be.
      Is it true? is it possible?"</p>
<p>It is certainly well to be on easy terms with your brother-in-law; but, in a case so
      exceptional as that of Miss Churchill, it is perhaps hardly wise to address him with an
      alluring archness that may remind him of former disasters. At all events, in the present case
      it is not successful.</p>
<p>"I am afraid that I must ask you to excuse me," he says sourly, turning on his heel. "I must
      refer you to some one better qualified to give an opinion on such a point. Belinda, I must
      request your assistance with my gown."</p>
<p>There is something in his tone so unequivocally unplayful, thàt Sarah slinks away snubbed,
      and for the moment robbed of all her little airs and graces; and Belinda rises with rebellious
      slowness, flame in her
      <pb n="181"/> eye and revolt in her nether lip, to render the grudging aid demanded of her. As
      her reluctant hand holds the gown for her husband to put on, they both find themselves
      unintentionally standing plump and full before a rather large mirror, inevitably facing their
      own figures, thus brought into sudden juxtaposition.</p>
<p>Belinda is in gala-dress. In honour of the Duke, and for the first time since her marriage,
      Oxbridge is to see her neck and shoulders. Upon their smooth sea of cream, unbroken by any
      trifling necklet— a sea that flows unrippled over the small collar-bones—the gas-lamps throw
      satin <hi>reflets</hi> ; a little chaplet of seasonable cowslips clasps her well-set head, and
      wrath has borrowed love's red pennon and planted it in her cheeks. She looks a magnificent
      embodiment of youth and vigour, dwarfing into yet meaner insignificance the parched figure
      beside her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Forth casts one pregnant look at the two reflections, and then hearing, or feigning to
      hear, a sound of suppressed
      <pb n="182"/> mirth behind her, she says, in a clear, incisive voice:</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at, Sarah? Are you admiring us? Are you thinking what a nice-looking
      pair we are?"</p>
<p>She lays a slight but cruel accent on the noun. <hi>Pair</hi> , indeed! From Fate's
      strangely jumbled bag were never two such odd ones sorted out before. The Professor has turned
      sharply away, but not before his wife has had the satisfaction of seeing that her shot has
      told; but Sarah maintains a scared silence. The fly is late in arriving. Probably it has had
      many freights to take up and put down on this festal night before the Forths' turn comes. At
      length, however, and just as Sarah is beginning wistfully to interrogate her Louis Quinze
      shoes as to their powers of reaching St. Ursula and H. R. H. on foot, it drives up, and they
      all get in. Possibly Belinda, though she makes no approaches towards a verbal <hi>amende</hi>
      , may be remorseful for her spurt of malevolence. At all events, she offers no objection to
      the raising of the window
      <pb n="183"/> on her side; nor does she, even by a pardonable gasp or two, or an obtruded
      fanning, resent the insult to the summer night.</p>
<p>The lateness of their fly has retarded them so much, that instead of being first at the
      rendezvous, as is the Professor's usual habit, they see, on reaching St. Ursula's, the great
      quadrangle that the proudest churchman built filled with every carriage and bath-chair that
      Oxbridge's modest mews can boast; filled, too, with capped men and hooded women, hurrying to
      the goal. They have trodden the low-stepped stone stairs, along whose side lie unwonted banks
      of green moss that smells of cool, woodland places, planted with young field flowers; have
      passed the one slender shaft that, upspringing, bears the vaulted roof, and its loveliest
      stone fans, and have entered the lordly hall, where Elizabeth Tudor once saw Masks, and where
      one of the sons of her latest successor is listening with a courteous patience, probably
      superior to hers, to such improvements
      <pb n="184"/> upon the barbarous Mask and obsolete Allegory as the nineteenth century, rich in
      the spoils of its eighteen grandfathers, can afford him. In the present instance, the
      substitute offered is a tale told, not by an idiot, but by an excessively hot young man,
      striking occasionally sensational chords on the piano, at which he is seated upon the raised
      daïs, where the "Fellows'" table is wont to stand—a monstrously long tale about a signalman,
      who, while busied in working his points, sees his infant, through some glaring domestic
      mismanagement, staggering across the metals at the precise moment when an express train is
      due. The struggle between his emotions as a parent and as a pointsman is so mercilessly
      protracted, that the audience, unable to bear the prolonged strain upon their feelings, are
      relieving themselves by a good deal of <hi>sotto voce</hi> , or not quite <hi>sotto voce</hi>
      conversation. But the Prince sits immovably polite, not permitting himself even one aside to
      his <hi>sémillante</hi> hostess, who, all loyal smiles, is
      <pb n="185"/> posed in glory on a chair in the front rank beside him.</p>
<p>Large as is the assemblage, so nobly proportioned is the great room, that there is no crowd.
      Every woman has put on her best gown; and every woman has the satisfaction of thinking that
      every other woman has seen, is seeing, or will fully see it; not, indeed, to do them justice,
      that this is a consideration much likely to engage the attention of the Oxbridge ladies.
      Thanks to the height of the carved oak roof, whither the vapours can ascend, below it is cool
      and fragrant. With the one emphatic exception of the detailer of the signalman's perplexities,
      scarce one of the living guests has a more heated air than the brave line of judges, bishops,
      philosophers, premiers—St. Ursula's dead glories —looking down in painted tranquillity from
      the walls.</p>
<p>"You must introduce me to everybody, and tell me who they are, and what they have done, so
      that I may say something suitable," says Sarah, in a flutter of pleasure,
      <pb n="186"/> looking beamingly round on the, to her, eccentric throng of black-gowned M.A.'s,
      with their flat college caps tucked under their arms; of velvet-sleeved proctors, etc.</p>
<p>"For heaven's sake, do not try!" says Belinda, in serious dissuasion, "or you will be sure
      to make a mess of it!"</p>
<p>Sarah shrugs her white shoulders. She is so clamorous to be presented to everyone, that
      Belinda, after patiently pointing out to her, and, where feasible, making her personally
      acquainted with the owners of many of the local, all the half-dozen national, and the one or
      two European reputations that grace the room, at length strikes work.</p>
<p>"You are insatiable!" she says. "You are as bad as Miss Watson!"</p>
<p>"Unberufen!" cries Sarah, with a shudder that is not all affectation, "do not mention that
      accursed name; I could have sworn that I heard her voice just now!"</p>
<p>The room is fuller than it was. About the door, indeed, and the lower part of the
      <pb n="187"/> hall, circulation is still easy; but who would be content with elbow-room at a
      lower end, when the sight of a genuine live English royal Duke—no dubious Serene German— is to
      be fought for at the upper?</p>
<p>"And you say that we are not loyal!" says Belinda, with that irony now so frequently assumed
      by her, as they, too, push and jostle their forward way. They have to push and jostle for
      themselves.</p>
<p>Immediately upon their entry, their natural pusher and jostler, the Professor, has quitted
      them for associates more akin in age and conformable in tastes than the two handsome girls
      assigned by a sarcastic Providence to his jurisdiction. As they so work slowly forwards,
      gaining a step a minute, they are conscious of a disturbed heaving of the wave of humanity
      behind them—as when the ocean is ploughed by some puissant steamer, or monstrous shark. At the
      same instant a familiar voice, whose accents Sarah had already but too truly caught, breaks in
      brazen certainty upon their ears:</p>
<pb n="188"/>
<p>"I am sure I beg a thousand pardons! but in a crush of this kind it is quite unavoidable. I
      really must beg you to make way for me! I am naturally anxious to get to the top of the room,
      having a personal acquaintance with the Duke, or what really amounts to the same thing."</p>
<p>The loud voice grows nearer, the wave-like swell heavier. She is close behind them now.</p>
<p>Belinda has turned white and sick. That dreadful voice! Even here, on this hot May night, in
      the thick festal crowd, of what power is it to re-create for her that miserable fog-stained
      Christmas morning, on which, in her madness, she had allowed a few senseless words uttered by
      that brutal voice to seal her doom for her.</p>
<p>"Speak to her!" she says, in a choked whisper to her sister. "I cannot."</p>
<p>"Hold your head down!" rejoins the other, hastily putting into practice her own precept, and
      burying her nose in the lilies of the valley on her breast; "perhaps she will not see us!"</p>
<pb n="189"/>
<p>But when did Miss Watson ever fail to see anyone?</p>
<p>One final oaring of her powerful arm has brought her alongside of them.</p>
<p>"Belinda! Sarah!" she cries loudly, seeing that her mere presence, although sufficiently
      obvious, has apparently failed to attract their attention; "do not you know me? Emily Watson?
      Dresden? Has anything been going on? have I lost much?—I could not possibly get here
      before—quite a sudden thought my coming at all. I heard that the Sampsons were coming down to
      see their boy, who is at King's; so it struck me I would join them and come, too. I took them
      quite by surprise—met them at the station. 'Why not see Oxbridge all together?' I said; 'halve
      the expense, and double the pleasure!'"</p>
<p>She pauses out of breath, and looks eagerly onwards towards the spot where, beyond his
      mother's struggling lieges, the Prince sits, cool and civil, with his suite on their row of
      chairs.</p>
<p>"I was so afraid that the Prince might be
      <pb n="190"/> gone," pursues she volubly; "the royalties sometimes go so early, you know. Have
      you been presented to him? Do you know him? well, enough to present me? No? Well, then I must
      re-introduce myself: I have no doubt that a word will suffice to recall me to H.R.H.'s
      recollection. Royal memories are proverbially good, you know. I must get hold of his equerry;
      I know him quite well—once crossed over in the same steamer from Newhaven to Dieppe with
      him."</p>
<p>The last few words are thrown back over her shoulder, as she has already resumed her
      vigorous fight onwards.</p>
<p>With fascinated eyes they watch her athlete's progress to the front. The human billows part
      before her. The crowd lies behind her. She has reached smooth water and the Prince.</p>
<p>The signalman's troubles are by this time drawing to their close. His rosy babe has been
      found lying smiling on the line; the express train having, contrary to its usual habit, passed
      over the pretty innocent
      <pb n="191"/> without inflicting a scratch. Most people draw a long breath; but whether at the
      babe's immunity or their own, who shall decide?</p>
<p>"She is making him shake hands with her!" says Sarah, in a shocked voice, standing on
      tiptoe, and stretching her neck.</p>
<p>It is too true. In defiance of etiquette and despite the horrified look of the hostess, Miss
      Watson is warmly grasping her Duke's hand. Against the background of wall and chairs her
      figure stands out plainly silhouetted—fringe, garish evening-dress, and hot red neck! To their
      ears come even fragments of her resonant speech: "Your equerry, sir!" "Newhaven!"
      "Sea-sick!"</p>
<p>"I should like to sit down," says Belinda, in a spent voice.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done. By slow degrees, however, they succeed in edging out of the
      crowd; and are lucky enough to find an unoccupied sofa, upon which Belinda seats herself; and
      whither, presently, various of her acquaintance come and exchange remarks with her upon the
      success
      <pb n="192"/> of the entertainment, the excellence of the supper, the affability of the
      Prince, etc.</p>
<p>In one of the intervals between two of these fragments of conversation she perceives that
      her charge has left her side; but it requires no very distant excursion of the eye to discover
      her standing at the supper-table, an ice in her hand, having, by the agency of one of her
      just-made acquaintance, effected an introduction to a good-looking undergraduate, who in
      return is presenting to her a second, who in his turn will obviously present to her a third
      and a fourth.</p>
<p>A little mob of young men is beginning to gather round her. A moment more, and, her ice
      finished, followed by her <hi>cortège</hi> , Sarah returns to her sister, winking so deftly as
      to be invisible to the outer world as she comes.</p>
<p>"Belinda," she says, "I want to introduce to you Mr. Bellairs, who tells me that he plays
      tennis remarkably well" (an indistinct disclaimer from the blushing Bellairs); "and Mr.
      Stanley, who plays very nicely
      <pb n="193"/> too; and Mr. De Lisle, who thinks he would play very nicely if he had a little
      more practice."</p>
<p>Belinda laughs slightly, amused at the glibness with which her sister has already mastered
      her new admirers' names.</p>
<p>She has risen to her feet again—Professor Forth's wife—the stern-faced beauty whom in their
      walks and talks the boys have often with distant awe admired.</p>
<p>"I am sure," she says, with a sweet cold smile, "that if you care to try our small ground, I
      shall be very—"</p>
<p>She is a tall woman, and her eyes are on a level with Bellairs'. She can, therefore, easily
      look over his shoulder. What sight is it so seen that makes her stop suddenly in mid-speech,
      with a catch in her breath? The pause is but short. Almost before her auditors have had time
      to notice the hiatus, it is filled up.</p>
<p>"I shall be very happy to see you any day you choose to come—to-morrow, any day!"</p>
<p>Her words are perfectly collected; but
      <pb n="194"/> surely she is far, far paler than she was when she began to speak; and though
      her sentences are addressed to the young men, her eyes are wandering oddly beyond them.</p>
<p>"Upon my soul, I believe the woman is off her head!" Stanley says confidentially to
      Bellairs, as they walk home together in the moonlight. "Did you notice her eyes when she was
      talking to us? they made me feel quite jumpy!"</p>
<p>"Off her head!" growls Bellairs, who finds it not impossible to combine a poignant interest
      in Sarah with a servile moth-and-candle-like homage to the elder and severer beauty; "so would
      you be, if you were married to an old mummy!"</p>
