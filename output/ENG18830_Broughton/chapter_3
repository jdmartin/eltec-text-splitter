<l>"For mirth of May, with skippis and with hoppis,</l>
<l>The birdies sang upon the tender croppis,</l>
<l>With curiose notes, as Venus' chapell clerkis.</l>
<l>The roses yong, new spreding of their knoppis,</l>
<l>Were powdered brycht with hevinly beriall droppis,</l>
<l>Throu' bemes rede birnyng as ruby sperkis,</l>
<l>The skyes rang for schouting of the larkis."</l></quote>
<p>A way they go to Moritzburg, when the noon sun is warm and high; away they go,
      handsome, gay, and chaperonless. There is no reason why their grandmother, who is a perfectly
      able-bodied old lady, should not escort them; but as she is sixty-five years of age, has no
      expectation of meeting a lover, and is quite indifferent to spring tints and German Schlosses,
      she wisely chooses to stay at home.</p>
<pb n="35"/>
<p>"If you cannot behave like young gentle-women without having me always at your heels, why,
      all I can say, my dears, is that I am sorry for you," is the formula with which she mostly
      salves her own conscience and dismisses them.</p>
<p>The result is perhaps not worse than that of more pretentious exhortations; for the girls,
      having a sense of being on parole, do behave like young gentlewomen: at least Belinda always
      does, and Sarah very often.</p>
<p>They get into their carriage in a quick and cautious manner; casting, meanwhile,
      apprehensive glances towards a house a good deal lower down the street, and which they will be
      obliged to pass.</p>
<p>"Sarah," says Belinda impressively, unconsciously speaking half under her breath, "if you
      hear a window open, mind you do not look that way. She is quite capable of bawling at us from
      the balcony; and if she finds out where we are going to, she is certain to insist on coming
      too."</p>
<p>"If she gets into this carriage to-day,"
      <pb n="36"/> replies Sarah firmly, "it will be over my dead body!" and away they go.</p>
<p>With lowered parasols and held breath, they pass the dreaded house—pass it in safety. Not a
      sound issues from its silent casements. Away they go, across the Elbe, over the many-arched
      bridge, where the people, more leisurely than in our breathless London, are standing to watch
      the rafts floating down the river, and guided between the piles; through the Neustadt, where
      the Strong August for ever prances in bronze; past the Leipzig Railway Station, under the
      Acacia alley, leaving on their right the great, new, dreary barracks, backed by the pine-wood;
      along, along, between the young birches that, silver-turnked, baby-leaved, stand on each side
      of the way; off a-pleasuring into the country.</p>
<p>They do not talk much—at least to each other. To herself, Belinda is saying over and over
      the same one thing continuously: "He will not be there! I do not at all expect him." She says
      it superstitiously,
      <pb n="37"/> in the trembling hope that if she can cajole the envious gods into believing that
      she does not count upon it, they may let her have her wish. "He will not be there!" But her
      racing pulse and her flushing cheeks say differently; differently too say the wedded birds and
      the springing grasses and the opening buds. They say all together:</p>
<p>"He will be there! He will—he will!"</p>
<p>But perhaps, besides him, there may be some one else, not quite so eagerly desired.</p>
<p>They are not far beyond the town, and are joggling tranquilly along in the sunshine, when
      Belinda is roused with a start from her love-musings by an agitated series of ejaculations
      from Sarah.</p>
<p>"Belinda! She is there! On your side. Quick! Hold down your parasol! Perhaps she may not see
      us."</p>
<p>Swift as lightning Belinda has obeyed. Totally irrespective of the sun's position, her
       <hi>en-tout-cas</hi> stoops till it shields—imperviously, one would think—the inmates of the
      carriage from all passers-by on that side.</p>
<pb n="38"/>
<p>But there are eyes, hard, horny, and inquisitive, to which an <hi>en-tout-cas</hi> —nay, a
      stone wall, if need be—is as glass. The coachman checks his horses; and Sarah, leaning angrily
      out to bid him drive quicker, perceives that he has no alternative, if he would not drive over
      a burly, middle-aged figure gesticulating with raised arms and waved umbrella in mid-road, and
      crying: "Halt, Kutscher!" with all the power of a strong pair of lungs.</p>
<p>"It is no use!" says the girl, sinking back in disgusted resignation on the cushions. "It
      never is any use!"</p>
<p>The next moment the lady to whom she alludes is presenting a hot, red face, a grizzled
      fringe of hair, and a large-patterned black and white plaid gown, at the carriage-door.</p>
<p>"I was afraid you might not see me!" she says, shaking hands warmly. "How are you? Where are
      you going to? I thought I must just stop you for a minute, to ask where you are going to? To
      Moritzburg? How pleasant! I wish I
      <pb n="39"/> were going to Moritzburg too!" Then, as no invitation follows this very broad
      hint: "I dare say, now, as you seem to have plenty of room, you would not mind giving me a
      lift."</p>
<p>"It would be delightful!" says Belinda, with suspicious precipitancy; "but I am afraid—"</p>
<p>"I do not in the least mind sitting back, if that is what you are going to say. It is all
      one to me how I sit. If you had travelled as much as I, it would be all one to you!"</p>
<p>"If Belinda had travelled as much as you," says Sarah sarcastically, "I am sure that her one
      hope and prayer would be to be allowed to stay at home for the rest of her life. Well," with a
      would-be valedictory wave of the hand, "it is too unlucky; but as we have unfortunately
      promised to meet some people—"</p>
<p>"Some people! What people?" repeats the other inquisitively. "Anyone I know, I wonder?
      Professor Forth, of course, for one," with a meaning smile. "I saw
      <pb n="40"/> him setting off this morning somewhere. I knew that it must be an excursion of
      some kind, because he had two overcoats; but I could not make out where. I asked at his
      lodgings, but the Dienstmädchen did not know. And Rivers—young Rivers?— are you going to meet
      him too? <hi>A propos</hi> what Rivers is he? I want to find out what Rivers he is; I know so
      many Rivers."</p>
<p>"I will ask him at once," says Sarah gravely. "I will say to him, 'What Rivers are you?'
       <hi>Au revoir</hi> . Drive on, Kutscher."</p>
<p>"Where are you going to-morrow? What are you going to do to-morrow? Will you come to
      Wesenstein? I want you all to come to Wesenstein! With a little packing we might all get into
      one carriage. What do you say to a long day at Wesenstein? or, better still, Tharandt? What do
      you say to a long day at Tharandt?"</p>
<p>But the carriage has rolled inexorably away; and the latter part of these
      <pb n="41"/> propositions is addressed to the empty air.</p>
<p>"A form of thanksgiving to be used on land!" says Sarah, drawing a long breath, and blowing
      a kiss in ironical adieu to the lessening figure of their baffled friend.</p>
<p>They are nearing their goal now. Along the straight avenue of young horse-chestnuts and
      limes they trot; the wind-swept flat plain on either hand, and the long vista of tree-shaded
      road, ended by the Schloss.</p>
<p>They are driving up to the Gasthof Au Bon Morché. Belinda shuts her eyes. If he is here, he
      will be to be seen at once, or not at all. If he is not here, she will be ignorant of it for
      yet one moment more. She shuts her eyes; but in an instant Sarah's sarcastic ejaculation,
      obviously called forth by the first sight of her betrothed, "My king! my king!" makes her open
      them again; open them to see that she has succeeded in tricking the gods; that he is here; and
      that, judging
      <pb n="42"/> by his looks, he too has been shutting his eyes and dreading.</p>
<p>"How do you do?" says Sarah gaily, giving him her hand. "I have a message for you from Miss
      Wheaton; she wants to know what Rivers you are! I was so afraid of forgetting that I thought I
      had better deliver it at once. Think it over, I advise you, against you meet her next. Bah! he
      does not hear a word I say!"</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later they are all seated on deal chairs at a deal table under a
      primitive shed that does duty as an arbour, waited on by a civil, homely Dienstmädchen in a
      blue bib, and eating beefsteaks. At least two of them are. Two of them are past eating. For
      them the beefsteak cuts juicily; for them the schnitzel swims greasily; for them the excellent
      light lager-bier foams in lidded mugs—in vain. It is indeed dubious whether anyone except
      Sarah enjoys the luncheon <hi>quâ</hi> luncheon. The Professor is doubtful as to the
      digestibility of the schnitzel, and more than doubtful as to
      <pb n="43"/> the prudence of lunching out of doors in a high wind on the 2nd of May. He had
      indeed gone so far as to have luncheon laid in the little beer-and-smoke-stained inn parlour;
      but his betrothed has explained to him so kindly yet firmly that if he lunches indoors he will
      lunch alone, that he has sullenly submitted, merely putting on ostentatiously, one atop of
      another, the two overcoats which, as Miss Watson faithfully reported, he had providently
      brought with him. And yet, though the wind is high, it is not spiteful. It rocks playfully the
      tall oleanders in pots, and swings the little wooden boxes hung in the trees to oblige the
      birds, who find them a quite satisfactory substitute for nests, judging, at least, by the easy
      cheerfulness with which the short-tailed, wise-faced starlings go in and out of the tiny
      apertures.</p>
<p>Whether or not it has pleased or been digestible, luncheon is now ended, and Professor Forth
      is surveying the bill through his spectacles.</p>
<p>"Six marks, sixty pfennigs!" he says,
      <pb n="44"/> proclaiming the total in a tone which announces how very far from content he is
      with it; "one mark, sixty-five pfennigs a head! A very high charge, I should say; undoubtedly
      prices in Germany have doubled since the war! <hi>Viermal Bifstek</hi> !" reading aloud the
      items—"as it turned out, <hi>zweimal</hi> would have been ample. <hi>Zweimal Kartoffeln</hi>
      —"</p>
<p>He breaks off suddenly, for Sarah has twitched the paper out of his hand.</p>
<p>"In mercy spare us!" she cries. "What can be more dreadful than the recapitulation of the
      items of the food one has just swallowed? It is like beginning luncheon all over again, to
      which, with my present feelings, death would be preferable."</p>
<p>By-and-by they set off to visit the Schloss—the four-towered Schloss, with its round red
      domes, and all its little pinnacles and dormer windows—falling, as they go, into two couples,
      though this is not accomplished without a slight manoeuvring on the part of one.</p>
<p>"In heaven's name stop a moment to
      <pb n="45"/> admire this pump!" says Rivers, in an eager whisper to Belinda. "Nothing to
      admire in it?—of course there is not! I never saw an uglier pump in my life, but it will give
      them a good start!"</p>
<p>"Are you so sure that they are anxious to get a good start?" asks Belinda with a significant
      look ahead at Sarah, who, continually throwing back restless glances over her shoulder,
      lagging, stopping on every possible pretext, if she cherishes a desire for a
       <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> , certainly disguises it admirably.</p>
<p>"I am not at all sure," replies the young man, with a dry laugh. "What I am sure of is that
      I wish it."</p>
<p>"Do you think that her back looks as if she were being tolerably civil to him?" pursues
      Belinda, talking on quickly and nervously; "one can gather so much from a person's back. I am
      afraid that the way in which she is jerking her head about does not augur very well for him.
      Was not she rude to him at luncheon? he must
      <pb n="46"/> have heard her whisper to me that he was an old skinflint."</p>
<p>"Perhaps they are all right when they are alone," replies Rivers sanguinely.</p>
<p>Belinda shakes her head.</p>
<p>"I doubt it!"</p>
<p>They have reached the Schloss and its broad slabbed terrace. Belinda is leaning on the old
      stone balustrade, low and weather-worn, that runs round it. Her eyes are fixed on the carved
      stone figures, weather-worn too, that stand out against the pallid fair sky in their old-world
      quaintness; the fat Cupids with abnormal Dachshunds; the ancient vases, rough with stone
      lilies and roses; the fat Cupids again.</p>
<p>Belinda looks at the Cupids, and Rivers looks at her; looks at her as a wholesome minded and
      bodied boy of twenty-two does look at his first love. To him nothing now exists save that
      opaque white cheek; that small disdainful nose, on which Sarah hangs all its owner's
      mischances; that lovely stature that makes other women look squat and bunchy. To him all
      creation
      <pb n="47"/> that is not Belinda—sun, moon, stars, Schloss, Professor, bifsteks—is an
      irrelevant and impertinent accident.</p>
<p>"After all," he says, with a trembling in his vigorous, fresh voice, "I do not think that I
      should much mind how like a dog the woman I loved treated me in company, if she were—if she
      were—as I would have her when we were alone!"</p>
<p>"Would not you?" replies Belinda, suddenly changing colour at the application that she
      herself makes of this speech; and then, in fevered consciousness of her own untimely flush,
      she adds with a callous, cold laugh: "I think I should agree with the poet: " 'Perhaps it was
      right to dissemble your love,    But why need you kick me downstairs?' " </p>
<p>The poor boy looks terribly thrown back; and indeed what ardent young lover would not, at
      such a turn given to a tender speech? And yet in her heart she had
      <pb n="48"/> felt as tender as he, though no human being could have guessed it. Both now lean
      their elbows on the balustrade, and look down on the garden grass, and the stiff fir-trees cut
      into prim yew-shapes; so that unless you look at them very closely you would swear that they
      were yews. And beyond the grass and the firs comes the ruffled blue water, which like a broad
      moat girds the Schloss around. The water is running to-day into little waves and ridges; and
      trees just greening are verdantly bordering its brim. In the garden, beneath the fir-trees a
      pair of figures are seen soberly pacing.</p>
<p>"There they are!" cries Belinda, pointing to them, and thankful for a safe subject with
      which to break the strained silence; "is it possible that she has taken his arm? No; I thought
      it could not be! I wonder what progress she has made towards telling him that she does not
      mean to marry him."</p>
<p>"Is that what she is telling him?" says Rivers, roused to interest by fellow-feeling,
      <pb n="49"/> and craning his neck to look; "unhappy old devil!"</p>
<p>Belinda nods.</p>
<p>"I think so; that is what she meant to tell him; and, if I do not mistake, his haggling over
      the luncheon gave him his <hi>coup de grâce</hi> ."</p>
