<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>Although there may be something in Professor Forth's remark that no one, not let
      into the secret, could now conjecture his wife's invalidhood, yet, by right of that
      invalidhood, she has hitherto been excluded from the longer excursions made by her grandmother
      and sister in the neighbourhood, as being too severe a tax upon her not yet completely
      restored powers. But on the morning succeeding her lake-side colloquy, Mrs. Forth is, it
      appears, expected to resume the habits of health.</p>
<p>"I must request your kind chaperonage," says Miss Churchill, running to meet her
      <pb n="197"/> sister, as that sister enters Mrs. Churchill's sitting-room after breakfast, and
      lifting a cheek as fresh and sweet as soap and water, health and jollity, can make it to hers.
      "Granny has struck work, as she has frequently done before: she has always in her heart hated
      the picturesque, and today I have induced her to own it; eh, granny? As for me, for reasons
      best known to myself, I am going to spend a long and happy day at Coniston; and I see no
      earthly reason why you should not accompany me."</p>
<p>By the extreme positiveness of her tone, and determination of her eye, it may be inferred
      that Sarah looks for a demurrer to this proposition. If such comes, it comes in silence.</p>
<p>"You had much better say 'yes,'" pursues Miss Churchill warmly; "if you do not, and if you
      continue to look as robust as you do now, you will certainly be tied by the leg again to
      Menander before you can draw breath!"</p>
<pb n="198"/>
<p>Belinda laughs, a little unnaturally.</p>
<p>"That shows how little you know about it; Menander has been three months before the
      public."</p>
<p>"Well, no doubt he has left plenty of little brothers behind him," rejoins Sarah lightly;
      "what do you say?"</p>
<p>"Do you think it is safe to venture?" replies Belinda, walking to the window, and pointing
      in faint objection to the blind vapours that feel about the mountaincrests; "do not you think
      that the wather looks rather uncertain?"</p>
<p>"Does it ever look anything else?" retorts Sarah drily. "Come, quick! 'yes' or 'no'?"</p>
<p>"I will ask Mr. Forth if he can spare me," says Belinda reluctantly, leaving the room with
      lagging steps.</p>
<p>"Tell him that he shall be put to no expense; that you shall not even pay the turnpikes,"
      cries Sarah saucily after her.</p>
<p>She returns presently with still more lagging steps.</p>
<pb n="199"/>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"He has no objection," answers Mrs. Forth slackly, sitting down, and letting her arms drop
      depressedly beside her.</p>
<p>"You tried to make him forbid you, and he would not," cries Sarah sharply, and with a
      pungent laugh.</p>
<p>"You are really too clever," replies Belinda, reddening, and with a petulance which shows
      that this shaft has gone home; "you have got your own way; you always get your own way. I am
      going with you; let us hear no more about it."</p>
<p>The carriage is at the door, and a few such idlers as mostly watch the arrival and departure
      of each coming and going vehicle, hang about it. Sarah is already seated, and is exchanging
      such chastened and diluted gallantries as the publicity of the situation will admit, with some
      one hanging over the balcony overhead. Belinda has purposely loitered over her dressing, in
      the hope that some opportune mountain storm may even yet intervene to
      <pb n="200"/> hinder the execution of the, to her, so distasteful project.</p>
<p>But in vain. The perverse and hostile sky is, all too obviously, clearing. As she issues
      from the hall, she glances furtively to right and left. Yes, he is here! His voice, which but
      for Sarah's manoeuvring might have been all day in her happy ears, is addressing her.</p>
<p>"You are going out?"</p>
<p>(Do they all hear, as plainly as she does, the blank disappointment and discomfiture of his
      tone?)</p>
<p>"Yes," she answers, lifting for an instant her eyes with an instinct of ungovernable
      plaintiveness to his; "for the day! on a pleasure-trip! Wish me joy!"</p>
<p>She has taken her seat, and, just as they are setting off, she leans forward, and addressing
      the driver, repeats in a peculiarly clear and distinct voice that direction which has already
      been given him, "To Coniston!"</p>
<p>"You are determined that there shall
      <pb n="201"/> be no mistake as to our destination, I see," says Sarah sarcastically.</p>
<p>Belinda's chest heaves.</p>
<p>"I thought that you might like Mr. Bellairs to know," she answers ironically. "By-the-bye,
      who is to keep watch and ward over him in your absence?"</p>
<p>"I have received private information that they all mean to come to Coniston too," replies
      Sarah tranquilly. "I thought I would be beforehand with them!—a poor project, but mine
      own!"</p>
<p>Away they go from the wind-freshened lake, whose waves are running riot in the sun; while,
      as they pass along, the clouds roll up and up from fell and scaw and nab, leaving only a lawny
      kerchief here and there about their necks; as though loth all at once to desert them. And
      by-and-by kerchief and veil are swept away too, and the hills are free.</p>
<p>Through loveliest pasture-fields, crowded with great bluebells and vetches, and meadow-sweet
      that smells of almonds; by
      <pb n="202"/> meadows where women are tossing the late hay, beside the laughing Rotha; under
      Loughrigg and over chattering Brathay's grey stone bridge they go. Up and up they climb;
      between the weather-painted walls, with their lavish ferns and their crannied flowers; till at
      the top of the long ascent they pause to breathe the horses, and look back.</p>
<p>Fair mountain-wonders, now again conversing with the clouds; and yet lit on your bare flanks
      by the sun: Red Screes, Fairfield, Wansfell Pike, with your pointed head! to which of you
      shall we give crown and sceptre, as Queen-hill, in this your morning glory? For a while they
      both look in silence. Then:</p>
<p>"It seems a pity that we are not in the least enjoying ourselves," says Sarah
      regretfully.</p>
<p>Belinda's heart gives a passionate assent, though her lips are closed. Is not life full of
      such pities? of exquisite spread feasts, and gagged mouths that are not allowed
      <pb n="203"/> to taste them? With what an agony of pleasure would she be looking at these
      curly mists and shining shoulders; at these heavenly becks, rain-swollen in their noisy mirth,
      dashing in happy bounds down the hillsides, if only—if only! And this is such an easy,
      probable "if," too!</p>
<p>"If you could but think it, you know," continues Miss Churchill, turning in calm reasoning
      to her sister, "I am really much better company than David; and it is no great stretch of
      imagination to say that you are not much duller than Bellairs, eh?"</p>
<p>But Belinda is still staring, in sullen, grudging misery at the wasted loveliness before
      her.</p>
<p>"Shall we try to pretend, at all events, that we like it?" says Sarah persuasively. "It
      would be more to our credit; I think <hi>I</hi> could, if you could."</p>
<p>But Mrs. Forth is unable to promise even thus much.</p>
<p>"You cannot do it?" says Sarah leniently; "well, I am the last person who
      <pb n="204"/> has any right to blame you. Personally, I have never cared for a landscape
      without figures in the foreground!"</p>
<p>But as time goes on, this seems to be the species of landscape to which Miss Churchill is
      to-day to be condemned. Although Coniston has been long ago reached, luncheon eaten, and
      several coaches and <hi>char-à-bancs</hi> driven up and unloaded, yet is there no sign of the
      appearance of any one of the ornamental foreground figures for which she had confidently
      looked.</p>
<p>"Beaten by a banjo!" says she tragically; "if it had not been for the banjo I should have
       <hi>walked</hi> away from her. I will never go anywhere without a banjo again!"</p>
<p>Belinda laughs grimly. "I would not!"</p>
<p>"I suppose there must be some tiresome sight to be seen here," says Sarah, yawning; "it
      would never do if they found out that we had not seen it: not the lake— no! I could not bear
      that; it would remind me of the dinghey! What did the
      <pb n="205"/> waiter tell us? copper-mines and a water-fall? Come, do look a little livelier,
      and brace your mind to copper-mines and a waterfall!"</p>
<p>They set out dispiritedly, but before they have gone five yards:</p>
<p>"I will leave word which way we have gone," cries Sarah, brightening, "in case anyone asks
      for us."</p>
<p>"A most unnecessary precaution!" replies Belinda morosely.</p>
<p>A walk undertaken in such a spirit is not likely to be productive of any very acute
      enjoyment.</p>
<p>"We are to turn to the right when we reach the Black Bull!" says Sarah gloomily; "I wonder
      what would happen if we turned to the left?"</p>
<p>But they have not the energy even to make this experiment. They have passed village and
      white-washed church, and asking their way of the civil villagers, presently find themselves
      climbing a mountain road, with a little gay river frisking
      <pb n="206"/> over its worn boulder stones on their right, and a green fell on their left. Ere
      long the road leaves the bright beck, and climbs higher than it; and trees interpose a leafy
      shield between them and their noisy friend. But it calls to them from beneath, "I am here; you
      will find me soon again." And so they do. For by-and-by the road swerves to the right, and
      they are once more free from the envious sycamores and mountain ashes, with their red
      rosaries, and are standing on a rough stone mortarless bridge with parapet broken down, and
      beneath them the stream plunges in a little storm of foam. Is this the waterfall? They do not
      know; they do not much care. It is a little waterfall, even if it be not the one in search of
      which they have been sent.</p>
<p>"My cup is full!" says Sarah, sitting resolutely down. "I am hot; I have not a leg to stand
      upon; my pretty project has <hi>avorté</hi> ; if Niagara were round the corner I would not go
      to look at it. Oh,
      <pb n="207"/> why did I leave my granny? dear granny! how she would have hated this!"</p>
<p>"Even more than you do?" asks Belinda cynically.</p>
<p>Mrs. Forth is still standing, her eyes riveted on the little cascade, and her heart
      repeating over and over to itself that bitter morning plaint: "How pleasant! if only—if
      only—what?"</p>
<p>"Belinda!" says her sister, after a while, in a voice of cautious triumph, "do you see
      anything moving between the trees? yes? I thought so! A more direct answer to prayer I have
      seldom heard of!" Then, with an abrupt change of tone to one of sharp and real annoyance: "If
      he has not brought that eternal David with him!"</p>
<milestone rend="stars" unit="subsection"/>
<p>"Are you going to see the coppermines?" says Miss Churchill demurely, a couple of minutes
      later, addressing the new arrivals; "so were we. But we have broken down; perhaps you will
      tell us about them this evening!"</p>
<pb n="208"/>
<p>"We never heard that there were any," replies Bellairs, with an unvarnished boyish
      bluntness. "We came to look for you; we understood that you had left word."</p>
<p>For once in her life Sarah looks a shade foolish.</p>
<p>Belinda, still standing, has remained looking, as if in absorption, at the waterfall. It is
      not much of one, after all. Its noise does not deafen you; its spray does not drench you; it
      is but a few feet that it plunges. But how snowy-clean is its foam! How agilely it springs
      down! How pleasant its voice! Like the voice of Undine calling to her false Huldbrand! What
      wondrous green ferns lip its waters!</p>
<p>"You said 'To Coniston!'" This is the murmur that comes to Belinda's ear. Is it the brook
      that utters it? She turns her head sharply away; but not before he has seen that the
      rowan-berries are scarcely redder than she.</p>
<p>And then (neither inviting, nor being invited) they saunter away together, as if
      <pb n="209"/> they would fain follow the stream to its springs in the mountain-lap. At least,
      they may lend it their company for a little while. Almost in silence they linger along, and
      gravely watch its lovely antics, as, in little cataracts and water-breaks and jumps, it sings
      and dances along in its jubilant old age (for how many centuries has it sung and capered?)
      that is so like youth!</p>
<p>"I wish I could think that I should wear as well!" said Mrs. Forth, with an excited laugh,
      sitting down on a grey stone beside the road that leads up to the copper-mines.</p>
<p>The sun has gone for awhile, and the fells look serious and careworn. They are old, too,
      like the brook; but they scarcely carry their years so well. He has thrown himself at her
      feet, that favourite symbolic attitude of his—body and soul, past, present, and future—is not
      he always there? In their ears is the booming of the mountain bees; and
      <pb n="210"/> the rivulet's warble. There is no longer an " <hi>if</hi> "!</p>
<p>"How long are you going to stay at Lowood?" she asks abruptly.</p>
<p>She had not meant to put the question, and bitterly regrets it when it is pronounced; but it
      forces itself out, in spite of her.</p>
<p>"I shall go when you tell me."</p>
<p>Her forehead contracts with a furrow of angry pain.</p>
<p>"You have no right to throw the decision upon me," she answers indignantly; "it is
      ungenerous. Why, are not you perfectly well able to judge for yourself?"</p>
<p>"Because—" he answers, looking full at her, and speaking steadily, though very low, "because
      I broke down once; what security have I that I should not break down again?"</p>
<p>Her eyes drop, and now the rowanberries claim no kinship with her cheeks.</p>
<p>"That was <hi>my</hi> fault!" she answers faintly, turning dead-white.</p>
<pb n="211"/>
<p>"No!" he says slowly, yet with agitation, "it was not! Perhaps your being late that day may
      have accelerated it; but it would have come anyhow," with rising passion. "It would have come
      anyhow; how could it help coming? When I am with you," speaking with a sort of despair, "how
      can it ever help coming?"</p>
<p>Her hot fingers pick the cool mountain daisies.</p>
<p>"You must do as you think best!" she murmurs, half in tears.</p>
<p>How solemnly the hills are listening! The higher ones, indeed, are out of sight; so
      forwardly have grim Coniston Old Man's younger brothers thrust themselves before him.</p>
<p>From the bridge come sounds of rapturous manly merriment, which tell how far ahead of the
      banjo and its owner Sarah's tongue is triumphantly carrying her.</p>
<p>Rivers has raised himself into a sitting posture, and in his hand he is bruising and
      <pb n="212"/> crushing a bit of the dwarf bracken that grows beside them.</p>
<p>"You—you would give me another chance, then?" he says indistinctly; "you —you would let me
      try again?"</p>
<p>Is there any slightest doubt as to what her answer should be; and yet she hesitates.</p>
<p>"I—I—have so few friends," she answers, as if apologetically and sobbing; "as I have always
      told you, I do not know how to make friends! my life is so empty, and now that I am obviously
      perfectly recovered," with a sort of exasperation, "will no doubt be so long! You must do as
      you think best!"</p>
<p>He looks at her in a dumb agony for fully a hundred heart-beats. Does she know what she is
      asking of him? In her divine high innocence she does not understand. It is for him to
      understand for her! Her head is bent, and upon her white hands and whiter daisies one slow
      tear splashes. Until that tear it was possible to him! Until that tear!</p>
<pb n="213"/>
<p>"I must do as I think best?" he cries in passionate excitement, wholly carried away; "is
      that what you tell me? Then I think best to stay! The case is changed —it is not what it was
      then: I was taken by surprise. I was off my guard!—fore-warned, forearmed, you know! Yes, it
      is quite safe now!"</p>
<p>"But is it?" she says, shuddering, too late terrified by the wildness of his look and the
      mad triumph of his eyes; "is it?"</p>
<milestone rend="stars" unit="subsection"/>
<p>Is it indeed? There has been a week in which to answer this question.</p>
<p>"It is putting one into such a disagreeable position!" says Mrs. Churchill pettishly.</p>
<p>The hour is the immediately after breakfast one; and she is sitting at the table, an open
      writing-case before her, papers and an hotel bill spread around. Her usual equable brow is
      ruffled. The
      <pb n="214"/> manager of the hotel has just left the room.</p>
<p>"Being apparently all of the same party, it is so difficult to explain that we are not
      responsible for his eccentricities," continues Mrs. Churchill in a tonc of growing
      annoyance.</p>
<p>"Heaven has so obviously framed you for each other, that they cannot disabuse themselves of
      the idea that you are husband and wife," says Sarah in an amused voice from the window. "I saw
      incredulity in the manager's eye when you were laboriously explaining that he was your
      grandson-in-law; he wondered why, if you must tell a lie, you should tell such a bad one!"</p>
<p>"I fancy that there is not the most paltry item of his bill over which he does not haggle,"
      says Mrs. Churchill indignantly. "It is too petty! it makes one quite hot! I am sure that they
      would gladly pay him to go away! Of course it will end in his driving <hi>us</hi> off! Oh,
      Belinda, my dear, are you there? I am sure I beg
      <pb n="215"/> your pardon; but what is said cannot be unsaid, and you really come into the
      room in such a creep-mouse way that one does not know whether you are in it or not!"</p>
<p>"It is not of the least consequence," replies Belinda, though her face burns. "I will
      certainly try to make more noise next time; and for the present, perhaps I am best away."</p>
<p>As she speaks she walks to the door, opens it, and closes it gently behind her; then
      deliberately mounts the stairs to her husband's attic. His occupation seems to be of somewhat
      the same nature as her grandmother's. At least, before him too, papers and a bill are
      spread.</p>
<p>"I was on the point of summoning you to my aid," he says, looking up as she enters; "I
      wished to consult you as to several of these items," indicating them with his long thin
      forefinger, "of which personally I have no knowledge whatever. A couple of stamps on the 15th,
      a bottle of Apollinaris water on the 18th, enevlopes
      <pb n="216"/> on the 19th. May I ask whether these entries are correct, or whether they are
      due to carelessness on the part of the manager? in which case I shall of course at once take
      him to task, for such culpable oversight."</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that it is all right," still with that burning in her face; "what can it
      matter?"</p>
<p>"In my opinion it matters extremely," replies he sharply; "your memory can, at all events,"
      again referring to the bill, "go back so far as yesterday? you can at least inform me whether
      or not you ordered a bottle of seltzer-water yesterday?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replies she, defiantly shrugging her shoulders—"two, three, half a dozen!"</p>
<p>He looks at her with a not altogether ill-founded exasperation.</p>
<p>"You are obviously resolved, for some unexplained reason, to thwart my purpose," he says
      slowly; "but it is of the less consequence, since I have made up my mind at once to leave this
      place, where
      <pb n="217"/> the scale of expenditure into which I am led—probably owing to a mistaken notion
      of my connection with your grandmother —is indubitably higher than I was taught to
      expect."</p>
<p>She has been looking straight before her, with a dogged <hi>insouciance</hi> ; but at the
      mention of his purpose of departure that look vanishes, and her cheeks blanch.</p>
<p>"You mean to leave this place?" she says, in a low voice; "and yet," with irony, "wherever
      you go you will have to pay for the postage stamps I buy and the Apollinaris water I
      drink."</p>
<p>"It is not merely a question of expense," rejoins he, colouring faintly at her tone; "I have
      daily more reason to be convinced that the air of this place does not suit me; I have slept
      worse, and my palpitations have been sensibly severer since my arrival. I am aware that you
      always assume a look of incredulity when I allude to my maladies."</p>
<p>"Do I?" she answers, with a preoccupied
      <pb n="218"/> air, as if she were not thinking of what she was saying. "I beg your pardon; I
      did not mean it."</p>
<p>"I have written to engage rooms for to-morrow at the Lodore Hotel at the head of
      Derwentwater; a coach starts from here at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and—"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say that we are to go —to leave this place— <hi>to-morrow</hi> ?" she
      interrupts, with a sort of gasp.</p>
<p>Her eyes are dilated, and there is a roughness in her voice which she herself hears. He
      makes a sign of assent.</p>
<p>"It is <hi>impossible</hi> !" she says, speaking low and rapidly; "you have never asked my
      opinion; you have never consulted me. How can the air of one of these lakes differ from that
      of another? it is fancy— all fancy! As you said to me the other day, there is nothing that
      gains upon one so much by indulgence in them as valetudinarian fancies!"</p>
<p>He turns his eyes slowly from the bill,
      <pb n="219"/> on which they have been, until now, riveted, in painstaking search for errors,
      the discovery of which may diminish the total, and fixes them piercingly upon her.</p>
<p>"You seem to be unaccountably reluctant to quite this place," he says, very slowly; "why are
      you so much attached to it?"</p>
<p>There is that in his tone, or she thinks so, which is unlike anything she has ever heard in
      it before—that which at once strikes her murmurings dumb. But a passing frenzy seizes her,
      bidding her answer him, for once truly; tell him, in so many words, face to face, <hi>why</hi>
      ; to throw the game up—have done with it! It is true that the longing for that lunatic relief
      is but short; a brief insanity that leaves her trembling and terror-struck—not at him, but at
      herself.</p>
<p>He has long removed his scrutiny from her face, and has been, for many minutes, re-immersed
      in his dissection of the bill, before she speaks; and when she does, it
      <pb n="220"/> is clear that he has no further insubordination to fear from her.</p>
<p>"The coach starts at eleven?" she says, in a very low voice. "I will be ready!"</p>
<p>So saying, she rises, and drags herself to the door.</p>
<p>"If you see a waiter, will you be good enough to tell him that I wish to speak to the
      manager?" says her husband, looking up; "they are apt to disregard my bell, and there are
      several of these items which I shall indisputably contest."</p>
<p>Having docilely fulfilled this commission, Mrs. Forth once more returns to her grandmother's
      sitting-room, and looks in.</p>
<p>"Is granny here?"</p>
<p>"She is not," replies Sarah, from her usual watch-tower, the window. "To tell you the truth,
      I have been giving her a little piece of my mind, as to her incivility to you; she knew as
      well as I did that you were in the room. I have been making her so angry," breaking into a
      <pb n="221"/> laugh, "by telling her that she is certainly growing a little deaf!"</p>
<p>Since the coast is clear, Belinda has entered, and sunk inertly into a chair.</p>
<p>"It <hi>is</hi> a little annoying for her, one must own," resumes Sarah, with an air of
      impartiality, "to be suspected of collusion with the economies of our friend upstairs; it
      would not be a bad thing if we could manage to establish the fact that there is no connection
      beyond a tender family affection between us and him!"</p>
<p>"You cannot be more anxious to prove it than he is," replies Belinda; but, as she speaks, no
      hot red wave of shame flows this time over her face; stronger emotions than that which had
      called it forth have too successfully driven the blood back to her heart; "but in any case you
      will not be troubled with him long!"</p>
<p>"Is he going to die?" cries Sarah, with extreme animation, leaving her post of observation,
      and hastening to her sister's side.</p>
<pb n="222"/>
<p>"He threatens that if he stays here he will!"</p>
<p>"I wonder is there anything really the matter with him?" says Sarah, in a tone of acute
      curiosity. "There is something very interesting about his diseases; I always regret not having
      utilized my former opportunities to learn more about them. I suppose there <hi>must</hi> be
      something odd about his heart, or the doctors he consulted would not have given him drops for
      it."</p>
<p>"And would not they have given him pills for his liver, or draughts for his spleen either?"
      asks Mrs. Forth bitterly. "Is not it a little improbable that <hi>all</hi> his organs have
      been hopelessly deranged for the last sixty years? No, no!" with a shrug, "you need not be
      alarmed; he will see us all out!"</p>
<p>"Then why are we not to be troubled with him long?" inquires Miss Churchill, puzzled.</p>
<p>"He imagines that this place disagrees
      <pb n="223"/> with him," replies Belinda, in a dull, flat voice; "and so we are to leave
      to-morrow for Derwentwater; to-morrow morning, by the coach that starts at eleven."</p>
<p>"And you have consented?" (very sharply, and with an accent of excessive astonishment).</p>
<p>Her sister's answer to this simple question seems not at once forthcoming. And when it does
      come, it is by no means a direct one.</p>
<p>"Sarah," she says slowly, and turning even whiter than she already is—though, indeed, that
      is scarcely needful—"do you remember once telling me that you were afraid I was going to the
      devil, and that I was taking"—a pause and a sort of gasp— "David Rivers with me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I remember!" replies the other drily.</p>
<p>"Then why"—Mrs. Forth's voice has sunk to a whisper—"then why have you never told me so
      lately?"</p>
<pb n="224"/>
<p>Miss Churchill's eyebrows rise.</p>
<p>"My dear soul," she says bluntly, "you did not receive my first exhortation in such a spirit
      as to make me very anxious to hazard a second."</p>
<p>Belinda's head has sunk forward upon her chest.</p>
<p>"You were not very far wrong then!" she says faintly, "but you would be still nearer the
      truth now!"</p>
<p>There is a silence. Sarah has begun to march unquietly up and down the room, with her hands
      behind her. Perhaps the confession just made her does not partake much of the nature of a
      surprise. For there is less of astonishment than of genuine concern in her face.</p>
<p>"And you are going?" she says abruptly; "but who is to prevent his following you?"</p>
<p>Belinda's lip trembles.</p>
<p>"He will not, if I tell him not." Her eyes wander wistfully away through the window to
      mountain and mere. The
      <pb n="225"/> high peaks are still withdrawn into the mystery of their morning vapours, but
      all the lovely lake is at play with the sun. To-morrow, to-morrow, he was to have rowed her on
      that lake!</p>
<p>Suddenly her attitude of subdued wretchedness changes to one of more violent pain.</p>
<p>"What am I thinking of?" she cries, starting up; "I had forgotten! I shall not see him
      again; he has been obliged to go to Milnthorpe to-day on business; and by the time he gets
      back to-morrow, we shall be gone! we shall be <hi>gone</hi> !"</p>
<p>"He will be after you by the next coach!" replies Sarah, with cynical good sense.</p>
<p>Belinda utters a low groan.</p>
<p>"I must write to him!"</p>
<p>"Do not!" cries Sarah dissuasively: " <hi>never</hi> write! Whatever else you give up,
      adhere to that one golden rule! In the length and breadth of Europe," says Miss Churchill,
      with a modest pride,
      <pb n="226"/> "there is not a square inch of my handwriting to be obtained!"</p>
<p>Once again Belinda moans.</p>
<p>"If I do not write, he will certainly find out where we have gone to; unless"— her eyes
      still taking that miserable farewell journey to the lake—"unless I leave word that we do not
      wish it known."</p>
<p>"That would scarcely do," rejoins Sarah drily; "it would be hardly advisable to take the
      waiters into our confidence."</p>
<p>A pause. Miss Churchill still pursuing her restless walk, and undistracted even by the
      strains of the banjo clearly heard from below, and the sound of a male, as well as a female
      voice, obviously accompanying it.</p>
<p>"I suppose," she says by-and-by, sighing impatiently, "that the end of it is, it will
      devolve upon me: our <hi>rôles</hi> are reversed. All my life I have been asking you to
      undertake disagreeable commissions for me, and now I must do you the same kind office. I
      suppose that <hi>I</hi> must tell him!"</p>
<pb n="227"/>
<p>" <hi>You</hi> ?" cries Belinda, wheeling suddenly round, a passionate dissent from this
      proposal in voice and eyes, and with a new rush of her lately dormant old and senseless
      jealousy; "why <hi>you</hi> ?"</p>
<p>"Would you prefer granny?" asks Sarah quietly. "Some one must tell him; you can hardly
      suppose that I very greedily covet the office!"</p>
<p>At the cool rationality of her sister's words, Belinda's rebel blood slowly subsides again,
      and her head sinks once more upon her breast. How thin these floors are! One can hear each
      word of the idiotic melody warbled by Bellairs and the girl in red; but Miss Churchill never
      flinches. Belinda is the first to speak, though it is not at once easy to comprehend the drift
      of her words, so unsure and muffled is her voice.</p>
<p>"You will tell him as kindly as you can?"</p>
<p>"Do you think it will kill him?" replies Sarah, with a touch of sarcasm; "if you
      <pb n="228"/> remember, you thought that his father's death would kill him, but it did not!
      Pooh! They take more killing than that!"</p>
