<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>"Often, however, was there a question present to me: should some one now at the turning of
      that corner blow thee suddenly out of Space into the other world, or no-world, by pistol-shot,
      how were it?"</p>
<p><hi>The</hi> wrench is accomplished. The coach that starts at eleven o'clock has started.
      Within the close precincts of its interior, it has carried away, among other persons, the
      cautiously-enveloped figure of Professor Forth; and among its mackintoshed and umbrellad
      outside passengers, it reckons his wife.</p>
<p>"I never was so glad of anything in my life," says Mrs. Churchill, walking briskly back to
      the fire from the rain-blurred window, whence she has been waving
      <pb n="230"/> adieux of accented tenderness to her descendants.</p>
<p>"Not even when you first hailed him as grandson?" asks Sarah caustically.</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchill reddens.</p>
<p>"Poor soul!" says the girl, with an accent of heartfelt compassion, following with her eyes
      the departing vehicle.</p>
<p>"I never can understand why you should pity her!" retorts the elder woman, with irritation;
      "there is no greater mistake than to measure everyone by one's own foot-rule."</p>
<p>"I suppose that without offence to anyone, I may pity her for getting extremely wet,"
      replies Sarah surlily.</p>
<p>And certainly, on this count, Mrs. Forth, by the time of her arrival at the Lodore Hotel,
      does deserve as much compassion as she can get. Stiff and drenched, she has climbed down from
      her perch. Pouring as is the day, the coach has been crowded. Belinda's ribs on each side feel
      indented with the continued nudging of her companions'
      <pb n="231"/> elbows; and there has been such a cordial interchange of drips between all the
      umbrellas, that it would have been a sensibly drier course to have taken no umbrellas at all.
      Upon the tarpaulin that covers the luggage, lakes of water have collected, which, at each
      fresh jolt of the coach, discharge themselves refreshingly upon the passengers' knees. As far
      as any glimpse of mountain that the blanket-clouds have allowed them to obtain is concerned,
      they might as well have been in Holland. Dunmail Raise, Skiddaw, Saddleback—what have they
      been but various names for the one huge white pelt? It is a grand day for the becks—the
      foaming, jumping, brimful becks, and they are the only cheerful things she has seen; they, and
      the long lythrums growing lushly beside them.</p>
<p>"You have no one to blame but yourself," says Professor Forth, emerging, dry and warm, from
      the steaming interior, and severely regarding his half-drowned wife; "had you taken my
      advice—"</p>
<pb n="232"/>
<p>"I blame no one," she interrupts, apathetically; "there is no great harm in being wet; it is
      very easy to get dry again!"</p>
<p>"You have every appearance of having taken a chill," scrutinizing her shivering figure with
      an angry solicitude that might appear the outcome of an anxious affection; "it would be
      extremely vexatious if, thanks to a mere caprice on your part, you were to be so soon again
      laid up. I must insist upon your at once drinking a glass of hot brandy-and-water as a
      preventive!"</p>
<p>"I have taken no chill," she answers faintly, but she obeys with a dull acquiescence.</p>
<p>There is no draught he could offer her, from Socrates' hemlock upwards or down-wards, that
      she would not think it less trouble to take than to refuse. The rain pours on and on, all
      through the <hi>table-d'hôte</hi> , all through the long, long evening. There is a public
      drawing-room to which, after dinner, the other guests betake themselves,
      <pb n="233"/> shawl-wrapped, grumbling, and uttering aspirations for a fire. Belinda has not
      the heart to accompany them. She climbs the stairs to her bedroom in the roof, although at
      eight o'clock it is scarcely possible to go to bed. No sense, indeed, of the prematureness of
      the hour prevents her flying to the blessed keeping of sleep; but the knowledge that whatever
      moments are filched from consciousness now, will be asked back with usury in the grey morning
      hours—those grim, grey hours that only the tiny minority of the quite happy and the completely
      innocent dare face.</p>
<p>Her window is open, and looks to the back; to the wooded hill rising so immediately behind
      the house that it seems as if, with outstretched hand, one might touch it. The rain swishes
      past: now and then, when the freakish gust takes it, swishes in. She sits down on her bed and
      listens to it. For two hours she will listen to its swishing; and then, perhaps, she may dare
      give
      <pb n="234"/> herself—tired body and sick heart—to slumber. With the rain mixes the
      never-ceasing noise of the waterfall. On a sultry summer night no doubt it is sweet and
      lulling, falling coolly beneath the stars; but it seems to treble, to centuple the dreariness
      of this inclement drenching evening, cold as winter, and without winter's palliatives of thick
      curtains and blazing logs. It gets upon her nerves at last. It seems as if she must stop it
      for one instant or die. If its wet din would fill her brain, indeed, as it fills her ears,
      crowding out other presences, she would thank it, and bless it on her knees; but, on the
      contrary, its clamour seems to make thought sharper, memory intenser, fancy wilder. With what
      a dreadful liveliness does she rehearse—set to the murderous monotony of its tune—the scene of
      Rivers' back-coming to-morrow! It grows at last so hideously real that she asks herself in
      bewilderment, "Has she really seen—is she really seeing it?"</p>
<pb n="235"/>
<p>She passes her hand across her forehead and rubs her eyes. In what room of the hotel—in
      which often-trodden spot by wave-lipped mere will the blow fell him? How will he take it? Will
      it kill him? She laughs aloud. "Pooh! as Sarah says, 'they take more killing than that!' And
      how much killing will she herself take?" This Sarah has never told her. How much of this slow
      death? A great, great deal! Was ever anyone so full of obstinate life as she? Other
      women—women who prayed to live, women with little children's chubby arms about their necks,
      with passionate, fond husbands, wetting their faint hands with good-bye tears—would have died
      of such an illness as hers. She, childless, hated and hating, has survived. A sense of
      impotent, dark rebellion fills her soul. Of what use to save her alive? What sense in it? To
      save her alive in order to show her just one small glimpse of what life might have been, and
      then to hurl her back into what life is! What life
      <pb n="236"/> might have been! Oh, the terrible vividness of that vision!</p>
<p>She has fallen sideways upon her bed, which, as well as her whole body, is shaken with the
      force of her silent sobs. They must be silent, for the walls are thin, and her husband's attic
      is next door.</p>
<p>"If we had once belonged to each other," she says, with a violent agony of emphasis, "even
      if afterwards I had seen him struck dead at my feet, still, I should have known what is the
      very best thing that life holds; I could have said, 'I have lived!' but now I shall lie down
      in my grave, knowing that there has always been something immeasurably better than anything I
      know, just beyond me!"</p>
<p>After that, she lies quite still, a sort of numb calm succeeding the hurricane, and outside
      the rain swirls always, and the waterfall tumbles. There must be more of soothing properties
      in their joint sound than she gives them credit for, since by-and-by
      <pb n="237"/> their sullen music grows dim in her ears, and she sleeps.</p>
<p>She awakes in the early morning, forlorn and cold, to find that she has lain all night fully
      dressed, outside her bed. She is down in good time, and stands outside the hall-door, waiting
      for breakfast to be announced. The rain has ceased. The wind has torn and hurled the clouds
      apart, and let the sun look through; and also swept clear little intensely blue islands in the
      sky. The shadows are flying, speedy as dreams, along Skiddaw's flanks, and Derwentwater
      lies—all billowy and disturbed— at the foot of her girdling fells. On the bit of marshy grass
      that intervenes between Belinda and the lake, several horses are grazing, and two rolling. One
      cannot roll quite over, which seems to annoy him.</p>
<p>"I hope that you are recovered from the effects of your yesterday's imprudence," says a
      voice at her elbow.</p>
<p>She starts.</p>
<pb n="238"/>
<p>"There were not any to recover from," she answers, with a shrug.</p>
<p>"In that case," says her husband stiffly, "and since you have every appearance of being in
      other respects perfectly restored to health, I think I am justified in proposing that you
      should return to your normal habits, which have been for so long, and at such great
      inconvenience to myself, interrupted."</p>
<p>Belinda smiles slightly. She is well aware that it is only the presence of her grandomother
      and Sarah that has, up to this time, prevented the pack-saddle from being replaced upon her
      back. It is being now, at the earliest opportunity, strapped on again. Well, what matter?</p>
<p>"I perfectly agree with you," she answers hastily. "I have not the shadow of an excuse for
      any further idleness. After such a holiday," catching her breath in a sigh, "a little work
      will do me good."</p>
<p>But people's ideas as to what a little work is, differ.</p>
<pb n="239"/>
<p>"I need scarcely tell you," says the Professor, when, after the <hi>table-d'hôte</hi>
      breakfast, he and she have mounted to his bedroom, which, as at Lowood, is also his
      study—"indeed, it has once or twice struck me with surprise that the idea of a spontaneous
      offer of assistance should not have occurred to you—that my correspondence is very seriously
      in arrears; moderate application, however, will to-day reduce it in a great degree to order. I
      have briefly indicated, upon each letter, the tenour of the answer I wish drawn up."</p>
<p>As he speaks, he places before her a large pile of docketed letters. If any dismay at its
      height and breadth enters her soul, she swallows it down in silence. The sun comes forth in
      summer strength, but though the room is not a tenth part as large as the Professor's Oxbridge
      study, the window is as rigorously closed as ever it was there. The garret, like her own,
      looks to the back, and in it there is no escape from the waterfall's loud pouring.
      <pb n="240"/> She is still teased by that maniac notion that she must make it stop or die.
      Unused, for the past couple of months, to close air, to confinement, to toil, her head soon
      begins to ache, sometimes swims, burns always, but she makes no complaint.</p>
<p>The clock strikes one; she hears cheerful voices, and steps trooping down the passage
      outside to luncheon. The Professor is no great advocate of luncheon, even when he can eat it
      at some one else's expense; at an hotel he simply ignores the possibility of its existence.
      But she cannot complain. He is willing to share with her such hospitality as he extends to
      himself. Biscuits bought at a shop in Ambleside, so that there may be no danger of their
      figuring in the hotel bill, and weak brandy-and-water —the brandy also his own. She declines
      the brandy, would fain decline the biscuits too; to eat in such an air, and with such a heavy
      head, seems impossible, but she dreads being scolded for her sickliness if she refuse.</p>
<pb n="241"/>
<p>Two o'clock strikes! Three! Halfpast three! Four! Even now her pile seems scarce perceptibly
      diminished. Two or three times she has been thrown back, by having to draw up a fresh draft,
      her muddled brain and wandering thoughts having led her to mistake the sense of his
      directions. Hopeless tears fill her eyes, as she tears across each sheet and begins another.
      As the clock strikes four, the pen drops from her numbed fingers.</p>
<p>"I think you must excuse me," she says faintly. "I—I—do not feel very well!"</p>
<p>"Not well?" returns he sharply; "then your indisposition is, of course, attributable to the
      chill you contracted yesterday!"</p>
<p>"The chill?" replies she, laughing hysterically, and pressing her hot hands to her throbbing
      forehead. "The <hi>chill</hi> ? Oh, how delightful it would be to have a chill! No, no! it is
      only the old story! It is only that I have broken down again!"</p>
<pb n="242"/>
<p>"Impossible!" he cries angrily; "in that case, your health can never have been really
      re-established!"</p>
<p>"I suppose not," assents she dully. "Well, may I go?"</p>
<p>"Why do you ask?" retorts he waspishly, and regarding with a dissatisfied air her
      uncompleted task. "Do I ever put any check upon your actions? I merely reserve to myself the
      right of requesting that you will not incur the risk of contracting another chill."</p>
<p>She is very willing to buy her liberty at the price of this most unnecessary promise. At
      what price would not she buy air, the liberty to gasp, the privilege— beyond all value—of
      being alone? Without much thought, she has taken, on leaving the hotel, the Borrowdale road,
      walks along it for some distance, confused and woolly-headed, conscious only of the relief of
      having temporarily escaped from suffocation—from the waterfall—from <hi>him</hi> ! But
      by-and-by the loveliness around her
      <pb n="243"/> wakes her again—wakes her to new and keener sufferings. She is aware of the road
      that winds in gentle companionship with the windings of the Derwent; she is aware of the
      marvellous coloured water, tinted a strange fair green by the stones in its bed, and clear as
      the crystal stream in the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Above, the great crags rear their steepy heads; the Castle Crag that, at one point, seems to
      block the valley, guarding hid treasures behind it, and saying austerely, "You shall not pass
      me!" the Gate Crag, that looks down, benignant though awful, on the prattle of the river
      curling round its feet, looks down with its solemn purplegrey rock-shelves and sheer slopes of
      slate.</p>
<p>As she nears a village, she turns off a road to the left, and begins to climb the hill. She
      proposes to herself no goal. She does not know where she is, or whither she is going. She only
      knows that each step takes her farther from the waterfall,
      <pb n="244"/> and from <hi>him</hi> . Climbing, climbing, climbing, through a wood, up a
      mountain path, until at length, panting, she attains the hill-crest, and turning, looks back
      upon all the beauty and majesty of Borrowdale. But even here she only halts to cast one
      breathless glance at the great hills, thrown about as if in Titan play, and looking over each
      other's shoulders, silent, wondrously-coloured, august! She is not far away enough, even yet.
      With knees that tremble and give beneath her—for she has been but little used to such a walk—
      a walk undertaken, too, almost fasting— she descends the hill on the other side; and at its
      foot finds a most lonely tarn, here, in the heart of the fells.</p>
<p>A little ale-house, lonely too, sits near it, backed by three or four storm-wrecked Scotch
      firs; and around, the fells lift their harsh faces, scored by the channels of their winter
      weepings. She asks the stout housewife at the little innfor a drink of milk; but she does not
      inquire where she is, nor
      <pb n="245"/> in which direction Lodore lies. She would far rather not know. She has lost her
      way, and will be late for the <hi>table-d'hôte</hi> ! Well? He will be imagining that she has
      contracted some new and expensive chill! <hi>Well</hi> ? She may go astray upon the mountains,
      and perish like the sheep in winter! <hi>Well</hi> ? The milk has a little revived her
      flagging powers; and she walks on again. Whither? She neither knows nor cares. She only knows
      that she is among friends—among the stern, yet summer-softened hills that lend her the
      sympathy of their silence; among the crisp and frolic mountain airs, and the beds of
      bog-myrtle that smells of bay-leaves; while—friendliest of all—blithe comforter and comrade—a
      mountain beck tinkles, a hand-breadth off, beside her. But there is a limit even to the
      sustaining powers of a cup of milk; and by-and-by she sinks down, faint and spent, by that
      flower-lipped brook, upon the dainty bed of ferns and sundews with which it is set round.</p>
<pb n="246"/>
<p>Why should she ever move hence again? What inducement is there to her ever again to lift up
      her tired limbs and leave the mute society of these bald limestone crags and steeps of shingle
      and flint? Whither could she go to better herself? In what direction on earth's broad face
      does any good for her lie? Why should not she lie down and die here? <hi>Die</hi> ! But is it
      such an easy thing to die? Has not she already tried hard and failed? Oh, if she could but
      gently depart here now! Surely no one could ever wish for a sweeter, fragranter death-bed!</p>
<p>She stretches herself back upon the bog-myrtle and sundews, and closes her eyes, trying to
      fancy that it is over, and that she <hi>is</hi> dead. Oh, if she might but be gently spunged
      out of being! It seems such a small thing to ask, and yet she might as well bid the mountains
      bow down and the sun make obeisance to her. She asks for no other life instead. Has her
      experience of this one been so pleasant
      <pb n="247"/> that she is greedy for more? If there be another world, what security is there
      that it is a better one? May not it resemble this? the same long hopes that go gradually,
      sickeningly out; the same poniardstabs of recollection thrusting one through in the hour of
      the uncoloured dawn; the same tiny, weakling joys!</p>
<p>She has raised herself from her recumbent attitude, and her head is bowed forwards upon her
      knees, which her long arms embrace. Neither by death nor by life is there any escape for her!
      But there is a mode of outlet for her nearer at hand than she wots of. It is noiseless walking
      upon the fine mountain herbage; there the heaviest foot falls mutely—so noiseless that until
      he who has been approaching her stoops and most gently touches her on the shoulder, she is
      unaware that anyone is nigh. She springs up staggeringly, with a loud cry.</p>
<p>" <hi>You</hi> !"</p>
<p>"Yes, <hi>I</hi> !"</p>
<pb n="248"/>
<p>It seems as if she had spent all her breath on that one monosyllable, since, for a while,
      nothing more comes; then, at last, a gasping whisper:</p>
<p>"Did not—Sarah—tell you?"</p>
<p>"Yes; she told me."</p>
<p>Her breath comes hard and laboured. How is it possible to interpose any words between such
      heart-beats? At last:</p>
<p>"You—have—always bragged about your obedience to-me," she says slowly; "you have always
      boasted of doing what I told you—is <hi>this</hi> doing what I told you?"</p>
<p>He offers no exculpation. He only stands doggedly before her, white and burning-eyed, but
      not trembling.</p>
<p>"This—it—is," she says, with that same slow intensity—"this—it—is—to throw yourself upon a
      man's generosity!"</p>
<p>His lips twitch, but his eyes are still dogged.</p>
<p>"I will go at your bidding; I will go at no one else's!"</p>
<pb n="249"/>
<p>She looks distractedly round at her silent friends—the scarped slopes, where the lady-birch
      finds difficult footing, but yet keeps her place, and hangs her delicate tresses: in her sore
      need she consults the beck, but the hills are speechless; and though the beck talks fast, she
      cannot distinguish the meaning of its words.</p>
<p>"I will go if you tell me; and I will stay if you tell me!"</p>
<p>Her look still wanders wildly; and her ear detects the sound of a little oozing runlet, lost
      hitherto in the noise of its elder brother; a runlet filtering through the red moss on the
      hillside.</p>
<p>"Which shall it be? go or stay?"</p>
<p>His voice, that hitherto her lightest word has awed into silence, presses, imperatively
      asking, upon her hearing. (Which shall it be? <hi>Which? which</hi> ?) Oh, if some one would
      but answer for her! If mountain or runlet would but take the responsibility of that one
      all-weighty word off her? <hi>Go</hi> ? Leave her to drag her tired limbs back
      <pb n="250"/> into that bondage which seems already to have endured for centuries? and for a
      limit to whose mean and sordid sufferings eye and heart consult the long future in vain.</p>
<p>" <hi>I am waiting! which shall it be</hi> ?"</p>
<p>Hideous future! Hideous past! Hideous present! She has given it a fair trial. No one can say
      that she has not given it a fair trial.</p>
<p>" <hi>Which</hi> ?"</p>
<p>And she has broken down; mind and body her tyrant has broken her down. He will break her
      down again if she give him the chance. Why should she? It has been his turn hitherto! Let it
      be hers now!</p>
<p>d" <hi>Which</hi> ?" His voice is no longer dogged; heart-rendingly urgent only. "
       <hi>Which</hi> ?" He has taken her hand, and has laid its palm upon his burning eyes. "
       <hi>Which shall it be? go or stay</hi> ?"</p>
<p>Her look, staring yet unseeing, is fixed upon the little zigzag green paths on the
      <pb n="251"/> fell, worn by the small feet of the mountain sheep. Not a bird's voice breaks
      the silence of the hills.</p>
<p>"It—shall—be— <hi>stay</hi> !" she says, almost inaudibly.</p>
<p>Before his eyes the sun dances, and the steady hills go round. Yet, mixed with a joy so
      awful and utter that his whole strong frame reels beneath its weight, there comes too a pain
      keen to agony. He has prevailed. His high goddess has fallen from her pedestal, and it is he
      that has dragged her down! Her divine fair head lies in the dust, and it is he that has laid
      it there!</p>
<p>"Do you know what you are saying?" he cries, in suffocating excitement. "Some-times I think
      that you say things of which you do not understand the meaning! Do you understand what '
       <hi>stay</hi> ' means? It does not mean 'Stay to-day, and go tomorrow;' it means 'Stay
       <hi>always</hi> , ALWAYS, ALWAYS !' it is <hi>all or nothing</hi> for which I am asking. Do
      you understand? Which?"</p>
<pb n="252"/>
<p>She draws a long heavy breath, as one recovering from a deep swoon.</p>
<p>" <hi>All!</hi> " she answers, whispering; and so breaks into an exceeding bitter cry of
      anguish and revolt: " <hi>I will not die without having lived</hi> !"</p>
<p>Then, indeed, the pain goes, swallowed up and stifled in the enormity of his gladness. He
      knows that hereafter it will return, but now he is only, <hi>only</hi> glad! Great God! how
      glad! He has thrown himself down before her, and is kissing her tired feet, and clasping her
      knees. But when he seeks to gather her into his arms, she pushes him convulsively away.</p>
<p>"No! no!" she says wildly; "not now!"</p>
<p>"What!" he cries, with a hideous revulsion of feeling; "you have been fooling me, then! you
      are not in earnest!"</p>
<p>" <hi>Not in earnest</hi> !" she says, with a heart-broken smile; "do you think that I am
       <hi>joking</hi> ? Cannot you understand that I have fallen low enough for <hi>one</hi>
      day?"</p>
<pb n="253"/>
<p>Her voice dies away, and her head sinks on her breast. His high Queen! Already she looks
      discrowned and dissceptred. By-and-by she lifts her haggard face and speaks.</p>
<p>"We must be going home," she says dully.</p>
<p>He complies in silence, and they set out. Before they have gone far, one of those swift
      changes, so common in mountain weather, has sent a sharp storm driving in their faces. She is
      unprovided with umbrella or mackintosh, and the large drops soon saturate her light gown. He
      puts his arm in anxious protection round her. Her first impulse is to shrink away from him;
      but, bethinking herself, she tamely submits.</p>
<p>"Shall I stick at such a trifle— <hi>I</hi> , that stick at nothing?"</p>
<pb/>
