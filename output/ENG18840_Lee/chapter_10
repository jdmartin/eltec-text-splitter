<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>WALTER HAMLIN did not go to America. On leaving the Villa Arnolfini, he met at
      Florence some artist friends, who, in his condition of utter absence of plans, easily drew him
      on with them to Siena and Perugia, thence into the smaller Umbrian cities, and finally into a
      wholly unexplored region between the Abruzzo and the Adriatic. By the time that their
      sketching and article‐writing expedition was at an end, the winter had come round, and more
      than three months had elapsed since Hamlin had parted with the Perrys. Would Hamlin return
      with his friends to England? He had often said that he had had enough of Italy—that he would
      go home and shut himself
      <pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7107-114"/> up in his studio at Hammersmith, among smoke and
      river‐fogs, seeing not a living creature, learning Persian and studying Sufi poets until next
      spring, when he would set off for the East, never more to return to Europe, except for the
      Grosvenor private view. But when the moment for return north approached, Hamlin began to
      hesitate; and the very day before his friends’ departure, he informed them that he had come to
      the conclusion that there was still some work for him to do in Italy.</p>
<p>“I shall be in England at the end of two months at latest,” he said.</p>
<p>And on their remonstrating at his fickleness, he merely answered—</p>
<p>“I have a notion for a new picture, and I think I have found my model for it.”</p>
<p>“‘The Queen of Night’ in your portfolio,” suggested one of his friends.</p>
<p>They had noticed and generally admired that strange head, the like of which none of them had
      ever seen before, and they had given the drawing, which Hamlin described
      <pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7107-115"/> merely as “a girl near Lucca,” the nickname of “The Queen
      of Night.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered Hamlin, “that’s the one I’m thinking about.”</p>
<p>So the rest of the party set sail from Civita Vecchia; and one drizzly, foggy morning,
      Hamlin got into the train to carry him northward to Florence.</p>
<p>During those three months, he could scarcely himself have explained when or how, strange
      notions had come into Hamlin’s head, and a still stranger plan had finally matured in it. He
      had been haunted by the remembrance of the Perrys’ nursemaid at the Villa Arnolfini, and
      gradually taken to brooding and day‐dreaming about her. He had made up his mind that Anne
      Brown was the most beautiful girl, in the strangest style, whom he had ever met. What was to
      be her future? Of two possibilities one must be realised. Either this magnificent blossom was
      to be untimely nipped,—this beautiful and strange girl was to fritter away her life,
      unnoticed, wasted, to
      <pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7107-116"/> little by little lose her beauty, her dignity, her
      grandeur, her whole imaginative aroma; or the rare plant of beauty was to be cherished, nursed
      into perfection, till it burst out in maturity of splendour, a thing of delight for the
      present and of wonder for the future. Either Anne Brown must turn into a sordid
      nursery‐governess, or into the avowedly most beautiful woman in England—that is to say, in the
      particular pre‐Raphaelite society which constituted England to him.</p>
<p>Yet not necessarily; there was still a middle course—she might marry some small shopkeeper
      or teacher of languages at Florence; or, perhaps, some artist might notice her, make her his
      mistress, perhaps his wife. This last thought of Anne Brown as the possible wife of some other
      Melton Perry (for they were all Melton Perrys at Florence) filled Hamlin with a vague disgust
      and irritation. Much better that she should end her life as a nursery‐maid, or a daily
      governess at a franc the hour. Still, it was dreadful to think that something so
      <pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7107-117"/> unique should be lost, wasted for ever. “Such things must
      be,” said Hamlin to himself; “it is sad, but it can’t be helped.” And he wrote two sonnets,
      “Lost Loveliness,” and “Stillborn Joy,” which were extremely beautiful, and quite among the
      finest he ever wrote. But this did not despatch the subject. The sense of having made the most
      of the fact that this loveliness was to be wasted, this joy of beauty to be stillborn, did not
      make up for the consciousness that the waste, the abortion, had not actually taken place,
      might yet be prevented, and were dreadful in themselves. Was he, Hamlin, to marry Anne Brown?
      He shrank in terror from so Quixotic, and at the same time so commonplace, so school‐girlish a
      thought. But if he did not marry her no other man could; at least, no other man who was to
      prevent the act of wastefulness to be consummated. She might marry a clerk, a shopkeeper, even
      a servant, or even some miserable little Anglo‐Florentine artist; but if she married a man
      above that, a man to appreciate and
      <pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7107-118"/> make the most of her, that man must evidently be himself.
      It is difficult to follow the logic of this notion; but certain it is that Hamlin never
      doubted for a second that either Anne Brown must bloom for him and by him, must be his most
      precious possession and his most precious loan to the world—or that Anne Brown must be simply
      and deliberately buried under a bushel. Such arguments are matters of character, I suppose; be
      it as it may, the argument was absolutely cogent.</p>
<p>When Hamlin had got thus far he stopped for a long time, revolving the matter in his mind in
      a purely abstract way, without attempting to realise how things might be settled. He was not a
      man of action or of resolves, and would usually let things slip on and look at them slipping;
      and during this ruminating condition, he did not once seriously ask himself whether he
      intended marrying the Perrys’ nursemaid. But suddenly, the very day before his friends were to
      carry him back to England, a new notion came into his head. His life seemed
      <pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7107-119"/> suddenly filled with romance. The matter was settled in a
      minute. Anne Brown was to be filched triumphantly from oblivion: he telegraphed Perry to hire
      him rooms in Florence. As the meeting of certain chemical substances will sometimes produce a
      new and undreamt‐of something of wholly unprecedented properties, so ideas had come in
      collision in Hamlin’s mind, and out of a mere perplexity had arisen a stranger scheme—out of
      the question what should be the fate of Anne Brown, had originated the decision what was to be
      the future of Walter Hamlin. The situations seemed changed: instead of his being a mere
      possible, but by no means probable, instrument of a change in her life, she was the
      predestined instrument for the consummation of his life. Anne Brown should live for the world
      and for fame; and Walter Hamlin’s life should be crowned by gradually endowing with vitality,
      and then wooing, awakening the love of this beautiful Galatea whose soul he had moulded, even
      as Pygmalion had moulded the limbs of
      <pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7107-120"/> the image which he had made to live and to love. The idea,
      once present to Hamlin’s mind, had been accepted at once; and in another hour he had worked
      out all the details of the real romance in which he was embarking; he had determined exactly
      where he would send Anne Brown to school, where he would go during her stay there, what
      settlements he would make to ensure her complete freedom of choice when she should choose him,
      in what part of London he would buy a house for her, which of his female relations should have
      charge of her, by whom she should be introduced into artistic society;—he began to imagine all
      the details of his long courtship. Beyond the courtship, into their actual married life, his
      fancy did not carry him; it was that year, or two or three years of gradually growing
      devotion, upon which he cared to dwell. Whether such a scheme was wise or right it never
      occurred to him to question. He had determined on educating, wooing, and marrying a woman like
      what Anne Brown seemed to be,
      <pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7107-121"/> as a man might determine to buy a house in a particular
      fishing or hunting district—the only thing is to make sure whether the particular house is the
      suitable house. The only further concern of Hamlin was to make sure that Anne Brown was really
      all that she seemed to him to be; and Hamlin looked forward as to a kind of preliminary
      romance to the strange inspection, this minute examination of a creature who should never
      guess the extraordinary metamorphosis which might, or might not, be in store for her.</p>
