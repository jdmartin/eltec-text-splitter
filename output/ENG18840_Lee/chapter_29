<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>WHEN Mrs Macgregor had gone up‐stairs to rest before dinner on their arrival at
      Wotton Hall, Hamlin took Miss Brown round the huge, deserted‐looking house, which his
      grandfather had built on returning from Jamaica. It was like an Italian villa, with vaulted
      rooms, gilded and stuccoed, marble floors, and terraced windows; the furniture was all of the
      Napoleonic period; nothing could be more dignified or sadder.</p>
<p>When Hamlin had shown her the large drawing‐rooms, the library, the room which had been the
      play‐room when he was a child, he took Anne into the large Palladian hall, and showed her the
      innumerable portraits of ladies and gentlemen in armour, and ruffs,
      <pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7108-047"/> and bobwigs, and powder, hanging all round—his ancestors
      ever since his family had left England in the civil wars.</p>
<p>Anne looked at them shyly. They were mostly indifferently painted and vapid—affected, like
      all old portraits by mediocre painters; but it seemed to her that in most of these gentlemen,
      with peaked beards on their Vandyck lace, or horse‐hair wigs, or carefully powdered hair tied
      back in silk bags, she could recognise a resemblance to the man by her side—the same delicate,
      handsome features, the same fair, almost beardless complexion, the same gentle, melancholy,
      slightly ironical expression: and never did the real meaning of Hamlin’s marriage with her
      come clearer before her mind than when, in that silent hall, surrounded by all those portraits
      of his ancestors, she suddenly saw herself and him reflected in one of the long dim mirrors;
      she, so tall and strong, so powerful of bone and muscle, with her strange, half‐southern,
      half‐Jewish, and
      <pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7108-048"/> almost half‐Ethiopian beauty, by the side of that slight,
      fair, pale, aristocratic man, with features sharp like those of a high‐bred race‐horse,
      nervous and wistful and dreamy, as if he were tired of his family having lasted so long.</p>
<p>“They all married and intermarried for nearly a century,” said Hamlin, “that’s why they’re
      all so like each other. I often wonder why it didn’t end in insanity—you see it has ended in a
      poet at last. My mother was the first woman married by a Hamlin for eighty years who was not
      at least a second cousin,—in those islands there were very few decent people, you see. Don’t
      they all look dapper and respectable? It appears they were not. That man in the corselet was
      killed in a duel about another man’s wife. That one in the middle, the boy in the grey dress
      with the powdered hair, Sir Thomas Hamlin, they used to call the bad Sir Thomas, because he
      amused himself practising pistol‐shooting on black people, whom he had put all round his yard;
      <pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7108-049"/> he was a very fine gentleman, they say, and would go out
      only in the evening on account of his complexion. The one who looks like a woman, with the
      open shirt‐collar and the long hair, was my great‐uncle, Mordaunt Hamlin, who supposed himself
      to be a poet, somewhere in the first years of this century; he was an opium‐eater, and did
      some horribly disgraceful things, I don’t exactly know what, and was poisoned, they say, by
      some low woman, because she was tired of him. My father had his portrait removed; but I used
      to see it in the lumber‐room when I was a child, and thought him very handsome and eery; and
      when I came of age, I had it brought down, because I think he’s far better‐looking and more
      interesting than any of the respectable ones. Then he was a poet also, you see, and Cosmo
      Chough pretends I’m like him. Do you think so, Miss Brown?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Anne, laughing, as she looked at Hamlin, at that noble and delicate face, which
      seemed to her the noblest and most beautiful
      <pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7108-050"/> in the world; and yet, when she looked at Mordaunt Hamlin
      again, with his morbid woman’s face and his effeminate bare throat, she could not help feeling
      a certain disgust at the thought that perhaps—perhaps— Hamlin <emph>was</emph> just a little
      like him.</p>
<p>“That’s my mother,” said Hamlin, pointing to a faded crayon of a beautiful, gentle,
      pathetic‐looking woman.</p>
<p>“<emph>That</emph> is like you,” cried Anne, delighted. “That is very like you—like your
      expression. I was wondering where you got your expression from among all your Jamaica
      ancestors.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you think so. She was a very beautiful woman, and very brave and noble, and not
      very happy, poor mamma.”</p>
<p>“Did you know her?”</p>
<p>“Only till I was about twelve; she died young. That is grandpapa; and that is my uncle
      Arnold,—he died young too—in fact, drank himself to death. Don’t you think he is like Mordaunt
      Hamlin? That’s papa;<corr>”</corr>
<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7108-051"/> and Hamlin stopped before the full‐length of a handsome
      effeminate man.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t think that he was a very violent man, would you?” he said.</p>
<p>“No,” answered Anne, looking at that weak, worn, rather blear face, and thinking how her
      father, too, had been a drunkard; but how different had been the drunkenness of the poor
      overworked mechanic, so industrious and gentle and high‐spirited when he was sober, from the
      sort of emasculating vice of Mordaunt and Arnold Hamlin, of Walter Hamlin’s bad‐faced
      father!</p>
<p>“It’s very curious,” pursued Hamlin, with a sort of psychological interest in his own
      family, “how that Mordaunt, who, after all, was no ancestor of mine, tries everywhere to
      perpetuate himself. There’s unfortunately no portrait of my great‐grandfather, or perhaps we
      might understand it; but perhaps it came from the mother. It’s curious I have never felt any
      inclination to drink—I mean, however moderately; but I can’t take
      <pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7108-052"/> any wine at all—it makes me drunk at once.”</p>
<p>“I never have seen you take any wine, by the way,” said Anne.</p>
<p>“I tried opium once; but Chough made me give it up. It’s sad to be denied any sort of unreal
      pleasures, don’t you think? That’s my brother and I when we were boys.”</p>
<p>Anne stopped to look at the picture.</p>
<p>It was very well painted, though a trifle old‐fashioned. The two boys were represented in
      shooting‐jackets, with guns and dogs. The shorter, slighter, and paler boy was evidently
      Walter Hamlin; the other was more robust, boyish, and ordinary‐looking.</p>
<p>“Your brother died when he was a child, did he not?”</p>
<p>“Oh no,” answered Hamlin, quickly. “Poor Arnold—was very fond of shooting—I hated it; but
      papa had the picture painted on his account; he was the favourite at first, being
      younger.”</p>
<p>It seemed to Anne that Hamlin was going
      <pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7108-053"/> to say something different from what he had said. What had
      become of Arnold Hamlin? Mrs Macgregor’s allusions to him, who had evidently been her
      favourite nephew, always seemed to point to a melancholy end.</p>
<p>“It’s curious,” said Hamlin, after a moment. “Arnold looked so jolly and strong when he was
      a child; and yet, later, he got such a look of our grand‐uncle Mordaunt.”</p>
<p>“I think you have your grand‐uncle on the brain,” said Anne, trying to break through
      Hamlin’s strange mood.</p>
<p>They left the hall, and went to the window of the large drawing‐room, and looked out on the
      reddening beeches and the grass, permitted to grow high and thick, in the yellow sunlight.</p>
<p>“I shall sell this place most likely soon,” said Hamlin; “I’ve already had some offers for
      it. It’s too large, and pompous, and characterless for me. I should like a real old
      country‐house, two or three centuries old, with flower‐gardens and panelled rooms,—not this
      plaster and stucco and romantic gardening.
      <pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7108-054"/> Besides, I hate this place—have hated it ever since I was a
      child.”</p>
<p>Anne did not answer.</p>
<p>“I hate this place,” went on Hamlin, leaning on the window‐sill by Anne’s side, “and that is
      the reason why I have brought you here. Before saying farewell to it for good and all, I wish
      to save it from being a mere hateful recollection in my life. I wish to be able to think of it
      in connection with you;” and he looked up at Anne, who was leaning against the tall French
      window.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” went on Hamlin, again looking out at the vaporous yellow sunset horizon— “I
      don’t know what are destined to be the relations between our lives. You have seen too little
      of the world as yet to be able to know yourself and me; and I am more and more decided to
      abide by my original plan of giving ourselves time to understand each other, and to understand
      whether we are made for one another. . . .”</p>
<p>He looked at Anne; she had turned an ashy‐white as she listened; she had thought
      <pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7108-055"/> that Hamlin loved her, and now . . . He noticed it, and
      understood, but pretended not to understand; he enjoyed playing upon a living soul, all the
      more upon a soul like this one, slow to respond to his touch, with low and long‐sustained
      vibrations, like those of some deep‐toned instrument.</p>
<p>“Don’t take what I say in bad part,” he went on, conscious to himself that he was speaking
      the truth, and at the same time that he was acting, telling it at a moment and in a manner
      which made it untruthful; “and don’t think that I mean anything horrid against you or against
      myself, when I say that you don’t yet know me, and will not know me, perhaps, for some time.
      You see me through your own nature, your own enthusiasms, your own aspirations; you think I am
      strong where I am weak, and pure where I am impure.”</p>
<p>Anne shook her head.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>Hamlin smiled sadly.</p>
<p>“But I do. It’s very sad to think that one
      <pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7108-056"/> must lose so much that is worth most in life, all one’s
      illusions, before one can approach the reality of even one’s best friends,—that even one’s
      best friends can be seen as they really are only when we have got disillusioned and
      disappointed, is it not?”</p>
<p>Hamlin had often said things like these in the letters which he used to write to her, and
      had hinted, much more clearly, at weaknesses and basenesses which she would some day recognise
      in him.</p>
<p>It could not occur to Anne, whose character was so completely of a piece, that there was any
      untruthfulness in this mode of speaking, any more than she could believe that Hamlin could be
      correct in thus speaking of himself. The sort of shimmer, as of the two tints in a shot stuff,
      of reality and unreality, of genuine and affected feeling, of moods which came spontaneously
      and of other moods, noticed, treasured up, reproduced in himself,—which existed in Hamlin,
      would be perfectly unintelligible to Anne.</p>
<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7108-057"/>
<p>“I daresay,” she answered gravely, “that you have faults, in which, at present, I cannot
      believe; but those faults are not the ones which you imagine. When a man knows himself to have
      a fault, he ceases to have it—he cures it.”</p>
<p>A sensation of a new experience passed through Hamlin’s mind as Anne said this: it seemed so
      strange, pathetic, grand, to him—who knew himself to be for ever mixing up the unrealities of
      his art with the realities of his life, to be continually experimenting upon himself the moods
      of his poetry—that any one should seriously think thus, should not know that when a man
      recognises in himself a fault, he may, so far from eradicating, cherish it stealthily.</p>
<p>“You have asked me not to be angry with you for telling me that I am inexperienced and
      cannot yet know my own mind,” said Anne; “don’t be angry and don’t laugh at me if I tell you
      that I think you don’t always know yours. I have often observed how imaginative
      <pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7108-058"/> you are about yourself, how apt to fancy morbid things; I
      suppose it is because poets are always turned inwards, and because you have not perhaps been
      very happy sometimes, and because”—and she looked at him half laughing, half with the tears in
      her eyes—“you are very good. I daresay I don’t know you thoroughly yet, but I know you—I know
      I know you—better sometimes than you do; because you fancy all sorts of horrid mysterious
      flaws in your character wherever there is a little inequality; and I know how good and noble
      you are, and how you are always thinking that you must be wicked.”</p>
<p>Hamlin did not answer. He was deeply touched, touched all the more because he knew how
      little she guessed at the self‐conscious unreality of so much of him.</p>
<p>“You are very comforting,” he said sadly, then went on more cheerfully: “well, what I wanted
      to say, when we began to discuss which of us knew the other better, is this,—that whatever we
      may be destined to be to
      <pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7108-059"/> one another in future—and this I dare not decide even in
      surmise—you will always have been to me, in these years that I have known you, in the past and
      present, an infinite source of happiness and good; a something which to have possessed, as I
      possess your friendship, will always remain, even should all the reality come to an end and
      only the recollection remain, the most precious thing in my life.” He had taken her hand, and
      playing with her strong shapely fingers, so much stronger and less delicate, though not less
      shapely than his own, looked with a kind of solemnity into her face. Anne could not answer,
      for if she did, she knew she must cry; she felt the tears, as it were, all through her nature;
      she seemed to see, she knew not why, but as a solemn certainty, that things could never go any
      further, that Hamlin was prophesying the inevitable future: and yet, in the midst of this
      quite inexplicable, unreasonable sense of loss and resignation, there was a deep happiness
      which she had never
      <pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7108-060"/> before felt, the happiness of the present; a something new
      to Anne, though all other lovers have felt the happiness of possession of one another, even at
      the moment of loss.</p>
<p>“It is getting chilly,” said Hamlin, and shut the window. “You look very pale, Miss Brown;
      had you not better put on some warmer dress this evening?”</p>
<p>His voice seemed like the curtain dropping after a scene, or the chord at the end of a duet.
      It was a return to reality and prose.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I had better, and I ought to go and see after your aunt; good‐bye for the
      present.”</p>
<p>Hamlin strolled out into the terrace, and lit a cigarette; the past and present, his real
      and unreal self, Anne, his brother and father, his great‐uncle Mordaunt—all went cloudily
      through his brain. He was very happy. Love to him was not what it was to other men, not what
      he had tried it himself in former years. It was romance, but romance not of ladders and
      hairbreadth escapes, but
      <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7108-061"/> of psychical conditions, of spiritual sensations. He had
      written fleshly poetry and passionate poetry, but no one could be less fleshly or less
      passionate than Hamlin: the ‘Vita Nuova’—if it could be made modern, and the parts altered and
      reversed—unreal reality of love, had been his ideal, and he had got it.</p>
<p>They had many conversations like this one. Hamlin never so much as kissed Anne’s hand, never
      told her that he loved her, spoke merely of himself, of her, of the future and the past, of
      what she would one day know, of what he would one day feel; and Anne listened seriously,
      trying to cure him of his despondency and morbidness, trying to persuade him of his own worth
      and of her clear‐sightedness, while never a suspicion crossed her simple stern mind that all
      this earnest talk, which was so tragic and still so delightful, was the thing which she
      scornfully connected with whispers and kisses and nonsense,—in one word, love‐making.</p>
