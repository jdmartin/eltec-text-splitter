<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>IN this condition of mind Anne was violently impelled towards the two Leigh girls;
      and strongly induced to take an aversion to Edmund Lewis. For the Leighs represented every day
      more and more the influence which was strengthening her, the influence which might revive
      Hamlin; and Edmund Lewis seemed sent as an incarnation of those tendencies which, in her
      belief, had marred the nobility of Hamlin’s nature.</p>
<p>Anne’s unmistakable desire to know what was going on in the striving and suffering world
      outside the strongholds of æstheticism, to help in it to her utmost; to be, what the people
      believing only in beauty and passion could not conceive, responsible,—all this intense
      <pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7108-136"/> striving got the better of Marjory Leigh’s prejudices. She
      began to understand that she had found in Anne a zealous lieutenant; nay, after some time, the
      conscientious though somewhat pig‐headed and conceited young philanthropist admitted to
      herself that Anne was a force for work and good which dragged even her along, making her, by
      the influence of her complete unselfishness, self‐unconsciousness, and energy, more ready to
      examine into her own mode of doing things, to sift her vanity from her humanitarianism.</p>
<p>“Anne does make one less conceited,” Marjory one day remarked to her sister, waking up from
      a long reverie—“less conceited and less narrow, I do believe. It’s such a revelation; and
      somehow it makes one feel just a little bit ashamed, to find such honesty and determination in
      an æsthete. After that, people don’t seem to be so hopelessly lost—do they? I fear I must have
      been a rather bigoted sort of brute formerly,” and Marjory pushed her fingers through her
      short, lank
      <pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7108-137"/> yellow hair, and looked up at her sister with her childish,
      resolute, defiant face, not yet puzzled by the sad experience of the difficulty of doing good,
      and of the dangerousness of even the wisest theories. Mary Leigh smiled. She was proud of her
      little sister; and she was, in a sort of a way, in love with Anne Brown. Marjory thought her
      rather æsthetic and spiritless, she knew; and Anne was absorbed in her own thoughts; but Mary
      Leigh was one of those girls who can resign themselves cheerfully to being second best, as
      long as they are the best in their power—to be happy in her devotion, even if it be
      unreciprocated; and she was happy, in a subdued way—proud of Marjory and adoring Anne, and
      seeing that the two somewhat unresponsive objects of her love could now appreciate one
      another.</p>
<p>So much for the Leighs. But if their presence at Wotton was a support and a consolation to
      Anne, the presence of Edmund Lewis very soon grew to be a positive source of disgust
      <pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7108-138"/>. At first, in his egotistic, silently brow‐beating way, he
      was an interesting visitor. He had travelled and read a good deal, and, in point of fact, knew
      much more about literature than about his own art. His imagination turned easily to the
      terrible; he considered Webster as greater than Shakespeare, and Ford as greater than Webster;
      he had personal experiences of more or less criminal persons, whose acquaintance, for the sake
      of morbid psychology, he had sought, and whose characteristics he had lovingly studied; while
      in reality mild and even milk‐soppish in his habits, he seemed to experience a fascination
      from violence and bloodshed. For a week or so he was decidedly interesting, if not, to Anne
      and her two girl‐friends, attractive. But hostility soon arose. He was a fervid spiritualist,
      and a great adept in mesmerising; his vanity made him see mediums, victims of his will‐power,
      everywhere. He immediately discovered one in Anne, and begged to be permitted to try his
      tricks, as Marjory Leigh called them.</p>
<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7108-139"/>
<p>Now, if there was one thing which was more abhorrent to Anne than any other, it was
      spiritualism: averse to mysticism like every Italian; prosaic and common‐sense, perhaps just
      in proportion to the idealism of passion and aspiration, she was impatient of the vulgar
      mysteriousness of modern magic; while at the same time her powerful personality, her austere
      will (which she always recognised as the most precious part of her nature), which took umbrage
      at Mrs Macgregor’s theories of obedience to mere physical passions, was positively insulted by
      the notion of surrender to the perfectly unintellectual will of another. However, she let
      Lewis try. During his performance, as he fixed his green eyes upon her, and made passes with
      his flabby white fingers, Anne felt a loathing as if a slug were trailing over her, but she
      sat unaffected by Mr Lewis’s will‐power, and at last wearied out his patience.</p>
<p>“You resisted!—I felt you resist!” cried Lewis angrily, at the end of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign>.</p>
<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7108-140"/>
<p>“There was nothing to resist against,” answered Anne, bluntly; “but had there been, of
      course I should have resisted.”</p>
<p>“Hamlin does not resist,” replied Lewis, with a certain malignant pride. “I can do just
      whatever I choose with Hamlin.”</p>
<p>“I enjoy it,” explained Hamlin; “it’s like the first effects of opium or haschisch. One
      feels one’s self giving way, one’s soul sinking deliciously.”</p>
<p>“Going to sleep, in fact,” corrected Anne.</p>
<p>From that moment Anne felt that Lewis hated her. Yet he was, in a way, fascinated by her
      exotic beauty; he could not make up his mind that so strange and splendid a woman could resist
      him. He never tried to magnetise her again; and he made many drawings of her, curiously
      distorting her expression, sullen, but frank and resolute, into a kind of sombre, morbid
      wistfulness.</p>
<p>“I hate those sketches he does of you,” cried Marjory one day; “nasty things, which make you
      look—I don’t know to express it—
      <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7108-141"/> as if you were neither a man nor a woman, and were in love
      with <emph>him</emph>.”</p>
<p>Mary Leigh laughed. “The school is running to seed,” she said: “the great men have done all
      that could be done in the way of beautiful suggestiveness—the little ones can only do
      suggestiveness of all sorts of vague nastiness which they don’t even understand. But there’s a
      change coming on in painting; people are beginning to be satisfied with interpreting real
      nature; and—don’t you think—Anne—a similar change . . .”</p>
<p>Mary Leigh, who was the most absent‐minded of Irish enthusiasts, suddenly stopped short. She
      had only just remembered that Hamlin was a poet and a painter of the school which she had just
      described. And a pained, darkened look had come over Anne. Mary Leigh could not understand
      that that look meant that Anne had often thought just the same thing, and that now there
      returned to her, with sickening bitterness, the double
      <pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7108-142"/> recollection of the “Ballad of the Fens,” and of those
      twelve sonnets called “Desire.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Anne gradually got substantial reasons for her instinctive aversion to Edmund
      Lewis. The family of the vicar of Wotton sometimes visited at the Hall. There were two very
      young girls, scarcely more than children, for whom Anne and the Leighs had taken a fancy. One
      afternoon they came to tea, delicate pink‐and‐white creatures of fourteen or fifteen,
      impressionable, nervous, utterly ignorant of the world. Hamlin seemed to appreciate the charm
      of obvious purity and guilelessness which went with their ignorance of the world.</p>
<p>“I should like to make a picture of those two creatures,” he whispered to Anne, as they sat
      at tea in the library, “or to write a poem about them—they seem to do one good; for it is
      good, is it not, to see so much life which is so perfectly fresh, and unsullied, and
      untormented—such a desire to know the world before
      <pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7108-143"/> the evil in it is even guessed at—don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Even Chough could not make a single unintelligible allusion to the wife of Claudius or the
      daughter of Alexander VI., but sat with one of his children on his knee, looking at the young
      girls and gently humming a scrap of old minuet, fresh and simple like themselves. Anne could
      not help thinking that she had never been what these girls were. She had been shown the ugly
      things of life, taught to struggle with them since her childhood, and now believing equally in
      good, but believing sadly and bitterly. It was better to be a woman as she was, a woman who
      knew of good and evil, and was prepared to fight her way out of darkness; but still it was sad
      never, never to have been as these girls. Edmund Lewis was leaning forward on the table, his
      reddish‐auburn head with its glittering eyes rising like that of a snake, as if silently
      trying to mesmerise the visitors.</p>
<p>“Suppose we show these young ladies some of our works of art?” he proposed, in a half‐
      <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7108-144"/> jocular way which he occasionally had. The girls had never
      seen any pictures scarcely, and having heard of Hamlin and Lewis as famous painters from
      London, were delighted. The whole party went up to Hamlin’s studio. He showed the girls not
      the things for which he cared most, but what he thought would give them most
      pleasure—magnificent tinted sketches of poetical legends, of the Sleeping Beauty, Cupid and
      Psyche, and so forth. Anne thought she had scarcely ever seen Hamlin so nice before as when he
      got the sketches out of the portfolio, and told the girls what they represented. When he had
      done, Edmund Lewis, with his slow, shuffling movements, placed his large sketch‐book on an
      easel, and turned a page. It was covered with outline drawings of men and women, stark naked,
      in various listless attitudes.</p>
<p>Anne had seen these drawings time after time, and had thought them, accustomed as she was to
      studios and painters, merely clever nude studies, with the usual expression of
      <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7108-145"/> bored depravity of all Lewis’s work. She had criticised the
      drawing and anatomy, and had never before thought that any impropriety was connected with
      them. But now she could not help blushing and feeling vaguely indignant.</p>
<p>“That’s not the sort of thing to show those children,” whispered Mary Leigh, who, heaven
      knows, had seen nude studies enough in her life. Both she and Anne had caught the surprised,
      vacant expression of the two girls, had seen the flush in their face, and understood the
      silence, never asking what it all meant, as they stared at all this emaciated, flabby
      nakedness. And Anne caught also Edmund Lewis’s expression, as he held the corner of the page,
      ready to turn over, with one hand, stroking his reddish‐brown beard with the other, and
      looking, with slightly raised eyebrows and curious green eyes, towards Hamlin, as if to call
      his attention. Lewis turned another page, and another; always the same stark‐naked people.
      Anne was very black. Heaven knows from what instinct, perhaps from a paternal recollection
      <pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7108-146"/> of his own little girls, Cosmo Chough understood Anne’s
      look; and edging himself awkwardly into the corner, he banged against the easel, and made it
      and the sketch‐hook come down with a crash.</p>
<p>“Confound your awkwardness!” cried Lewis, stooping to pick up his drawings, and slowly
      replacing the sketch‐book.</p>
<p>“I don’t think they care to see any more,” said Anne; “you see, these young ladies haven’t
      studied anatomy. Supposing you show them your Eastern sketches, Mr Lewis.”</p>
<p>Lewis gave Anne a rapid, angry glance. “The Eastern sketches are up‐stairs,” he said
      snappishly; adding, in his drawling, mock courteous way, “I think these young ladies have seen
      the best I could show them.”</p>
<p>“Then we had better go down‐stairs, and Mr Chough will play an accompaniment, for I know
      they sing very nicely,” said Anne, taking no notice of him.</p>
<p>Perhaps, thought Anne, she might have been prejudiced against Edmund Lewis. He
      <pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7108-147"/> did draw morbid‐looking nudities; but so many other men did
      just the same, that it was quite possible he might have displayed that sketch‐book from mere
      thoughtlessness. Yet she could not believe it; she had seen Lewis’s look as he turned over the
      pages, and that look had disgusted her.</p>
<p>The next day but one the question was settled in her mind. It was a fine autumn morning, and
      Anne was seated on the terrace, waiting for the others to come down to breakfast. The air,
      just touched by the first cold, was exquisitely pure; and the sear bracken of the hillside
      opposite sparkled golden with the heavy dew. All round the swallows were whirring about,
      collecting for departure. The thought of the Villa Arnolfini—of the place in the vineyard,
      among the yellowing vines, where she used to sit on the dry warm mint and fennel with the
      little Perrys, where, under the big mulberry‐tree, they had buried her Dante in a heap of
      yellow leaves—came home to Anne. How good Hamlin had been to
      <pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7108-148"/> her! the idea almost pained her. But this lovely morning
      seemed to have swept all evil away. If only, Anne said to herself, Hamlin’s sympathies could
      be violently roused—if only he could be awakened suddenly, by some unexpected contact with the
      tragic realities of the world, by a sudden appeal to his generosity and indignation, out of
      this æsthetic day‐dream with its enervating visions of impure beauty and forbidden things. If
      only this could be done, the horrid spell which kept him at a moral distance from her would be
      broken through. . . . And soon it must come, this awakening.</p>
<p>As she was thinking in this way, Edmund Lewis strolled up, his hands behind his back, to the
      table at which she was seated. He gave her a little unceremonious nod, and then, interrupting
      the tune which he was faintly whistling, pushed a paper‐bound book across the table to
      her.</p>
<p>“Have you ever read this, Miss Brown?” he asked; “do you know that passage? I
      <pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7108-149"/> think it one of the loveliest things which have ever been
      written.”</p>
<p>Anne’s eye glanced at the page, pencil‐marked all round, and then at the title on the
      margin. It was Gautier’s ‘Mademoiselle de Maupin.’ She understood.</p>
<p>“I have never read it,” she answered, “but I have often heard that it is a book which a man
      does not offer a woman except as an insult,” and she quietly handed the volume back, looking
      up, her beautiful severe face flushed, her slate‐grey eyes flashing, at Lewis.</p>
<p>The painter started.</p>
<p>“Upon my word,” he answered quickly, with his usual self‐possession, “I never thought that.
      I never thought that any book could possibly offend a pure woman nowadays. I regard this book
      merely as a noble hymn to beauty; others may regard it otherwise. I really had no thought of
      offending you, my dear Miss Brown”—there was a tone of patronising insolence in his voice.</p>
<p>“So much the better,” answered Anne, rising.</p>
<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7108-150"/>
<p>Oh how, how could Hamlin, with his chivalrous nature, endure the daily contact of such a man
      as this!</p>
<p>“Lewis ought not to have selected those particular drawings to show the vicar’s girls,” said
      Anne, later on. She could not allude to that scene of the book; but she felt she must say
      something. “A man ought not to show such things as those to mere children, brought up in the
      country, who don’t know what they mean, and are merely shocked by such things—don’t you think
      so, Mary?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” answered Mary Leigh boldly, quite astonished at Anne’s venturing to mention
      such a subject.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t good taste, certainly,” answered Hamlin. “Lewis is fearfully absent‐minded. They
      are lovely designs. But still, it wasn’t good taste, I quite agree.”</p>
<p>“Good taste!” thought Anne, with a shudder. “Is there nothing higher than taste in the
      world?”</p>
