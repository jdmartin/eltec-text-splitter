<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>THE incident of the burning bed left the inmates of Wotton Hall in a state of
      excitement which outlasted their stay in the country. All attempts to find the culprits had
      been useless; and Madame Elaguine had begged Hamlin not to permit any regular judicial
      inquiry, lest the story of her persecution, about which she affected to be excessively
      jealous, should become public property. Hamlin, who hated vulgar publicity, easily consented.
      But the mysterious story was now known to all the guests at Wotton, and soon became known to
      the whole pre‐Raphaelite set which centred round the house at Hammersmith, with the result of
      turning Madame Elaguine, in the eyes of Mrs Spencer and her friends, from
      <pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7109-151"/> something not much better than an adventuress, into
      something uncommonly like a heroine and a martyr; for it seemed as if these good folk, whose
      life was the most humdrum prose and whose ideal was the most far‐fetched poetry, felt absolute
      gratitude towards the remarkable individual who supplied them with a real mystery, a real
      persecution by unknown enemies, a real romance. So when Sacha, on her return to town, began to
      suffer or to think that she suffered from nervous prostration due to this terrible shock, and
      to lie even more than usual on sofas in even more than usually picturesque dressing‐gowns, she
      found herself surrounded by a crowd of sympathising and admiring artists, writers, and
      critics, to whom she confided, one by one, and in slightly different versions, the details of
      her strange history.</p>
<p>The only person who seemed displeased was Hamlin; and the only person who seemed cold was
      Miss Brown. Hamlin always required to absorb the whole attention of any person to whom he took
      a liking; to see his cousin fenced
      <pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7109-152"/> round with idiots, as he described it, was almost a
      physical annoyance to him; he was cross, captious, bitter, and gruff; and the more he showed
      his temper the more pleasure Madame Elaguine took in provoking him. As usual, when out of
      sorts with the world, and especially when he felt himself neglected, Hamlin began once more to
      pay attentions to Miss Brown, to bemoan his own baseness and weakness, to throw himself on her
      compassion, to insinuate that in her lay his only hope.</p>
<p>This sort of talk, with his beautiful dreamy eyes fixed adoringly upon her, his slow quiet
      voice sounding like that of a votary before an altar, had long become for Anne a mere
      additional bitterness; a bitterness of comprehension proportionate to the long delusion which
      had made her see in this sort of behaviour the dissatisfaction of a noble nature, the
      yearnings of real love. She was accustomed to it; and would have merely smiled the bitter
      smile which had become part of her nature. But now, every lover‐like look or word from Hamlin
      <pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7109-153"/> inspired Anne with positive terror; it seemed as if he had
      let her fancy that he loved his cousin—that he had let her dream of release, of freedom from
      the life captivity which threatened her soul, only to creep back, as a cat creeps back to the
      mouse with which it is playing, and slowly stretch forth his hand to seize her. This feeling
      became so strong in Anne that little by little there developed in her a nervous dread of
      Hamlin: every time that he approached her alone, that he fixed his eyes on her face or
      addressed her by her name, she was aware of a chill throughout her body, of a sudden pallor in
      her face; a chill, a pallor which, if noticed, must mean to Hamlin that she loved him.</p>
<p>Into this vague and painful suspense were vaguely mingled the suspicions which she had
      formed regarding Madame Elaguine. Confusedly Anne was conscious that the worthiness or
      unworthiness of Sacha was not a matter of indifference to her; if Sacha was a mere hysterical
      liar, she could not sincerely love
      <pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7109-154"/> Hamlin, Hamlin could not love her; and if this man and this
      woman did not love one another, Anne Brown was once more, what she had for a brief time
      imagined that she was no longer, the slave of her protector, as Mademoiselle Aïssé had been
      the slave of M. de Ferréol.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one day, there came a change, and with it the end of the terrible doubt and fear
      which were corroding Miss Brown’s soul. What had happened Anne never clearly understood; she
      only perceived a change, and guessed that it was connected in some manner with the sudden
      disappearance of Edmund Lewis, and with some tremendous quarrel between him and Hamlin which
      seemed to have preceded it. Mr Lewis, who had spent all his mornings in Hamlin’s studio, and
      all his evenings in Madame Elaguine’s boudoir, appeared to have sunk into the ground; his very
      name was scarcely mentioned; and Anne Brown, who hated the very sight of the little man with
      the sealing‐wax lips and green cat‐like eyes, who instinctively felt that he personified
      <pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7109-155"/> all the peculiarities which degraded Hamlin in her eyes,
      had a vague superstitious notion that now that he was gone everything would settle
      happily.</p>
<p>What had Lewis done? Had he insulted Madame Elaguine; and had this insulting, by a man who
      was his friend, of a woman whom he loved, made Hamlin suddenly conscious of his love for
      Sacha, and of his duty to protect an irresponsible little woman whom his indecision was
      putting into a false position? The more Miss Brown pored over the subject, the more did it
      seem as if there could be no other explanation.</p>
<p>But whatever the explanation, the result was unmistakable. On the score of ill‐health,
      Madame Elaguine had more or less dismissed all those admiring and sympathising friends who had
      given Hamlin so much umbrage, and Hamlin had become almost her sole and constant visitor. He
      appeared to have almost taken up his abode at the Russian’s. He came to Hammersmith for lunch
      as usual, but always
      <pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7109-156"/> found some excuse or other for leaving immediately after:
      he was painting a portrait of his cousin, and his cousin was too delicate to give him sittings
      except in her drawing‐room. He not merely neglected Anne, but obviously avoided her. He seemed
      to dread being left alone with her, as much as she, for such very different reasons, had
      dreaded to be left alone with him: when he did not succeed in getting away, he was moody and
      depressed; yet he seemed moody and depressed also whenever, as was frequently the case, he was
      sent for by his cousin, and whenever Anne met them together.</p>
<p>It seemed to Miss Brown as if she could understand it all so well: she, who was slow in
      understanding others, felt as if she knew Hamlin’s character as her own father must have known
      the construction and working of the machines which she remembered seeing him continually
      taking to pieces and setting up again. Hamlin had been, so Anne thought, obliged to admit to
      himself that he loved his
      <pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7109-157"/> cousin, and that he had made her love him; and he was
      depressed and irritated at his own inability to take any decided course, at his humiliation in
      finding that this was the end of all his romance with Anne, at his dread of being obliged,
      sooner or later, to tell Anne the truth; nay, Miss Brown thought she knew Hamlin sufficiently
      well to be persuaded that there entered into his feelings a certain annoyance at having to
      forfeit the exotic and unhealthy pleasure of being partially in love with two women at a time,
      and at the impetuosity of Sacha precipitating matters from a position of hesitation and
      self‐reproach, which was in some ways pleasant to his peculiar temper, into a situation
      requiring a definite and prompt solution.</p>
<p>Oh, Anne had not suffered silently these two years, without getting to understand the
      strange character to which her suffering was due. Yes, she knew Hamlin and what was passing in
      his mind; and the sense of power implied in this knowledge, the power of following all
      <pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7109-158"/> that he felt and thought, gave her a sort of pleasure,
      proportionate to that very sense of her difficulty in understanding any character save her
      own; a curious rare pleasure, in which mingled the consciousness of the price at which it had
      been bought, and the almost ineffable consciousness that this that she was studying concerned
      her no more; the pleasure, so often talked about, of the man who has escaped the shipwreck and
      looks down upon the dangerous waters in safety. Yes; she was safe; she was free.</p>
<p>It gave her a morbid pleasure also to watch Madame Elaguine, who, in the last month or so,
      ever since the quarrel with Edmund Lewis and the consequent intimacy with her cousin, had
      suddenly changed in her manner towards Anne—had shown a half‐savage, half‐childish desire to
      parade her conquest before her rival, to let her see how completely she had taken Hamlin away
      from her, to humiliate and insult her: the flaunting perversity of a new sultana towards an
      old one. Anne had hitherto insisted
      <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7109-159"/> on thinking that Madame Elaguine was really a very noble
      little woman, and this revelation of a base wish to wound and humiliate, hurt her at first
      like some nauseous smell arising suddenly beneath her nostrils. But disgust was soon replaced
      by that new and secret pleasure in the consciousness of understanding this woman better than
      she understood herself; by the pleasure in feeling how wasted were all Madame Elaguine’s
      insults—how startled would not the little woman be, could she but know that every proof of her
      supremacy over Hamlin was to Miss Brown as each successively sawed‐through window‐bar is to
      the prisoner pining for the day of deliverance.</p>
<p>Anne felt herself getting into so singular a condition of excitement, losing so completely,
      under the pressure of these conflicting doubts and hopes in the past, of the great joy in the
      present, all her usual self‐composure and self‐control, that she took fiercely to working, to
      hurrying in every way through those studies
      <pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7109-160"/> which she had long since begun in the sickening
      often‐deferred hope that they might become her livelihood if she should ever be released from
      Hamlin. Miss Brown had often and often, even when the sense of hopelessness had been
      bitterest, consoled herself with what she believed to be unrealisable dreams for the future;
      and after going through many possible plans, she had decided that if—if—she should ever become
      her own mistress, she would employ, resolutely determined to return it to him some day, part
      of the money which Hamlin had settled upon her, in entering Girton or Newnham, where she would
      train herself to become a teacher in a public school. Almost mechanically, her studies (and
      restlessness, and the desire for something that should not be the harassing reality, had
      developed in her a perfect passion for study) fell into this programme. She had gone in for
      political economy, history, and what people are pleased to call moral sciences.</p>
<p>Now that liberty seemed on the point of
      <pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7109-161"/> being realised, and that she felt the want of something to
      steady her shaken nature, she applied herself to this work with redoubled ardour.</p>
<p>“If you go on like that you will get seedy, Annie,” warned the practical Marjory Leigh, now
      on the eve of becoming Mrs Harry Collett.</p>
<p>And Marjory Leigh proved right. The secret excitement of the last months, joined to the
      recent overwork, was too much for Anne. One day she was suddenly taken ill, and a little time
      later she was delirious.</p>
<p>“Nervous prostration from overwork,” said the doctors.</p>
<p>A great remorse, which was at the same time a great triumph, rose up in Hamlin’s heart.</p>
<p>“Sacha,” he cried, one day as Madame Elaguine came into the studio at Hammersmith, after
      visiting the sick woman, “it is I who am killing Anne; and it is you—you—who are forcing me to
      do it,”—and he tore the
      <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7109-162"/> portrait of Madame Elaguine off the board of his easel, and
      pulled the paper, in long ribbons, through his fingers.</p>
<p>“It’s no great harm,” said the Russian, quietly; “I’m not quite such a guy as you
      represented me, Watty, and I’m the better pleased not to go down to posterity like that. As to
      Anne, don’t flatter yourself you are breaking her heart, for the excellent reason that there
      is none to break. Too much study! the doctor says, and he knows. A woman like that works only
      with her brain. Too much Euclid, Kant, Hegel, Fichte, etc. You needn’t flatter yourself
      that <emph>you</emph> are of the company. Seriously, can you be such a baby as to imagine that
      if that woman loved you she wouldn’t have turned me out of doors ages ago? Besides, she talked
      only of Girton College and of her cousin Richard when she was delirious, the nurse tells
      me.”</p>
<p>Madame Elaguine watched Hamlin as she let these words drop, then she burst out laughing.</p>
<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7109-163"/>
<p>“Poor Walter! what a misfortune it is to be a poet and to be vain! I am really grieved for
      you. But sooner or later you would understand that when a woman has no heart, but only ‘a
      muscle for pumping the blood to the extremities,’ as one of her professors calls it, she can’t
      love; and that, moreover, no woman will ever understand or love you, you silly person, except
      your cousin Sacha.”</p>
<p>Cosmo Chough, who had come to the studio door, and, not being troubled with scruples when
      base creatures like Madame Elaguine were concerned, and having, moreover, a violent curiosity
      about everything concerning the Eternal Feminine, had listened at the keyhole, affirmed to
      Miss Brown some time after that Madame Elaguine had then and there put her arms round Hamlin’s
      neck, and called him a poor, vain little baby.</p>
