<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>“<hi>AFTER</hi> all,” said Melton Perry to himself next morning, as he sat under the big
      apple‐trees in the garden, smoking his pipe and looking at Miss Brown stitching at a piece of
      embroidery and overwhelming him with questions about Winnie, Mildred, Leila, the baby, Mrs
      Perry—nay, even about all her former fellow‐servants in Italy, and the grocer round the
      corner, and the milkman, and the man who came from the country every Monday to fetch the
      linen,—“after all, it was a very bright idea of old Watty’s to fall in love with our nursemaid
      and turn her into a wonderful æsthetic being in a wonderful æsthetic house: it was very
      sensible of Mrs Perry to encourage him in the idea; and it was just like
      <pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7109-235"/> a confounded, fumbling, purblind old pig and ass like me to
      try and prevent it.”</p>
<p>After lunch Anne took Melton Perry up into the drawing‐room, cool, and almost Italian, with
      drawn blinds and a faint smell of flowers in the dusk, on one of the most stifling London
      afternoons. Perry mechanically took out a cigarette; but he hastily put it in again. It seemed
      to him profanation to smoke in such a wonderful room, in the presence of such a wonderful
      woman.</p>
<p>“Please smoke; you used always to smoke after lunch with Mrs Perry,” said Anne.</p>
<p>“But—this isn’t Florence; and you—you aren’t Mrs Perry.”</p>
<p>Anne made an impatient gesture that he should take out his cigarettes again. She had
      determined that she must speak to him before Hamlin came; that she must try and get him to
      understand, to explain things to Hamlin. But how get this good‐natured, kindly, childish, yet
      in a way chivalrous, harum‐scarum creature to understand her story? She
      <pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7109-236"/> had a great dread of the impossibility of making him
      understand that Hamlin had never acted meanly towards her—that their estrangement was due to
      nothing voluntary on Hamlin’s part, to nothing but the disappointing of her own perhaps
      unwarranted ideals; of making him understand that Hamlin’s connection with Madame Elaguine,
      instead of being a grievance in her eyes, was the greatest happiness she could conceive. Perry
      was sure to burst out against Hamlin, to refuse to listen to her explanations, to insist upon
      fighting the battle of an injured woman.</p>
<p>Anne groaned at the thought, as she might have groaned at some immense stone to roll uphill.
      It was always so difficult for her to understand others, so intolerably more difficult to make
      herself understood. But she had resolved.</p>
<p>“I must tell you all my history since last we saw each other,” she said; “you will want to
      hear it, won’t you, Mr Perry?”</p>
<p>Perry, to whose brain all the unwonted
      <pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7109-237"/> splendour of this house, all the fantasticalness of finding
      his former nursemaid changed into a magnificently dressed goddess, had gone with a sort of
      narcotic effect, answered in a stupefied way, “Oh dear, yes—of course—I’m dying to hear it. I
      can’t at all realise that it is really you, Annie, or really anybody and anything. Do you
      remember when we went into Lucca that day for the feast of the Holy Face, and I left you with
      Winnie and Mildred to go to the opera with Hamlin? D’you remember the plaster bust of
      Castruccio at the top of the hotel stairs, with the old woman’s night‐cap on? I don’t know why
      that bust haunted me so. What tiny trots Winnie and Mildred were, with sashes down at their
      knees! and such confounded young flirts, five feet seven, as they are now! I see you have
      Winnie’s photograph. How comic those brats must have looked! . . . But won’t you tell me all
      your marvellous and incredible circumstances?”</p>
<p>“I scarcely know where to begin; perhaps
      <pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7109-238"/> I had better begin at the end. You wanted to know,” said
      Anne, making a great effort to arrest Perry’s attention, “why Mr Hamlin and I weren’t married
      yet, nor even engaged . . .”</p>
<p>“Oh yes; what the deuce is the meaning of it, Annie? You are certainly the queerest people,
      you æsthetic folk. By Jove! you actually have a photograph of yourself with the children. I
      had clean forgotten its existence; and now I remember as if it were yesterday taking you to
      Alinari’s, and how beastly naughty Winnie was! Oh, what a sulky blackamoor you do look, Annie!
      Good gracious! you don’t mean to say you know <emph>her</emph>?” and Melton Perry suddenly
      turned the album, at which he was looking, towards Anne. “Where in the world did you pick up a
      photograph of Mrs Constantine Bulzo?”</p>
<p>“Mrs Constantine Bulzo ?” asked Anne, in amazement. “Whom do you mean? I never heard of such
      a person. That photograph?—why, that’s a half‐Russian cousin of Mr Hamlin's
      <pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7109-239"/>, Sacha Elaguine, who was a Miss Polozoff.”</p>
<p>“Hamlin’s cousin!” whistled Melton Perry,—“well, upon my word . . . yes, of course, I had
      forgotten—of course, her name isn’t Mrs Constantine Bulzo any longer. But may I ask, how under
      heaven do you come to know Madame Elaguine?”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand a word. This lady is Madame Elaguine; she is Mr Hamlin’s first cousin,
      and that’s of course how I come to know her.”</p>
<p>“Hamlin’s cousin or not Hamlin’s cousin, how in the wide world could a woman like you ever
      know, ever meet such a—such a—excuse the word, but it’s the least bad I can find—such an
      abominable baggage as this woman, Elaguine, or Bulzo, or Polozoff—as this abominable
      Sacha?”</p>
<p>Miss Brown turned white and almost green; the embroidery slipped out of her hands—she
      gasped.</p>
<p>“Good Lord, what’s the matter with you,
      <pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7109-240"/> Annie?” cried Perry, jumping up; “you surely didn’t imagine
      that—you surely can’t be a great friend of such a creature as that. What’s the matter?—are you
      ill?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing—the heat, I suppose,” said Anne, stooping to pick up her embroidery; “and
      then, also, I suppose I’m not very strong yet; I’ve had brain fever, and you took me by
      surprise. But I oughtn’t to have been surprised, because I know Sacha Elaguine has a great
      many enemies, and that her circumstances, her history, and in some measure, unfortunately, her
      ways and character, rather lend themselves to all manner of horrible stories. She’s a
      frightfully tried and slandered little woman, poor thing. But I don’t—I don’t believe any of
      it.”</p>
<p>Anne was conscious of a horrible effort as she spoke these words; lying was difficult to
      her; and she remembered Edmund Lewis’s words.</p>
<p>“Are you really fond of Madame Bulzo—I mean Madame Elaguine?” asked Perry, grown
      <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7109-241"/> very serious suddenly, and looking Anne in the face with an
      expression of surprise and pain. “Are you intimate with her?”</p>
<p>“I am intimate in the sense of having been with her a good deal, and knowing more than other
      people about her,” answered Anne; “but I can’t say I am a great friend of hers. She is Mr
      Hamlin’s cousin; she has settled in England recently; he—we, I mean—see a good deal of her. I
      am awfully sorry for her, poor little woman; but there isn’t very much in common between
      us.”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness!” cried Perry. “Do you know, the sight of that photograph made me feel quite
      sick—the thought that you, Annie, should be the friend of such a creature. But I knew you
      couldn’t be.”</p>
<p>“But I am Madame Elaguine’s friend; I don’t believe a word of the infamous stories that are
      told about her; and you wouldn’t believe them either, if you knew all that I do.”</p>
<p>“What <emph>do</emph> you know ?” asked Perry, slowly
      <pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7109-242"/> and pityingly; “about the iniquities of Monsieur Elaguine,
      about the terrible persecution, the bits of letters, the pistol‐shots, the poisoned chocolate,
      the lit spirits of wine poured under the door,—all that crazy imposture, I suppose? Well, I
      hope that Hamlin knows no more than you; otherwise, by God! he’s no better than a blackguard
      to let you associate with this woman, be she his cousin a hundred times over; and you must
      never see that woman again, Annie. I forbid you to—I, as the oldest friend you have in the
      world—I forbid you to defile yourself by knowing that infamous creature.” And Perry walked
      fiercely up and down, while Miss Brown, her whole body, it seemed to her, melting away from
      her soul, sat speechless looking at him.</p>
<p>“Listen to me, Anne,” he said, “and judge whether I am unfair. God knows I’m not a Puritan,
      neither towards myself nor towards others. I’ve been a very rowdy man; I’ve knowu a great many
      rowdy women—what you call regular bad women—Russians, who are the
      <pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7109-243"/> worst of all—by the dozen. I’m not a red‐tapist; I can
      quite understand women misbehaving,—having lovers—that sort of thing,—or even, if they are
      very wretched, selling themselves. It’s beastly immoral to say so before a woman, but still,
      there it is, it’s the truth. Well, such as you see me, I wouldn’t touch <emph>that</emph>
      woman with the longest pair of tongs in all the devil’s kitchen. That woman is really
      wicked—not merely immoral, but abominable, atrocious; she is the sort of woman who absolutely
      degrades a man, takes a pleasure in turning him into a beast and a madman—whose greatest
      pleasure would be to degrade and make a beast of an honest woman. Just listen to me. Some five
      years ago I knew a Greek couple—a young man and his sister, called Constantine and Marie
      Bulzo. They were orphans, very young, very handsome, especially the boy, who was only eighteen
      or nineteen. They were a sort of half‐English Greeks, and went in for being æsthetical and
      artistic, all that sort of thing. I knew them in Florence, where Miss Bulzo,
      <pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7109-244"/> who was four or five years older than her brother, was
      studying painting. I gave them both lessons. I never met two such beautiful creatures, body
      and soul, as those young Bulzos. They were like young saints, and yet perfectly childish and
      merry, and they were quite devoted to each other: Marie really lived only for the boy. Well,
      six months later I met the two at Venice. They were staying at the same hotel as your Madame
      Elaguine, who immediately proceeded to make herself awfully fascinating and pathetic to them.
      Of course the poor children swallowed all about the persecutions by the Nihilists as so much
      Gospel. They introduced me, and Madame Elaguine rather amused me; but I saw very soon that she
      wasn’t a woman for them to know. There was a man staying in the same hotel, an old friend of
      hers, and, in fact, her lover, who was one of the vilest scoundrels the world ever bred—a
      horrible loathsome old Russian. I used to wonder how Madame Elaguine could endure him, but
      then I found out that he paid
      <pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7109-245"/> her bills for her. I tried to warn the Bulzos, especially
      Constantine, as, being a man, he might be expected to understand such things rather better.
      But, <foreign xml:lang="ita">figurati!</foreign> (and Perry made an expressive gesture of
      Italian exaggeration,) they wouldn’t hear a word against their beloved, deeply injured,
      martyrised Madame Elaguine. Well, we half quarrelled; I scarcely saw anything of them. At the
      end of four months what do I hear, but that Miss Bulzo was married to Madame Elaguine’s
      loathsome Russian; and then, a week later, I see Constantine and Madame Elaguine go off in the
      train together. Do you understand? Madame Elaguine, who was in love with young Bulzo, wanted
      to go off with him, and not knowing what to do with Marie, and wishing to dismiss and settle
      accounts with her <foreign xml:lang="lat">quondam</foreign> lover, had, in some fiendish way,
      induced this innocent girl of twenty‐four to marry this frightful old Russian sinner—had sold
      her to the loathsome beast as a settlement to their debts; and Marie, after a few months,
      simply pined
      <pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7109-246"/> away and died of shame and disgust at the slavery she had
      been sold into. Do you understand that?”</p>
<p>“I understand; but I don’t see why I should believe—it’s too horrible to be true.”</p>
<p>“It is true, though, for Constantine Bulzo told it me all himself later; how the Elaguine
      had talked him over to consent, and had regularly bullied his sister into the marriage, by
      pretending that it was the only way of paying a lot of imaginary debts of her brother’s, and
      had forced Constantine, who was raving in love with her, to hold his tongue. That was the end
      of Marie Bulzo. Now as to Constantine. His sister once safely married to her old beast, he
      went off with the Elaguine, or rather, the Elaguine went off with him. Next summer I met them
      at Perugia; they were travelling about in remote places as Mr and Mrs Bulzo; and English
      people were so kind as to believe that this Russian woman of thirty and this Greek boy of
      twenty were married. Constantine perfectly adored her; but I never
      <pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7109-247"/> saw a man more changed: he looked thirty, a miserable,
      hang‐dog, effeminate sort of creature, quite unable to do anything except drag after his
      so‐called wife. That woman had regularly ruined the poor boy, broken his spirit, turned him
      into a kind of male odalisque of hers. Two years later the Bulzos were at Venice again; and I
      came just in time for the catastrophe. One fine morning Mrs Constantine Bulzo, become Madame
      Elaguine once more, packed her trunks and went off with a French painter, leaving her supposed
      husband to pay the hotel bill.”</p>
<p>“I saw Constantine shortly after; the woman had spent nearly all his money, and he was
      living, or starving, in a room in a beastly court, slinking out only early in the morning and
      late at night, spending the day lying in his bed, eating opium and drinking. I never saw such
      a wreck in my life. As he was starving, I got him a place as clerk at a picture‐shop, and
      tried to get him to work; but he didn’t seem to care about living, and went on drinking and
      <pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7109-248"/> stupefying himself, till one day he drowned himself in the
      lagoon—they say accidentally, but I shall never believe it. That is the story of your Madame
      Elaguine; and I swear to you I have not exaggerated one word of it. Do you still think she is
      a woman fit to be known by you? By heaven! when I think what that miserable boy was when I saw
      him last, and what he had been when first I knew him, I feel as if it would be the greatest
      possible pleasure to throttle your Madame Elaguine with my own hands! Upon my soul, I do!”</p>
<p>Perry was walking up and down rapidly. Anne had never seen him so excited in his life.</p>
<p>“But,” remarked Miss Brown, coldly, “even admitting your story to be true, which I suppose,
      as it comes from you, that I must, was it all the woman’s fault? You men always throw the
      blame on the woman. But your Constantine Bulzo must have been a wretched weak creature.”</p>
<p>Perry stopped short.</p>
<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7109-249"/>
<p>“No one has a right to expect every man or every woman to be very strong,” he answered,
      sadly. “This poor boy was kind and trusting, and, when left to his own devices, honest. He was
      not weaker than most men, especially than most artistic natures—not weaker, for instance, than
      Walter Hamlin.”</p>
<p>Anne Brown did not answer. But next morning she greatly surprised Melton Perry by asking
      him, in a voice that affected him as being very strange—</p>
<p>“Did you tell me something—a dreadful story—about Madame Elaguine and a young Greek friend
      of yours, yesterday afternoon?”</p>
<p>Perry looked at her with surprise. There was something in her wide‐opened, strained eyes, in
      her rigidity of features, that made him think of a sleep‐walker.</p>
<p>“Of course I did. Why?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing. I had only a very bad night—all manner of horrible dreams, and I was not sure
      whether this might not be one of them.”</p>
