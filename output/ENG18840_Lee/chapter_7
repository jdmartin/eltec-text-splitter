<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>EARLY the following morning Hamlin was awakened by the wheels of the waggonette and
      the bells of the horses. Then came the excited voices of children; the sound of slammed doors
      and precipitate steps on the stairs; and finally the rattle and jingle of departure. He had
      declined being one of the boisterous expedition to Lucca, for he detested children in general,
      and the little Perrys in particular; and a day in the empty house (for Mrs Perry was going to
      see some friends at a neighbouring villa) had seemed to him delightful. He opened his shutters
      and saw, in the crisp pale‐blue morning, the carriage sweeping round the corner of a narrow
      lane, the children’s hats, Anne Brown’s red shawl, the coachman’s grey coat, brush rapidly
      along a tall box hedge.
      <pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7107-078"/> If there was a thing Hamlin hated more than another, it was
      a holiday, a crowd, a lot of people on a jaunt.</p>
<p>After breakfast he went to the studio and sat down before his sketches of Miss Brown. They
      were unsatisfactory, but they were as good as he could hope to make them. He had fancied that
      a coloured sketch of her head would be all that he could possibly want; but he now recognised
      that, after all, the head, beautiful and singular as it was, was yet the least part of the
      matter. It was the girl’s gait, her way of carrying her head and neck, her movements when at
      work, her postures when in repose—a number of things of which that head gave no indication,
      and which, indeed, it was difficult to render in painting, since it was all movement. He had
      scribbled a few lines—just fragmentary metaphors and scraps of description—suggested to him by
      Anne Brown, and wondered what use he would make of them; indeed, what use he could make of
      Anne Brown altogether. Here was a
      <pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7107-079"/> splendid model, a splendid heroine, but he was in the mood
      neither for painting nor for poetry writing. He put a background of dark bay trees to one of
      his sketches, and then regretted having put it in at all. He no longer felt inclined to work;
      and, all of a sudden, an unaccountable fancy struck him to follow the holiday‐makers—to go
      quietly into town—to see them, without, perhaps, letting himself be seen.</p>
<p>The sun was already high as he walked, or rather waded, along the dusty road, with its
      garlands of dust‐engrained vines hanging from tree to tree on either side; its dust‐stifled
      marsh‐flowers in the ditch; its white farmhouses, and white stone heaps, white upon white,
      brilliant, relentlessly white, under the deep blue autumn sky. Before him the bullock‐carts,
      with sleepy drivers prostrate on their back, moved in a white cloud; a whirlwind of dust was
      raised by every cariole, heavily laden with singing and yelling peasants, which dashed past.
      Within sight of the rampart trees, like a pleasant oasis of leafage in
      <pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7107-080"/> the treeless green desert of the town, the crowd of vehicles
      of all sorts began. Under the red brick gate, with its statue of Justice and motto “Libertas,”
      there was a perfect block of carts, gigs, bullocks, horses, and screaming country folk. Hamlin
      wriggled through, and slipped along in the scant shade of the narrower streets—empty and
      desolate on that holiday—ribbons of brilliant light cut into, bordered by the black shadows of
      overhanging roofs and balconies. A great buzz of voices came from the square of the cathedral;
      peasants and townsfolk elbowing about, people at booths yelling their wares, boys screeching
      on whistles and trumpets, cathedral bell tolling, and all the neighbouring church bells
      clattering and jangling. From the windows of the blackened palaces fluttered strips of crimson
      and yellow brocade; across the street, from balcony to balcony, and from twisted iron
      torchholder to twisted iron bridle‐ring, were slung garlands of coloured lamps for the
      evening’s illumination; and in the
      <pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7107-081"/> midst of all rose the cathedral front, its tiers and tiers
      of twisted and sculptured pillarets, with the massive grey belfry soaring by its side into the
      high blue sky. Hamlin pushed his way in at one of the side gates; a rolling of organs, and
      quavering of choir voices, and clash of brass instruments; a hot mouthful of heavy,
      incense‐laden atmosphere; a compact moving human mass beneath the Gothic arches; beams of
      light flickering among clouds of dust, and incense and taper smoke high in the arched nave;
      constellations of lights on altar, and organ‐loft, and chandelier, yellow specks in the
      mid‐day twilight of the cathedral; something tawdry, hushed, unbreathable, and yet impressive
      and beautiful.</p>
<p>Hamlin gradually made his way to the side of the altar‐steps. This part of the cathedral was
      full of women—provincial great ladies, and shopkeepers’ wives and daughters in their Sunday
      clothes, brilliant caricatures of last year’s Paris fashions—close packed together on reserved
      seats, enjoying the incense, the
      <pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7107-082"/> lights, the music, the holiness of the ceremony, the clothes
      of their neighbours, the appealing glances of the young men in elaborate silk and alpaca
      summer coats, with artistically combed‐up heads of hair, sucking their canes all about the
      altar. Hamlin’s entry, however quiet, was soon perceived, and the eyes of all this womankind
      were fixed upon the sight, rare in that country town, of an Englishman; and white silk
      bonnets, and black lace veils, and big red fans, and fuzzy yellow and smooth black heads,
      leant towards each other,—while questions went round in a whisper, who was the <foreign xml:lang="fre">forestiere</foreign>—the handsome <foreign xml:lang="fre">forestiere</foreign>—small, slight, meagre, white, with the light hair and moustache, and
      that melancholy face like a woman’s? Hamlin was quickly bored by all this magnificence;
      jostled to pieces, stifled by the heat, and incense, and heavy smell of the crowd. He was
      going out, when, as his eyes wandered from the silver and lights of the altar, and the shining
      mitres and stoles of the priests, to that sea of heads and bonnets and
      <pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7107-083"/> hats in the nave, they were suddenly and unexpectedly
      arrested on the side steps of the high altar just opposite to him. There, among a lot of
      heads, but high above them, was a head half covered with coarse black lace and crisp dark hair
      half turned away from him; a majestic sweep of cheek and jaw, a solemn bend of neck. A moment
      later the bell tinkled for the elevation of the Host, the organ burst forth into a rapid jig,
      and the church was a sea of bent heads, of kneeling and stooping men and women. As the people
      suddenly sank like a wave about the steps, there remained, stranded as it were, and rising
      conspicuous, the tall and massive figure of Miss Brown. She was standing on the altar‐steps,
      whose orange‐red baize cloth threw up faint yellowish tints on to her long dress of some kind
      of soft white wool, while the crimson brocade on wall and column formed a sort of dull red
      background. In the mixed light of the yellow tapers and the grey incense‐laden sunbeams, her
      face acquired a diaphanous pallor, as if of a halo surrounding
      <pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7107-084"/> it, as she stood, her hands hanging loosely clasped, looking
      calmly upon the bowed‐down crowd below. One minute, and the bell tinkling again, the people
      rose with a muffled, shuffling noise, and hid her from Hamlin. The organ and bells were
      pealing, the voices and violins rising shrill, the incense curling up in grey spirals into the
      sunbeams among the crimson hangings. The sonnet of Guido Cavalcanti, about the Madonna
      picture, enshrined at Or San Michele behind the blazing tapers, and in which he recognised his
      lady, came into Hamlin’s mind, with the sound of the music and the fumes of the incense; and
      together with it, a remembrance, a sort of picture, hopelessly jumbled, of Laura in the church
      at Avignon that Good Friday, and Beatrice among the blazing lights of the Heavenly Rose. The
      Mass was over, and people began to stir and leave the cathedral. Why had she remained standing
      while all the others had knelt? Perhaps from some Scotch puritanism; it was incongruous,
      thought Hamlin. But at the same time
      <pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7107-085"/> he felt that, while incongruous in one way—for she ought
      certainly to have knelt like the others—it had in another respect completed an effect; this
      disbelieving girl had herself become, as it were, the Madonna of the place. He stood aside and
      let the crowd slowly pass out. Suddenly he saw, among the moving sea of heads, the flaxen
      curls of the little Perrys—the reddish beard of Melton Perry—the head, half covered with black
      lace and towering above the others, of Miss Brown. She was leading the two smaller children,
      and looked anxious in that great crowd. Up went one of the little yellow heads; she had taken
      the child in her arms. All of a sudden her eyes caught those of Hamlin standing close by, and
      yet separated from him by an impassable gulf of people. Her own lit up, and with them her
      whole face, in a smile, which he had never seen before. At last, near the church door, the
      crowd bore his friends straight towards him.</p>
<p>“What! here after all!” cried Perry. “Up to some mischief, you cunning dog!”</p>
<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7107-086"/>
<p>“Up to the mischief of watching these good people’s devotion,” answered Hamlin.</p>
<p>“Why did you come?” asked the children eagerly.</p>
<p>“I suppose because I thought I should like to amuse myself after all,” answered Hamlin.</p>
<p>They were out on the cathedral steps, in the full glare of the blue sky. Outside a fountain
      was playing, penny whistles and trumpets shrilled on all sides, and the people at the stalls
      shrieked and bellowed out their wares to the motley crowd pouring out of the church. The
      children cast eyes of longing upon the booths, decorated with tricolour flags and sprigs of
      green, full of gaudy dolls, and squeaking wooden dogs, and tin trumpets, and drums; upon the
      tables, covered with bottles shaped like pyramids, and china men, and Garibaldi busts, full of
      red and yellow and green stuff, and with piles of cakes with little pictures of saints stuck
      in the middle of them.</p>
<p>“Buy us something,” cried the little ones to their father and Hamlin; and they squeezed
      <pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7107-087"/> through the crowd, and began to hesitate before the varied
      splendours of the fair.</p>
<p>“You look very happy, Miss Brown,” said Hamlin, as they were waiting while the children made
      their choice. For really the girl looked quite radiant,—an expression of unwonted happiness,
      of freedom and amusement, shone through her quiet, almost solemn, face, like sunshine through
      a thin film of mist, all the richer for being half suppressed.</p>
<p>“It is all so beautiful,” she answered, looking round at the square surrounded by high black
      palaces draped with crimson brocade, and terraces covered with green, and at the cathedral,
      carved like a precious casket, beneath the blue sky.</p>
<p>“Not more beautiful than at the Villa Arnolfini, surely?”</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>“No, not more beautiful; but more—I don’t know what.”</p>
<p>“More cheerful?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “Yes; but not so
      <pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7107-088"/> much that; more free—more—I don’t know how to call it.”</p>
<p>The children were laden with lollipops and sixpenny toys.</p>
<p>“Come,” said Perry suddenly, very cheerful, in his unaccustomed freedom from his better
      half, “you must choose a fairing, Annie. What will you have?—a doll?—a beautiful yellow
      ’kerchief with purple flowers, warranted the very worst colours in creation? some
      gingerbread?—a penny whistle? No, I’m sure you’re dying for some literature”—and he turned to
      a stone bench under a palace, where twopenny books were piled up, and quantities of leaflets
      of ballads, and lives of saints, and romantic histories, were strung to the wall.</p>
<p>“Oh!” he said, “there’s nothing for Annie here—she hates saints and knights and poetry; we
      must get her a book on the ‘Rights of Man,’ or a ‘History of the French Revolution,’ at the
      bookseller’s in Via Fillungo. But this is just what suits Hamlin”—and throwing
      <pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7107-089"/> down a heap of coppers, he filled his hands with printed
      leaflets. “The tremendous adventures of the Giant Ferracciù,” he read; “the lamentable history
      of Lucia of Lamermoor; the loves of Irminda and Astolfo; the complaint of the beautiful
      Fair‐haired One,—these are the things for a poet,” and he stuffed them into Hamlin’s
      pockets.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous, Melton,” cried Hamlin.</p>
<p>“Ridiculous!” exclaimed Perry. “Who talks of things being ridiculous? I’m in good
      earnest”—and as they went along he began declaiming, with appropriate gestures, a ballad
      composed by some printer’s prentice from the libretto of an old opera.</p>
<p>The children shrieked with laughter at papa’s voice and faces; and Anne Brown burst into a
      curious subdued laugh, which, although scarcely audible, was extremely childish.</p>
<p>As they walked along the narrow crowded streets towards the inn where they were to
      <pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7107-090"/> have dinner, Perry kept on ahead with the two elder
      children, and Hamlin hung back with Miss Brown and the two younger.</p>
<p>“Did you like the ceremony in the cathedral, Miss Brown?” he asked, irresistibly drawn on to
      understand why she had not knelt like the others.</p>
<p>“It was very beautiful,” she said; “and such beautiful vestments! Did you see the white and
      gold embroidery of the bishop?—and the purple dresses of the canons?—oh, it was lovely! But it
      makes me angry to see such things.”</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<p>“Because it is dreadful—don’t you think?—to see all those people kneeling down and believing
      in all that nonsense.”</p>
<p>“How do you know it is nonsense? It seems to me very beautiful and consoling.”</p>
<p>She turned her big grey‐blue eyes upon him. “You don’t mean that you believe in all that
      mummery?” she asked, searchingly and reproachfully—“you who have studied so much;
      <pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7107-091"/> you don’t believe that they can make God come down with
      their mutterings and kneelings?”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it,” answered Hamlin, with some embarrassment; “but I think it is very
      beautiful, and those who do believe in it are very happy.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t think it is right that people should believe in falsehoods, and be the slaves
      of wicked priests?”</p>
<p>“How rabid you are!” laughed Hamlin. “No, I don’t believe; but I like to see others
      believing.”</p>
<p>“I don’t;” and after a minute she added, “Don’t you believe in anything at all?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps I do,” he said, fixing his eyes upon her. “I believe in beauty—I believe that is
      the one true thing in life.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” she answered; “but it seems to me dreadful that people should
      believe in priests and kings, and all sorts of lies.”</p>
<p>They relapsed into silence. As they walked along, Hamlin stole glances at his companion,
      <pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7107-092"/> walking stately and serious like a saint or a sibyl by his
      side. He wondered what this girl would have been had she lived three or four centuries back.
      All this common modern radicalism distressed him in her—it had no colour and no perfume. Yet,
      after all, it was but the modern accessory instead of the medieval. This was the way in which
      beauty and romance were wasted nowadays—wasted, he thought, half consciously, yet not perhaps
      entirely, since it went to make up a characteristic whole.</p>
<p>Melton Perry took them to the chief inn of the place for dinner. He let each of the children
      choose whatever she preferred, ordered several bottles of <foreign xml:lang="ita">Asti
       spumante</foreign>, and gave it them to drink in champagne‐glasses. The one or two furtive
      English spinsters who were sipping their tea and reading their “Murray” at the other tables of
      the huge dining‐room, profusely ornamented with casts from the antique, and with cut‐paper
      fiy‐floppers, looked up with surprise at the festive party headed by Perry.
      <pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7107-093"/> After dinner the two little ones began to hang their heads
      in the hot room, and gave signs of going to sleep.</p>
<p>“Good gracious!” said Perry, in a consternation, “what are we to do with these wretched
      infants? They’ll just prevent our taking a stroll in the town before returning home.”</p>
<p>“I think the best thing will be for them to sleep a little, sir,” suggested Anne Brown. “I
      will tuck them up on the sofa, and stay with them here while you and Mr Hamlin take Miss
      Mildred and Miss Winnie for a walk.”</p>
<p>“But I can’t think of leaving you behind, Annie,” cried Perry., “I know how much you would
      like to see the town.”</p>
<p>“I saw part of it this morning,” she swered; “and I really would just as soon stay with the
      children here.” There was no gainsaying her; so the two men sallied forth with the two elder
      children on a walk through the crowded and bannered streets; while Anne Brown remained sitting
      in the stuffy inn dining‐room by the side of the torpid little
      <pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7107-094"/> ones. When they were out an idea suddenly struck Hamlin:
      this was the opportunity of getting a present for Anne Brown. He left Perry regaling the
      children on ices at a <foreign xml:lang="fre">café</foreign> opposite the Church of St
      Michael, which rose like a great marble bride‐cake into the bright blue sky, and made his way
      to a bookstall which he had noticed in the morning. He asked for the ‘Vita Nuova.’ The old
      bookseller looked over a number of little schedules in his desk, and produced several copies,
      new and second‐hand. They did not please Hamlin. At last he displayed a tiny Giunti volume,
      just delicately yellowed by age, and bound in vellum. Hamlin bought it, and secreted it in his
      pocket, and then joined Perry.</p>
<p>They went to the stable, where all the carioles from the country put up, and ordered the
      waggonette to be at the inn door in an hour. But as they were slowly mounting the wide stone
      staircase, with the eternal plaster dancing nymphs tripping it on each landing, Perry’s eye
      fell upon a large bill pasted upon the
      <pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7107-095"/> opposite wall,—the playbill of the Teatro del Giglio,—on
      which, among the names of singers, fiddlers, chorus‐directors, scene‐painters, theatre
      tailors, and hairdressers, streamed, in scarlet letters, the title “Semiramide.”</p>
<p>“<foreign xml:lang="ita">Tò</foreign>!” cried Milton Perry, with the Tuscan expression for a
      sudden bright thought; “what do you two young minxes say to going to hear an opera for the
      first time in your lives?”</p>
<p>“Oh, papa!” shrilled Mildred.</p>
<p>“Oh, papa!” echoed Winnie, catching hold of his knees—</p>
<p>“Not so quick!” exclaimed Perry; “I’m by no means so sure of it. What’s to become of the two
      sleepy little worms?”</p>
<p>“Send them home with Annie,” suggested Mildred, promptly; “and you’ll take us home
      later.”</p>
<p>“Nothing of the kind, my young woman,” he answered sternly. “If any one goes to the opera it
      shall be Annie. Make up your mind for that.”</p>
<p>The dining‐room was deserted. On a sofa
      <pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7107-096"/> near the open window lay the two tiny girls, propped up with
      cushions; Anne Brown, surly, flopping away the flies which buzzed about them, and reading a
      newspaper. She was resting the paper on her knees, and supporting her head with one hand,
      while the other moved slowly with the cut‐paper flopper; and in this position the young
      nursemaid struck Hamlin as a resuscitation, but more beautiful and even stranger, of one of
      Michaelangelo’s prophetic women.</p>
<p>“I say, Annie,”’ cried Perry, “what do you say to taking these two brats to the opera this
      evening?”</p>
<p>Anne Brown started up.</p>
<p>“To the opera, sir?” she cried, flushing with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Yes; these creatures have never been. They’re giving ‘Semiramide’ to‐night. I think it’s a
      good opera for children to begin with; because it will teach them betimes the unhappy
      complications which are apt to result from murdering one’s husband, and trying
      <pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7107-097"/> to marry one’s son unawares. I’ll take the little ones back
      to the villa in half an hour, and quiet Mrs Perry’s feelings. Mr Hamlin will be delighted to
      accompany you and mesdemoiselles my daughters, to the theatre, and then bring you home. It
      won’t last late.”</p>
<p>“But,” exclaimed Anne Brown,—“ oh, how good of you, sir!—but are you sure you would not like
      to stay for the opera yourself? I could take the little ones home.”</p>
<p>“No, thank you, Annie. The fact is, I <emph>never</emph> have approved of Rossini’s music.
      Ever since my earliest infancy I have been shocked by its want of earnestness; what I like is
      a symphony in P minor, with plenty of chords of the diminished seventeenth. That’s the right
      sort of thing, isn’t it, Hamlin?”</p>
<p>A few minutes later Perry went away with the two little girls, leaving Mildred and Winhie
      with Anne Brown. Hamlin accompanied them down‐stairs to the waggonette.</p>
<p>“I will go to the theatre and secure a box,” he said, “and order a trap to take us
      back.”</p>
<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7107-098"/>
<p>“All right!” cried Perry, as the waggonette rolled off. “Mind you don’t let those children
      bore you or worry poor Annie too much; and don’t leave them alone the whole afternoon.”</p>
<p>But, for some unaccountable reason, Hamlin did leave them alone the whole afternoon. After
      he had secured the box and ordered the carriage, he felt a sort of unwillingness to go back to
      the inn, perhaps unconsciously, to sit opposite the Perrys’ nursemaid; so he walked about the
      town till tea‐time, not troubling himself to inquire whether Anne Brown and the children might
      not prefer a stroll on the ramparts to the monotony of sitting for two mortal hours in the inn
      dining‐room.</p>
