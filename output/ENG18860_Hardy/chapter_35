<p>As Donald stated, Lucetta had retired early to her room because of fatigue. She had, however,
     not gone to rest, but sat in the bedside chair reading and thinking over the events of the day.
     At the ringing of the door-bell by Henchard she wondered who it should be that would call at
     that comparatively late hour. The dining-room was almost under her bed-room; she could hear
     that somebody was admitted there, and presently the indistinct murmur of a person reading
     became audible.</p>
<p>The usual time for Donald's arrival upstairs came and passed, yet still the reading and
     conversation went on. This was very singular. She could think of nothing but that some
     extraordinary crime had been committed, and that the visitor, whoever he might be, was reading
     an account of it from a special edition of the Casterbridge Chronicle. At last she left the
     room, and descended the stairs. The dining-room door was ajar, and in the silence of the
     resting household the voice and the words were recognizable before she reached the lower
     flight. She stood transfixed. Her own words greeted her in Henchard's voice, like spirits from
     the grave.</p>
<p>Lucetta leant upon the banister with her cheek against the smooth hand-rail, as if she would
     make a friend of it in her misery. Rigid in this position, more and more words fell
     successively upon her ear. But what amazed her most was the tone of her husband. He spoke
     merely in the accents of a man who made a present of his time.</p>
<p>“One word,” he was saying, as the crackling of paper denoted that Henchard was unfolding yet
     another sheet. “Is it quite fair to this young woman's memory to read at such length to a
     stranger what was intended for your eye alone?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes,” said Henchard. “By not giving her name I make it an example of all womankind,
     and not a scandal to one.”</p>
<p>“If I were you I would destroy them,” said Farfrae, giving more thought to the letters than
     he had hitherto done. “As another man's wife it would injure the woman if it were known.”</p>
<p>“No, I shall not destroy them,” murmured Henchard, putting the letters away. Then he arose,
     and Lucetta heard no more.</p>
<p>She went back to her bedroom in a semi-paralyzed state. For very fear she could not undress,
     but sat on the edge of the bed, waiting. Would Henchard let out the secret in his parting
     words? Her suspense was terrible. Had she confessed all to Donald in their early acquaintance
     he might possibly have got over it, and married her just the same — unlikely as it had once
     seemed; but for her or any one else to tell him now would be fatal.</p>
<p>The door slammed; she could hear her husband bolting it. After looking round in his customary
     way he came leisurely up the stairs. The spark in her eyes well-nigh went out when he appeared
     round the bedroom door. Her gaze hung doubtful for a moment, then to her joyous amazement she
     saw that he looked at her with the rallying smile of one who had just been relieved of a scene
     that was irksome. She could hold out no longer, and sobbed hysterically.</p>
<p>When he had restored her Farfrae naturally enough spoke of Henchard. “Of all men he was the
     least desirable as a visitor,” he said; “but it is my belief that he's just a bit crazed. He
     has been reading to me a long lot of letters relating to his past life; and I could do no less
     than indulge him by listening.”</p>
<p>This was sufficient. Henchard, then, had not told. Henchard's last words to Farfrae, in
     short, as he stood on the doorstep, had been these: “Well — I'm obliged to 'ee for listening. I
     may tell more about her some day.”</p>
<p>Finding this, she was much perplexed as to Henchard's motives in opening the matter at all;
     for in such cases we attribute to an enemy a power of consistent action which we never find in
     ourselves or in our friends; and forget that abortive efforts from want of heart are as
     possible to revenge as to generosity.</p>
<p>Next morning Lucetta remained in bed, meditating how to parry this incipient attack. The bold
     stroke of telling Donald the truth, dimly conceived, was yet too bold; for she dreaded lest in
     doing so he, like the rest of the world, should believe that the episode was rather her fault
     than her misfortune. She decided to employ persuasion — not with Donald but with the enemy
     himself. It seemed the only practicable weapon left her as a woman. Having laid her plan she
     rose, and wrote to him who kept her on these tenterhooks: — </p>
<p>“I overheard your interview with my husband last night, and saw the drift of your revenge.
     The very thought of it crushes me! Have pity on a distressed woman! If you could see me you
     would relent. You do not know how anxiety has told upon me lately. I will be at the Ring at the
     time you leave work — just before the sun goes down. Please come that way. I cannot rest till I
     have seen you face to face, and heard from your mouth that you will carry this horse-play no
     further.”</p>
<p>To herself she said, on closing up her appeal: “If ever tears and pleadings have served the
     weak to fight the strong, let them do so now!”</p>
<p>With this view she made a toilette which differed from all she had ever attempted before. To
     heighten her natural attraction had hitherto been the unvarying endeavour of her adult life,
     and one in which she was no novice. But now she neglected this, and even proceeded to impair
     the natural presentation. Beyond a natural reason for her slightly drawn look, she had not
     slept all the previous night, and this had produced upon her pretty though slightly worn
     features the aspect of a countenance ageing prematurely from extreme sorrow. She selected — as
     much from want of spirit as design — her poorest, plainest and longest discarded attire.</p>
<p>To avoid the contingency of being recognized she veiled herself, and slipped out of the house
     quickly. The sun was resting on the hill like a drop of blood on an eyelid by the time she had
     got up the road opposite the amphitheatre, which she speedily entered. The interior was
     shadowy, and emphatic of the absence of every living thing.</p>
<p>She was not disappointed in the fearful hope with which she awaited him. Henchard came over
     the top, descended and Lucetta waited breathlessly. But having reached the arena she saw a
     change in his bearing: he stood still at a little distance from her; she could not think
     why.</p>
<p>Nor could any one else have known. The truth was that in appointing this spot, and this hour,
     for the rendezvous, Lucetta had unwittingly backed up her entreaty by the strongest argument
     she could have used outside words, with this man of moods, glooms, and superstitions. Her
     figure in the midst of the huge enclosure, the unusual plainness of her dress, her attitude of
     hope and appeal, so strongly revived in his soul the memory of another ill-used woman who had
     stood there and thus in bygone days, and had now passed away into her rest, that he was
     unmanned, and his heart smote him for having attempted reprisals on one of a sex so weak. When
     he approached her, and before she had spoken a word, her point was half gained.</p>
<p>His manner as he had come down had been one of cynical carelessness; but he now put away his
     grim half-smile, and said, in a kindly subdued tone, “Goodnight t'ye. Of course I'm glad to
     come if you want me.”</p>
<p>“O, thank you,” she said apprehensively.</p>
<p>“I am sorry to see 'ee looking so ill,” he stammered with unconcealed compunction.</p>
<p>She shook her head. “How can you be sorry,” she asked, “when you deliberately cause it?”</p>
<p>“What!” said Henchard uneasily. “Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like
     that?”</p>
<p>“It is all your doing,” she said. “I have no other grief. My happiness would be secure enough
     but for your threats. O Michael! don't wreck me like this! You might think that you have done
     enough! When I came here I was a young woman; now I am rapidly becoming an old one. Neither my
     husband nor any other man will regard me with interest long.”</p>
<p>Henchard was disarmed. His old feeling of supercilious pity for womankind in general was
     intensified by this suppliant appearing here as the double of the first. Moreover that
     thoughtless want of foresight which had led to all her trouble remained with poor Lucetta
     still; she had come to meet him here in this compromising way without perceiving the risk. Such
     a woman was very small deer to hunt; he felt ashamed, lost all zest and desire to humiliate
     Lucetta there and then, and no longer envied Farfrae his bargain. He had married money, but
     nothing more. Henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game.</p>
<p>“Well, what do you want me to do?” he said gently. “I am sure I shall be very willing. My
     reading of those letters was only a sort of practical joke, and I revealed nothing.”</p>
<p>“To give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of matrimony or
     worse.”</p>
<p>“So be it. Every scrap shall be yours....But, between you and me, Lucetta, he is sure to find
     out something of the matter, sooner or later.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” she said with eager tremulousness; “but not till I have proved myself a faithful and
     deserving wife to him, and then he may forgive me everything!”</p>
<p>Henchard silently looked at her: he almost envied Farfrae such love as that, even now. “H'm —
     I hope so,” he said. “But you shall have the letters without fail. And your secret shall be
     kept. I swear it.”</p>
<p>“How good you are! — how shall I get them?”</p>
<p>He reflected, and said he would send them the next morning. “Now don't doubt me,” he added.
     “I can keep my word.”</p>
