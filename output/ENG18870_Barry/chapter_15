<head>CHAPTER XV THE MEETING OF FAIR LADIES</head>
<p>It was natural that Lord Trelingham should ask next morning how Rupert had been led
      to Falside. And just as natural was it that Rupert should not know where to begin. He would
      not mention his first encounter with Hippolyta, and was thereby at a loss how to explain the
      second. He kept, therefore, to the vague and the general. He had never crossed the stream
      before, and, on the completion of his picture, had been seized with an irresistible desire to
      spend a morning in the open air and to explore the country which lay across the high and woody
      banks of Yale. He was not, like his friend Ivor, endowed with a strong local memory, and the
      mist which came down on the moor obliterated the usual landmarks. While in this uncertainty,
      Miss Valence, who was riding home, as he supposed, and who might have gathered from his
      appearance that he was a stranger, came to his rescue. She told him
      <pb/> that he could not reach Trelingham before nightfall, and very kindly offered him shelter
      and refreshment at her father's house. He might have hesitated had Colonel Valence been at
      home; but in his absence no subjects were likely to be handled in which a guest at Trelingham
      could not join, and he had accepted Miss Valence's benevolent offer. At this point Lady May
      interrupted him. 'Was Miss Valence riding unattended?' So far as he knew, she was.</p>
<p>'She must be an extraordinary young lady,' said the Earl's daughter. 'It is now four or five
      years since they came to Falside. Miss Valence has no mother, and apparently never had a
      governess. She has no companion, and but one woman-servant is ever seen about the place. But
      Miss Valence rides and walks alone where she pleases,—like a man or an American young woman. I
      have seen her only at a distance. Is she peculiar when you meet her?'</p>
<p>Glanville hardly knew; no, he thought not; he had no opinion, except that Miss Valence
      seemed to have had more experience of the world than he could have supposed. And here he began
      to consider how he should give her message to Lady May. Better now than when they were alone.
      He must speak as not having received any special confidences while at Falside.</p>
<p>'Miss Valence,' he said, not without an inward thrill as he mentioned her name, 'surprised
      me in some ways. I did not know at first whether she
      <pb/> shared the Colonel's feelings. But it is evident that she does not. Her father, no
      doubt, sees that she can have nothing to do with his first marriage. At all events,' he went
      on, directing his words to the Earl, 'she spoke of you, I may say, with affection. Nor is that
      all. She expressed a strong desire to know Lady May.'</p>
<p>'Did she really?' cried the Countess, who had been listening attentively. 'How amusing it
      would be to know such an original girl! Do let us call on her, May.'</p>
<p>Her cousin was astonished, not at Karina, who uttered whatever came into her flighty brain,
      but at the message conveyed by Rupert. She was not prejudiced in favour of Miss Valence.
      Though her own views were unconventional and her principles daringly unlike those in which, as
      the daughter of a pious English peer, she had been trained, it did not follow that she
      approved of 'American manners,' as she called them. Neighbours who remembered Lady Alice's
      marriage, were slow to mention the Valences when one of the Trelingham family happened to be
      present. Yet she had heard and seen enough to give her a disagreeable notion of Hippolyta as a
      bold, hoydenish sort of young person, brought up nobody knew where, and showing in her conduct
      a complete indifference to the sacred usages of the class to which her father at least
      belonged. Lady May was capable of breaking with society to gratify a strong inclination; but
      she was not capable of riding
      <pb/> out without a groom. Those laws of the Medes and Persians which, concerned with slight
      outward forms, are different in different countries, are yet in each inviolable. Now Hippolyta
      had never borne their yoke. She could not feel the enormity of the offences she almost daily
      committed against those which govern Englishwomen. Not a stain could be imputed to her; in
      word and deed she was white as the driven snow. And yet the mention of her name in any
      drawing-room within a circuit of a dozen miles was accompanied, on the part of her own sex,
      with mysterious looks and frowns, which implied that her reputation was a thing of naught. On
      first coming into the country she was too young to be introduced anywhere; nor did Colonel
      Valence, who never entered a drawing-room, seek female society for his daughter. She had grown
      up alone, and seemed not to mind it. But such an eccentric way of life made it impossible that
      the ladies around should make acquaintance with her now she had reached the age of nineteen.
      She was excommunicated by universal though tacit consent. She was a social outcast, to be
      owned by no class of her father's fellow-citizens or their wives. Did she feel it? Was she
      aware of it even? Impossible to say. If she suffered, neither Colonel Valence nor any of their
      forein guests observed her suffering. She went to and fro, or stayed at home and received her
      visitors, with much the same freedom and straightforwardness which a young man of her own age
      would have displayed.
      <pb/> Her manners were, in this respect, American. Most certainly they were un-English. Had
      one of the younger revolutionists that sometimes came happened to interest her in his views,
      she would have written long letters to him and permitted or enjoined him to answer at equal
      length, nor imagined that she was indulging an unfeminine intimacy. Assuredly she had not the
      shadow of a notion that such correspondence implied a promise or prospect of their union for
      life. As a matter of fact, she had no correspondent except her father; but she might have had
      a score and Colonel Valence would not have interposed. She did, indeed, write letters at his
      dictation to all parts of Europe, sometimes in cypher, and often without remembering their
      contents. These things were not all within Lady May's knowledge, but some of them were; and
      she could not decide whether the message conveyed by Rupert was a fresh instance of Miss
      Valence's boldness, or whether she ought to accept it in a friendly spirit. Her first
      resolution was in the negative. She could not take notice of Hippolyta; it would be every way
      unbecoming. 'Did you dine at Falside?' she inquired of Rupert. He admitted that he had done
      so; and further civil questioning made it clear that Miss Valence had presided at the
      dinner-table. This was dreadful in a maiden of nineteen; how could any lady that respected
      herself visit such a hardened sinner, such an inexcusable culprit? So reasoned the Earl's
      daughter on hearing these confessions,
      <pb/> although for the honour of her sex she made no remark. Rupert, likewise, came in for his
      share of censure. But he was only a man, and men are easily led from the right path when women
      are bold. Call on Miss Valence? no, indeed. But the Countess would not leave her in peace.
      When she expressed her decision in a brief but energetic sentence, that lady, appealing to the
      Earl, who tolerated her saucy ways with marvellous good-nature, said, 'Don't you think, uncle,
      that it is very nice of poor Miss Valence to want May for a friend? She must be a great deal
      better than her father. I don't like his looks at all. But Miss Valence seems very bright and
      charming; it is not her fault if nobody calls at such an ogre's castle as Falside. I daresay
      she does not know what people think. Although,' continued the Countess in a wise tone, 'what
      people think is often as silly as can be. I know I wish there were not always a servant behind
      one to spoil things. If I were Miss Valence I should enjoy riding about where I pleased, and
      doing what I liked.' She spoke with conviction, the lawless creature!</p>
<p>The beginning of this little speech was more persuasive than the end. Lord Trelingham smiled
      at the first words, and did not attend to the last.</p>
<p>'I incline to think,' he said, with a benignant glance at his daughter, 'that your cousin is
      not altogether wrong. It might be a kindness to Miss Valence, alone and unfriended as she
      seems to be, if
      <pb/> you made her acquaintance. You could help her to understand what is expected of a young
      lady in her position, and perhaps put an end to the isolation in which she lives. What do you
      say, my dear?'</p>
<p>Lady May was still reflecting on the odd circumstance that Rupert should have dined at
      Falside. She did not answer immediately. Her affection for the artist had not yet been
      quickened by jealousy. But she disliked the thought of Hippolyta intervening at that moment.
      Why could fortune not have waited till Rupert had taken the decisive step? It was a most
      undesirable incident. If she declined to call on Miss Valence, she must remain in the dark
      about her so long as Rupert hesitated. There might, of course, be no feelings on either side;
      but still— She must gain time to think. 'Would not Colonel Valence make a difficulty?' she
      inquired by way of answering her father.</p>
<p>'No difficulty to me,' said the Earl. 'I have long resolved that if he or his came with
      overtures of reconciliation I would meet them half way. There are reasons why I could do no
      other. Lady Alice's fortune is still in my trust. If she left no children, it should go to her
      husband.'</p>
<p>Rupert, who had reasons on his side to encourage the intimacy, threw in a word. 'I believe
      Colonel Valence leaves his daughter free to choose her friends. She said expressly that he
      would not be displeased at her sending the message I have had the honour to convey.'</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<p>'That is strange,' said the Earl. 'I should be glad to think it implied kindlier feelings on
      his part. But since he said so, you may be sure he meant it. Valence always knew his own
      mind.'</p>
<p>Nothing more was said just then. A few days passed; and Rupert, still in a dream which was
      so vivid and absorbing that he hardly wanted to see Hippolyta, went silently to and fro in the
      Park or spent hours by the sea, his imagination busy on the designs which must be prepared for
      the Great Hall, his heart musing on its own happiness and inspiring his genius with ever fresh
      lights. He said little or nothing; but the watchful eye of his hostess caught him smiling
      often, fantastically, like Malvolio, whom, as I have remarked, most infatuated lovers resemble
      in their gestures. The change, unobserved by others, could not escape Lady May; but the
      meaning of it was beyond her. Rupert never uttered Miss Valence's name. Now that the
       <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> in the picture-gallery had come to an end, these two seldom saw one
      another alone, and at no time for more than a few seconds. While others were present Rupert
      stayed; when they went he found a pretext for leaving the room. All this he did unconsciously,
      not being quite awake. The question whether he had done Lady May a wrong was one that, after
      the drive from Falside, ceased to trouble him. The truth is that he scarcely thought of her at
      all. Years of absence could not have made a wider gulf between them than the hours he had
      passed with Hippolyta,
      <pb n="11"/> or in thinking about her since their meeting. He looked neither before nor after.
      He did not even reflect on the difficulties which might arise should Lady May call on
      Hippolyta and the innocent Amazon gave an account of her visit to the Hermitage. She was
      capable of it; but Rupert never heeded.</p>
<p>Fortune favoured him, more perhaps than he deserved. The next time he rowed to the chalet
      Ivor was at home. Our philosopher had fallen into a habit of spending almost every day by
      himself, and appeared at Trelingham merely for dinner, being occupied, as he said, in the work
      which Rupert had given him. Imagine the consternation of the latter when his friend said to
      him, 'By the bye, an extraordinary thing happened here not long ago.'</p>
<p>'What sort of thing?' said Rupert, looking up from the couch where he lounged away his time
      on these visits. He was alarmed and nervous at what might be coming.</p>
<p>'Well, I should call it a ghostly visitation,' replied Ivor. 'Do you remember that afternoon
      you wandered across the moor and got to Falside?'</p>
<p>'Of course I do,' said Rupert impatiently; 'but do go on. That has nothing to do with your
      story, has it?'</p>
<p>'Nothing; only it fixes the date. I did not return to the Hermitage that evening, as it was
      midnight when you came home and the notion of walking through the mist was anything but
      agreeable. I slept in my old room, next to yours. Some little
      <pb n="12"/> matters kept me till the afternoon; but I had made up my mind to come back, if
      only for a short spell, as I had been a whole forty-eight hours in the society of human
      creatures. So I rowed over about three o'clock. The result was a series of surprises. First,
      and most extraordinary of all, I found the coracle from the other side lying at the
      steps.'</p>
<p>'Do you mean,' said Rupert, who felt he must make an effort, 'that you found it in the
      boathouse on the Trelingham side?'</p>
<p>'No; here at the steps, I tell you. It was most extraordinary. It could not have moored
      itself; and I ran into the house, expecting to see a visitor, little as I knew who it could
      be. There was no visitor, although I looked everywhere. If any one came in the coracle he must
      have flown away again, using wings instead of oars, for there was the boat, and there was not
      he.'</p>
<p>'A ghost, surely,' cried the other young man, laughing a forced laugh. He remembered his
      stupidity, and anathematised himself for leaving the coracle behind.</p>
<p>'But was that all?' resumed he, after his laugh was out. 'You talked of surprises.'</p>
<p>'I did,' said Ivor. 'Look at this;' and to Rupert's horror and delight he held up a
      riding-glove which must have been Hippolyta's. 'I found it on the chair by the door.'</p>
<p>'Let me see it,' said the arch-hypocrite. He took it in his hand. Ah, how much greater was
      the
      <pb n="13"/> mesmeric influence of this poor dead thing than of all the lightnings that shot
      from the eyes of Lady May! 'Go on,' he murmured dreamily.</p>
<p>'Go on,' echoed Ivor; 'that is all very fine, my dear boy. But what am I to think of finding
      a glove here?'</p>
<p>'That it was lost by an angel,' said Rupert, still in a trance.</p>
<p>'I don't think it can have been an angel,' answered his friend laughingly; 'at all events,
      it was not an angel out of the Christian heaven, for it brought me a message from quite
      another quarter.'</p>
<p>'Brought you a message? Never!' cried Glanville, now thoroughly awake and starting to his
      feet. Could Hippolyta be in communication with his friend? Impossible!</p>
<p>'But it did, all the same; and that is why my time has been so taken up. I must leave
      Trelingham in a few days.'</p>
<p>'You don't mean that this glove,' Rupert held it tighter as he spoke, 'has to do with your
      leaving Trelingham.'</p>
<p>'No; but this piece of paper has.' Ivor, from the table where he was sitting, took up a
      folded half-sheet of note-paper and held it out. Glanville scanned it eagerly, but could make
      nothing of it. He turned it upside down with no better result. 'Is it Russian?' he said, 'or
      what? I never saw letters formed like these, if letters they are.'</p>
<p>'It is a cypher,' replied Mardol, 'and tells me I
      <pb n="14"/> must go to London on business.' He looked serious and somewhat downcast.</p>
<p>'I can guess the sort of business,' said the artist; 'but of course I will not ask you about
      it. Poor Ivor! are you still convinced that you are in the right way?'</p>
<p>'Utterly convinced,' replied he; 'nor is it that which troubles me. But I do not like to
      leave you so suddenly and with such little prospect of returning.'</p>
<p>'Shall you be absent long?' inquired his friend, feeling sad and yet relieved at the turn
      things were taking. If it was this errand which brought Hippolyta to the chalet she would not
      mention it to Lady May.</p>
<p>'I do not know how long. But I daresay several months. You will have to do without me in the
      Great Hall.'</p>
<p>'And if I want you?' asked his friend. 'You know how miserable I am when you vanish out of
      sight in this fashion.'</p>
<p>'Write to Grafton Place. One of my working friends will forward my letters.'</p>
<p>'It seems to me,' said Rupert, somewhat bitterly, 'that you trust your working friend more
      than you do this brother of yours. Why not give me an address where my letters could at once
      reach you?'</p>
<p>'Rupert, how can you say so?' cried the other, coming up to him and putting his hand on his
      shoulder. 'You know that in comparison with you I have no friend. This is a matter of duty or
      <pb n="15"/> discipline, not of affection. I do not belong to myself. When I am summoned I
      must go. I shall have no fixed address; in any case I am bound to secrecy.'</p>
<p>'Well, old fellow, I wish you well out of it,' said his friend. 'You ought to belong to
      yourself; and as for the secrecy which you have promised, it can bode little good to any one.
      But you must do what you think right.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' replied Ivor, 'I partly agree with you. But I have promised and there's an end on't.
      What excites my curiosity, however, is the way in which this notice came. I saw, on entering,
      that my books were not in their usual places, and on looking round I discovered a volume of
      poetry on the table with this paper showing out of it. Had I not been so hasty in coming in, I
      might have known there was a message by the marks on the front-door. You look surprised. But
      they are rubbed out now, and I don't mind telling you that we find it useful to adopt such
      signals—borrowed, I suppose, from the gipsies. But still, I cannot account for the messenger's
      getting away.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps he had two boats,' said Rupert, 'and left the coracle to draw your attention.' He
      could not help laughing as he spoke at the thought of trying to mislead Ivor. The fatal
      effects of love! He was aware that the relations between Colonel Valence and Lord Trelingham
      had never been discussed before his friend. Ivor did not know the story of the
      <pb n="16"/> Madonna of San Lucar except in general outline, nor until the adventure on the
      moor had Miss Valence been mentioned. Thus if the young man departed immediately he might
      never know who had left the missive on his table. Rupert felt certain it was Hippolyta. Her
      bold visit was now explained; and the circumstance that she had held a book in her hand when
      she received him so calmly was decisive. He would have liked to ask whether his friend knew
      the Valences or anything about them. But it was part of their silent compact never to indulge
      in personal questions which might involve deceit on Ivor's part. Rupert was in the dark, not
      as to his friend's convictions, but as to the extent to which they implicated him in dangerous
      designs. That Ivor would not countenance assassination he felt sure. But there his knowledge
      ended. So now he did not dare to mention Colonel Valence or his daughter. But Ivor was
      speaking.</p>
<p>'Bring two boats and leave one; that is an original idea,' he exclaimed; 'it would not be
      unlike the strange being from whom this comes.'</p>
<p>'Then you know the writing?' said Glanville.</p>
<p>'I know it,' replied the other quietly; 'but I do not know the glove, which ought to be
      destroyed.' He put forth his unmerciful hand while speaking, and, to Rupert's poignant grief,
      took the beloved object away. To protest would have been in vain. With sorrowful eyes the
      worshipper of Hippolyta beheld her divine glove (is it not so the poets call it?) weighted
      with
      <pb n="17"/> a stone and flung into the mere. A ripple on the waters showed where it had gone
      down, and for half a minute Rupert detested his bosom-friend. But, wise even in despair, he
      held his peace; and the adored name of Hippolyta escaped not the hedge of his teeth. Ivor, as
      though he had accomplished a sacred duty, turned the conversation to other things; and his
      friend when he grew calm believed that the peril on that side was past.</p>
<p>How did it stand on the other, which was Lady May's? When in the evening he returned to
      Trelingham one of the first to greet him was the Countess Lutenieff, and she did so in the
      triumphant words, 'We have called on Miss Valence.' The young man's heart beat fast. He
      thought it was the Countess's doing, and he did not know whether to feel grateful or the
      reverse. He wished the acquaintance had begun under better auspices. But he was mistaken. Not
      Karina, but Lady May had proposed to drive over in the afternoon to Falside. This was the
      outcome of her painful meditations. She would see with her own eyes and hear with her own
      ears. To linger in suspense was intolerable; it was, indeed, killing her, as she said with the
      exaggerated language of passion for which, in this instance, ground was not wholly wanting.
      Once having resolved on the visit, she was restless till it had taken place. To her fevered
      spirit even the hours occupied in driving to Falside seemed an age. It was a delightfully
      still afternoon, with that serious unruffled calm over earth
      <pb n="18"/> and sea which has the solemnity though not the bitterness of a farewell to things
      mortal. The trees were bare, the long lanes dry and leafless, the country silent as they drove
      through it. Lady May, addressing no word to her cousin, sat upright in her furs and looked
      eagerly onward, as though to quicken the pace at which they were moving. She would have given
      much to be tranquil, but it was not in her nature; and when the carriage turned at the steep
      entrance to Falside, she almost wished that she had never undertaken this trying visit. Could
      any good come of it? But self-control was too much a habit of her life to be shaken even by a
      meeting with the woman on whose attractiveness or the want of it her future perhaps depended;
      and only the sharpened attention of Karina could perceive that in shaking hands with Hippolyta
      she was inwardly agitated.</p>
<p>The supreme powers, indeed, had so ordered it that their first encounter was agreeable. Lady
      May acquitted herself of a delicate task with grace and courtesy, while the quiet spirit of
      the afternoon seemed to have passed into Hippolyta. Unaffectedly surprised and pleased with
      Lady May's kindness, she was not so much the spirited maiden who feared neither to ride alone
      nor to preside at the dinner-table when her father gathered round it his miscellaneous guests,
      as the child who is all shyness and gratitude in return for a token of love. With charming
      simplicity she did the honours of Falside; and
      <pb n="19"/> while not apologising for anything in their way of life, she spoke as if taking
      for granted the peculiarities in her bringing-up and in Colonel Valence's history, which would
      explain whatever might seem strange. There was not a turn in her speech nor a trace in her
      bearing that could be deemed unfeminine. The Countess was particularly struck with her; she
      was so elegantly dressed and looked so beautiful in the shades of colour she had chosen that
      all idea of a female revolutionist vanished from Karina's mind. If she was leaned, she kept it
      to herself; if unbelieving, as people said, she was certainly not aggressive. Her natural
      delight on receiving them gained her visitors in no long time, so that a stranger coming in
      might have taken them for old established callers.</p>
<p>And, pray, what did they talk about? You may well ask, for it was a curiously intimate yet
      strictly defined conversation. Subjects there were in the minds of all three which, though
      constantly suggesting themselves, could not be handled. Lady May found it wisest, as it was
      most natural, to begin with the occurrence that had given occasion to their meeting—Rupert's
      adventure on the moor. Had the gentleman himself been in company he would have praised
      Hippolyta's discretion—it was equal to her other adorable virtues. For when, by the tenor of
      Lady May's discourse, it was evident that he had said nothing at Trelingham of their meeting
      in the morning, she fell in with Rupert's policy and said as little. This was not because Miss
      Valence deemed
      <pb n="20"/> her conduct unmaidenly; the thought never entered her mind. But if Rupert had not
      spoken, there was no reason why she should speak. She allowed the story to begin where he told
      it; and keenly as her visitors examined her countenance while she inquired about him, neither
      the Countess nor Lady May perceived a change in its exquisite calm or noted in her voice the
      tremulousness that is born of love. The Earl's daughter began to feel happier; and her cousin,
      in whose fertile mind a certain plan had been ripening, had to brush away a sense of
      disappointment when it appeared that Rupert Glanville excited no more interest at Falside than
      a young man may to whom one has given shelter from the rain. Hippolyta knew nothing of his
      pictures, and could ask about them in a steady voice. Then she passed to a more important
      topic,—her own isolation, necessitated, in great measure, by the wandering life of Colonel
      Valence and the principles on which he regulated his household. It was impossible, she said
      with a smile, to receive friends who could not forego the convenience of servants, or who
      would be shocked by seeing their hostess performing what they might deem menial offices. Nor
      did she complain of her exclusion from the world. She was not without interests; she had
      travelled with her parents in many parts of Europe; and she had books and a horse. All she
      wanted besides—she hesitated, and looked in a pleading, affectionate way from one lady to the
      other—was a friend or two of her own sex, who
      <pb n="21"/> might remind her that there were other things as sweet and precious as the
      service in which she was engaged. Especially, she went on, it had been her desire to know a
      little of Lady May, to be allowed sometimes to talk with her, and, sooner or later, to help
      towards healing the feud which had lasted so many years. It was daring, on her part, to make
      the request which Rupert had conveyed. 'But,' she said, 'you would not blame a poor sailor who
      was cast away on a desert island for putting up his torn handkerchief as a signal to any ship
      that came in sight. I had no other way.'</p>
<p>All this was said with extreme modesty and a charm of manner which Lady May had been far
      from anticipating. Hippolyta's strange beauty dazzled her; while the combination of
      self-respect with straightforward feeling which appeared in all she spoke, made it impossible
      to set her down as the unwomanly creature she was deemed in the neighbourhood. She asked for
      affection. Could it be refused? But while Lady May was reasoning, the Countess had decided.
      With her birdlike lightness she had flown to Hippolyta, and, kissing her on the cheek, cried
      out, 'My dear, you are perfectly charming. You may reckon upon us as your friends as long as
      we live. What a pity we did not begin earlier; but we must make up for lost time, and consider
      that we have been friends these five years.' Hippolyta returned her embrace, saying in a low,
      earnest voice, 'How kind this is of you!' But she
      <pb n="22"/> still kept her eyes on Lady May, as though the Countess's affection by itself
      would not suffice. The Earl's daughter had gone too far to draw back. Neither was she disposed
      to feel uneasy, as before their meeting. She put out her hand and took Hippolyta's with a firm
      grasp, while she said, 'My dear Miss Valence, I am not much given to making promises, and the
      Countess knows that I have but few intimate friends. But you may always reckon upon me; and I
      will do my best to bring about the reconciliation you have at heart. Will you come one of
      these days and see my father? He will be so glad to see you.'</p>
<p>'Oh,' said Hippolyta, 'these are words to make one happy. I have so wished to speak with
      Lord Trelingham. I will come whenever you please; and you may be sure that in doing so I have
      my father's consent. I did not press him at all. He gave it of his own accord.'</p>
<p>On this understanding they parted. Hippolyta promised that she would come to Trelingham for
      a long day, as soon as her household affairs permitted; and Lady May renewed her assurances
      that she should be received by the Earl with cordiality. At the gate, to which she accompanied
      them, Hippolyta underwent a second embrace from Madame de Lutenieff, and again shook hands
      with the less demonstrative of her visitors. She saw them off, and walked back with thoughtful
      steps and slow along the terrace, listening to her waterfall as it
      <pb n="23"/> leapt merrily down the rocks. Much had been done, but much remained to do. Her
      purpose in soliciting Lady May's friendship was indeed simply to end the long disagreement
      between the families. She could not comprehend her father's motive in keeping it up, unless
      that he fancied the Earl unwilling to be reconciled. But the Earl had relented, according to
      Lady May; and why should Colonel Valence not do the same? Their political differences were not
      to the point; they never had met, nor were likely to meet, on this ground. For if Lord
      Trelingham was a Tory of the purest type, her father represented a programme which at that
      date no English party would have dreamt of adopting. He despised the politics of the
      polling-booth, and would have begun his reform by abolishing not only the Crown, but the
      Houses of Parliament with it. She knew that the two men could never again be friends; why,
      however, should they continue to be enemies? The waters kept falling with their pleasant
      ripple, and Hippolyta roamed about her garden till sundown.</p>
