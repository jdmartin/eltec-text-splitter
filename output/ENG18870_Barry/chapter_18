<head>CHAPTER XVIII THE CELTIC KING ARTHUR</head>
<p>So these two, opening the gates of Elysium, went down into its heathery dells and
      fresh green woodlands side by side. They had found one another amid the wastes of the world,
      and might ramble where it pleased them in a golden dream. They loved with the ardour of youth
      and the intensity of exceptional natures. Hippolyta's strange education had kept her innocent
      of the thousand artificialities which too often spoil the best of women, making them helpless,
      sentimental, or false, when they desire to be brave and true. She was the most loyal of human
      beings; her temperament was steeped in poetry, and the sweet impulses of the heart gave her
      slightest words a fascination. But where she loved she could not be sentimental; and
      Glanville, who had sometimes felt wearied with Lady May's —how shall I call it?—too great
      effusiveness, was delighted with a companion at once so charming
      <pb n="75"/> and so sensible. She told him much of her earlier life and her father's character
      and principles. To Rupert Colonel Valence seemed an enigma. He did not comprehend how a man
      who had professed such a hopeless creed as he had gathered from the Colonel's lips in the
      churchyard at their first and only meeting could spend his life in forwarding Utopian schemes.
      But Hippolyta, when this difficulty was urged, had much to say in explanation. 'My father,'
      she remarked, 'does take a sad view of existence. He thinks the forces of Nature are terrible
      and often malignant. To struggle against them, he says, would be as foolish as attempting to
      sweep the stars out of the sky. They are high above us, and we cannot reach them, though their
      influence shapes our destinies. But he will not allow that human misgovernment, or the
      ignorance of an oppressed multitude, or the distinctions of ranks and birth, are among the
      forces of Nature. When we come to that Utopia which you wise men of the world scorn' —she
      laughed and looked at Glanville, who was delighted to be so mocked—'we shall still be face to
      face with the terrible unknown powers that we can neither control nor appease. So my father
      says. But is that any reason, he asks, why we should tolerate kings and kaisers? Thus he
      combines the deep melancholy, which seems to grow upon him every year, with a burning zeal and
      such incessant activity as will not suffer him to stay at home. I feel it, but I would not
      hinder him from being noble.
      <pb n="76"/> My husband, when I have one, must be father and mother too. Will he, Rupert,
      think you?'</p>
<p>I need not chronicle Rupert's answer. He was willing that the Colonel should be always
      absent if they might be together. And they were, sometimes with no third to lessen their
      happiness, but oftenest in the company of their friends at Trelingham. One day, in particular,
      about a month after their engagement, Rupert, who spent many hours in the chalet working at
      his designs, begged Lady May and the rest of them to pay him a visit and see what he had done.
      The 'rest of them' included Hippolyta, who now often dined at Trelingham, and occupied the
      room which her kind host insisted on calling hers, and which was kept for her use whether she
      came or no.</p>
<p>It was a morning in March, but that mild climate turns March to April, and the promise of
      spring was in the air, filling it with dewy freshness. The party was larger than usual, and
      included not only the three ladies, but the Earl himself, Tom Davenant, and the learned Mr.
      Truscombe, clergyman of the parish, whose devotion to King Arthur had nearly sent Glanville
      home at the beginning of our story. The naval expedition which crossed the mere consisted of
      two comfortable skiffs and an outrigger for Tom Davenant; and luncheon was to be served in the
      chalet at the close of the exhibition. Glanville had expressly invited Mr. Truscombe. They
      were very good friends, and, though wide as the poles
      <pb n="77"/> asunder on all other subjects, had, as we know, various thoughts in common
      regarding their hero.</p>
<p>'I must confess,' said Mr. Truscombe, as they stood before the drawings, 'that I have never
      had patience with the ultra-sceptics who look upon King Arthur as a myth: '"That gray king,
      whose name, a ghost, Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain-peak," as one of their
      poets describes him. In my two volumes may be seen documents which prove not merely that he
      lived, but when he was born, how long he reigned over Britain, and the approximate dates of
      his twelve great battles with the heathen from over sea, together with fragments of the laws
      he enacted at Camelot, London, and York. As well, on the strength of poetical confusion in the
      Song of Roland, deny that Charles the Great existed as, on a like ground in the Morte d'Arthur
      and similar epic treatments of our subject, refuse to believe that Arthur was one of our most
      valiant monarchs.'</p>
<p>Glanville listened to the worthy man in respectful silence; and when he had concluded took
      up his parable.</p>
<p>'You and I, dear sir,' he said, 'are of one mind as to the essential point, which is that a
      medieval writer, like Sir Thomas Malory, could understand, and therefore could truly
      represent, no age but his own. The art of seeing through the eyes of a dead or distant
      generation was born, one may say, yesterday. It is only the modern artist or historian that
      can
      <pb n="78"/> picture King Arthur in his habit as he lived and the world which he dwelt in.
      Suppose him to be a real personage of the fifth or sixth century—'</p>
<p>'No need to suppose, my good sir,' interrupted Mr. Truscombe; 'I have proved abundantly that
      he cannot have been born later than—'</p>
<p>'Quite so,' said Glanville; 'I accept your data and do not discuss them. For me, as an
      artist, the question is how, if such a man existed, did he appear to the eye, what type of
      race did he belong to, of what species was his military apparel, his camp, his court? On such
      points, I contend, the writers upon chivalry are unsafe, or rather impossible, guides. They
      knew nothing of the ages that went before them. Fancy one of Arthur's knights being described
      as a near relation, cousin in some degree—I forget which—of Joseph of Arimathea!'</p>
<p>The company was disposed to laugh, but not so Mr. Truscombe. 'Ah, there,' he said, 'they may
      well have been in the right. For Joseph of Arimathea came to Glastonbury about twenty years,
      as I calculate, after the Ascension; and as he may have married in Britain—'</p>
<p>Glanville, who saw that he was on the very edge of an abyss into which next moment the
      erudite but fantastic Mr. Truscombe would drag him down, hastened to save himself by timely
      admissions.</p>
<p>'Yes,' he said, 'yes. I am sure you have made your calculations with admirable care, and I
      have not a word to say against Joseph of Arimathea or
      <pb n="79"/> Glastonbury. All I meant was that the elements, the necessary ingredients of a
      sixth century epic must be of quite a different cast from those which were taken after the
      Crusades to construct the legend—I would say the cycle—of Arthur.'</p>
<p>'And what do you suppose the true elements to be?' inquired Hippolyta, who was interested
      and forgot her timidity while she was speaking. But she knew her face was burning when she had
      got the words out of her mouth.</p>
<p>'Look at these drawings,' replied Glanville; 'I think you will perceive in them a glimmering
      of my idea. I do not pretend, however, to minute learning; and I am willing to go one mile
      even with Sir Thomas Malory, if I am not compelled to go twain. I agree, for instance, that
      historical reproduction is not the same thing as archæology. But there is a middle way between
      the realism we cannot hope to achieve and a caricature, if I may term it so, borrowed chiefly
      from what we see around us—from the stark, staring present—and given out as an image of the
      past. Nor, again, do I say that you may not, if you have genius like Mr. Tennyson, array these
      old-world stories in the garb of our century; but then they cease to be epic or historical,
      and become fables with a moral running through them. One kind of reality or inspiration they
      lose to assume another, and I have no quarrel with such a transformation.'</p>
<p>'But I have,' said Mr. Truscombe in his deep voice; 'it is tampering with holy things. The
      man
      <pb n="80"/> who moralises King Arthur into a fable will perhaps have as little respect for
      King David.'</p>
<p>'Anyhow,' Glanville went on, 'if the House of Trelingham is to be represented as descending
      from Uther Pendragon, it will never serve to paint on these walls the fancies of the late
      middle age. Now, I conceive that the older epic is the more truly poetical. It has less
      monotony; it does not give you ever-recurring adventures of a similar type, castles all built
      on one plan, enamelled meadows with a fountain in the middle of them, tournaments so much
      alike that to describe one is to know all, and a small company of actors which may be reduced
      to a knight, a damsel in distress, a villainous dwarf, and Merlin the Enchanter. I feel the
      exquisite pathos of certain incidents and the grandeur of certain quests. But none of these
      things need be discarded, and much may be gained for poetry, if we fill them with the rude,
      tumultuous warrior life, and light this up again with the gleam of a declining or a nascent
      civilisation such as did, in fact, shed a terror and a glory over the Arthurian period. But,
      really, I am making a speech. It will be pleasanter, perhaps, to see what I have endeavoured
      to design.'</p>
<p>'Yes, but you can go on talking,' said the Countess. 'I know a little of the older poetry,
      which I began to read during those terrible long nights in Russia when we sat as still as
      mice, not having a word to say or anything to amuse ourselves with except cards, which I
      hated. And I do like the ballads and those
      <pb n="81"/> strange old German stories, much better than the <hi>Idylls of the King</hi> .
      They are so wild, they make the blood freeze in your veins with horror and then hot with a
      kind of war-dance. You know the tales I mean,' she said, speaking to Lady May; 'the Nibelung
      stories and those gruesome ballads about swan's wings dropping blood.'</p>
<p>'Upon my word,' answered Lady May, 'you will give your friends a delightful idea of your
      character if these are the things that please you.'</p>
<p>'I understand Madame de Lutenieff,' said the artist, 'and I am glad to see that she
      understands me. The battle for Britain between Saxon and Cymri cannot have been child's play.
      It was "sword-play" rather, and "shield lightnings," to quote a metaphor of the latest
      singers. There ought to be the feeling of an everlasting struggle in pictures of the time.
      Again, there is the extraordinary combination of Roman customs inherited during their stay in
      Britain with the ancient habits and traditions which existed before their arrival and lasted
      when they were gone. The Romans, the Cymri, the Saxons—add to these the Celts who brought over
      sea other legends, other manners,—allied to those of their British cousins, yet not the
      same,—and arts, like that of working in fine gold and colours, which have never been
      indigenous within the four corners of this island. I daresay I am using terms rather loosely,
      and Mr. Truscombe will set me right. But such has been my notion,—the cycle of Arthur is of a
      more elemental period than
      <pb n="82"/> that in which it became famous, and the colours in which it is usually painted
      are not its own. The legends of Ossian and Cuchullain have more to say to it than Boiardo; it
      is partly Roman, but more than all it is Celtic, in its dim enchantments, its fury of hopeless
      battle, its almost feminine tenderness of friendship, its fainting passion, its religious
      ardours, all at length vanishing in defeat, and being found no more.'</p>
<p>Mr. Truscombe was somewhat too literal to follow the artist, and would now have been glad to
      ask whether he believed in a real King Arthur or held him to be a coinage of the brain. But,
      somehow, Glanville's eloquence daunted the antiquarian. He was fain, therefore, to take up the
      nearest of the drawings, which represented a pirate ship disembarking its mailed hordes, and
      to put a few searching questions on the subject of chain armour, regarding which he was the
      first authority in Europe. Glanville replied; and the others looked at his designs.</p>
<p>On so genial a day, when the sun was bright and warm, indoors and out seemed equally
      alluring. The party scattered,—some remaining in the study to discuss the drawings point by
      point, others lingering about the verandah, or going down to the boats and paddling round the
      chalet, which on every side presented a different but agreeable aspect. While they were thus
      occupied Rupert invited Hippolyta to ascend the watch-tower. She looked round for a companion,
      but every one was busy, and she ran gaily
      <pb n="83"/> up the stairs with him. The watch-tower was empty, and the great window gave a
      delightful view of the long gorge with its waving woods, the meandering silver thread which
      marked the course of the Yale, and the clear-shining waters with a circle of clouds above them
      which closed in the scene. Side by side Rupert and Hippolyta stood, without uttering a word,
      in that most intimate of companionships which would be lessened, not added to, by speaking.
      Their cup was full, was brimming over. Happiness had come to them and seemed willing to stay.
      The breeze which fanned their cheeks, the light which rested lovingly upon their heads and
      appeared to caress them, was intoxication enough. They could have remained silent thus and
      lost in a delicious sense of their nearness to one another had not some movement on the waters
      below them broken the spell. It was only Tom Davenant mooring his outrigger at the steps.
      Glanville smiled, and, as if remembering the purpose that had brought him, went to a chest of
      drawers in the room, and taking thence a square sheet of paper, as it would seem, returned to
      Hippolyta and held it before her. The young lady looked, drew back a little to see the object
      more clearly, and took it in her hand with an exclamation of delight. 'Oh Rupert,' she cried,
      'when did you paint this?'</p>
<p>He laughed mischievously. 'If you speak so loud what will become of your precious secret,
      Hippolyta?'</p>
<p>'True,' she said in a lower tone; 'but I am so astonished. How could you recollect me in my
      <pb n="84"/> riding-habit, and paint it all from memory. For you never saw me in this attitude
      but once.'</p>
<p>'How could I recollect? Ask rather how I could forget. I saw you day and night as you stood
      in the room downstairs, your head turned expectantly towards the door and a book in your hand.
      You pretended to be afraid, but your eyes did not look it. Oh, it was easy enough to paint, I
      can assure you, Hippolyta.'</p>
<p>'Hush, you mustn't say Hippolyta,' she whispered, 'and keep your distance, sir. Yes, it is
      beautifully done. But where are my riding-gloves? I don't look complete without them.'</p>
<p>'They were lying on a chair when I came in and disturbed you. Then you took them up,
      intending to go. But you left one of them behind, all the same.'</p>
<p>'Did I, indeed?' she said, with great calmness. 'And I suppose you found it. You must
      restore it, please.' She was laughing to herself slightly.</p>
<p>'I wish I had found it,' said Glanville pettishly, 'but it fell to the lot of Ivor Mardol to
      do that; and the wretch threw it into the mere.'</p>
<p>Hippolyta became interested. 'How do you know he found it?' she asked.</p>
<p>'Because he showed it me. I held it for two or three minutes. Then he took it away again,
      and said it ought to be destroyed.'</p>
<p>'Did he say anything else?'</p>
<p>'I don't think he said, but he implied that a message had come with the glove.'</p>
<pb n="85"/>
<p>When Hippolyta heard these words she became very quiet. She was thinking whether to leave
      matters as they stood, or explain them to Rupert. When she had made up her mind she said, with
      her eyes fixed on her own portrait, 'And you told him who had brought the message?'</p>
<p>'I told him nothing,' answered Rupert. 'I had not your permission. Moreover, it was no
      concern of mine. There are subjects on which Ivor and I have agreed that confidence between us
      would be impossible, and we are the best of friends notwithstanding.'</p>
<p>'Well,' she said, 'that is right, and only what I should expect from both of you. I do not
      know Mr. Mardol except by your report, though of course I knew his name when I came here that
      morning. I have never seen him. But I may, without breach of orders, tell you what concerns
      myself. I remember saying that my visit was due to curiosity— and, in fact, it was. I had a
      message to give your friend of great, though to me unknown, import. Nor could I entrust it to
      another, or present myself at Trelingham. In this difficulty I forget who told me that Mr.
      Mardol had taken up his abode in the chalet, which I had often seen from the heights over
      there, but had never entered. The thought occurred to me that I had better make an attempt to
      see him here. I was curious about the place, for, as perhaps I told you, my father used to be
      its regular tenant when he was a young man. Whether I saw Mr.
      <pb n="86"/> Mardol was of no consequence. I could make pretty sure that he would receive my
      message once I was able to get into his study. I came to the water's edge, examined the state
      of the rooms by means of a pocket telescope I carried with me, and arrived at the conclusion
      that there was no one at home. I determined to hazard it, and rowed across, being afraid only
      that somebody might come from the other side and catch me before I disembarked. However,
      nothing of the sort happened. I ventured in, left my message in such a way that it could not
      be overlooked, and went, somewhat timidly I confess, into the remaining rooms, like
      Bluebeard's wife when her husband was gone out. I little expected that Bluebeard would return
      from my side of the water; and I was more alarmed than you think when I saw you. Did you
      notice any gesture I made as you opened the door?'</p>
<p>'No,' said Glanville; 'I was too much taken aback to notice anything, except that you were
      the most lovely woman I had ever set eyes on.'</p>
<p>'Quiet, quiet,' she answered. 'No, I soon perceived you could not be the person of whom I
      was in quest, or you would have given me the countersign. Dear me,' she went on meditatively,
      'when my father joined the movement if any one had talked to a stranger,—and you are a
      stranger, you know—.' He held up his hand, as if to threaten her, but she motioned him to keep
      still, and continued, 'Talked, I say, of signs and countersigns, he would have been
      <pb n="87"/> judged a traitor and punished as he deserved. But now we are coming more and more
      into the open; there will soon be little secrecy left.'</p>
<p>They heard Tom Davenant calling Rupert. 'The Earl wants you,' he said, as they came
      downstairs. 'I think there is some plan afoot about your drawings and my birthday, though the
      two things haven't much connection, one would think. It is all the Countess's doing. I wish
      she would let it alone. She is too clever by half.'</p>
<p>On entering the studio they found the party collected round Rupert's drawings, and Madame de
      Lutenieff in earnest conversation with her cousin. She at once came to the artist, and with
      enthusiasm in her accents said to him, 'Oh, Mr. Glanville, I do so hope you will take my side.
      I am sure as a painter you ought.'</p>
<p>'I shall have the greatest pleasure in doing so,' he answered gallantly, 'as soon as I know
      what the discussion is about. But Mr. Davenant has left that for you to tell.'</p>
<p>'Mr. Davenant never comes to my help in anything,' she said, with a reproachful look at that
      young man, who instead of attending to her was considering the signs of the times, so far as
      they could be studied from the window in front of him.</p>
<p>'I don't see the good of a dress ball,' said Tom, without looking round. 'Why cannot people
      dance in their ordinary clothes and not make themselves into a museum of curiosities? Fancy me
      got up like
      <pb n="88"/> your Launcelots and your Percivals, or whatever you call them! They look absurd
      enough on a stage, but in a ballroom where you know who the fellows are they look twenty times
      more ridiculous.'</p>
<p>'But then,' said Lady May, 'you profess to hate dancing altogether and you don't want to
      keep your birthday, so you are out of court. This is the case,' she continued, addressing
      Glanville: 'my Cousin Karina was struck with the <hi>ensemble</hi> , to use her own term, of
      your designs, and thought they would fall into admirable groups if we could get people to
      dress up to them. She is very fond of dancing,— are you not, Karina?' The Countess made a
      gesture of delight, but would not interrupt Lady May, who went on to explain that among the
      festivities to celebrate Mr. Davenant's majority—she looked at Tom as she spoke—a dress ball
      would do much to enhance the general pleasure, and there was the Great Hall, with its frescoes
      begun, inviting them to illustrate the floor from the walls, so to speak, and to make a grand
       <hi>tableau vivant</hi> of the Arthurian legends. It would be an original and quaint device,
      but without Glanville's aid in designing dresses and sketching the groups it could not be
      carried out. How did it strike him?</p>
<p>Instead of answering like a sensible young man, Rupert turned demurely to Miss Valence and
      inquired what she thought. She laughed, and blushed, but would not reply beyond saying that in
      these matters she had no opinion to give.</p>
<pb n="89"/>
<p>'But Mr. Glanville is quite right,' said the Countess; 'you ought to have an opinion, my
      dear. For you would of course shine in our galaxy that evening.'</p>
<p>'I shine in a galaxy?' said Hippolyta, laughing; 'you forget, Countess, that I have never
      been introduced to society, and should most likely not be admitted if I wished for such a
      thing.'</p>
<p>'Oh, nonsense,' replied Karina; 'you have the most old-fashioned ideas. In the first place,
      there is no such thing as society, in that exclusive sense of the word, now; and in the
      second, it would not matter if there were. Make your <hi>début</hi> at Trelingham, my dear,
      and rely upon it you will find no doors locked afterwards.'</p>
<p>Hippolyta smiled. 'Now that your door is unlocked to me,' she said, addressing Lord
      Trelingham, 'I do not think I mind whether the rest are shut or open.'</p>
<p>'My dear young lady,' said he, taking her hand, 'you will be most welcome if you come to
      this house, either on the occasion my niece has mentioned, or any other. Colonel Valence may
      have renounced society, but that should be no injury to his daughter, and only those would
      raise a question who do not know you.'</p>
<p>'Well, and of course you will come,' said Karina; 'that is all settled. I will be your
      chaperon and— but have you learned dancing?' she asked with comic anxiety.</p>
<pb n="90"/>
<p>Hippolyta answered, 'I am more of a Spanish than an English girl, remember. Did you ever
      hear of one who could not dance, or was not fond of dancing? It is the most exquisite
      enjoyment I know. But, indeed, I have not danced in such fine company as this would be.'</p>
<p>'Never mind,' said the Countess; 'you will probably put us all to shame. However, is it
      decided, and does Mr. Glanville promise his services?'</p>
<p>'Mr. Glanville will promise anything,' replied the infatuated artist. He had never till then
      thought of dancing with Hippolyta. What a heaven of happiness was in store! How admirable of
      the Countess to propose it and of Tom Davenant to come of age just at that time! To get any
      further conversation of a sensible kind from Rupert was for the rest of the day impossible.
      The Countess made her observations; Lady May, whose suspicions had been lulled to sleep, was
      not blind, and began once more to feel the gnawing pangs of jealousy; while Mr. Davenant
      wondered that people should care so much about tiring themselves to death in a hot and crowded
      assembly, and would have given all the balls between now and next year for a good day's
      fishing.</p>
<p>But the dress ball was decided on, and there were to be tableaux representing King Arthur
      and his Table Round.</p>
