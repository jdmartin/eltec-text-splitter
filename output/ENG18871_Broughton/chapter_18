<head rend="center">CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<p>"I AM afraid you must think it very rude of us, leaving you alone on the last evening of your
     visit," says Miss Blessington next day to Esther, as the two girls stand together in
     <pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7385-198"/> the conservatory, picking bits of heliotrope and maidenhair,
     and regardless of the ten and twenty little pots that their long gowns have knocked down; "but,
     you see, it is such a long-standing engagement, and we can so seldom induce Sir Thomas to go to
     a ball, that we really could hardly get out of it."</p>
<p>She speaks politely, with that friendly suavity that one feels on the ultimate and
     penultimate days of their stay to a guest that one is glad to be rid of.</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind me," says Essie, lightly; "I can always amuse myself: and, besides, it will
     be very nearly bedtime by the time you go."</p>
<p>"They intend me to go with them," St. John had said to her overnight, <foreign xml:lang="fr">à propos</foreign> of this ball, "and of course I intend it too; only some prophetic instinct
     tells me that my head will begin to ache prodigiously towards dressing-time. I am half divided
     between that and toothache, only I suppose that the latter necessitates the simulating of acute
     bodily torture, and subjects one to unlimited offers of boiled figs, hopbags, laudanum, and the
     Lord knows what."</p>
<p>Gerard had found his betrothed stubborner than he had expected as to her expressed resolution
     of departure. Looking at the childish roundness of her soft face, at the dewy meekness of her
     heavenly eyes, he had fancied her malleable by his hand, as clay by the potter's; and so, in
     most things, she would have been. In most things, it was to her easier to yield than to
     resist—less trouble—and, besides, it pleased people; but in the one prime passion of her life,
     her love for her brother, you might as well try to move the Tower of London with your finger
     and thumb as to stir her. After half an hour of arguments, persuasions, caresses, St. John is
     constrained vexedly to own to himself that in that young faithful heart <hi>lover</hi>-love
     holds as yet
     <pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7385-199"/> only the second place. The sole concession he could win from
     her was that of one day, the day of the ball.</p>
<p>"We may imagine the clock put on thirty years, and ourselves already in possession," he says,
     laughing—"only minus the gout and wrinkles and spectacles we shall also have come into
     possession of by then."</p>
<milestone rend="stars" unit="section"/>
<p>"What the devil do people mean," says Sir Thomas, entering the morning-room that evening
     after dinner, with his hair brushed up into-a stiff cockatoo, and tugging away at a huge pair
     of white kid gloves, off which he has already succeeded in bursting both buttons, "dragging a
     man away from his own fireside to see a lot of fools cutting capers, and flourishing their
     heels in each other's faces?" </p>
<p>From Sir Thomas's description one would imagine that the Cancan was habitually danced at the
     balls he frequents.</p>
<p>The door opens, and Miss Blessington makes her appearance; looking, not vain or conscious,
     but calmly defiant of any one to make a better—a triumph of lace and tulle and flowers, and
     milk-white flesh, and grand, cold curves and contours.</p>
<p>"Oh, how beautiful!" cries Essie, clasping her little hands, with the unaffected admiration
     of one handsome woman for another. "I know it is rude to make personal remarks; but is not she,
     Lady Gerard?" </p>
<p>"It is a pretty dress," replies miladi, whose unwieldy bulk not even the cunningest of
     Parisian <foreign xml:lang="fr">couturières</foreign> has been able to fashion into anything
     nearer than an approximation to any shape at all; "but I never think that Elise's taste is as
     good as Jane Clarke's used to be."</p>
<p>Constance has walked to a pier-glass, and is examining with anxiety a bite that a gnat has
     been savage enough to inflict on her face, a little under the lower lip, and which
     <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7385-200"/> has been disturbing her wonted composed serenity ever since
     3 P.M., when the catastrophe took place.</p>
<p>"Does it show much?" she asks, turning with a concerned, serious look to Esther.</p>
<p>"Oh no! hardly at all."</p>
<p>"I think I will put a little bit of sticking-plaster on it," she continues, gravely. "It will
     only look like a patch; and patches are always so becoming."</p>
<p>"Let me go and get you a bit!" cries Essie, good-naturedly, running off.</p>
<p>When she returns Sir Thomas is saying, fussily: "Now, why is not that boy dressed ? Always
     the same! Always late! Never in time for anything!"</p>
<p>"He is not coming, Sir Thomas; he has got a headache, and is gone to lie down—at least he
     said so," replies Constance, coldly, but casting a scrutinising glance at Esther (who is
     deftly, with a small pair of scissors, cutting out a little circle of sticking-plaister) as she
     speaks.</p>
<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" cries "that boy's" papa, angrily—"a pack of lies! A fine Miss Molly you
     have made of your son, miladi! He'll be afraid of going out shooting next year for fear of
     getting his feet wet!"</p>
<p>"Is that about the right size " inquires Esther, timidly, raising a pair of guilty pink
     cheeks, and exhibiting the result of her labours on the point of the scissors.</p>
<p>"Good God! miladi, do take that plaguy long tail of yours up! How the devil can I help
     treading on it?"</p>
<p>These are the last sweet words of Sir Thomas, as he follows wife and ward into the carriage.
     They are gone, and Essie sits down in the large empty room to await the resurrection of her
     lover. The sort of shy half-fear which always assails her at his expected approach comes over
     her more strongly than ever. A distant door bangs faintly somewhere about the house; then
     another nearer. " He is
     <pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7385-201"/> coming !" she says to herself, and the quick blood rushes
     tingling to her fingers' ends.</p>
<p>It is a hot night, and the tall French windows stand unshuttered and open. Some impulse of
     timid coquetry urges her to flee from before him: she is ashamed that he should see the plain
     letters of joy written on her face at his coming: she would fain have yet a few moments of the
     happiness of expectancy, to whose delights those of reality are but seldom comparable. From the
     terrace a flight of stone steps leads down, with many a twist, to the mere. In a minute Essie
     has run lightly down, and is standing by the water's edge.</p>
<p>The dahlias are nodding their round drowsy heads, and the sentinel hollyhocks stand up stiff
     and pompous with their clustered flower-spikes—rulers and law-givers among the flower-people;
     the little ripples are biting with playful tooth the low sedge-banks, and the tall bulrush
     forest, whence the coot and the waterhen families sailed out into life in the warm spring
     weather. To and fro rock the heavy, lazy, water-lily leaves, whose bloom-time is past two
     months ago. Through her garden, the sky, the high moon walks stately, holding her silver lamp,
     in whose light all things shine deliciously.</p>
<p>Essie stands entranced. It seems to her like the intermediate residence of some happy soul,
     freed from the world's toil and moil, shrived from sin, emancipated from life, where it should
     dwell in tempered bliss till that last day when heaven's brighter glories, stronger raptures,
     should burst upon and clothe it for aye. She strolls along the narrow gravel path, bathing her
     hands with childish delight in the moonbeams, and then stoops and picks up two or three little
     stones that the night's sweet alchemy has gifted with a bright short glory not their own. So
     stooping, she hears a man's quick firm foot running down the garden
     <pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7385-202"/> steps. She raises herself, and goes to meet him with
      <quote>"a moonlight-coloured smile"</quote> on her face. "Aren't they lovely?" she asks,
     holding up her pebbly treasures for him to look at.</p>
<p>Not speaking, he takes the little pink palm, stones and all, into his hand, and looks into
     her face; and then, as if yielding to a temptation that he hates, that he would fain resist,
     and to which, being over-strong, he must yet succumb, he snatches her to his breast, and kisses
     her fiercely—eyelids, lips, and neck—with a violence he is himself hardly conscious of.</p>
<p>"Stop!" she cries, surprised, half-shocked, pushing him away from her. "What do you mean? You
     frighten me!"</p>
<p>He recollects himself instantly, and releases her. "It <hi>is</hi> alarming being kissed,
     especially when you are not used to it," he answers, with a sneer.</p>
<p>She looks up at him in blank astonishment. Has he gone mad? Is it the moonlight that has
     given him that white wrathy look?</p>
<p>"Something has happened!" she says, quickly. "What is it? tell me!"</p>
<p>"Oh! nothing—a mere bagatelle !" he replies, with a little bitter laugh. "It is only that I
     have been hearing a pleasant piece of news."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Only that an acquaintance of mine is going to be married!"</p>
<p>"Is it an acquaintance of mine too?" </p>
<p>"About the most intimate you have, I should say: yourself, in fact!"</p>
<p>"Is that news ?" she asks, trying to smile. "I am going to be married, am not I, to you?"</p>
<p>"I am not aware that my name is—Brandon," he answers, coldly, while his sorrowful, fierce
     eyes go through her heart like poisoned arrows.</p>
<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7385-203"/>
<p>She turns her head aside and groans. A great vague darkness blots out the broad moon, and the
     stars' thick cohorts; the bright water beside her grows black as hell's sluggish rivers.</p>
<p>He had not known how much he had been buoyed up by hope till that mute gesture of hers bid
     him despair.</p>
<p>"It's true, then?" he asks in a voice of sharp rage and anguish, catching hold of the white
     wonder of her arm, on which his fingers, unwittingly cruel, leave crimson prints.</p>
<p>"Is <hi>what</hi> true?" she asks, faintly, trying for yet a little longer to stave off Fate,
     to push away Nemesis, with her weak woman-fingers.</p>
<p>"That you are—God! am I choking?—engaged to Brandon?" </p>
<p>"I was once," she falters under her breath.</p>
<p>"How long ago?"</p>
<p>"When first I came here."</p>
<p>"And since then you have written to break it off?" he asks, while a tone of joyful hope
     vibrates in his deep voice.</p>
<p>"No, I have not," she answers, in a frightened whisper.</p>
<p>St. John's face gathers blackness. "I am to understand, then," he resumes, in a constrained
     voice, out of which the man's strong will keeps the pent passion from bursting forth, "that you
     belonged to him at the time when I kept you out of bed one night to listen to an interesting
     chapter in my own autobiography?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And when, in reply to my inquiries, you denied having any connection beyond common
     acquaintance with—with him?" </p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And when you were good enough to overlook all trifling obstacles, and to consent to marry
     me?"</p>
<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7385-204"/>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The little catechism ended, the last cobweb of doubt torn away, they stand dumb. Esther's
     guilty head sinks down on her breast as a flower's head sinks overladen with rain. Suddenly she
     looks up and stretches out her arms. " Speak to me!" she says, huskily. "Curse me! strike me!
     call me some bad name—only speak!"</p>
<p>"I wish to God you were a man!" he answers, in a hard, low voice; while his straight brows
     draw together into one dark line across his face, and his lips look white and thin under his
     moustache.</p>
<p>"That you might <hi>kill</hi> me!" she says, incoherent with excitement. "Well, kill me now!
     If revenge is so pleasant to you, I give you leave!"</p>
<p>"Let us have no heroics, please," says he, contemptuously; "you don't appear to be aware that
     it is not the fashion for English gentlemen to murder women who make fools of them. It may be a
     sensible practice, but it is at present confined to the <foreign xml:lang="fr">tiers
      état</foreign>."</p>
<p>Having spoken, he makes a slight movement to depart.</p>
<p>"Are you going to give me up?" she cries, smiting her hands together, and forgetting in her
     great dismay to reflect whether the remonstrance accorded well with her dignity or not.</p>
<p>"I have no claim upon you," he answers, icily.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" she cries, passionately. "You are unjust. There could be nothing too bad
     for <hi>him</hi> to say of me, but what injury have I done you? You ought to thank me and
     praise me for having been wicked and dishonourable and double-dealing for your sake."</p>
<p>"For my sake!" he repeats, with a sardonic smile. "I am hardly so conceited as to take it
     personally."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" she asks, quickly. "If I did not do it for your sake, for whose did
     I?"</p>
<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7385-205"/>
<p>He is silent.</p>
<p>"Do you mean," she inquires, slowly, her cheeks paling to the whiteness of snowdrops blowing,
     "that you think I gave him up because I wanted to be a grand lady—because I wanted to have all
     these fine things" (looking round at the flowering gardens, at the broad lake, at the stately
     house shimmering in the moonshine) "belonging to me?"</p>
<p>Still he holds his peace.</p>
<p>"Is that what you meant?" she repeats, urgently.</p>
<p>"I meant," he says, looking up, his eyes flashing with a hard, metallic gleam, "that you
     thought a rich man a better investment than a poor one, and, being equally and conveniently
     indifferent to both, you thought it wisest to select the former."</p>
<p>"If such is your opinion of me," she says, turning away indignantly, "I don't wonder at your
     being in such a hurry to be rid of me!" </p>
<p>He looks askance at her out of the corners of his eyes. She has hidden her face in her hands,
     but by the panting breast and heaved white shoulder he sees that she is weeping—that a storm of
     sobs is shaking her childish frame.</p>
<p>"I am in a hurry to be rid of you!" he says, harshly, steeling himself against her. "From a
     woman who could throw a man over with the deliberate, cold-blooded artlessness you have done,
     one may well sing 'Te Deum' for beirg rescued in time."</p>
<p>She flings up her little head proudly, and the dusk splendour of her eyes blazes through
     great tears. "Listen to me!" she says, laying hold of his arm with one small burning hand. "I
     am a bad girl, I know, but I am not the calculating, mercenary wretch you take me for. I tell
     you honestly that the first day I came here—I had never been staying at a great house before—I
     thought it must be pleasant to live in large rooms, and have gilt and ormolu and
     <pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7385-206"/> fine pictures about one, and to have carriages and horses
     and servants, and not to be obliged to think twice before one spent sixpence; and I thought,
     too" (her long neck droops, and she blushes painfully as she makes the confession), "what a
     pity it was that I was already engaged, for that otherwise, as I was pretty, you might have
     taken a fancy to me—" She stops, choked with maiden shame. Upon his averted face an enduring
     flush, like a hectic autumn leaf's, burns red and angry.</p>
<p>"But as soon as I saw you, almost," she continues, commanding her tears with great
     difficulty—"as soon as you spoke to me, all such thoughts went out of my head. I don't know why
     they did," she says, simply. "You were not particularly pleasant or civil; I did not think you
     good-looking, and you gave me the idea of being ill-tempered; but" (with a sigh) "one cannot
     reason about those sort of things. I began to think so much about what you <hi>were</hi>, that
     I forgot to remember what you had."</p>
<p>He makes no comment upon her confession.</p>
<p>"Do you believe me?" she asks, eagerly, her little fingers tightening their clasp upon his
     coat-sleeve.</p>
<p>Still he is dumb.</p>
<p>"Do you?" she repeats, excitedly, the quick breath passing to and fro pantingly across the
     threshold of her crimson lips.</p>
<p>"Why do you insist on making me uncivil? " he says, with a sarcastic smile. "I do
      <hi>not</hi> believe you. I dare say you fancy you are telling truth; but if another man were
     to come on the scene with a few thousands a-year more, and a higher position in the social
     scale, you would enact the same part over again. Women must be true to their instincts. Those
     who are bent on rising must kick down the ladder by which they have climbed: it is an
     irreversible law."</p>
<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7385-207"/>
<p>"You are mistaken," she says, eagerly. "I have no desire to climb; if I came here with any
     silly, childish idea that rich people were happier than poor ones, I have been quite
     disillusioned. Bob" (how oddly the little unromantic name comes in among her heroics!)— "Bob is
     a happier man than you are, though he is only a lieutenant in a foot regiment, and has next to
     nothing to live upon."</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that <hi>Bob</hi>" (with a little sneering emphasis on the monosyllable) "is
     in all respects a very superior person to me," says St. John, with a bitter pale smile, like a
     gleam of wrathful sunlight on a day of east wind and clouds and driving sleet.</p>
<p>"I quite agree with you," she answers eagerly, her great eyes flashing angry, like unwonted
     meteors that blaze fitful in the winter sky, "and I wish to Heaven I had never left him!"</p>
<p>Over Gerard's features a spasm, contracting and puckering them, passes ugly and painful; his
     hands clench themselves in the mightiness of his effort to govern his smitten soul. "That is
     easily remedied," he answers, after a little pause, in a clear cold voice. "Why should not you
     go back to him as you came? There is no reason why he should ever hear of this—this
      <hi>episode</hi>, this <hi>interlude</hi>, this <hi>farce</hi>."</p>
<p>"And you think that I am to be bandied about like a bale of goods!" she cries, scornfully,
     voice trembling and lip quivering with passion. "You are like the woman in the Judgment of
     Solomon, who said, <quote>'Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it!'</quote>
<hi>You</hi> love me! You never did!" </p>
<p>"Perhaps not," he answers, with slow difficulty; "perhaps what I loved was my ideal that I
     fancied I had found in you, and when I found I was mistaken, perhaps the love went too! My God,
     I wish it had!" </p>
<p>Through the proud calmness of his voice penetrates a tone
     <pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7385-208"/> of bitter, unwilling tenderness. Hearing it, her whole soul
     is melted into fresh, quick tears.</p>
<p>"It is not my ideal, or any one else's, that I love in you!" she cries, stretching out eager
     white arms towards him; "it is yourself—your very self! Oh, if I could but tear out my heart,
     and show it you! Oh! why won't you believe me?"</p>
<p>He looks at her—looks at the innocently-wooing arms, at the tear-stained, dimpled, tremulous
     face—and feels his resolution wasting away like wax before the fire, as Samson's wasted away in
     Delilah's lap. He turns his eyes away across the cool silvered flood, and hardens his heart
     against her.</p>
<p>"Why cannot you?" she repeats, in her sweet, vibrating voice.</p>
<p>"Because I have not the faith that removes mountains," he answers, harshly; "because a thing
     must be probable, or at least possible, before I can give credit to it; because I am unable to
     understand how, for a man whom you confess to having thought ill-looking, ill-tempered, and
     ill-mannered, you could, out of pure disinterested love, throw over one to whom you must, at
     least, have pretended to be sincerely attached."</p>
<p>"I never pretended anything of the kind," she answers, vehemently. "If you don't believe me,
     ask him. I was engaged to him because he seemed unhappy, and because I did not see any
     particular reason why I should not, and because he asked me."</p>
<p>Through all his bitter, surging wrath, St. John can hardly forbear a smile. "And you became
     engaged to me because I asked you?" he says, drily. "At that rate, there is no reason why the
     number of your aspirants should not be increased <foreign xml:lang="lat">ad
     infinitum</foreign>.</p>
<p>"And were you going to play the play out to the end, may I ask, and <hi>marry</hi> us both"
     he inquires, in the same cutting key.</p>
<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7385-209"/>
<p>No woman can stand being sneered at; she much prefers having the tables and chairs flung at
     her head.</p>
<p>"Do you think it manly or witty to jeer at me," cries Essie, stung almost to madness by his
     taunts, "because I have been fool enough to desert for you a man worth a hundred of you?"</p>
<p>Gerard stands motionless in the moonlight, with folded arms, and a chill, painful smile on
     his stern mouth. " I have already announced my conviction of his superiority, and have advised
     you to return to him," he says.</p>
<p>"Do you mean <hi>really?</hi>" asks Essie, her wild, wide eyes flaming in half-incredulous
     fear on his face.</p>
<p>"I do," he answers, with icy steadiness.</p>
<p>"And you have done with me altogether?" she says, brokenly, her tears forcing their way
     through her slight shielding fingers, and falling one after another, slow and heavy, on the
     stones at her feet. "Serve me right!—Serve me right!"</p>
<p>Once again, intoxicated by her great fairness, he goes nigh to pardoning her; once again his
     obstinate will comes to his aid. "If I were to marry you now," he says, resolutely, "my life
     would be one long suspicion : I should love you madly, and should disbelieve in you."</p>
<p>With that, and his saying he should love her madly, a little creeping hope steals warmly
     about her heart. "Why should you disbelieve in me ?" she asks, putting out a timid peace-making
     hand.</p>
<p>"Because a faith once broken can never be mended," he answers, sternly—<corr>"it</corr> may
     be patched up, but a patched faith will not do to go through life with; because a woman who has
     deceived a man once for one object may deceive him a second time for another. I should never,"
     he says (words coming quicker and emotion deepening as he proceeds), "look in your sweet eyes
     without thinking I read some
     <pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7385-210"/> treachery in them; I should never press your heart against
     mine without fearing that it was beating for some one else."</p>
<p>She withdraws her rejected hand, and falls to weeping sorelier than ever, but very
     mutely.</p>
<p>"What madness induced you to tell me so many lies?" he cries, passionately, with mournful
     severity. "Were you bent on putting a gulf, that could never be bridged through all eternity,
     between us? Did not you know that that is the one sin I could never forget or forgive?"</p>
<p>She looks down humbled and crestfallen, and says, sobbingly, "I was afraid of you. I thought
     that, if I told you, I should lose you as I have done now, without telling you. I was on the
     point of speaking two or three times, but you looked so angry that my courage failed, and I
      <hi>dared</hi> not."</p>
<p>"Afraid of me!" he says, reproachfully. "By your own showing, then, you could not have loved
     me perfectly, for <quote>'perfect love casteth out fear.'</quote> If you are afraid of me, it
     is indeed time for us to part."</p>
<p>"I see you are bent on misconstruing every word I say," she says, hopelessly, and yet with a
     little petulant movement of shoulder and head, "and so I'll hold my tongue."</p>
<p>He looks at her, not relentingly, but with infinite sadness. "I almost wish that Constance
     had left me in my Fool's Paradise!" he says.</p>
<p>"Constance!" exclaims Esther, quickly. "Was it she that told you?" </p>
<p>"It was," he answers, quietly: "she heard it this morning; she was annoyed with me for not
     going to the ball, and chose this ingenious and, I must say, complete mode of revenge."</p>
<p>"What <hi>had</hi> I done to her?" says Essie, bringing her two hands together sharply, and
     looking upwards to Heaven's great black, blue floor above her, <quote>
<l rend="center">'Thick inlaid with patines of bright gold."</l></quote>
<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7385-211"/> "What <hi>had</hi> I done to her," she says, in a sort of
     wonder, "that she should do me such a mischief?"</p>
<p>Looking at her as she stands with upturned eyes, like some sweet prayerful saint or penitent
     Magdalen, drawn by a cunning hand that has been resolved three centuries back into elemental
     dust—dust that has stopped a bunghole perhaps, like Alexander's—Gerard's resolution breaks a
     little; not his resolution of parting from her—<hi>that</hi> remains firm as ever—but his power
     of so parting with nonchalant coldness: "Child!" he cries, a little roughly, and yet with a
     half-groan, placing a hand heavily on each of her shoulders—"Child! why are you so pretty? If
     it was your nature to be deceitful and underhand, why could not you be ugly too? Your beauty is
     the one thing about you that I believe in, and it drives me distracted!" </p>
<p>"And yet," she answers, with a melancholy smile, "you told me just now, very calmly, to go
     back to—to <hi>him</hi>: you seemed to contemplate with great equanimity the prospect of seeing
     me and my <hi>distracting beauty</hi>" (with a bitter emphasis) "in another man's
     possession."</p>
<p>"You are mistaken," he answers, with quick violence. "By God's help, I'll never see you again
     after to-night."</p>
<p>Hearing that heavy sentence, her knees tremble beneath her a little; a momentary dimness
     comes over her eyes; voice, breath, and heart seem to suspend their functions. No word of
     protest, of lamentation, of entreaty, crosses her whitened lips.</p>
<p>"What right have I to be with you?" he asks, indignantly—"I, who cannot see you without
     coveting you? What right have I to steal another man's wife, any more than his horse or his
     money?" </p>
<p>"Let me go, then," she answers, with a low, moaning sigh—"since it must be so. You know what
     is right better than I do. Good-bye!" </p>
<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7385-212"/>
<p>"Good-bye!" he answers, very shortly, and turns away his head sharply, that only the lake and
     the stars may see the distortion that the passion of that parting is working on his face.</p>
<p>"Say you forgive me before I go!" says the tender, tremulous voice, that might unman a
     hero—might unsaint an anchorite—as she lingers yet a little minute beside him.</p>
<p>"Why should I say what is not true?" he asks, turning round roughly upon her. "I don't
     forgive you, and never shall, either in this world or the next."</p>
<p>"You must!" she says, sobbingly, the words coming a little wildly through a tempest of tears.
     "I cannot go unless you do; if I went now, I should remember you all my life as you are to-day;
     to-day would blot out all the happy hours we have been together!"</p>
<p>For all answer he turns away from her, and buries his face in his hands.</p>
<p>"Look at me kindly once again!" she says, calmness growing out of her strong emotion, putting
     up her two small hands and trying to draw his away from before his hidden face. "I may be very
     wicked; I suppose I am—as you say so—mean, underhand, deceitful; but yet, for the sake of what
     is gone, look at me kindly once again: that won't hurt you, as it is for the very last time!" </p>
<p>Still Gerard remains speechless—not from obstinacy, but because he cannot command his voice:
     and his pride revolts from speaking shakily, quaveringly, like an hysterical woman or paralytic
     old man.</p>
<p>"If I were a thief, or a murderer!" she says, indignantly, withdrawing her hands, "you could
     not turn from me with greater loathing!"</p>
<p>"You are a murderer!" he answers, with fierce vehemence, looking at her once again as she had
     asked him—looking at her with wrathful, reluctant passion, but not
     <pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7385-213"/> kindly. " You have murdered my whole future—my hope, my
     belief in women, in truth—my everything of life but what is merely animal. If you had murdered
     my body I could have forgiven you much more easily. Time or disease must have done that sooner
     or later, but now—" He stops abruptly.</p>
<p>"If I am a murderer, I am a suicide too," she replies, with a smile more tearful than her
     tears. "St. John," she says, earnestly, "don't you know that people always attend to dying
     requests, however foolish and unreasonable they may be? This of mine is a dying request, for
     after to-night I shall be dead to you. Say, 'Essie, I forgive you.'"</p>
<p>"What is it to you whether I forgive you or not?" he inquires, sullenly, with a certain
     savage pulling and biting of his moustache. "Are you mistaking me for Brandon again? Why should
     two indifferent acquaintances like us go through the farce of begging each other's pardons?
     What are we to one another?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," she answers, calmly; "you need not be so eager to remind me of that; my memory
     needs no refreshing; but we <hi>have been</hi> something—do what you will you cannot take that
     away from me—so for the sake of that 'have been,' say you forgive me!"</p>
<p>"Falsehoods don't pass my lips so glibly as they do yours," he answers, doggedly. "If I were
     to say, 'I forgive you' a thousand times, I should be no nearer the doing it. Good-bye!" he
     says again, abruptly, putting out his hand; feeling that the strain is too great for him, and
     that if it last much longer he, being but human, will break under it. Her answering farewell is
     to fling herself upon his breast.</p>
<p>"I can no more say 'good-bye,' "she says, desperately, in a passionate whisper, "than you can
     say 'I forgive you.' St. John, take me back, try me once again! I know I
     <pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7385-214"/> ought not to say it—that it is undignified, unwomanly,
     perhaps—but I cannot see my everything going away from me without reaching out a hand to stop
     it. Oh, my darling! give me one more trial!"</p>
<p>Her arms cling about his brown throat close as the bindweed clings about the hedges in sultry
     August; her white warm breast heaves and pants against his, as the sea heaves and pants against
     the shore's tawny sides; her eyes, impassioned as only dark eyes can be—alluring,
     despairing—flame into his eyes, and down through his eyes into his heart. Prisoned in those
     sweet, frail fetters, he feels strength and name and fame ebbing from him, as Merlin's ebbed
     under Vivien's wily charm.</p>
<p>"Is not it better to be tricked by such a woman," Passion whispers, "than to spend long eons
     of unswerving fidelity with one less maddeningly fair? Were not such moments of ecstasy very
     cheaply purchased, even by years of suspicion and deceit?" But Will and Honour push her back
     with their strong right hands. "She has deceived you once, and therefore she will deceive you
     twice. She is enacting this melodrama on your breast: she may enact the next on another man's.
     Put her away!—put her away!" </p>
<p>Hearkening to them, he, with a groan as of one that teareth out his right eye, with
     relentless fingers unfastens her arms from about his neck. "<hi>Your</hi> darling!" he says,
     contemptuously; "you are forgetting whom you are addressing!"</p>
<p>"I am, indeed," she answers, with a sudden revulsion of feeling; "but it is a mistake that
     one does not make twice in a lifetime."</p>
<p>"I hope not," he answers, taking refuge in surly rudeness from the almost overpowering
     temptation to fall at her feet and say, "Essie, come to me ! deceive me! outwit
     <pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7385-215"/> me! overreach me; do what you please, I cannot help it! If
     there were a thousand Brandons and ten thousand treacheries between us, I <hi>must</hi> be
     yours, and you <hi>must</hi> be mine!"</p>
<p>"I have degraded myself once to the dust before you," rejoins Essie, in a voice that tries to
     be angry, but is only trembling; "but there is no fear of my doing it again. And yet," she
     continues, after a pause, her soft nature making it more difficult for her to part from him in
     anger than to incur his contempt by again descending to supplication—"and yet, since I have
     confessed to having been wicked, you might as well forgive me. How much the better will you be
     for going through life with the consciousness that you have made one wretched woman even more
     unhappy than she would otherwise have been? You forgave that other girl who deceived you
     because she did not love you. Forgive me, who deceived you, because I loved you too well!" </p>
<p>"I forgave her," he answers, sternly, "because I had ceased to care about her—because what
     she stole from me had lost its value. Perhaps at some future period I may be in the same frame
     of mind towards you; at present I am some way off it. I neither can forgive you, nor have I the
     slightest wish to do so!"</p>
<p>Seeing that she is abasing herself in vain, she refrains.</p>
<p>"Well, then, since you wish it, so it must be," she answers, with meek despair; and catching
     suddenly his hand before he has time to prevent her, she kisses it very humbly and sorrowfully.
     Then, unforgiven, unrecalled, she passes away. And Gerard, the battle over, the victory won,
     sits down on a garden-seat, and cries like a child for his pretty lost plaything.</p>
