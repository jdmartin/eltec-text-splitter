<head rend="center">CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
<p>TIME goes by. Since Joshua, God-bidden, commanded sun and moon to stand still, who has been
     able to stop it?</p>
<p>Gerard still remains at Blessington—remains, despite the six-o'clock dinners; despite the
     inarticulate and inharmonious mumblings with which old Blessington takes away the appetites of
     such as feast with him; despite the utter failure of his endeavours to draw from the mind of
     his betrothed any ideas but such as <hi>Le Follet</hi> and <hi>Le Journal des Demoiselles</hi>
     had just put into it. Latterly he has abandoned the attempt, has taken to reading the
      <hi>Times</hi>, <hi>Field</hi>, anything in the evening, instead; has even, in his
     despair—modern works of fiction being, as I have before observed, unknown at Blessington—waded
     through two chapters and a half of "Pamela," which Esther had inadvertently left on the table.
     Sometimes, to his own surprise, he catches himself wishing that his wedding-day were over.
     "When we are married, we need never speak to one another," he reflects. "Thank God, we shall
     not be so poor as to be obliged to keep together from economy; a dinner of herbs and hatred,
     or, worse still, indifference therewith, <hi>would</hi> be hard to digest; she may go her way,
     and I mine. I will get up a great stock of beads, and looking-glasses, and red calico, and make
     an expedition to Central Africa; learn some euphonious African tongue, all made up of Ms and
     Ns; and carefully
     <pb n="386" xml:id="VAB7385-390"/> abstain from engaging in arguments upon the immortality of
     the soul with intelligent natives."</p>
<p>Now and again conscience's voice thunders at him in the recesses of his soul: "You are
     paltering with temptation. Arise!—flee!—begone!" But he, strong in the innocence of his acts
     and words, replies doughtily: "Temptation is there none for me here. The occupations of my life
     are such as they would be at home; I am struggling to know and like better her with whom my
     life is to be passed. As to that other woman, I see her rarely, speak to her never, look at her
     as seldom as it is possible to me."</p>
<p>And, in the meantime, that other woman droops like an unwatered flower, day by day. When the
     mainspring of a watch is broken, must it not stop? If hope, the mainspring of life, be broken,
     must not life stop—not all at once, as the watch does, but by gentle yet sure degrees? A slow
     fire burns in the child's veins; before this man had come, she had peace—a sad stagnant peace,
     indeed, but still peace. <hi>Now</hi> she lives in a state of perpetual concealed excitement.
     True, they meet but rarely, speak to each other never; but the same roof covers them both. From
     her outlook in the China Gallery, she can watch his going forth in the morning, his coming back
     at evening. At breakfast and dinner he sits opposite to her; she can study his face, with
     stealthy care, lest she may be observed, while he drives heavily through slow trite talk with
     her that fills the place in his life that, for a golden day, from one sundown to another, was
     Esther's. Sometimes they meet upon the stairs; her black dress lightly touches him, as they
     pass one another dumbly. At night she lies awake, waiting to catch the sound of his footfall in
     the gallery past her door; has to wait long hours often; for he, unknowing that any one takes
     note of his vigils, sits in the smoking-room far into the small hours, puffing out of his
     well-coloured meerschaum
     <pb n="387" xml:id="VAB7385-391"/> great volumes of smoke—wishing, not seldom, I think, that he
     could puff away Constance, his beloved, into smoke volumes and thin air.</p>
<p>Fed by no kindly words, nourished only upon neglect and cold looks, Esther's love for Gerard
     yet strikes out great roots downwards—shoots forth strong branches upwards. A tree of far
     statelier growth it stands than in the days when the soft gales and gentle streams of answering
     love fanned and watered it. Who cares for what they can have? Who cries for the moon? It is the
     intermediate something—the something that lies just a handbreadth beyond the utmost stretch of
     our most painfully-strained arms, that we eat out our hearts in longing for.</p>
<p>Esther never goes beyond the park palings now, deterred by the fear of being waylaid by
     Linley. She need not have been alarmed. As long as she came naturally in his way, he was
     delighted to see her: as we stoop and pick gladly the fruit that drops off the tree at our
     feet. He had even, on a day when the frost forbade hunting, and when he had got tired of
     skating, taken the unwonted trouble of riding over to Blessington, to warm himself at the fire
     of those great black eyes, that have still for him the charm of novelty upon them; but women,
     many and fair, came too readily to his hand to make him very keen in the chase of any one
     individual woman. In former generations men used to be the pursuers, women the pursued. In this
     generation we, who have set right most things, have set right this also. <hi>Now</hi>, the
     hares pursue the harriers, the foxes the hounds, and the doves swoop upon the falcons.</p>
<p>During these latter evenings Mr. Blessington has been very alert and wakeful—has insisted on
     being read to from tea to bed-time—a liberal hour. But, however hoarse and voiceless the young
     reader may be, Gerard never now comes to the rescue, never interferes, though the frequent
     teasing
     <pb n="388" xml:id="VAB7385-392"/> cough of the "damnable flirt" goes through his heart like a
     sword. With steady certainty, through frost and thaw, rain and shine, through all the
     alternations of an English winter, the young girl's health declines. To all but herself is this
     fact evident, and she, unaccustomed to illness—never having seen the signs of premature decay
     in others—thinks it is but a little weariness, a little languor, a nothing. It will pass when
     the swooned world revives into spring and the buttercups come.</p>
<p>Sunday is here again, the initial letter in the week's alphabet: <quote>
<l rend="ti-3">"The Sundays of man's life,</l>
<l rend="ti-3">Threaded together on Time's string,</l>
<l rend="ti-3">Make bracelets to adorn the wife</l>
<l rend="ti-3">Of the eternal glorious King."</l></quote></p>
<p>Ah me! the languid, yawning Sundays of most of us will make but sorry bracelets for any one,
     methinks. Sunday—the day on which the Shelford shopboys and shopgirls walk about gloriously
     apparelled, arm-in-arm, man and maid, filling their lungs with country air,—day on which the
     gentlefolks, such as are men of them, debarred from horse and hound and cue, smoke a cigar or
     two more than usual over the instructive pages of Messieurs De Kock, Sue, Balzac, etc.;
     while such as are women, being for the most part piously disposed, hold Goulburn's "Thoughts on
     Personal Religion," or Hannay's "Last Day of Our Lord's Passion," open on their velvet laps,
     and kill a reputation between each paragraph.</p>
<p>On this especial Sunday Esther has risen, feeling feebler, more nerveless than usual.
     Something in the influence of the weather—soft, sodden, sunless—weighs upon her with untold
     oppression. She would fain not go to church, remain at home, and lie on her bed; but this
     cannot be. Foremost in importance, in indispensability, among her duties are these
     <pb n="389" xml:id="VAB7385-393"/> Sunday ones. If the weather be tolerable, Mr. Blessington is
     always scrupulously punctual in attending Divine worship. Leaning on his valet's arm, he
     totters up the church, in his old tail-coat, tightly buttoned over his sunken chest, and,
     arrived at the Blessington pew, is deposited in a little nook thereof, partitioned (in some
     quirk of his, while he could yet see) from the rest. In thia nook there is room for two
     people—to wit, for Mr. Blessington, and for the happy person who is to guide his devotions. And
     to conduct Mr. Blessington's prayers and praises is, I assure you, no sinecure. Almost entirely
     deaf, almost entirely blind, he is yet resolute to take a part in the services by no means less
     prominent than the clerk's. It is, therefore, his attendant's duty to shout the responses in
     his ear, in order to give him some clue to the portion of the ritual which has been arrived at
     and to check him with elbowings and nudgings, when his aberrations from the right path become
     so flagrantly noticeable as to distract the attention of the other worshippers. But too often,
     however, the attempts at repression on the part of the acolyte are so much labour lost. In the
     region of darkness and silence in which his infirmities have placed him, the old man frequently
     becomes impatient of the slow progress of the service as notified to him by the roars of his
     companion. Not seldom he proclaims, in a voice distinctly audible throughout the building, the
     point at which, according to his reckoning, priest and people should have arrived. "And with
     thy spirit," cries the squire, with unction in his deep, tremulous bass, while the sleek young
     rector's gentle "The Lord be with you" does not follow till five minutes later. In the Creed
     there is but one course to pursue: to start him, if possible, fair—happy, indeed, if he does
     not insist on turning to the altar somewhere towards the close of the second lesson or
     beginning of the Jubilate,—to start him fair, I say. and then in despair, give him his head.
     <pb n="390" xml:id="VAB7385-394"/> Fervently, loudly, rapidly, he announces his belief in the
     articles of the Christian faith, while parson, clerk, and congregation toil after him in vain.
     Occasionally—especially at such portions of the service as refer to our need of forgiveness,
     our sinfulness, our mortality,—he breaks out into senile tears; too deaf to hear his own
     penitent sobs, he has no idea of the loudness with which they reverberate through the church.
     Strangers, hearing, perk their heads up above their pews, and then fling them down again on
     their pocket-handkerchiefs convulsed with inextinguishable laughter; but the greater part of
     the assemblage are used to these spasms of grotesque devotion—it is only "t'oud squoire."</p>
<p>Esther always draws a long breath of relief when <quote>
<l rend="ti-3">"Lord, have mercy upon us!</l>
<l rend="ti-3">Christ, have mercy upon us!</l>
<l rend="ti-3">Lord, have mercy upon us!" </l></quote> has been safely tided over without any
     unusually noisy burst of lamentation.</p>
<p>On the Sunday I speak of "t'oud squoire's" prayers were more unruly than usual. Whether it
     was that Esther's weakened voice was unable to guide them into the right channel, or to
     whatever other cause assignable, certain it is that his vagaries were more painfully
     evident—ludicrously to the congregation, distressingly to his family—than on any former Sunday
     within the memory of man. Many heads turn towards the Blessington pew ; even the rector—meekest
     among M.A.s—looks now and again with gentle reproach at the old man, who is, with such
     aggressive loudness, usurping his office of leading the devotions of his flock. A proud woman
     is Esther Craven when the Liturgy comes to a close. In the sermon there are, thank God, no
     responses for the congregation to make; it is not even
     <pb n="391" xml:id="VAB7385-395"/> customary to cry, "Hear, hear!" "Hallelujah!" "More power to
     you!" at intervals. In the sermon, therefore, the old gentleman composes himself to sleep, and
     there is peace.</p>
<p>The Blessington pulpit is to-day occupied by a stranger—a Boanerges, or Son of Thunder, in
     the shape of a muscular, half-educated, fluent Irishman—a divine who would fain <hi>flog</hi>
     his hearers to heaven, show them the way upwards by the light of hell's flambeaux—one of that
     too numerous class who revel in disgusting descriptions, and similes drawn from our mortality.
     It is impossible to help listening to him, and difficult to help being sick. Esther listens,
     trembling, while he descants with minute relish on <quote>"the worm that never dies."</quote>
     The worm that never dies! Surely, a terrible picture enough, in its simple bareness, without
     enlargement thereupon! With imagination rendered more vivid, and reason weakened by sickness,
     the unhappy girl pictures that worm gnawing at her brother's heart—gnawing, crawling, torturing
     eternally. She covers her face with her hands; it is too horrible! A sort of sick feeling comes
     over her—a giddy faintness. If she can but reach the open air ! She rises unsteadily, opens the
     pew-door, and walks as in a mist down the aisle, between the two rows of questioning faces, and
     so out. As she passes through the church-door she staggers slightly, and catches at the wall
     for support. Gerard, watching her anxiously, sees her unsteady gait, and the involuntary
     gesture of reaching out for some stay for her tottering figure. Instantly, without giving
     thought to the light in which his beloved may regard his proceeding, he, rising, quickly
     follows the young girl. She has just managed to reach a flat tombstone, and there sits, with
     her face turned thirstily westwards, whence a small soft wind blows <corr>fitfully</corr>.</p>
<p>"You are ill," he says, <corr>bending</corr> solicitously over her, and
     <pb n="392" xml:id="VAB7385-396"/> laying aside in that compassionate mment the armour of his
     coldness.</p>
<p>She does not answer for awhile; then, drawing a long breath, and trying to smile: "The church
     was so close," she says, sighingly; "and that smell of escaped gas always makes me feel faint,
     and—and" (with a shudder)—" that dreadful man—with his metaphors all taken from the
     charnelhouse!" </p>
<p>"I wish he were there himself, with all my heart," answers Gerard, devoutly; "he might there
     frame metaphors to his taste at his leisure."</p>
<p>"And it is so terrible to think that it is all <hi>true</hi>, isn't it?" she says, fixing her
     great awestruck eyes upon his face, as if trying to find comfort and reassurance there; "that
     the reality exceeds even his revolting word-painting; that we <hi>shall</hi> be
      <hi>loathsome</hi>, all of us!—you and I and everybody—young and old, beautiful and ugly! How
      <hi>could</hi> God be so cruel as to let us know it beforehand?" </p>
<p>"Knowing it beforehand is better than knowing it at the time, which, at least, we are
     spared," replies St. John, composedly.</p>
<p>"But are we?" she cries, eagerly: "that is the question! Latterly I have been beset by a
     fearful idea that death is but a long catalepsy. In a catalepsy, you know, a person seems
     utterly without consciousness or volition; breath is suspended, and all the vital functions;
     and yet he feels and sees and hears more acutely than when in strong health. Why may not death,
     too, be a catalepsy?"</p>
<p>"Absurd!" he says. "My poor child, it is thoughts like these, gone wild, that fill madhouses.
     According to your theory, at what point of time does your catalepsy end? When we are dissolved
     into minutest particles of dust does each atom still feel and suffer?"</p>
<p>"My theory, as you call it, will not hold water, I know,"
     <pb n="393" xml:id="VAB7385-397"/> she answers gravely, "but it does not haunt me any the less.
     There are times when one cannot reason—one can only <hi>fear</hi>."</p>
<p>" You should not give way to these morbid fancies," he says, chidingly; "they are making you
     ill."</p>
<p>"Am I ill, do you think? Do I look ill?" she asks, with startled eagerness.</p>
<p>The havoc worked in face and figure by the last few months is too directly under his eyes for
     him to answer anything but truthfully, "Very ill."</p>
<p>"You don't think I'm going to <hi>die</hi>?" she says, lowering her voice, and laying her
     hand on his arm, while her great feverish eyes burn into his very soul. " People are not any
     the more likely to die for being thin and weak, are they? Creaky doors hang the longest."</p>
<p>"Die!—God forbid!" he replies, trying to speak <corr>lightly.</corr> "Let us banish death
     from our talk. I suppose it is this place of tombs that has made him take such a leading part
     in it. Come, you are not at all fit to go back into church, and I am not anxious to hear the
     tail-end of that wormy discourse. The smell of brimstone is quite strong enough in my nostrils
     already. Let us go home!" </p>
<p>So they return to the house, and he still shows no inclination to leave her. He draws a chair
     for her near an open window, and stands with his hand resting on the back. It is almost like
     the old times—the old times that he thinks of, <quote>
<l rend="ti-5">"As dead men of good days,</l>
<l rend="ti-2">Ere the wrong side of death was theirs, when God</l>
<l rend="ti-2">Was friends with them."</l></quote></p>
<p>Something in the recollection of those days makes soft his voice, which is not wont to be
     soft. "You are not fit for this life," he says, stooping down his face towards her small wan
     one. "It requires a tough seasoned woman, in middle
     <pb n="394" xml:id="VAB7385-398"/> life. Tell me why you have undertaken it? Why are you
     not—not married?"</p>
<p>She turns away, crimsoning painfully. "Because no one has asked me, I suppose," she answers,
     trying to speak banteringly.</p>
<p>"But you were engaged when—when we parted?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And you are not now?"</p>
<p>With ungovernable, unaccountable impatience, he awaits the slow brief answer.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Had he then—h'm! h'm!—<hi>discovered</hi> anything?" Gerard asks, finding some difficulty in
     framing the question politely.</p>
<p>She fires up quickly. "<hi>Discovered</hi> anything!" she repeats, indignantly. "Do you think
     it is impossible for me to be honest even <hi>once</hi> in my life? I told him myself."</p>
<p>"<hi>You</hi> broke it off, then?"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't."</p>
<p>"<hi>He</hi> did?" </p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Poor fellow! he had good cause to be angry," says St. John; the old bitterness surging back
     upon him, as he reflects on the cowardly duplicity that had made waste two honest lives.</p>
<p>"But he was <hi>not</hi> angry," she cries, eagerly: "he was grieved—oh, <hi>so</hi> grieved
     ! Shall I ever forgive myself when I think of how he looked when I told him?" (her eyes gazing
     out abstractedly at the "Rape of the Sabines," as her thoughts fly back to that quarried nook
     on the bleak autumnal hillside, where she had broken a brave man's heart). "But he was not
     angry. Oh, no! he never thought of himself! he thought only about me! Ah! <hi>that was</hi>
     love!"</p>
<pb n="395" xml:id="VAB7385-399"/>
<p>"He would not marry you, however?" says St. John, exasperated at these laudations, which he
     imagines levelled as reproaches against himself.</p>
<p>"No," she answered quietly, "you are right; he would not marry me, though I begged him. But
     that was for my sake, too—not his own; he told me that he could not make me happy, for that I
     did not love him. He was wrong, though. I did love him—I love him now. If I did not love the
     one friend I have in all this great empty world, what should I be made of?" she concludes,
     while the tears come into her eyes.</p>
<p>"You have a great capacity for loving," says St. John, who, though not usually an ungenerous
     fellow, is maddened by the expressions of affection, the tears and regretful looks bestowed
     upon his rival. "I envy, though I despair of emulating you."</p>
<p>"Men have but <hi>one</hi> way of loving," she answers, gently; "women have several. I love
     him as the one completely unselfish being I ever met. I agree with you, that the way of loving
     you mean comes but once in a lifetime."</p>
<p>At her words, and the fidelity to himself which they so innocently imply, a fierce bright joy
     upleaps in his heart—a joy that clamours for utterance in violent fond words, in the wild
     closeness of forbidden embraces; but honour, that strong gaoler that keeps so many under lock
     and key, keeps him too.</p>
<quote>
<l rend="ti-3">"For Love himself took part against himself</l>
<l rend="ti-3">To warn us off; and Duty, loved of love—</l>
<l rend="ti-3">Oh! this world's curse, beloved but hated—came,</l>
<l rend="ti-3">Like death, betwixt thy dear embrace and mine,</l>
<l rend="ti-3">And crying, 'Who is this? Behold thy bride!'</l>
<l rend="ti-3">She push'd me from thee."</l></quote>
<p>He only holds out his hand to her. "Esther, let us be
     <pb n="396" xml:id="VAB7385-400"/> friends. I am tired of this silence and estrangement; let
     there be peace between us!" </p>
<p>"I have always wished for it," she answers meekly, laying her little trembling hand in his—
     "you know I have; but let us be at peace <hi>apart</hi>, and not <hi>together</hi>; that will
     be better. How long," she asks, impulsively, lifting quivering red lips and dew-soft eyes to
     his— "how long—how much longer— do you mean to stay here?"</p>
<p>"Why do you ask?" he says, in a troubled voice, hurt pride and hot passion struggling
     together. "Surely in this great wide house there is room for you and me; I am not much in your
     way, surely?" </p>
<p>"You are," she answers, feverishly—"you are in my way; you would be, in the widest house that
     ever was built. Every day I long more and more to be a great way off from you. I think I could
     breathe better if I were."</p>
<p>He does not answer: leaning still over her in a dumb agonised yearning, that—with the chains
     of another still dragging about him—may not be outspoken.</p>
<p>"That day we met upon the stairs," she continues, eyes and cheeks aflame and lustrous with
     the consuming fire within her, "you promised me you would avail yourself of the first
     opportunity to leave this place; a month or more is gone since then. Surely the most exacting
     mistress could spare you for awhile now? Why have you broken your word, then? Why are you
     here?"</p>
<p>He is silent for a few moments, questioning his own soul—questioning that conscience whose
     monitions he has hitherto so stoutly resisted. Then he speaks, a flush of shame making red his
     bronzed cheek: "Because I have been dishonest to myself and to you. This place has had an
     attraction for me which I see now it would not have had had <hi>she</hi> only been here. I
     linger about it as a man lingers about the churchyard where his one hope lies buried." </p>
<pb n="397" xml:id="VAB7385-401"/>
<p>"Don't linger any longer, then," she cries, passionately, taking his hand between both hers;
     "don't be dishonest any more! Tell <hi>yourself</hi> the truth, if you tell no one else, and go
      <hi>at once</hi>, before it is too late; for if you won't, <hi>I</hi> must!" </p>
<p>She is weeping freely as she speaks; her tears drop hot and slow, one after another, upon his
     hand.</p>
<p>He flings himself on his knees beside her, his mastery over himself reeling in the strong
     rush of long-pent passion.</p>
<p>"You tell me to go," he says, in a voice choked and altered with emotion, "and in the very
     act of telling me you cry. Which am I to believe, your words or your tears?"</p>
<p>"My words," she answers, trying to speak collectedly, and by gaining calmness herself to
     bring it back to him. "I have been dishonourable once—you know it; don't let me have the
     remorse of thinking that I made an honourable man palter with temptation—made him sully his
     honour for me. If <hi>I</hi> am the inducement that keeps you here, <hi>go; for my sake,
      go!</hi> I say it a hundred times; promise me you will go—<hi>soon, this week</hi>. Let me
     hear you swear it; you will not break your oath, I know!"</p>
<p>He is silent; hesitating to take that step of irrevocable banishment—banishment from the
     woman that he cast away in righteous wrath, and in whose frail life his own now seems to be
     bound up.</p>
<p>"Swear!" she says again, earnestly, with a resolute look in her soft face. "I beg it of you
     as a favour; for if you won't, though my only chance of daily bread lies here, I must go
     to-night."</p>
<p>The determination in her voice recalls him to his senses. "I will not drive you to such
     extremities," he says, coldly. "Give me only till to-morrow morning—twenty-four hours cannot
     make much difference to you, and a man going to
     <pb n="398" xml:id="VAB7385-402"/> be hanged likes to have a little respite—give me till to-
     morrow, and I will swear whatever you wish."</p>
<p>"That is right," she answers, trying to smile through her tears. " Some day you will thank
     me; you will say, 'She was a bad girl, but she did me one good turn!'"</p>
<p>The people are flocking out of church; the squire, in a low pony-chaise, driven by a groom as
     old and toothless as himself, and drawn by a pony (considering the comparative ages of horses
     and men) also nearly as old, is bowling gently up the drive.</p>
<p>"I must go," Esther says, rising hastily; "Mrs. Blessington hates red eyes as she hates a
     black dress, and for the same reason!" </p>
