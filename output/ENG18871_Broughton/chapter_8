<head rend="center">CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p> THE 2.25 train from Brainton is due at Felton at 5.30. It is drawing near Mither now,
     escorted by a vanguard, bodyguard, and rearguard of dust-clouds; it rushes along, with the sun
     beating down on the roofs of the carriages, making them like little compartments of Hades. If
     the devil took a hint from the Coldbath Fields cells for "improving the prisons of Hell," he
     certainly might take a hint from the Brainton train for improving the travelling conveyances of
     the same locality.</p>
<p>In one of the first-class carriages there is a baby: it has got a cold, and seems rather
     inclined to be sick; so both the nurse, on whose lap it lies gaping and blowing bubbles, and
     the idolising mother, who sits over against it, insist on keeping its window tight up. There is
     a rusty old divine, in gilt-rimmed spectacles and a jowl, reading the <hi>Guardian</hi>; a
     commercial traveller, with his hat off, his legs up, and a gaudy cap on his head, fast asleep;
     and, lastly, a little young lady, sitting facing the engine, with the dusty blast driving hot
     and full in her face, blinking, coughing, choking, with the utmost patience. On her lap lies a
     huge bunch of red and yellow roses and heavy-scented double-stocks, all limp and drooping and
     soiled. Bob gave them to her when he came down to the station to see her off-and very kind of
     him too, and very nice they are; but all the same, as she has already a bag, a box, and a
     parasol to carry, she thinks (though she barely owns it to herself) that she would almost as
     soon have been without them.</p>
<p>The dusty blast blows gentler, moderates to a dusty zephyr; the train is slackening speed.
     "Fel—ton!" "Fel—ton!"
     <pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7385-078"/> cry a row of green-fustianed porters, as the long bulk draws
     up at the platform.</p>
<p>"Please 'm, are you Miss Craven?" inquires a tall footman in powder and a cockade, touching
     his hat to Esther, as she stands all by herself, trying to take several beams out of her own
     eye.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The carriage is here for you, 'm. Would you please to show me which is your maid and
     luggage?"</p>
<p>"I have no maid, and there's my luggage," responds Esther, pointing with one grimy kid finger
     to a small trunk standing on its head, and looking half inclined to burst asunder in the midst.
     She is ashamed of her destitute condition, and ashamed of herself for being ashamed of it.</p>
<p>"Will it change into a pumpkin?" thinks Miss Craven, as she steps into a large yellow
     barouche, with two fidgety, showy greys, that is waiting for her at the station gate. After the
     yammering of the baby, the dull rumble-rumble of the train, how delicious! "If it were only my
     own," she says to herself, throwing herself back with a consequential feeling on the soft
     cushions, as some country people pass and pull their forelocks to the well-known liveries.</p>
<p>"Well, odder things have happened! <hi>But</hi> for Bob! The Prince fell in love with
     Cinderella at first sight; why should not Prince Gerard with me? I dare say I'm quite as
     good-looking as Cinderella was!"</p>
<p>As they pass Lady Gerard's model school, twenty little charity girls come trooping out in the
     uniformity of their cotton frock and straw bonnet livery, and drop twenty bob courtesies to
     Esther, who feels as the man in the "Arabian Nights" did who woke and found himself Sultan.
     Labouring men go stumping heavily home, with their tools over their shoulders and their heads
     bent earthwards, as is always
     <pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7385-079"/> the case with the tillers of the soil, who must—oh, hard
     necessity!—be ever looking down.</p>
<p>Park palings, through which the strong brake fern is thrusting itself, slide past; then a red
     lodge, picked out with blue bricks, where an obsequious old woman rushes out from the washtub,
     with hands all soapsuds, to open the gates; then a grassy, knolly park; then a great red house,
     likewise picked out with blue bricks; then stones clattering under an echoing portico; then the
     pumpkin stops, and Cinderella descends.</p>
<p>"Miss Craven!" announces the butler, opening a tall door; and Miss Craven, plucking up heart,
     marches into a high, dark library, lined with high, dark books—marches in, looking very much
     like a chimney sweep. Dust lies in ridges on her once white bonnet; dust, instead of
     belladonna, in streaks under her eyes; dust on the parting of her hair, on her eyelashes, up
     her nose (on which there is also, though, happily for her, she does not know it, a large smut),
     and a double portion of dust on the great, faded, yellow roses, to which she cleaves with as
     much pertinacity as the idiot in "Excelsior" clave to that senseless banner which he was so
     determined to run up hill with.</p>
<p>As she enters, a goddess rises like an exhalation (as Pandemonium did), and comes floating on
     lilac clouds towards her. This is as things seem to her; in reality, a large, fair, young woman
     comes forward in a long-tailed mauve muslin. Simultaneously a man's two legs are seen
     disappearing over the window-sill.</p>
<p>"How do you do?" says the goddess, sweetly. "I think the train must have been rather late; we
     expected you half an hour ago."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>A little pause, each taking stock.</p>
<p>"Won't you have some tea?" </p>
<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7385-080"/>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>The tea is poured out; it has been standing on the table an hour, and is perfectly cold. The
     goddess and the little female collier examine each other stealthily.</p>
<p>"Rather alarming," thinks the latter: "talks in such a low voice, and has such a difficulty
     in pronouncing her <hi>r</hi>'s. So that is the correct thing, is it? Well, I'll always call
     Robert <hi>Wobert</hi> for the future."</p>
<p>"Might be pretty, if she were not so filthy," thinks the other.</p>
<p>"Same age as I am, indeed! She looks five years older."</p>
<p>"I think, if you don't mind, we had perhaps better be going to dress. Sir Thomas is so very
     particular as to punctuality."</p>
<p>"Is he ? was that Sir Thomas that got out of the window just as I came in?"</p>
<p>"Oh no! that was St. John."</p>
<p>(" St. John! What a pretty name! How much prettier than Bob!")</p>
<milestone rend="stars" unit="section"/>
<p>Sir Thomas Gerard is walking up and down the library, with his watch in his hand, prepared
     the instant the clock strikes to ring the bell violently, and inquire what is the meaning of
     dinner being so late. Sir Thomas is a big man, who affects the country squire, the good, old
     English gentleman—plain Sir Thomas, without any nonsense about him; dresses to the character,
     and succeeds in looking not unlike the Frenchman's idea of an English <hi>milord</hi>, as
     depicted in <hi>Punch</hi> some years ago, where he is represented in low-crowned hat and
      <corr>breeches</corr>, with the face of a truculent butcher, cracking a whip, and exclaiming,
     with equal coherency and elegance, "Rosbif! I send my wife to Smiffel! God dam !"</p>
<p>Sir Thomas does not use such strong language when
     <pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7385-081"/> speaking of Lady Gerard, but in other respects the portrait
     is not unfaithful. Lady Gerard is lying in an arm-chair. She is fat to make you shudder; she
     has a short, turn-up nose, short legs, a red skin, and next to no hair—all very good points in
     a pig, but hardly so good in a lady. The clock strikes, and at the same instant the butler
     opens the door, and announces "Dinner!" </p>
<p>"Come along, Conny!" says Sir Thomas, sticking out his elbow to his ward.</p>
<p>"Are not you going to wait for Miss Craven? And St. John is not down, either," suggests Lady
     Gerard, who is hoisting herself slowly up out of her chair.</p>
<p>"Wait for 'em? Not I," responds Sir Roger de Coverley. " If people don't choose to conform to
     the rules of my house, they may go without their dinner for all I care, and serve 'em right,
     too. Come along, Conny!"</p>
<p>The soup is nearly ended when two people, who have come together by a fortuitous concourse of
     atoms at the door, make a simultaneous entry into the dining-room.</p>
<p>"Companions in iniquity!" says St. John, with a sarcastic look at his father, bowing to
     Esther, as he seats himself beside Miss Blessington.</p>
<p>"How do?" says Sir Thomas, putting out his left hand (his right is still grasping his spoon).
     "Never wait for anybody here; would not let the soup get cold for the Queen nor the Lord
     Chancellor either."</p>
<p>"Miss Craven mistook you for Sir Thomas before dinner," says Miss Blessington, in her sweet,
     smooth way to her neighbour.</p>
<p>"Did she? Unintentional compliments are always the most flattering," replies Mr. Gerard,
     quietly.</p>
<p>Then he looks across through the partition wall of great bigonias in silver pots, and sees a
     little face peeping at him under and over the broad crimson leaves.</p>
<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7385-082"/>
<p>No one would ever call Esther's a Madonna face. No artist would ever ask her to sit for St.
     Catherine, or St. Cecilia, or St. Anybody else; hers is essentially <foreign xml:lang="fr">beauté du diable</foreign>—one of those little, sparkling, provoking, petulant faces that
     have a fresh dress of smiles or tears, or dimples or blushes, for every trivial, passing
     question; one of those little faces that have been at the bottom of half the mischiefs the
     world has seen.</p>
<p>"I only saw a pair of legs," replies the face, exculpating itself; "how could I tell whether
     they were young or old legs?"</p>
<p>Miss Blessington looks rather shocked, as if she thought that Esther's modes of expression
     were somewhat <foreign xml:lang="fr">libre</foreign>; and indeed at the rate of purity at which
     we are advancing, <hi>legs</hi> will soon walk off into the limbo of silence and
     unmentionableness; <hi>arms</hi> will probably follow them, and then perhaps noses.</p>
<p>Although Miss Blessington looks shocked, St. John only laughs. He looks pleasant when he
     laughs; he did not look pleasant just now, when he was turning up his nose at his cold soup.
     When he is in an ill-humour he has a decided look of his father, though it puts him into an
     awful rage to tell him so. He is not handsome, certainly; not a straight-nosed, pink-cheeked,
     flaxen-curled, fairy prince at all; neither is he very young—not a boy, that is to
     say—five-and-thirty, or thereabouts; his face has a weather-beaten look, as of one that has
     felt many an icy wind and many a tropic sun beat against it. No lily-handed, curled woman's
     darling.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" cries Sir Thomas, raising his voice, and turning round in a fury (with
     his stiff grey hair standing upright, and the veins in his forehead swelling) upon an unlucky
     footman, who has had the <foreign xml:lang="fr">maladresse</foreign> to drop three spoons that
     he was carrying upon a tray. " You
     <pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7385-083"/> stupid hound, mind what you are about, or else keep out of
     the room, one or the other!"</p>
<p>Esther's mouth opens; she feels a sensation of shame-faced aghastness; but the rest of the
     company sit with the composure induced by long familiarity with the good old English
     gentleman's courtesies. Only one little flash of indignant contempt shoots from St. John's grey
     eyes. "How I hate my father!" would be his reading of the great statesman's dying ejaculation,
      <quote>"How I love my country!" </quote></p>
<p>Nobody ever speaks much at dinner at Felton. St. John because he knows, if he trusted himself
     to speak at all, it would be to contradict his father flat <hi>whatever</hi> he said, for the
     mere pleasure of contradicting him; Lady Gerard because she has heard that it is impossible to
     do two things well at the same time, and as she is quite resolved upon doing the eating part
     well, she thinks she will leave the talking alone; Miss Blessington because, having contributed
     her hard, cold beauty to the entertainment, she thinks she has done enough.</p>
<p>The company being rather silent, Esther turns her eyes round the room, and scans the
     pictures. Two or three Gerards, by Sir Thomas Lawrence, in very full dress; a large
     copper-coloured woman by Rubens, in no dress at all; "Susanna and the Elders;" "Jupiter and
     Leda" (twice life-size); a "Venus Sleeping, surprised by Satyrs" (a great gem); and many other
     like subjects, such as one mostly meets with in the dining-rooms of English nobles and
     gentles—subjects pleasant and profitable, to employ the eyes and minds of their daughters while
     engaged in eating their dinners. Esther is staring hard at Susanna's fat, coy face, when her
     attention is recalled by Mr. Gerard's voice addressing her. She starts and blushes furiously,
     like a child whose fingers have been found straying among the jam-pots. He looks amused at her
     confusion.</p>
<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7385-084"/>
<p>"I have just been thinking, Miss Craven, how pleasant your first impressions of us must be.
     What a well-mannered, courteous family you must think us!—I tumbling out of the window at the
     risk of breaking my neck to avoid you, and my father and mother going to dinner without
     you."</p>
<p>"If you had been a little quicker in your movements, I should have known nothing about you,"
     responds she, the carmine called forth by her detection dying slowly out of her cheeks, and
     noticing only the half of his sentence that refers to himself.</p>
<p>"Ah! I am not so young as I was" (with a sigh); "but, to tell the truth, we had just been
     dragging the pool, like Boodles in 'Happy Thoughts,' and I was such a mass of mud that I had
     not moral courage to face you."</p>
<p>"We should have met on equal terms. I was as black as a coal, was not I?"</p>
<p>"Railroads do make one wonderfully dusty," replies Miss Blessington, with a polite, evasive
     platitude.</p>
<p>"I had a worse infliction than any dust to bear," says Esther, stretching her long throat
     around the bigonia to get a fuller view of her <foreign xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis.</foreign></p>
<p>"A baby, of course?" replies he, stretching his neck too for a like purpose.</p>
<p>"An aggravated case of baby—a baby that had something odd the matter with it."</p>
<p>"Not so bad as a man drinking sherry," says he, his grey eyes and a bit of his nose laughing
     through the leaves; "a woman eating gingerbread is bad enough. I travelled once with a woman
     who ate gingerbread from London to Holyhead without stopping."</p>
<p>"And did not offer you any?" </p>
<p>"Good heavens, no! What a prodigious suggestion!—that would have been adding insult to
     injury."</p>
<p>"If I had been travelling with you I should undoubtedly
     <pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7385-085"/> have offered you some. I should have judged you by myself,
     and I am very fond of gingerbread."</p>
<p>"Indeed!"</p>
<p>"And" (with a mischievous look) "fonder still of peppermint lozenges, particularly in church
     on hot Sunday afternoons."</p>
<p>They were getting quite voluble, chatting and chirping like a nest of magpies—like children
     playing and laughing in a garden, unmindful that in a cave in a corner is a great old bear who
     may pounce out on them at any moment. The Felton bear pounces.</p>
<p>"What the devil do you mean leaving that door open Morris! John! George! Here, some of you!
     there's a door open somewhere between here and the kitchen: Don't contradict me, sir! I say
     there is; if I catch you propping those swing doors open," etc. etc.</p>
<milestone rend="stars" unit="section"/>
<p>The birds have gone to bed, and the slugs come out to walk on the damp garden paths. Now and
     then a little wind gets up, whispers a word or two to the polished laurel leaves, and lies down
     again. There is a carpet of thin, smoke-grey clouds over heaven's blue floor. The two girls are
     strolling up and down the terrace walk. Esther has got a red cloak thrown about her shoulders;
     she is not in the least afraid of taking cold, and declined the offer of it in the first
     instance; but on second thoughts, reflecting that the dining-room windows look on the terrace,
     and that the fairy prince may see and like the combination of black eyes and red cloth (fairy
     princes being always partial to gay colours), accepted it.</p>
<p>I have called Esther "little," and Miss Blessington "large;" but the truth is they are much
     of a height. The difference between them is, that one is a young, slight sapling that has, been
     so busy shooting up skywards, that it has
     <pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7385-086"/> had no leisure to grow broad, and that the other is a
     full-grown, spreading, stately forest tree. And yet they are the same age; but some women
     develope, mind and body, much quicker than others.</p>
<p>From the unshuttered dining-room windows comes a great square of yellow lamplight, and lies
     smooth upon the gravel. Looking in you see rifled fruit dishes, half-filled wine-glasses, moths
     flying round and round the lamp globes, trying their best to find an entrance to fiery
     death.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, in his red velvet easy chair, with his white duck legs stretched out before
     him—duck trousers and a blue coat and brass buttons are, I need hardly say, the fine old
     English gentleman's dinner costume—with his head thrown back, till you can see either up into
     his brains or down his throat, whichever you choose. St. John, with his elbow resting on the
     shining oak table, which reflects it as a mirror would, and his head on his hand, in a brown
     study.</p>
<p>"Do you always walk up and down here, Miss Blessington?" inquires Esther, who is getting
     rather tired of pacing along, along, along monotonously, with her gown sweeping a little
     avalanche of pebbles behind her.</p>
<p>"Generally" (with a pretty smile).</p>
<p>Miss Blessington has a very pretty smile—an "angelic smile"—people say who see her only once;
     but it is only one, and is aired every hour of the day—comes out for Sir Thomas, for Lady
     Gerard, for servants, for dogs, for callers, for old almswomen, for St. John—so that none can
     take it personally, can they?</p>
<p>"By yourself?"</p>
<p>"Not generally."</p>
<p>The pretty smile is dashed with a faint complacency.</p>
<p>("H'm I That means with St. John—
     <pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7385-087"/>
<quote>
<l rend="ti 4">"'Walking in a shady grove</l>
<l rend="ti 4">With my Juliana.'</l></quote> Pleasant look-out for me! A bad third! What a
     pity that Bob is not here ! we should be a <foreign xml:lang="fr">partie carrée</foreign>, and
     might change partners every now and then; Miss Blessington should have Bob, and I would have
     St. John!")</p>
<p>Below the terrace spreads a large square of grass, uninvaded by flower-bed or shrub, mowed
     and rolled, rolled and mowed, into the similitude of a pancake for flatness. There
     croquet-hoops glance whitely in the soft half-light; mallets lie strewn like dead soldiers
     after a battle; balls red, blue, and yellow, like great ripe fruit tumbled among the grass.</p>
<p>"Is this your croquet-ground?" </p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Nice and level?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Like a billiard table, only a prettier green?"</p>
<p>"Yes; would you like a game?" </p>
<p>"Better than doing nothing, isn't it?" answers Esther, cheerily; she being a young woman to
     whom the words <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>enjoyment</hi> are not synonymous, as they mostly grow to
     be to people in later years.</p>
<p>From the dining-room comes the faint melody of the trombone, played with the skill of much
     practice by Sir Thomas's nose. Some one comes to the window, looks out, puts a hand on the
     sill, and jumps down. St. John apparently has an aversion from going out and coming in by the
     authorised modes of exit and entrance. Now that one can see him without any bigonia
     interposing, one notices that he has kind, eager eyes—eyes that seem to be looking, looking for
     something that they have not found yet—and rather a long nose, that the sun has got hold of and
     browned, as a cook browns mashed potatoes.</p>
<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7385-088"/>
<p>"Won't you join us, St. John ?" asks Miss Blessington, stooping to reinstate a fallen hoop,
     and looking calm invitation at him out of her great, fine, passionless, cow eyes.</p>
<p>St. John hesitates, and looks towards Esther to see whether she is not going to second the
     invitation; but she is balancing herself with her two feet on a croquet-mallet, and does not
     appear to see him.</p>
<p>"Gooseberry I may be," she thinks, "but, at all events, I won't be instrumental in making
     myself so."</p>
<p>"Do I ever play?" asks he, with petulance, walking off in a huff.</p>
<p>"He did not accept your invitation with the exultant gratitude one would have expected, did
     he?" says Miss Craven, maliciously.</p>
<p>"He hates the game," replies Miss Blessington, rather sharplier than is her wont—"
     particularly playing with odd numbers."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>The match begins; it is about as fair as a foot race between Deerfoot and a lame baby. Esther
     has played about six times in the course of her life; Miss Blessington about six thousand. Miss
     Blessington makes the round of the hoops in triumphant solitude, while poor Essie struggles
     feebly, ignorantly, unscientifically, to ring a bell that refuses to emit the faintest
     tinkle.</p>
<p>"Hare and tortoise!" cries she, laughing at her own discomfiture; "you'll go to sleep
     presently, and I shall crawl in and win."</p>
<p>"Since you wish me, I don't mind taking a mallet," says St. John, appearing suddenly round a
     big Wellingtonia, and looking confusedly conscious of being seen descending very awkwardly from
     his high horse.</p>
<p>"How do you know we wish you to take one?—we never said so," says Essie, flashing at him with
     her wicked, laughing,
     <pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7385-089"/> half-lowered eyes. ("Since I am another's and he is
     another's, I don't see why we should not try to amuse each other," she says to herself.)</p>
<p>"It is your turn to play, Miss Craven," interposes Constance, coldly.</p>
<p>"Come to my rescue, won't you?" says Esther, making her seventy-second careless, abortive
     attempt at the bell, and throwing twice as much <foreign xml:lang="fr">empressement</foreign>
     into her voice from the amiable motive that she thinks such <foreign xml:lang="fr">empressement</foreign> is displeasing to Miss Blessington.</p>
<p>"You snubbed me so just now that I don't think I will. I'll leave you to perish miserably,"
     answers he, looking at her as he speaks with an intentness only excusable by the dim light, and
     the indistinctness of all objects in it.</p>
<p>"Constance, if you don't mind I'll take one of Miss Craven's balls."</p>
<p>"If you remember, I asked you to join us half an hour ago," replies Constance, in her
     measured way.</p>
<p>"I make one stipulation before we start," cries Esther, gaily, "and that is, that you make no
     remarks upon my play except such as are of a laudatory nature."</p>
<p>"I'll make no stipulation of the kind," answers he, gaily too; "if I see anything
     reprehensible I shall testify."</p>
<p>Fate does not smile upon the union of St. John and Esther. Disgrace and disaster attend their
     arms; in ignorance, unskilfulness, and general incapacity, St. John is no whit inferior to his
     partner.</p>
<p>"Why, you play worse than I do," cries she, delighted at the discovery.</p>
<p>"I know I do," he answers, not too amiably; " I should be ashamed of myself if I did not; it
     is the vilest, stupidest game ever any idiot invented; no play in it whatever. All luck! all
     chance! Look there!" pointing with a sort of ill-tempered resignation to Constance, who, with
     dress delicately
     <pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7385-090"/> lifted with one hand, and foot gracefully poised, is
     inflicting heavy chastisement, with a calm, satisfied vindictiveness, on his ball.</p>
<p>"Take that, you fool you !" (this is addressed to the ball, not to Miss Blessington) hurling
     his mallet at it as it scuds swiftly over the sward and lodges in the pink and purple breast of
     an aster bed. The head and handle of the mallet fly asunder from the violence of their passage
     through the air, and Mr. Gerard is reduced to the ignominy of picking up the <foreign xml:lang="lat">disjecta membra</foreign> and hammering them together again.</p>
<p>"You must make a sensation when you go to a croquet party," remarks Esther,
     sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Do you think so badly of me as to suppose I ever do? is thy servant a curate that he should
     do this thing?" he answers, coming over and standing close to her.</p>
<p>"Please attend to the game, St. John! It is you to play!" exclaims Constance, with
     suppressed, lady-like irritation, from the other end of the ground, where she stands in
     majestic solitude.</p>
<p>It is the penalty of greatness to be lonely. A few more egregious blunders on the part of the
     firm of Gerard and Craven, a few more masterstrokes by Miss Blessington, and the game draws to
     a conclusion.</p>
<p>"It is ridiculous playing against such luck as yours, Constance," cries St. John, flinging
     down his weapon in an unjust, unreasonable fury. "It is always the same; it does not matter
     what—whist, billiards, anything—always the same story. Take my advice" (turning to Essie, and
     speaking eagerly), "never play at anything, or do anything, or be anything with me, or you'll
     be sure to be a loser. I am the most unlucky devil under the sun." Then he feels that he is
     making a fool of himself, and walks off in a rage.</p>
<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7385-091"/>
<p>"Why, he is <hi>really</hi> cross," says Esther, opening her great eyes and looking a little
     blankly after him.</p>
<p>"He is rather odd-tempered," answers Miss Blessington, composedly; "and the most singular
     thing is, that it is always the people he is fondest of with whom he is most easily
     irritated."</p>
<p>"How fond he must be of you!" says Esther, internally.</p>
