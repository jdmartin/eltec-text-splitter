<head>CHAPTER XI</head>
<p>Farewell to the mountains!</p>
<p>The scene in which the next act of this unpretending history is to run its course is of a
      very different kind. In place of the rugged northern nature—a nature wild and solitary indeed,
      but still rich, luxuriant, and friendly to the senses of the traveller, even in its loneliest
      places. The heaths and woods of some districts of Surrey are scarcely more thickly peopled
      than the fells of Westmoreland; the walker may wander for miles, and still enjoy an untamed
      primitive earth, guiltless of boundary or furrow, the undisturbed home of all that grows and
      flies, where the rabbits, the lizards, and the birds live their life as they please, either
      ignorant of intruding man or strangely little incommoded by his neighbourhood. And yet there
      is nothing forbidding or austere in these wide solitudes. The patches of graceful birch-wood;
      the miniature lakes nestling among them; the brakes of ling—pink, faintly scented, a feast for
      every sense; the stretches of purple heather, glowing into scarlet under the touch of the sun;
      the scattered farm-houses, so mellow in colour, so pleasant in outline; the general softness
      and lavishness of the earth and all it bears, make these Surrey commons not a wilderness but a
      paradise. Nature, indeed, here is like some spoilt petulant child. She will bring forth
      nothing, or almost nothing, for man's grosser needs. Ask her to bear corn or pasture flocks,
      and she will be miserly and grudging. But ask her only to be beautiful, enticing, capriciously
      lovely, and she will throw herself into the task with all the abandonment, all the energy,
      that heart could wish.</p>
<p>It is on the borders of one of the wilder districts of a county, which is throughout a
      strange mixture of suburbanism and the desert, that we next meet with Robert and Catherine
      Elsmere. The rectory of Murewell occupied the highest point of a gentle swell of ground which
      sloped through cornfields and woods to a plain of boundless heather on the south, and climbed
      away on the north towards the long chalk ridge of the Hog's Back. It was a square white house
      pretending neither to beauty nor state, a little awkwardly and barely placed, with only a
      small stretch of grass and a low hedge between it and the road. A
      <pb/> few tall firs climbing above the roof gave a little grace and clothing to its
      southern side, and behind it there was a garden sloping softly down towards the village at its
      foot—a garden chiefly noticeable for its grass walks, the luxuriance of the fruit trees
      clinging to its old red walls, and the masses of pink and white phloxes which now in August
      gave it the floweriness and the gaiety of an Elizabethan song. Below in the hollow and to the
      right lay the picturesque medley of the village—roofs and gables and chimneys, yellow-gray
      thatch, shining whitewash, and mellowed brick, making a bright patchwork among the softening
      trees, thin wreaths of blue smoke, like airy ribbons, tangled through it all. Rising over the
      rest was a house of some dignity. It had been an old manor-house, now it was half ruinous and
      the village inn. Some generations back the squire of the day had dismantled it, jealous that
      so big a house should exist in the same parish as the Hall, and the spoils of it had furnished
      the rectory; so that the homely house was fitted inside with mahogany doors and carved
      cupboard fronts, in which Robert delighted, and in which even Catherine felt a proprietary
      pleasure.</p>
<p>Altogether a quiet, rural, English spot. If the house had no beauty, it commanded a world of
      loveliness. All around it—north, south, and west—there spread, as it were, a vast playground
      of heather and wood and grassy common, in which the few workaday patches of hedge and ploughed
      land seemed ingulfed and lost. Close under the rectory windows, however, was a vast sloping
      cornfield, belonging to the glebe, the largest and fruitfulest of the neighbourhood. At the
      present moment it was just ready for the reaper—the golden ears had clearly but a few more
      days or hours to ripple in the sun. It was bounded by a dark summer-scorched belt of wood, and
      beyond, over the distance, rose a blue pointed hill, which seemed to be there only to attract
      and make a centre for the sunsets.</p>
<p>As compared with her Westmoreland life, the first twelve months of wifehood had been to
      Catherine Elsmere a time of rapid and changing experience. A few days out of their honeymoon
      had been spent at Oxford. It was a week before the opening of the October term, but many of
      the senior members of the University were already in residence, and the stagnation of the Long
      Vacation was over. Langham was up; so was Mr. Grey, and many another old friend of Robert's.
      The bride and bridegroom were much fêted in a quiet way. They dined in many common rooms and
      bursaries; they were invited to many luncheons, whereat the superabundance of food and the
      length of time spent upon it made the Puritan Catherine uncomfortable; and Langham devoted
      himself to taking the wife through colleges and gardens, Schools and Bodleian, in most
      orthodox fashion, indemnifying himself afterwards for the sense of constraint her presence
      imposed upon him by a talk and a smoke with Robert.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>He could not understand the Elsmere marriage. That a creature so mobile, so sensitive, so
      susceptible as Elsmere should have fallen in love with this stately silent woman, with her
      very evident rigidities of thought and training, was only another illustration of the
      mysteries of matrimony. He could not get on with her, and after a while did not try to do
      so.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt as to Elsmere's devotion. He was absorbed, wrapped up in her.</p>
<p>'She has affected him,' thought the tutor, 'at a period of life when he is more struck by
      the difficulty of being morally strong than by the difficulty of being intellectually clear.
      The touch of religious genius in her braces him like the breath of an Alpine wind. One can see
      him expanding, glowing under it. <hi>Bien!</hi> sooner he than I. To be fair, however, let me
      remember that she decidedly does not like me—which may cut me off from Elsmere. However'—and
      Langham sighed over his fire—'what have he and I to do with one another in the future? By all
      the laws of character something untoward might come out of this marriage. But she will mould
      him, rather than he her. Besides, she will have children—and that solves most things.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if Langham dissected the bride as he dissected most people, Robert, with that
      keen observation which lay hidden somewhere under his careless boyish ways, noticed many
      points of change about his old friend. Langham seemed to him less human, more strange, than
      ever; the points of contact between him and active life were lessening in number term by term.
      He lectured only so far as was absolutely necessary for the retention of his post, and he
      spoke with wholesale distaste of his pupils. He had set up a book on 'The Schools of Athens,'
      but when Robert saw the piles of disconnected notes already accumulated, he perfectly
      understood that the book was a mere blind, a screen, behind which a difficult fastidious
      nature trifled and procrastinated as it pleased.</p>
<p>Again, when Elsmere was an undergraduate Langham and Grey had been intimate. Now, Langham's
      tone <hi>à propos</hi> of Grey's politics and Grey's dreams of Church Reform was as languidly
      sarcastic as it was with regard to most of the strenuous things of life. 'Nothing particular
      is true,' his manner said, 'and all action is a degrading <hi>pis-aller</hi>. Get through the
      day somehow, with as little harm to yourself and other people as may be; do your duty if you
      like it, but, for heaven's sake, don't cant about it to other people!'</p>
<p>If the affinities of character count for much, Catherine and Henry Grey should certainly
      have understood each other. The tutor liked the look of Elsmere's wife. His kindly brown eyes
      rested on her with pleasure; he tried in his shy but friendly way to get at her, and there was
      in both of them a touch of homeliness, a sheer power of unworldliness that should have drawn
      them together. And indeed Catherine felt the charm, the spell of this born leader of men. But
      she watched him with
      <pb/> a sort of troubled admiration, puzzled, evidently, by the halo of moral dignity
      surrounding him, which contended with something else in her mind respecting him. Some words of
      Robert's, uttered very early in their acquaintance, had set her on her guard. Speaking of
      religion, Robert had said, 'Grey is not one of us'; and Catherine, restrained by a hundred
      ties of training and temperament, would not surrender herself, and could not if she would.</p>
<p>Then had followed their home-coming to the rectory, and that first institution of their
      common life, never to be forgotten for the tenderness and the sacredness of it. Mrs. Elsmere
      had received them, and had then retired to a little cottage of her own close by. She had of
      course already made the acquaintance of her daughter-in-law, for she had been the Thornburghs'
      guest for ten days before the marriage in September, and Catherine, moreover, had paid her a
      short visit earlier in the summer. But it was now that for the first time she realised to the
      full the character of the woman Robert had married. Catherine's manner to her was sweetness
      itself. Parted from her own mother as she was, the younger woman's strong filial instincts
      spent themselves in tending the mother who had been the guardian and life of Robert's youth.
      And Mrs. Elsmere in return was awed by Catherine's moral force and purity of nature, and proud
      of her personal beauty, which was so real, in spite of the severity of the type, and to which
      marriage had given, at any rate for the moment, a certain added softness and brilliancy.</p>
<p>But there were difficulties in the way. Catherine was a little too apt to treat Mrs. Elsmere
      as she would have treated her own mother. But to be nursed and protected, to be screened from
      draughts, and run after with shawls and stools was something wholly new and intolerable to
      Mrs. Elsmere. She could not away with it, and as soon as she had sufficiently lost her first
      awe of her daughter-in-law she would revenge herself in all sorts of droll ways, and with
      occasional flashes of petulant Irish wit which would make Catherine colour and draw back. Then
      Mrs. Elsmere, touched with remorse, would catch her by the neck and give her a resounding
      kiss, which perhaps puzzled Catherine no less than her sarcasm of a minute before.</p>
<p>Moreover Mrs. Elsmere felt ruefully from the first that her new daughter was decidedly
      deficient in the sense of humour.</p>
<p>'I believe it's that father of hers,' she would say to herself crossly. 'By what Robert
      tells me of him he must have been one of the people who get ill in their minds for want of a
      good mouth-filling laugh now and then. The man who can't amuse himself a bit out of the world
      is sure to get his head addled somehow, poor creature.'</p>
<p>Certainly it needed a faculty of laughter to be always able to take Mrs. Elsmere on the
      right side. For instance, Catherine
      <pb/> was more often scandalised than impressed by her mother-in-law's charitable
      performances.</p>
<p>Mrs. Elsmere's little cottage was filled with workhouse orphans sent to her from different
      London districts. The training of these girls was the chief business of her life, and a very
      odd training it was, conducted in the noisiest way and on the most familiar terms. It was
      undeniable that the girls generally did well, and they invariably adored Mrs. Elsmere, but
      Catherine did not much like to think about them. Their household teaching under Mrs. Elsmere
      and her old servant Martha—as great an original as herself—was so irregular, their religious
      training so extraordinary, the clothes in which they were allowed to disport themselves so
      scandalous to the sober taste of the rector's wife, that Catherine involuntarily regarded the
      little cottage on the hill as a spot of misrule in the general order of the parish. She would
      go in, say, at eleven o'clock in the morning, find her mother-in-law in bed, half-dressed,
      with all her handmaidens about her, giving her orders, reading her letters and the newspaper,
      cutting out her girls' frocks, instructing them in the fashions, or delivering little homilies
      on questions suggested by the news of the day to the more intelligent of them. The room, the
      whole house, would seem to Catherine in a detestable litter. If so, Mrs. Elsmere never
      apologised for it. On the contrary, as she saw Catherine sweep a mass of miscellaneous
       <hi>débris</hi> off a chair in search of a seat, the small bright eyes would twinkle with
      something that was certainly nearer amusement than shame.</p>
<p>And in a hundred other ways Mrs. Elsmere's relations with the poor of the parish often made
      Catherine miserable. She herself had the most angelic pity and tenderness for sorrows and
      sinners; but sin was sin to her, and when she saw Mrs. Elsmere more than half attracted by the
      stronger vices, and in many cases more inclined to laugh with what was human in them than to
      weep over what was vile, Robert's wife would go away and wrestle with herself, that she might
      be betrayed into nothing harsh towards Robert's mother.</p>
<p>But fate allowed their differences, whether they were deep or shallow, no time to develop. A
      week of bitter cold at the beginning of January struck down Mrs. Elsmere, whose strange ways
      of living were more the result of certain long-standing delicacies of health than she had ever
      allowed any one to imagine. A few days of acute inflammation of the lungs, borne with a
      patience and heroism which showed the Irish character at its finest—a moment of agonised
      wrestling with that terror of death which had haunted the keen vivacious soul from its
      earliest consciousness, ending in a glow of spiritual victory—and Robert found himself
      motherless. He and Catherine had never left her since the beginning of the illness. In one of
      the intervals towards the end, when there was a faint power of speech, she drew Catherine's
      cheek down to her and kissed her.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'God bless you!' the old woman's voice said, with a solemnity in it which Robert knew well,
      but which Catherine had never heard before. 'Be good to him, Catherine—be always good to
      him!'</p>
<p>And she lay looking from the husband to the wife with a certain wistfulness which pained
      Catherine, she knew not why. But she answered with tears and tender words, and at last the
      mother's face settled into a peace which death did but confirm.</p>
<p>This great and unexpected loss, which had shaken to their depths all the feelings and
      affections of his youth, had thrown Elsmere more than ever on his wife. To him, made as it
      seemed for love and for enjoyment, grief was a novel and difficult burden. He felt with
      passionate gratitude that his wife helped him to bear it so that he came out from it not
      lessened but ennobled, that she preserved him from many a lapse of nervous weariness and
      irritation into which his temperament might easily have been betrayed.</p>
<p>And how his very dependence had endeared him to Catherine! That vibrating responsive quality
      in him, so easily mistaken for mere weakness, which made her so necessary to him—there is
      nothing perhaps which wins more deeply upon a woman. For all the while it was balanced in a
      hundred ways by the illimitable respect which his character and his doings compelled from
      those about him. To be the strength, the inmost joy of a man who within the conditions of his
      life seems to you a hero at every turn—there is no happiness more penetrating for a wife than
      this.</p>
<p>On this August afternoon the Elsmeres were expecting visitors. Catherine had sent the
      pony-carriage to the station to meet Rose and Langham, who was to escort her from Waterloo.
      For various reasons, all characteristic, it was Rose's first visit to Catherine's new
      home.</p>
<p>Now she had been for six weeks in London, and had been persuaded to come on to her sister,
      at the end of her stay. Catherine was looking forward to her coming with many tremors. The
      wild ambitious creature had been not one atom appeased by Manchester and its opportunities.
      She had gone back to Whindale in April only to fall into more hopeless discontent than ever.
      'She can hardly be civil to anybody,' Agnes wrote to Catherine. 'The cry now is all "London"
      or at least "Berlin," and she cannot imagine why papa should ever have wished to condemn us to
      such a prison.'</p>
<p>Catherine grew pale with indignation as she read the words, and thought of her father's
      short-lived joy in the old house and its few green fields, or of the confidence which had
      soothed his last moments, that it would be well there with his wife and children, far from the
      hubbub of the world.</p>
<p>But Rose and her whims were not facts which could be put aside. They would have to be
      grappled with, probably
      <pb/> humoured. As Catherine strolled out into the garden, listening alternately for
      Robert and for the carriage, she told herself that it would be a difficult visit. And the
      presence of Mr. Langham would certainly not diminish its difficulty. The mere thought of him
      set the wife's young form stiffening. A cold breath seemed to blow from Edward Langham, which
      chilled Catherine's whole being. Why was Robert so fond of him?</p>
<p>But the more Langham cut himself off from the world, the more Robert clung to him in his
      wistful affectionate way. The more difficult their intercourse became, the more determined the
      younger man seemed to be to maintain it. Catherine imagined that he often scourged himself in
      secret for the fact that the gratitude which had once flowed so readily had now become a
      matter of reflection and resolution.</p>
<p>'Why should we always expect to get pleasure from our friends?' he had said to her once with
      vehemence. 'It should be pleasure enough to love them.' And she knew very well of whom he was
      thinking.</p>
<p>How late he was this afternoon. He must have been a long round. She had news for him of
      great interest. The lodge-keeper from the Hall had just looked in to tell the rector that the
      squire and his widowed sister were expected home in four days.</p>
<p>But, interesting as the news was, Catherine's looks as she pondered it were certainly not
      looks of pleased expectation. Neither of them, indeed, had much cause to rejoice in the
      squire's advent. Since their arrival in the parish the splendid Jacobean Hall had been
      untenanted. The squire, who was abroad with his sister at the time of their coming, had sent a
      civil note to the new rector on his settlement in the parish, naming some common Oxford
      acquaintances, and desiring him to make what use of the famous Murewell Library he pleased. 'I
      hear of you as a friend to letters,' he wrote; 'do my books a service by using them.' The
      words were graceful enough. Robert had answered them warmly. He had also availed himself
      largely of the permission they had conveyed. We shall see presently that the squire, though
      absent, had already made a deep impression on the young man's imagination.</p>
<p>But unfortunately he came across the squire in two capacities. Mr. Wendover was not only the
      owner of Murewell, he was also the owner of the whole land of the parish, where, however, by a
      curious accident of inheritance, dating some generations back, and implying some very remote
      connection between the Wendover and Elsmere families, he was not the patron of the living. Now
      the more Elsmere studied him under this aspect, the deeper became his dismay. The estate was
      entirely in the hands of an agent who had managed it for some fifteen years, and of whose
      character the rector, before he had been two months in the parish, had formed the very poorest
      opinion. Robert, entering upon his duties with the ardour of the modern
      <pb/> reformer, armed not only with charity but with science, found himself confronted by
      the opposition of a man who combined the shrewdness of an attorney with the callousness of a
      drunkard. It seemed incredible that a great landowner should commit his interests and the
      interests of hundreds of human beings to the hands of such a person.</p>
<p>By and by, however, as the rector penetrated more deeply into the situation, he found his
      indignation transferring itself more and more from the man to the master. It became clear to
      him that in some respects Henslowe suited the squire admirably. It became also clear to him
      that the squire had taken pains for years to let it be known that he cared not one rap for any
      human being on his estate in any other capacity than as a rent-payer or wage-receiver. What!
      Live for thirty years in that great house, and never care whether your tenants and labourers
      lived like pigs or like men, whether the old people died of damp, or the children of
      diphtheria, which you might have prevented! Robert's brow grew dark over it.</p>
<p>The click of an opening gate. Catherine shook off her dreaminess at once, and hurried along
      the path to meet her husband. In another moment Elsmere came in sight, swinging along, a holly
      stick in his hand, his face aglow with health and exercise and kindling at the sight of his
      wife. She hung on his arm, and, with his hand laid tenderly on hers, he asked her how she
      fared. She answered briefly, but with a little flush, her eyes raised to his. She was within a
      few weeks of motherhood.</p>
<p>Then they strolled along talking. He gave her an account of his afternoon, which, to judge
      from the worried expression which presently effaced the joy of their meeting, had been spent
      in some unsuccessful effort or other. They paused after a while, and stood looking over the
      plain before them to a spot beyond the nearer belt of woodland, where from a little hollow
      about three miles off there rose a cloud of bluish smoke.</p>
<p>'He will do nothing!' cried Catherine, incredulous.</p>
<p>'Nothing! It is the policy of the estate, apparently, to let the old and bad cottages fall
      to pieces. He sneers at one for supposing any landowner has money for "philanthropy" just now.
      If the people don't like the houses they can go. I told him I should appeal to the squire as
      soon as he came home.'</p>
<p>'What did he say?'</p>
<p>'He smiled, as much as to say, "Do as you like, and be a fool for your pains." How the
      squire can let that man tyrannise over the estate as he does, I cannot conceive. Oh,
      Catherine, I am full of qualms about the squire!'</p>
<p>'So am I,' she said, with a little darkening of her clear look. 'Old Benham has just been in
      to say they are expected on Thursday.'</p>
<p>Robert started. 'Are these our last days of peace?' he said wistfully—'the last days of our
      honeymoon, Catherine?'</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>She smiled at him with a little quiver of passionate feeling under the smile.</p>
<p>'Can anything touch that?' she said under her breath.</p>
<p>'Do you know,' he said presently, his voice dropping, 'that it is only a month to our
      wedding day? Oh, my wife, have I kept my promise—is the new life as rich as the old?'</p>
<p>She made no answer, except the dumb sweet answer that love writes on eyes and lips. Then a
      tremor passed over her.</p>
<p>'Are we too happy? Can it be well—be right?'</p>
<p>'Oh, let us take it like children!' he cried, with a shiver, almost petulantly. 'There will
      be dark hours enough. It is so good to be happy.'</p>
<p>She leant her cheek fondly against his shoulder. To her life always meant self-restraint,
      self-repression, self-deadening, if need be. The Puritan distrust of personal joy as something
      dangerous and ensnaring was deep ingrained in her. It had no natural hold on him.</p>
<p>They stood a moment hand in hand fronting the cornfield and the sun-filled west, while the
      afternoon breeze blew back the man's curly reddish hair, long since restored to all its
      natural abundance.</p>
<p>Presently Robert broke into a broad smile.</p>
<p>'What do you suppose Langham has been entertaining Rose with on the way, Catherine? I
      wouldn't miss her remarks to-night on the escort we provided her for a good deal.'</p>
<p>Catherine said nothing, but her delicate eyebrows went up a little. Robert stooped and
      lightly kissed her.</p>
<p>'You never performed a greater act of virtue even in <hi>your</hi> life, Mrs. Elsmere, than
      when you wrote Langham that nice letter of invitation.'</p>
<p>And then the young rector sighed, as many a boyish memory came crowding upon him.</p>
<p>A sound of wheels! Robert's long legs took him to the gate in a twinkling, and he flung it
      open just as Rose drove up in fine style, a thin dark man beside her.</p>
<p>Rose lent her bright cheek to Catherine's kiss, and the two sisters walked up to the door
      together, while Robert and Langham loitered after them talking.</p>
<p>'Oh, Catherine!' said Rose under her breath, as they got into the drawing-room, with a
      little theatrical gesture, 'why on earth did you inflict that man and me on each other for two
      mortal hours?'</p>
<p>'Sh-sh!' said Catherine's lips, while her face gleamed with laughter.</p>
<p>Rose sank flushed upon a chair, her eyes glancing up with a little furtive anger in them as
      the two gentlemen entered the room.</p>
<p>'You found each other easily at Waterloo?' asked Robert.</p>
<p>'Mr. Langham would never have found <hi>me</hi>,' said Rose drily; 'but I pounced on him at
      last—just, I believe, as he was begin
      <pb/>ning to cherish the hope of an empty carriage and the solitary enjoyment of his
       <hi>Saturday Review</hi>.'</p>
<p>Langham smiled nervously. 'Miss Leyburn is too hard on a blind man,' he said, holding up his
      eyeglass apologetically; 'it was my eyes, not my will, that were at fault.'</p>
<p>Rose's lip curled a little. 'And Robert,' she cried, bending forward as though something had
      just occurred to her, 'do tell me—I vowed I would ask—<hi>is</hi> Mr. Langham a Liberal or a
      Conservative? <hi>He</hi> doesn't know!'</p>
<p>Robert laughed, so did Langham.</p>
<p>'Your sister,' he said, flushing, 'will have one so very precise in all one says.'</p>
<p>He turned his handsome olive face towards her, an unwonted spark of animation lighting up
      his black eyes. It was evident that he felt himself persecuted, but it was not so evident
      whether he enjoyed the process or disliked it.</p>
<p>'Oh dear, no!' said Rose nonchalantly. 'Only I have just come from a house where everybody
      either loathes Mr. Gladstone or would die for him to-morrow. There was a girl of seven and a
      boy of nine who were always discussing "Coercion" in the corners of the schoolroom. So, of
      course, I have grown political too, and began to catechise Mr. Langham at once, and when he
      said "he didn't know," I felt I should like to set those children at him! They would soon put
      some principles into him!'</p>
<p>'It is not generally lack of principle, Miss Rose,' said her brother-in-law, 'that turns a
      man a doubter in politics, but too much!'</p>
<p>And while he spoke, his eyes resting on Langham, his smile broadened as he recalled all
      those instances in their Oxford past, when he had taken a humble share in one of the herculean
      efforts on the part of Langham's friends, which were always necessary whenever it was a
      question of screwing a vote out of him on any debated University question.</p>
<p>'How dull it must be to have too much principle!' cried Rose. 'Like a mill choked with corn.
      No bread because the machine can't work!'</p>
<p>'Defend me from my friends!' cried Langham, roused. 'Elsmere, when did I give you a right to
      caricature me in this way? If I were interested,' he added, subsiding into his usual
      hesitating ineffectiveness, 'I suppose I should know my own mind.'</p>
<p>And then seizing the muffins, he stood presenting them to Rose as though in deprecation of
      any further personalities. Inside him there was a hot protest against an unreasonable young
      beauty whom he had done his miserable best to entertain for two long hours, and who in return
      had made him feel himself more of a fool than he had done for years. Since when had young
      women put on all these airs? In his young days they knew their place.</p>
<p>Catherine meanwhile sat watching her sister. The child was
      <pb/> more beautiful than ever, but in other outer respects the Rose of Long Whindale had
      undergone much transformation. The puffed sleeves, the æsthetic skirts, the naïve adornments
      of bead and shell, the formless hat, which it pleased her to imagine 'after Gainsborough,' had
      all disappeared. She was clad in some soft fawn-coloured garment, cut very much in the
      fashion; her hair was closely rolled and twisted about her lightly-balanced head; everything
      about her was neat and fresh and tight-fitting. A year ago she had been a damsel from the
      'Earthly Paradise'; now, so far as an English girl can achieve it, she might have been a model
      for Tissot. In this phase, as in the other, there was a touch of extravagance. The girl was
      developing fast, but had clearly not yet developed. The restlessness, the self-consciousness
      of Long Whindale were still there; out they spoke to the spectator in different ways.</p>
<p>But in her anxious study of her sister Catherine did not forget her place of hostess. 'Did
      our man bring you through the park, Mr. Langham?' she asked him timidly.</p>
<p>'Yes. What an exquisite old house!' he said, turning to her, and feeling through all his
      critical sense the difference between the gentle matronly dignity of the one sister and the
      young self-assertion of the other.</p>
<p>'Ah,' said Robert, 'I kept that as a surprise! Did you ever see a more perfect place?'</p>
<p>'What date?'</p>
<p>'Early Tudor—as to the oldest part. It was built by a relation of Bishop Fisher's; then
      largely rebuilt under James I. Elizabeth stayed there twice. There is a trace of a visit of
      Sidney's. Waller was there, and left a copy of verses in the library. Evelyn laid out a great
      deal of the garden. Lord Clarendon wrote part of his History in the garden, et cetera, et
      cetera. The place is steeped in associations, and as beautiful as a dream to begin with.'</p>
<p>'And the owner of all this is the author of <hi>The Idols of the Market-place</hi>?'</p>
<p>Robert nodded.</p>
<p>'Did you ever meet him at Oxford? I believe he was there once or twice during my time, but I
      never saw him.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Langham, thinking. 'I met him at dinner at the Vice-Chancellor's, now I
      remember. A bizarre and formidable person—very difficult to talk to,' he added
      reflectively.</p>
<p>Then as he looked up he caught a sarcastic twitch of Rose Leyburn's lip and understood it in
      a moment. Incontinently he forgot the squire and fell to asking himself what had possessed him
      on that luckless journey down. He had never seemed to himself more perverse, more
      unmanageable; and for once his philosophy did not enable him to swallow the certainty that
      this slim flashing creature must have thought him a morbid idiot with as much
       <hi>sangfroid</hi> as usual.</p>
<p>Robert interrupted his reflections by some Oxford question,
      <pb/> and presently Catherine carried off Rose to her room. On their way they passed a
      door, beside which Catherine paused hesitating, and then with a bright flush on the face,
      which had such maternal calm in it already, she threw her arm round Rose and drew her in. It
      was a white empty room, smelling of the roses outside, and waiting in the evening stillness
      for the life that was to be. Rose looked at it all—at the piles of tiny garments, the cradle,
      the pictures from Retsch's 'Song of the Bell,' which had been the companion of their own
      childhood, on the walls—and something stirred in the girl's breast.</p>
<p>'Catherine, I believe you have everything you want, or you soon will have!' she cried,
      almost with a kind of bitterness, laying her hands on her sister's shoulders.</p>
<p>'Everything but worthiness!' said Catherine softly, a mist rising in her calm gray eyes.
      'And you, Röschen,' she added wistfully, 'have you been getting a little more what you
      want?'</p>
<p>'What's the good of asking?' said the girl, with a little shrug of impatience. 'As if
      creatures like me ever got what they want! London has been good fun certainly—if one could get
      enough of it. Catherine, how long is that marvellous person going to stay?' and she pointed in
      the direction of Langham's room.</p>
<p>'A week,' said Catherine, smiling at the girl's disdainful tone. 'I was afraid you didn't
      take to him.'</p>
<p>'I never saw such a being before,' declared Rose—'never! I thought I should never get a
      plain answer from him about anything. He wasn't even quite certain it was a fine day! I wonder
      if you set fire to him whether he would be sure it hurt! A week, you say? Heigh ho! what an
      age!'</p>
<p>'Be kind to him,' said Catherine, discreetly veiling her own feelings, and caressing the
      curly golden head as they moved towards the door. 'He's a poor lone don, and he was so good to
      Robert!'</p>
<p>'Excellent reason for you, Mrs. Elsmere,' said Rose, pouting; 'but——'</p>
<p>Her further remarks were cut short by the sound of the front-door bell.</p>
<p>'Oh, I had forgotten Mr. Newcome!' cried Catherine, starting. 'Come down soon, Rose, and
      help us through.'</p>
<p>'Who is he?' inquired Rose sharply.</p>
<p>'A High Church clergyman near here, whom Robert asked to tea this afternoon,' said
      Catherine, escaping.</p>
<p>Rose took her hat off very leisurely. The prospect downstairs did not seem to justify
      despatch. She lingered and thought of 'Lohengrin' and Albani, of the crowd of artistic friends
      that had escorted her to Waterloo, of the way in which she had been applauded the night
      before, of the joys of playing Brahms with a long-haired pupil of Rubinstein's, who had
      dropped on one knee and kissed her hand at the end
      <pb/> of it, etc. During the last six weeks the colours of 'this threadbare world' had
      been freshening before her in marvellous fashion. And now, as she stood looking out, the quiet
      fields opposite, the sight of a cow pushing its head through the hedge, the infinite sunset
      sky, the quiet of the house, filled her with a sudden depression. How dull it all seemed—how
      wanting in the glow of life!</p>
