<head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>
<p>After dinner Lady Charlotte fixed herself at first on Catherine, whose quiet dignity during
      the somewhat trying ordeal of the dinner had impressed her, but a few minutes' talk produced
      in her the conviction that without a good deal of pains—and why should a Londoner, accustomed
      to the cream of things, take pains with a country clergyman's wife?—she was not likely to get
      much out of her. Her appearance promised more, Lady Charlotte thought, than her conversation
      justified, and she looked about for easier game.</p>
<p>'Are you Mr. Elsmere's sister?' said a loud voice over Rose's head; and Rose, who had been
      turning over an illustrated book, with a mind wholly detached from it, looked up to see Lady
      Charlotte's massive form standing over her.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'No, his sister-in-law,' said Rose, flushing in spite of herself, for Lady Charlotte was
      distinctly formidable.</p>
<p>'Hum,' said her questioner, depositing herself beside her. 'I never saw two sisters more
      unlike. You have got a very argumentative brother-in-law.'</p>
<p>Rose said nothing, partly from awkwardness, partly from rising antagonism.</p>
<p>'Did you agree with him?' asked Lady Charlotte, putting up her glass and remorselessly
      studying every detail of the pink dress, its ornaments, and the slippered feet peeping out
      beneath it.</p>
<p>'Entirely,' said Rose fearlessly, looking her full in the face.</p>
<p>'And what can you know about it, I wonder? However, you are on the right side. It is the
      fashion nowadays to have enthusiasms. I suppose you muddle about among the poor like other
      people?'</p>
<p>'I know nothing about the poor,' said Rose.</p>
<p>'Oh, then, I suppose you feel yourself effective enough in some other line?' said the other
      coolly. 'What is it—lawn tennis, or private theatricals, or—hem—prettiness?' And again the
      eyeglass went up.</p>
<p>'Whichever you like,' said Rose calmly, the scarlet on her cheek deepening, while she
      resolutely reopened her book. The manner of the other had quite effaced in her all that sense
      of obligation, as from the young to the old, which she had been very carefully brought up in.
      Never had she beheld such an extraordinary woman.</p>
<p>'Don't read,' said Lady Charlotte complacently. 'Look at me. It's your duty to talk to me,
      you know; and I won't make myself any more disagreeable than I can help. I generally make
      myself disagreeable, and yet, after all, there are a great many people who like me.'</p>
<p>Rose turned a countenance rippling with suppressed laughter on her companion. Lady Charlotte
      had a large fair face, with a great deal of nose and chin, and an erection of lace and
      feathers on her head that seemed in excellent keeping with the masterful emphasis of those
      features. Her eyes stared frankly and unblushingly at the world, only softened at intervals by
      the glasses which were so used as to make them a most effective adjunct of her conversation.
      Socially, she was absolutely devoid of weakness or of shame. She found society extremely
      interesting, and she always struck straight for the desirable things in it, making short work
      of all those delicate tentative processes of acquaintanceship by which men and women
      ordinarily sort themselves. Rose's brilliant vivacious beauty had caught her eye at dinner;
      she adored beauty as she adored anything effective, and she always took a queer pleasure in
      bullying her way into a girl's liking. It is a great thing to be persuaded that at bottom you
      have a good heart. Lady Charlotte was so persuaded, and allowed herself many things in
      consequence.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'What shall we talk about?' said Rose demurely. 'What a magnificent old house this is!'</p>
<p>'Stuff and nonsense! I don't want to talk about the house. I am sick to death of it. And if
      your people live in the parish, you are too. I return to my question. Come, tell me, what is
      your particular line in life? I am sure you have one, by your face. You had better tell me; it
      will do you no harm.'</p>
<p>Lady Charlotte settled herself comfortably on the sofa, and Rose, seeing that there was no
      chance of escaping her tormentor, felt her spirits rise to an encounter.</p>
<p>'Really—Lady Charlotte—' and she looked down, and then up, with a feigned
      bashfulness—'I—I—play a little.'</p>
<p>'Humph!' said her questioner again, rather disconcerted by the obvious missishness of the
      answer. 'You do, do you? More's the pity. No woman who respects herself ought to play the
      piano nowadays. A professional told me the other day that until nineteen-twentieths of the
      profession were strung up, there would be no chance for the rest; and as for amateurs, there
      is simply <hi>no</hi> room for them whatever. I can't conceive anything more <hi>passé</hi>
      than amateur pianoforte playing!'</p>
<p>'I don't play the piano,' said Rose meekly.</p>
<p>'What—the fashionable instrument, the banjo?' laughed Lady Charlotte. 'That would be really
      striking.'</p>
<p>Rose was silent again, the corners of her mouth twitching.</p>
<p>'Mrs. Darcy,' said her neighbour, raising her voice, 'this young lady tells me she plays
      something; what is it?'</p>
<p>Mrs. Darcy looked in a rather helpless way at Catherine. She was dreadfully afraid of Lady
      Charlotte.</p>
<p>Catherine, with a curious reluctance, gave the required information; and then Lady Charlotte
      insisted that the violin should be sent for, as it had not been brought.</p>
<p>'Who accompanies you?' she inquired of Rose.</p>
<p>'Mr. Langham plays very well,' said Rose indifferently.</p>
<p>Lady Charlotte raised her eyebrows. 'That dark, Byronic-looking creature who came with you?
      I should not have imagined him capable of anything sociable. Letitia, shall I send my maid to
      the rectory, or can you spare a man?'</p>
<p>Mrs. Darcy hurriedly gave orders, and Rose, inwardly furious, was obliged to submit. Then
      Lady Charlotte, having gained her point, and secured a certain amount of diversion for the
      evening, lay back on the sofa, used her fan, and yawned till the gentlemen appeared.</p>
<p>When they came in, the precious violin which Rose never trusted to any other hands but her
      own without trepidation had just arrived, and its owner, more erect than usual, because more
      nervous, was trying to prop up a dilapidated music-stand which Mrs. Darcy had unearthed for
      her. As Langham came in, she looked up and beckoned to him.</p>
<p>'Do you see?' she said to him impatiently, 'they have made
      <pb/> me play. Will you accompany me? I am very sorry, but there is no one else.'</p>
<p>If there was one thing Langham loathed on his own account, it was any sort of performance in
      public. But the half-plaintive look which accompanied her last words showed that she knew it,
      and he did his best to be amiable.</p>
<p>'I am altogether at your service,' he said, sitting down with resignation.</p>
<p>'It is all that tiresome woman, Lady Charlotte Wynnstay,' she whispered to him behind the
      music-stand. 'I never saw such a person in my life.'</p>
<p>'Macaulay's Lady Holland without the brains,' suggested Langham with languid vindictiveness
      as he gave her the note.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Wynnstay and the squire sauntered in together.</p>
<p>'A village Norman-Néruda?' whispered the guest to the host. The squire shrugged his
      shoulders.</p>
<p>'Hush!' said Lady Charlotte, looking severely at her husband. Mr. Wynnstay's smile instantly
      disappeared; he leant against the doorway and stared sulkily at the ceiling. Then the
      musicians began, on some Hungarian melodies put together by a younger rival of Brahms. They
      had not played twenty bars before the attention of every one in the room was more or less
      seized—unless we except Mr. Bickerton, whose children, good soul, were all down with some
      infantile ailment or other, and who was employed in furtively watching the clock all the time
      to see when it would be decent to order round the pony-carriage which would take him back to
      his pale overweighted spouse.</p>
<p>First came wild snatches of march music, primitive, savage, non-European; then a waltz of
      the lightest, maddest rhythm, broken here and there by strange barbaric clashes; then a song,
      plaintive and clinging, rich in the subtlest shades and melancholies of modern feeling.</p>
<p>'Ah, but <hi>excellent</hi>!' said Lady Charlotte once, under her breath, at a pause; 'and
      what <hi>entrain</hi>—what beauty!'</p>
<p>For Rose's figure was standing thrown out against the dusky blue of the tapestried walls,
      and from that delicate relief every curve, every grace, each tint—hair and cheek and gleaming
      arm gained an enchanting picture-like distinctness. There was jessamine at her waist and among
      the gold of her hair; the crystals on her neck, and on the little shoe thrown forward beyond
      her dress, caught the lamplight.</p>
<p>'How can that man play with her and not fall in love with her?' thought Lady Charlotte to
      herself, with a sigh, perhaps, for her own youth. 'He looks cool enough, however; the typical
      don with his nose in the air!'</p>
<p>Then the slow passionate sweetness of the music swept her away with it, she being in her way
      a connoisseur, and she ceased to speculate. When the sounds ceased there was silence for a
      moment. Mrs. Darcy, who had a piano in her sitting-room
      <pb/> whereon she strummed every morning with her tiny rheumatic fingers, and who had, as
      we know, strange little veins of sentiment running all about her, stared at Rose with open
      mouth. So did Catherine. Perhaps it was then for the first time that, touched by this
      publicity, this contagion of other people's feeling, Catherine realised fully against what a
      depth of stream she had been building her useless barriers.</p>
<p>'More! more!' cried Lady Charlotte.</p>
<p>The whole room seconded the demand save the squire and Mr. Bickerton. They withdrew together
      into a distant oriel. Robert, who was delighted with his little sister-in-law's success, went
      smiling to talk of it to Mrs. Darcy, while Catherine with a gentle coldness answered Mr.
      Longstaffe's questions on the same theme.</p>
<p>'Shall we?' said Rose, panting a little, but radiant, looking down on her companion.</p>
<p>'Command me!' he said, his grave lips slightly smiling, his eyes taking in the same vision
      that had charmed Lady Charlotte's. What a 'child of grace and genius!'</p>
<p>'But do you like it?' she persisted.</p>
<p>'Like it—like accompanying your playing?'</p>
<p>'Oh no!'—impatiently; 'showing off, I mean. I am quite ready to stop.'</p>
<p>'Go on; go on!' he said, laying his finger on the A. 'You have driven all my <hi>mauvaise
       honte</hi> away. I have not heard you play so splendidly yet.'</p>
<p>She flushed all over. 'Then we will go on,' she said briefly.</p>
<p>So they plunged again into an Andante and Scherzo of Beethoven. How the girl threw herself
      into it, bringing out the wailing love-song of the Andante, the dainty tripping mirth of the
      Scherzo, in a way which set every nerve in Langham vibrating! Yet the art of it was wholly
      unconscious. The music was the mere natural voice of her inmost self. A comparison full of
      excitement was going on in that self between her first impressions of the man beside her, and
      her consciousness of him, as he seemed to-night, human, sympathetic, kind. A blissful sense of
      a mission filled the young silly soul. Like David, she was pitting herself and her gift
      against those dark powers which may invade and paralyse a life.</p>
<p>After the shouts of applause at the end had yielded to a burst of talk, in the midst of
      which Lady Charlotte, with exquisite infelicity, might have been heard laying down the law to
      Catherine as to how her sister's remarkable musical powers might be best perfected, Langham
      turned to his companion,—</p>
<p>'Do you know that for years I have enjoyed nothing so much as the music of the last two
      days?'</p>
<p>His black eyes shone upon her, transfused with something infinitely soft and friendly. She
      smiled. 'How little I imagined that first evening that you cared for music!'</p>
<p>'Or about anything else worth caring for?' he asked her,
      <pb/> laughing, but with always that little melancholy note in the laugh.</p>
<p>'Oh, if you like,' she said, with a shrug of her white shoulders. 'I believe you talked to
      Catherine the whole of the first evening, when you weren't reading <hi>Hamlet</hi> in the
      corner, about the arrangements for women's education at Oxford.'</p>
<p>'Could I have found a more respectable subject?' he inquired of her.</p>
<p>'The adjective is excellent,' she said with a little face, as she put her violin into its
      case. 'If I remember right, Catherine and I felt it personal. None of us were ever educated,
      except in arithmetic, sewing, English history, the Catechism, and <hi>Paradise Lost</hi>. I
      taught myself French at seventeen, because one Molière wrote plays in it, and German because
      of Wagner. But they are <hi>my</hi> French and <hi>my</hi> German. I wouldn't advise anybody
      else to steal them!'</p>
<p>Langham was silent, watching the movements of the girl's agile fingers.</p>
<p>'I wonder,' he said at last, slowly, 'when I shall play that Beethoven again?'</p>
<p>'To-morrow morning if you have a conscience,' she said drily; 'we murdered one or two
      passages in fine style.'</p>
<p>He looked at her, startled. 'But I go by the morning train!' There was an instant's silence.
      Then the violin case shut with a snap.</p>
<p>'I thought it was to be Saturday,' she said abruptly.</p>
<p>'No,' he answered with a sigh, 'it was always Friday. There is a meeting in London I must
      get to to-morrow afternoon.'</p>
<p>'Then we shan't finish these Hungarian duets,' she said slowly, turning away from him to
      collect some music on the piano.</p>
<p>Suddenly a sense of the difference between the week behind him, with all its ups and downs,
      its quarrels, its <hi>ennuis</hi>, its moments of delightful intimity, of artistic freedom and
      pleasure, and those threadbare monotonous weeks into which he was to slip back on the morrow,
      awoke in him a mad inconsequent sting of disgust, of self-pity.</p>
<p>'No, we shall finish nothing,' he said in a voice which only she could hear, his hands lying
      on the keys; 'there are some whose destiny it is never to finish—never to have enough—to leave
      the feast on the table, and all the edges of life ragged!'</p>
<p>Her lips trembled. They were far away, in the vast room, from the group Lady Charlotte was
      lecturing. Her nerves were all unsteady with music and feeling, and the face looking down on
      him had grown pale.</p>
<p>'We make our own destiny,' she said impatiently. '<hi>We</hi> choose. It is all our own
      doing. Perhaps destiny begins things—friendship, for instance; but afterwards it is absurd to
      talk of anything but ourselves. We keep our friends, our chances, our—our joys,' she went on
      hurriedly, trying desperately to generalise, 'or we throw them away wilfully, because we
      choose.'</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>Their eyes were riveted on each other.</p>
<p>'Not wilfully,' he said under his breath. 'But—no matter. May I take you at your word, Miss
      Leyburn? Wretched shirker that I am, whom even Robert's charity despairs of: have I made a
      friend? Can I keep her?'</p>
<p>Extraordinary spell of the dark effeminate face—of its rare smile! The girl forgot all
      pride, all discretion. 'Try,' she whispered, and as his hand, stretching along the keyboard,
      instinctively felt for hers, for one instant—and another, and another—she gave it to him.</p>
<p>'Albert, come here!' exclaimed Lady Charlotte, beckoning to her husband; and Albert, though
      with a bad grace, obeyed. 'Just go and ask that girl to come and talk to me, will you? Why on
      earth didn't you make friends with her at dinner?'</p>
<p>The husband made some irritable answer, and the wife laughed.</p>
<p>'Just like you!' she said, with a good humour which seemed to him solely caused by the fact
      of his non-success with the beauty at table. 'You always expect to kill at the first stroke. I
      mean to take her in tow. Go and bring her here.'</p>
<p>Mr. Wynnstay sauntered off with as much dignity as his stature was capable of. He found Rose
      tying up her music at one end of the piano, while Langham was preparing to shut up the
      keyboard.</p>
<p>There was something appeasing in the girl's handsomeness. Mr. Wynnstay laid down his airs,
      paid her various compliments, and led her off to Lady Charlotte.</p>
<p>Langham stood by the piano, lost in a kind of miserable dream. Mrs. Darcy fluttered up to
      him.</p>
<p>'Oh, Mr. Langham, you play so <hi>beautifully</hi>! Do play a solo!'</p>
<p>He subsided on to the music-bench obediently. On any ordinary occasion tortures could not
      have induced him to perform in a room full of strangers. He had far too lively and fastidious
      a sense of the futility of the amateur.</p>
<p>But he played—what, he knew not. Nobody listened but Mrs. Darcy, who sat lost in an armchair
      a little way off, her tiny foot beating time. Rose stopped talking, started, tried to listen.
      But Lady Charlotte had had enough music, and so had Mr. Longstaffe, who was endeavouring to
      joke himself into the good graces of the Duke of Sedbergh's sister. The din of conversation
      rose at the challenge of the piano, and Langham was soon overcrowded.</p>
<p>Musically, it was perhaps as well, for the player's inward tumult was so great, that what
      his hands did he hardly knew or cared. He felt himself the greatest criminal unhung. Suddenly,
      through all that wilful mist of epicurean feeling which had been enwrapping him, there had
      pierced a sharp illumining beam from a girl's eyes aglow with joy, with hope, with tender
      <pb/>ness. In the name of Heaven, what had this growing degeneracy of every moral muscle
      led him to now? What! smile and talk, and smile—and be a villain all the time? What! encroach
      on a young life, like some creeping parasitic growth, taking all, able to give nothing in
      return—not even one genuine spark of genuine passion? Go philandering on till a child of
      nineteen shows you her warm impulsive heart, play on her imagination, on her pity, safe all
      the while in the reflection that by the next day you will be far away, and her task and yours
      will be alike to forget! He shrinks from himself as one shrinks from a man capable of injuring
      anything weak and helpless. To despise the world's social code, and then to fall conspicuously
      below its simplest articles; to aim at being pure intelligence, pure open-eyed rationality,
      and not even to succeed in being a gentleman, as the poor commonplace world understands it!
      Oh, to fall at her feet, and ask her pardon before parting for ever! But no—no more posing; no
      more dramatising. How can he get away most quietly—make least sign? The thought of that walk
      home in the darkness fills him with a passion of irritable impatience.</p>
<p>'Look at that Romney, Mr. Elsmere; just look at it!' cried Dr. Meyrick excitedly; 'did you
      ever see anything finer? There was one of those London dealer fellows down here last summer
      offered the squire four thousand pounds down on the nail for it.'</p>
<p>In this way Meyrick had been taking Robert round the drawing-room, doing the honours of
      every stick and stone in it, his eyeglass in his eye, his thin old face shining with pride
      over the Wendover possessions. And so the two gradually neared the oriel where the squire and
      Mr. Bickerton were standing.</p>
<p>Robert was in twenty minds as to any further conversation with the squire. After the ladies
      had gone, while every nerve in him was still tingling with anger, he had done his best to keep
      up indifferent talk on local matters with Mr. Bickerton. Inwardly he was asking himself
      whether he should ever sit at the squire's table and eat his bread again. It seemed to him
      that they had had a brush which would be difficult to forget. And as he sat there before the
      squire's wine, hot with righteous heat, all his grievances against the man and the landlord
      crowded upon him. A fig for intellectual eminence if it make a man oppress his inferiors and
      bully his equals!</p>
<p>But as the minutes passed on, the rector had cooled down. The sweet, placable, scrupulous
      nature began to blame itself. 'What, play your cards so badly, give up the game so rashly, the
      very first round? Nonsense! Patience and try again. There must be some cause in the
      background. No need to be white-livered, but every need, in the case of such a man as the
      squire, to take no hasty needless offence.'</p>
<p>So he had cooled and cooled, and now here were Meyrick and he close to the squire and his
      companion. The two men, as
      <pb/> the rector approached, were discussing some cases of common enclosure that had just
      taken place in the neighbourhood. Robert listened a moment, then struck in. Presently, when
      the chat dropped, he began to express to the squire his pleasure in the use of the library.
      His manner was excellent, courtesy itself, but without any trace of effusion.</p>
<p>'I believe,' he said at last, smiling, 'my father used to be allowed the same privileges. If
      so, it quite accounts for the way in which he clung to Murewell.'</p>
<p>'I had never the honour of Mr. Edward Elsmere's acquaintance,' said the squire frigidly.
      'During the time of his occupation of the rectory I was not in England.'</p>
<p>'I know. Do you still go much to Germany? Do you keep up your relations with Berlin?'</p>
<p>'I have not seen Berlin for fifteen years,' said the squire briefly, his eyes in their
      wrinkled sockets fixed sharply on the man who ventured to question him about himself,
      uninvited. There was an awkward pause. Then the squire turned again to Mr. Bickerton.</p>
<p>'Bickerton, have you noticed how many trees that storm of last February has brought down at
      the north-east corner of the park?'</p>
<p>Robert was inexpressibly galled by the movement, by the words themselves. The squire had not
      yet addressed a single remark of any kind about Murewell to <hi>him</hi>. There was a
      deliberate intention to exclude implied in this appeal to the man who was not the man of the
      place, on such a local point, which struck Robert very forcibly.</p>
<p>He walked away to where his wife was sitting.</p>
<p>'What time is it?' whispered Catherine, looking up at him.</p>
<p>'Time to go,' he returned, smiling, but she caught the discomposure in his tone and look at
      once, and her wifely heart rose against the squire. She got up, drawing herself together with
      a gesture that became her.</p>
<p>'Then let us go at once,' she said. 'Where is Rose?'</p>
<p>A minute later there was a general leave-taking. Oddly enough it found the squire in the
      midst of a conversation with Langham. As though to show more clearly that it was the rector
      personally who was in his black books, Mr. Wendover had already devoted some cold attention to
      Catherine both at and after dinner, and he had no sooner routed Robert than he moved in his
      slouching away across from Mr. Bickerton to Langham. And now, another man altogether, he was
      talking and laughing—describing apparently a reception at the French Academy—the epigrams
      flying, the harsh face all lit up, the thin bony fingers gesticulating freely.</p>
<p>The husband and wife exchanged glances as they stood waiting, while Lady Charlotte, in her
      loudest voice, was commanding Rose to come and see her in London any Thursday after the first
      of November. Robert was very sore. Catherine passion
      <pb/>ately felt it, and forgetting everything but him, longed to be out with him in the
      park comforting him.</p>
<p>'What an absurd fuss you have been making about that girl,' Wynnstay exclaimed to his wife
      as the Elsmere party left the room, the squire conducting Catherine with a chill politeness.
      'And now, I suppose, you will be having her up in town, and making some young fellow who ought
      to know better fall in love with her. I am told the father was a grammar-school headmaster.
      Why can't you leave people where they belong?'</p>
<p>'I have already pointed out to you,' Lady Charlotte observed calmly, 'that the world has
      moved on since you were launched into it. I can't keep up class-distinctions to please you;
      otherwise, no doubt, being the devoted wife I am, I might try. However, my dear, we both have
      our fancies. You collect Sèvres china with or without a pedigree,' and she coughed drily; 'I
      collect promising young women. On the whole, I think my hobby is more beneficial to you than
      yours is profitable to me.'</p>
<p>Mr. Wynnstay was furious. Only a week before he had been childishly, shamefully taken in by
      a Jew curiosity-dealer from Vienna, to his wife's huge amusement. If looks could have crushed
      her, Lady Charlotte would have been crushed. But she was far too substantial as she lay back
      in her chair, one large foot crossed over the other, and, as her husband very well knew, the
      better man of the two. He walked away, murmuring under his moustache words that would hardly
      have borne publicity, while Lady Charlotte, through her glasses, made a minute study of a
      little French portrait hanging some two yards from her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Elsmere party were stepping out into the warm damp of the night. The storm had
      died away, but a soft Scotch mist of rain filled the air. Everything was dark, save for a few
      ghostly glimmerings through the trees of the avenue; and there was a strong sweet smell of wet
      earth and grass. Rose had drawn the hood of her waterproof over her head, and her face gleamed
      an indistinct whiteness from its shelter. Oh this leaping pulse—this bright glow of
      expectation! How had she made this stupid blunder about his going? Oh, it was Catherine's
      mistake, of course, at the beginning. But what matter? Here they were in the dark, side by
      side, friends now, friends always. Catherine should not spoil their last walk together. She
      felt a passionate trust that <hi>he</hi> would not allow it.</p>
<p>'Wifie!' exclaimed Robert, drawing her a little apart, 'do you know it has just occurred to
      me that, as I was going through the park this afternoon by the lower footpath, I crossed
      Henslowe coming away from the house. Of course this is what has happened! <hi>He</hi> has told
      his story first. No doubt just before I met him he had been giving the squire a full and
      particular account—<hi>à la</hi> Henslowe—of my proceedings since I came. Henslowe lays it on
      thick—paints with a will. The squire
      <pb/> receives me afterwards as the meddlesome pragmatical priest he understands me to
      be; puts his foot down to begin with; and, <hi>hinc illæ lacrymæ</hi>. It's as clear as
      daylight! I thought that man had an odd twist of the lip as he passed me.'</p>
<p>'Then a disagreeable evening will be the worst of it,' said Catherine proudly. 'I imagine,
      Robert, you can defend yourself against that bad man?'</p>
<p>'He has got the start; he has no scruples; and it remains to be seen whether the squire has
      a heart to appeal to,' replied the young rector with sore reflectiveness. 'Oh, Catherine, have
      you ever thought, wifie, what a business it will be for us if I <hi>can't</hi> make friends
      with that man? Here we are at his gates—all our people in his power; the <hi>comfort</hi>, at
      any rate, of our social life depending on him. And what a strange, unmanageable, inexplicable
      being!'</p>
<p>Elsmere sighed aloud. Like all quick imaginative natures he was easily depressed, and the
      squire's sombre figure had for the moment darkened his whole horizon. Catherine laid her cheek
      against his arm in the darkness, consoling, remonstrating, every other thought lost in her
      sympathy with Robert's worries. Langham and Rose slipped out of her head; Elsmere's step had
      quickened, as it always did when he was excited, and she kept up without thinking.</p>
<p>When Langham found the others had shot ahead in the darkness, and he and his neighbour were
       <hi>tête-à-tête</hi>, despair seized him. But for once he showed a sort of dreary presence of
      mind. Suddenly, while the girl beside him was floating in a golden dream of feeling, he
      plunged with a stiff deliberation born of his inner conflict into a discussion of the German
      system of musical training. Rose, startled, made some vague and flippant reply. Langham
      pursued the matter. He had some information about it, it appeared, garnered up in his mind,
      which might perhaps some day prove useful to her. A St. Anselm's undergraduate, one Dashwood,
      an old pupil of his, had been lately at Berlin for six months, studying at the Conservatorium.
      Not long ago, being anxious to become a schoolmaster, he had written to Langham for a
      testimonial. His letter had contained a full account of his musical life. Langham proceeded to
      recapitulate it.</p>
<p>His careful and precise report of hours, fees, masters, and methods lasted till they reached
      the park gate. He had the smallest powers of social acting, and his rôle was dismally
      overdone. The girl beside him could not know that he was really defending her from himself.
      His cold altered manner merely seemed to her a sudden and marked withdrawal of his petition
      for her friendship. No doubt she had received that petition too effusively—and he wished there
      should be no mistake.</p>
<p>What a young smarting soul went through in that half-mile of listening is better guessed
      than analysed. There are certain
      <pb/> moments of shame, which only women know, and which seem to sting and burn out of
      youth all its natural sweet self-love. A woman may outlive them, but never forget them. If she
      pass through one at nineteen her cheek will grow hot over it at seventy. Her companion's
      measured tone, the flow of deliberate speech which came from him, the nervous aloofness of his
      attitude—every detail in that walk seemed to Rose's excited sense an insult.</p>
<p>As the park gate swung behind them she felt a sick longing for Catherine's shelter. Then all
      the pride in her rushed to the rescue and held that swooning dismay at the heart of her in
      check. And forthwith she capped Langham's minute account of the scale-method of a famous
      Berlin pianist by some witty stories of the latest London prodigy, a child-violinist,
      incredibly gifted, dirty, and greedy, whom she had made friends with in town. The girl's voice
      rang out sharp and hard under the trees. Where, in fortune's name, were the lights of the
      rectory? Would this nightmare never come to an end?</p>
<p>At the rectory gate was Catherine waiting for them, her whole soul one repentant alarm.</p>
<p>'Mr. Langham, Robert has gone to the study; will you go and smoke with him?'</p>
<p>'By all means. Good-night, then, Mrs. Elsmere.'</p>
<p>Catherine gave him her hand. Rose was trying hard to fit the lock of the gate into the hasp,
      and had no hand free. Besides, he did not approach her.</p>
<p>'Good-night!' she said to him over her shoulder.</p>
<p>'Oh, and Mr. Langham!' Catherine called after him as he strode away, 'will you settle with
      Robert about the carriage?'</p>
<p>He turned, made a sound of assent, and went on.</p>
<p>'When?' asked Rose lightly.</p>
<p>'For the nine o'clock train.'</p>
<p>'There should be a law against interfering with people's breakfast hour,' said Rose;
      'though, to be sure, a guest may as well get himself gone early and be done with it. How you
      and Robert raced, Cathie! We did our best to catch you up, but the pace was too good.'</p>
<p>Was there a wild taunt, a spice of malice in the girl's reckless voice? Catherine could not
      see her in the darkness, but the sister felt a sudden trouble invade her.</p>
<p>'Rose, darling, you are not tired?'</p>
<p>'Oh dear, no! Good-night, sleep well. What a goose Mrs. Darcy is!'</p>
<p>And, barely submitting to be kissed, Rose ran up the steps and upstairs.</p>
<p>Langham and Robert smoked till midnight. Langham for the first time gave Elsmere an outline
      of his plans for the future, and Robert, filled with dismay at this final breach with Oxford
      and human society, and the only form of practical life possible to such a man, threw himself
      into protests more and
      <pb/> more vigorous and affectionate. Langham listened to them at first with sombre
      silence, then with an impatience which gradually reduced Robert to a sore puffing at his pipe.
      There was a long space during which they sat together, the ashes of the little fire Robert had
      made dropping on the hearth, and not a word on either side.</p>
<p>At last Elsmere could not bear it, and when midnight struck he sprang up with an impatient
      shake of his long body, and Langham took the hint, gave him a cold good-night, and went.</p>
<p>As the door shut upon him Robert dropped back into his chair, and sat on, his face in his
      hands, staring dolefully at the fire. It seemed to him the world was going crookedly. A day on
      which a man of singularly open and responsive temper makes a new enemy, and comes nearer than
      ever before to losing an old friend, shows very blackly to him in the calendar, and, by way of
      aggravation, Robert Elsmere says to himself at once that somehow or other there must be fault
      of his own in the matter.</p>
<p>Rose!—pshaw! Catherine little knows what stuff that cold intangible soul is made of.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Langham was standing heavily, looking out into the night. The different elements
      in the mountain of discomfort that weighed upon him were so many that the weary mind made no
      attempt to analyse them. He had a sense of disgrace, of having stabbed something gentle that
      had leant upon him, mingled with a strong intermittent feeling of unutterable relief. Perhaps
      his keenest regret was that, after all, it had not been love! He had offered himself up to a
      girl's just contempt, but he had no recompense in the shape of a great addition to knowledge,
      to experience. Save for a few doubtful moments at the beginning, when he had all but surprised
      himself in something more poignant, what he had been conscious of had been nothing more than a
      suave and delicate charm of sentiment, a subtle surrender to one exquisite æsthetic impression
      after another. And these things in other relations the world had yielded him before.</p>
<p>'Am I sane?' he muttered to himself. 'Have I ever been sane? Probably not. The disproportion
      between my motives and other men's is too great to be normal. Well, at least I am sane enough
      to shut myself up. Long after that beautiful child has forgotten she ever saw me I shall still
      be doing penance in the desert.'</p>
<p>He threw himself down beside the open window with a groan. An hour later he lifted a face
      blanched and lined, and stretched out his hand with avidity towards a book on the table. It
      was an obscure and difficult Greek text, and he spent the greater part of the night over it,
      rekindling in himself with feverish haste the embers of his one lasting passion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a room overhead, another last scene in this most futile of dramas was passing.
      Rose, when she came in,
      <pb/> had locked the door, torn off her dress and her ornaments, and flung herself on the
      edge of the bed, her hands on her knees, her shoulders drooping, a fierce red spot on either
      cheek. There for an indefinite time she went through a torture of self-scorn. The incidents of
      the week passed before her one by one—her sallies, her defiances, her impulsive friendliness,
      the <hi>élan</hi>, the happiness of the last two days, the self-abandonment of this evening.
      Oh, intolerable—intolerable!</p>
<p>And all to end with the intimation that she had been behaving like a forward child—had gone
      too far and must be admonished—made to feel accordingly! The poisoned arrow pierced deeper and
      deeper into the girl's shrinking pride. The very foundations of self-respect seemed
      overthrown.</p>
<p>Suddenly her eye caught a dim and ghostly reflection of her own figure, as she sat with
      locked hands on the edge of the bed, in a long glass near, the only one of the kind which the
      rectory household possessed. Rose sprang up, snatched at the candle, which was flickering in
      the air of the open window, and stood erect before the glass, holding the candle above her
      head.</p>
<p>What the light showed her was a slim form in a white dressing-gown, that fell loosely about
      it; a rounded arm upstretched; a head, still crowned with its jessamine wreath, from which the
      bright hair fell heavily over shoulders and bosom; eyes, under frowning brows, flashing a
      proud challenge at what they saw; two lips, 'indifferent red,' just open to let the quick
      breath come through—all thrown into the wildest chiaroscuro by the wavering candle flame.</p>
<p>Her challenge was answered. The fault was not there. Her arm dropped. She put down the
      light.</p>
<p>'I <hi>am</hi> handsome,' she said to herself, her mouth quivering childishly. 'I am. I may
      say it to myself.'</p>
<p>Then, standing by the window, she stared into the night. Her room, on the opposite side of
      the house from Langham's, looked over the cornfields and the distance. The stubbles gleamed
      faintly; the dark woods, the clouds teased by the rising wind, sent a moaning voice to greet
      her.</p>
<p>'I hate him! I hate him!' she cried to the darkness, clenching her cold little hand.</p>
<p>Then presently she slipped on to her knees, and buried her head in the bed-clothes. She was
      crying—angry stifled tears which had the hot impatience of youth in them. It all seemed to her
      so untoward. This was not the man she had dreamed of—the unknown of her inmost heart.
       <hi>He</hi> had been young, ardent, impetuous like herself. Hand in hand, eye flashing into
      eye, pulse answering to pulse, they would have flung aside the veil hanging over life and
      plundered the golden mysteries behind it.</p>
<p>She rebels; she tries to see the cold alien nature which has laid this paralysing spell upon
      her as it is, to reason herself back to peace—to indifference. The poor child flies from her
      <pb/> own half-understood trouble; will none of it; murmurs again wildly—</p>
<p>'I hate him! I hate him! Cold-blooded—ungrateful—unkind!'</p>
<p>In vain. A pair of melancholy eyes haunt, enthral her inmost soul. The charm of the denied,
      the inaccessible is on her, womanlike.</p>
<p>That old sense of capture, of helplessness, as of some lassoed struggling creature,
      descended upon her. She lay sobbing there, trying to recall what she had been a week before;
      the whirl of her London visit, the ambitions with which it had filled her; the bewildering
      many-coloured lights it had thrown upon life, the intoxicating sense of artistic power. In
      vain.</p>
<quote>
<l>'The stream will not flow, and the hills will not rise;</l>
<l>And the colours have all passed away from her eyes.'</l>
</quote>
<p>She felt herself bereft, despoiled. And yet through it all, as she lay weeping, there came
      flooding a strange contradictory sense of growth, of enrichment. In such moments of pain does
      a woman first begin to live? Ah! why should it hurt so—this long-awaited birth of the
      soul?</p>
