<head>CHAPTER II</head>
<p>About four o'clock on the afternoon of the day which was to be marked in the annals of Long
      Whindale as that of Mrs. Thornburgh's 'high tea,' that lady was seated in the vicarage garden,
      her spectacles on her nose, a large <hi>couvre-pied</hi> over her knees, and the Whinborough
      newspaper on her lap. The neighbourhood of this last enabled her to make an intermittent
      pretence of reading; but in reality the energies of her housewifely mind were taken up with
      quite other things. The vicar's wife was plunged in a housekeeping experiment of absorbing
      interest. All her <hi>solid</hi> preparations for the evening were over, and in her own mind
      she decided that with them there was no possible fault to be found. The cook, Sarah, had gone
      about her work in a spirit at once lavish and fastidious, breathed into her by her mistress.
      No better tongue, no plumper chickens, than those which would grace her board to-night were to
      be found, so Mrs. Thornburgh was persuaded, in the district. And so with everything else of a
      substantial kind. On this head the hostess felt no anxieties.</p>
<p>But a 'tea' in the north country depends for distinction, not on its solids or its
      savouries, but on its sweets. A rural hostess earns her reputation, not by a discriminating
      eye for butcher's-meat, but by her inventiveness in cakes and custards. And it was just here,
      with regard to this 'bubble reputation,' that the vicar's wife of Long Whindale was
      particularly sensitive. Was she not expecting Mrs. Seaton, the wife of the Rector of
      Whinborough—odious woman—to tea? Was it not incumbent on her
      <pb/> to do well, nay, to do brilliantly, in the eyes of this local magnate? And how was
      it possible to do brilliantly in this matter with a cook whose recipes were hopelessly
      old-fashioned, and who had an exasperating belief in the sufficiency of buttered 'whigs' and
      home-made marmalade for all requirements?</p>
<p>Stung by these thoughts, Mrs. Thornburgh had gone prowling about the neighbouring town of
      Whinborough till the shop window of a certain newly-arrived confectioner had been revealed to
      her, stored with the most airy and appetising trifles—of a make and colouring quite
      metropolitan. She had flattened her gray curls against the window for one deliberative moment;
      had then rushed in; and as soon as the carrier's cart of Long Whindale, which she was now
      anxiously awaiting, should have arrived, bearing with it the produce of that adventure, Mrs.
      Thornburgh would be a proud woman, prepared to meet a legion of rectors' wives without
      flinching. Not, indeed, in all respects a woman at peace with herself and the world. In the
      country, where every household should be self-contained, a certain discredit attaches in every
      well-regulated mind to 'getting things in.' Mrs. Thornburgh was also nervous at the thought of
      the bill. It would have to be met gradually out of the weekly money. For 'William' was to know
      nothing of the matter, except so far as a few magnificent generalities and the testimony of
      his own dazzled eyes might inform him. But after all, in this as in everything else, one must
      suffer to be distinguished.</p>
<p>The carrier, however, lingered. And at last the drowsiness of the afternoon overcame even
      those pleasing expectations we have described, and Mrs. Thornburgh's newspaper dropped
      unheeded to her feet. The vicarage, under the shade of which she was sitting, was a new gray
      stone building with wooden gables, occupying the site of what had once been the earlier
      vicarage house of Long Whindale, the primitive dwelling-house of an incumbent, whose chapelry,
      after sundry augmentations, amounted to just twenty-seven pounds a year. The modern house,
      though it only contained sufficient accommodation for Mr. and Mrs. Thornburgh, one guest, and
      two maids, would have seemed palatial to those rustic clerics of the past from whose
      ministrations the lonely valley had drawn its spiritual sustenance in times gone by. They,
      indeed, had belonged to another race—a race sprung from the soil and content to spend the
      whole of life in very close contact and very homely intercourse with their mother earth. Mr.
      Thornburgh, who had come to the valley only a few years before from a parish in one of the
      large manufacturing towns, and who had no inherited interest in the Cumbrian folk and their
      ways, had only a very faint idea, and that a distinctly depreciatory one, of what these
      mythical predecessors of his, with their strange social status and unbecoming occupations,
      might be like. But there were one or two old men still lingering in the dale who could have
      told him
      <pb/> a great deal about them, whose memory went back to the days when the relative
      social importance of the dale parsons was exactly expressed by the characteristic Westmoreland
      saying: 'Ef ye'll nobbut send us a gude schulemeaster, a verra' moderate parson 'ull dea!' and
      whose slow minds, therefore, were filled with a strong inarticulate sense of difference as
      they saw him pass along the road, and recalled the incumbent of their childhood, dropping in
      for his 'crack' and his glass of 'yale' at this or that farmhouse on any occasion of local
      festivity, or driving his sheep to Whinborough market with his own hands like any other
      peasant of the dale.</p>
<p>Within the last twenty years, however, the few remaining survivors of this primitive
      clerical order in the Westmoreland and Cumberland valleys have dropped into their quiet
      unremembered graves, and new men of other ways and other modes of speech reign in their stead.
      And as at Long Whindale, so almost everywhere, the change has been emphasised by the
      disappearance of the old parsonage houses with their stone floors, their parlours lustrous
      with oak carving on chest or dresser, and their encircling farm-buildings and meadows, in
      favour of an upgrowth of new trim mansions designed to meet the needs, not of peasants, but of
      gentlefolks.</p>
<p>And naturally the churches too have shared in the process of transformation. The
      ecclesiastical revival of the last half-century has worked its will even in the remotest
      corners of the Cumbrian country, and soon not a vestige of the homely worshipping-places of an
      earlier day will remain. Across the road, in front of the Long Whindale parsonage, for
      instance, rose a freshly built church, also peaked and gabled, with a spire and two bells, and
      a painted east window, and Heaven knows what novelties besides. The primitive whitewashed
      structure it replaced had lasted long, and in the course of many generations time had clothed
      its moss-grown walls, its slated porch, and tombstones worn with rain in a certain beauty of
      congruity and association, linking it with the purple distances of the fells, and the brawling
      river bending round the gray enclosure. But finally, after a period of quiet and gradual
      decay, the ruin of Long Whindale chapel had become a quick and hurrying ruin that would not be
      arrested. When the rotten timbers of the roof came dropping on the farmers' heads, and the oak
      benches beneath offered gaps, the geography of which had to be carefully learnt by the
      substantial persons who sat on them, lest they should be overtaken by undignified disaster;
      when the rain poured in on the Communion Table and the wind raged through innumerable
      mortarless chinks, even the slowly-moving folk of the valley came to the conclusion that
      'summat 'ull hev to be deun.' And by the help of the Bishop, and Queen Anne's Bounty, and what
      not, aided by just as many half-crowns as the valley found itself unable to defend against the
      encroachments of a new and 'moiderin' parson, 'summat' was done, whereof
      <pb/> the results—namely, the new church, vicarage, and schoolhouse—were now
      conspicuous.</p>
<p>This radical change, however, had not been the work of Mr. Thornburgh but of his
      predecessor, a much more pushing and enterprising man, whose successful efforts to improve the
      church accommodation in Long Whindale had moved such deep and lasting astonishment in the mind
      of a somewhat lethargic bishop, that promotion had been readily found for him. Mr. Thornburgh
      was neither capable of the sturdy begging which had raised the church, nor was he likely on
      other lines to reach preferment. He and his wife, who possessed much more salience of
      character than he, were accepted in the dale as belonging to the established order of things.
      Nobody wished them any harm, and the few people they had specially befriended, naturally,
      thought well of them.</p>
<p>But the old intimacy of relation which had once subsisted between the clergyman of Long
      Whindale and his parishioners was wholly gone. They had sunk in the scale; the parson had
      risen. The old statesmen or peasant proprietors of the valley had for the most part succumbed
      to various destructive influences, some social, some economical, added to a certain amount of
      corrosion from within; and their place had been taken by leaseholders, less drunken perhaps,
      and better educated, but also far less shrewd and individual, and lacking in the rude dignity
      of their predecessors.</p>
<p>And as the land had lost, the church had gained. The place of the dalesmen knew them no
      more, but the church and parsonage had got themselves rebuilt, the parson had had his income
      raised, had let off his glebe to a neighbouring farmer, kept two maids, and drank claret when
      he drank anything. His flock were friendly enough, and paid their commuted tithes without
      grumbling. But between them and a perfectly well-meaning but rather dull man, who stood on his
      dignity and wore a black coat all the week, there was no real community. Rejoice in it as we
      may, in this final passage of Parson Primrose to social regions beyond the ken of Farmer
      Flamborough, there are some elements of loss as there are in all changes.</p>
<p>Wheels on the road! Mrs. Thornburgh woke up with a start, and stumbling over newspaper and
       <hi>couvre-pied</hi>, hurried across the lawn as fast as her short squat figure would allow,
      gray curls and cap-strings flying behind her. She heard a colloquy in the distance in broad
      Westmoreland dialect, and as she turned the corner of the house she nearly ran into her tall
      cook, Sarah, whose impassive and saturnine countenance bore traces of unusual excitement.</p>
<p>'Missis, there's naw cakes. They're all left behind on t' counter at Randall's. Mr.
      Backhouse says as how he told old Jim to go fur 'em, and he niver went, and Mr. Backhouse he
      niver found oot till he'd got past t' bridge, and than it wur too late to go back.'</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh stood transfixed, something of her fresh pink colour slowly deserting her
      face as she realised the enormity of the catastrophe. And was it possible that there was the
      faintest twinkle of grim satisfaction on the face of that elderly minx, Sarah?</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh, however, did not stay to explore the recesses of Sarah's mind, but ran with
      little pattering, undignified steps across the front garden and down the steps to where Mr.
      Backhouse the carrier stood, bracing himself for self-defence.</p>
<p>'Ya may weel fret, mum,' said Mr. Backhouse, interrupting the flood of her reproaches, with
      the comparative <hi>sang-froid</hi> of one who knew that, after all, he was the only carrier
      on the road, and that the vicarage was five miles from the necessaries of life; 'it's a bad
      job, and I's not goin' to say it isn't. But ya jest look 'ere, mum, what's a man to du wi' a
      daft thingamy like <hi>that</hi>, as caan't tëak a plain order, and spiles a poor man's
      business as caan't help hissel'?'</p>
<p>And Mr. Backhouse pointed with withering scorn to a small, shrunken old man, who sat
      dangling his legs on the shaft of the cart, and whose countenance wore a singular expression
      of mingled meekness and composure, as his partner flourished an indignant finger towards
      him.</p>
<p>'Jim,' cried Mrs. Thornburgh reproachfully, 'I did think you would have taken more pains
      about my order!'</p>
<p>'Yis, mum,' said the old man placidly, 'ya might 'a' thowt it. I's reet sorry, bit ya caan't
      help these things <hi>sum</hi>times—an' it's naw gud, a hollerin' ower 'em like a mad bull. Aa
      tuke yur bit paper to Randall's and aa laft it wi' 'em to mek up, an' than, aa, weel, aa went
      to a frind, an' ee <hi>may</hi> hev giv' me a glass of yale, aa doon't say ee <hi>dud</hi>—but
      ee may, I ween't sweer. Hawsomiver, aa niver thowt naw mair aboot it, nor mair did John, so
       <hi>ee</hi> needn't taak—till we wur jest two mile from 'ere. An' ee's a gon' on sence! My!
      an' a larroping the poor beeast like onything!'</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh stood aghast at the calmness of this audacious recital. As for John, he
      looked on surveying his brother's philosophical demeanour at first with speechless wrath, and
      then with an inscrutable mixture of expressions, in which, however, any one accustomed to his
      weather-beaten countenance would have probably read a hidden admiration.</p>
<p>'Weel, aa niver!' he exclaimed, when Jim's explanatory remarks had come to an end, swinging
      himself up on to his seat and gathering up the reins. 'Yur a boald 'un to tell the missus
      theer to hur feeace as how ya wur 'tossicatit whan yur owt ta been duing yur larful business.
      Aa've doon wi' yer. Aa aims to please ma coostomers, an' aa caan't abide sek wark. Yur like an
      oald kneyfe, I can mak' nowt o' ya', nowder back nor edge.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh wrung her fat short hands in despair, making little incoherent laments and
      suggestions as she saw him
      <pb/> about to depart, of which John at last gathered the main purport to be that she
      wished him to go back to Whinborough for her precious parcel.</p>
<p>He shook his head compassionately over the preposterous state of mind betrayed by such a
      demand, and with a fresh burst of abuse of his brother, and an assurance to the vicar's wife
      that he meant to 'gie that oald man nawtice when he got haum; he wasn't goan to hev his
      bisness spiled for nowt by an oald ijiot wi' a hed as full o' yale as a hayrick's full of
      mice,' he raised his whip and the clattering vehicle moved forward; Jim meanwhile preserving
      through all his brother's wrath and Mrs. Thornburgh's wailings the same mild and even
      countenance, the meditative and friendly aspect of the philosopher letting the world go 'as
      e'en it will.'</p>
<p>So Mrs. Thornburgh was left gasping, watching the progress of the lumbering cart along the
      bit of road leading to the hamlet at the head of the valley, with so limp and crestfallen an
      aspect that even the gaunt and secretly jubilant Sarah was moved to pity.</p>
<p>'Why, missis, we'll do very well. I'll hev some scones in t'oven in naw time, an' theer's
      finger biscuits, an' wi' buttered toast an' sum o' t' best jams, if they don't hev enuf to eat
      they ought to.' Then, dropping her voice, she asked with a hurried change of tone, 'Did ye ask
      un' hoo his daater is?'</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh started. Her pastoral conscience was smitten. She opened the gate and waved
      violently after the cart. John pulled his horse up, and with a few quick steps she brought
      herself within speaking, or rather shouting, distance.</p>
<p>'How's your daughter to-day, John?'</p>
<p>The old man's face peering round the oilcloth hood of the cart was darkened by a sudden
      cloud as he caught the words. His stern lips closed. He muttered something inaudible to Mrs.
      Thornburgh and whipped up his horse again. The cart started off, and Mrs. Thornburgh was left
      staring into the receding eyes of 'Jim the Noodle,' who, from his seat on the near shaft,
      regarded her with a gaze which had passed from benevolence into a preternatural solemnity.</p>
<p>'He's sparin' ov 'is speach is John Backhouse,' said Sarah grimly, as her mistress returned
      to her. 'Maybe ee's aboot reet. It's a bad business an' ee'll not mend it wi' taakin'.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh, however, could not apply herself to the case of Mary Backhouse. At any
      other moment it would have excited in her breast the shuddering interest which, owing to
      certain peculiar attendant circumstances, it awakened in every other woman in Long Whindale.
      But her mind—such are the limitations of even clergymen's wives—was now absorbed by her own
      misfortune. Her very cap-strings seemed to hang limp with depression, as she followed Sarah
      dejectedly into the kitchen, and gave what attention she could to those second-best
      arrangements so depressing to the idealist temper.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>Poor soul! All the charm and glitter of her little social adventure was gone. When she once
      more emerged upon the lawn, and languidly readjusted her spectacles, she was weighed down by
      the thought that in two hours Mrs. Seaton would be upon her. Nothing of this kind ever
      happened to Mrs. Seaton. The universe obeyed her nod. No carrier conveying goods to her august
      door ever got drunk or failed to deliver his consignment. The thing was inconceivable. Mrs.
      Thornburgh was well aware of it.</p>
<p>Should William be informed? Mrs. Thornburgh had a rooted belief in the brutality of husbands
      in all domestic crises, and would have preferred not to inform him. But she had also a dismal
      certainty that the secret would burn a hole in her till it was confessed—bill and all.
      Besides—frightful thought!—would they have to eat up all those <hi>meringues</hi> next
      day?</p>
<p>Her reflections at last became so depressing that, with a natural epicurean instinct, she
      tried violently to turn her mind away from them. Luckily she was assisted by a sudden
      perception of the roof and chimneys of Burwood, the Leyburns' house, peeping above the trees
      to the left. At sight of them a smile overspread her plump and gently wrinkled face. She fell
      gradually into a train of thought, as feminine as that in which she had been just indulging,
      but infinitely more pleasing.</p>
<p>For, with regard to the Leyburns, at this present moment Mrs. Thornburgh felt herself in the
      great position of tutelary divinity or guardian angel. At least if divinities and guardian
      angels do not concern themselves with the questions to which Mrs. Thornburgh's mind was now
      addressed, it would clearly have been the opinion of the vicar's wife that they ought to do
      so.</p>
<p>'Who else is there to look after these girls, I should like to know,' Mrs. Thornburgh
      inquired of herself, 'if I don't do it? As if girls married themselves! People may talk of
      their independence nowadays as much as they like—it always has to be done for them, one way or
      another. Mrs. Leyburn, poor lackadaisical thing! is no good whatever. No more is Catherine.
      They both behave as if husbands tumbled into your mouth for the asking. Catherine's too good
      for this world—but if she doesn't do it, I must. Why, that girl Rose is a beauty—if they
      didn't let her wear those ridiculous mustard-coloured things, and do her hair fit to frighten
      the crows! Agnes too—so lady-like and well-mannered; she'd do credit to any man. Well, we
      shall see, we shall see!'</p>
<p>And Mrs. Thornburgh gently shook her gray curls from side to side, while her eyes, fixed on
      the open spare room window, shone with meaning.</p>
<p>'So eligible, too—private means, no encumbrances, and as good as gold.'</p>
<p>She sat lost a moment in a pleasing dream.</p>
<p>'Shall I bring oot the tea to you theer, mum?' called Sarah
      <pb/> gruffly, from the garden door. 'Master and Mr. Elsmere are just coomin' down t'
      field by t' stepping-stones.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh signalled assent and the tea-table was brought. Afternoon tea was by no
      means a regular institution at the vicarage of Long Whindale, and Sarah never supplied it
      without signs of protest. But when a guest was in the house Mrs. Thornburgh insisted upon it;
      her obstinacy in the matter, like her dreams of cakes and confections, being all part of her
      determination to move with the times, in spite of the station to which Providence had assigned
      her.</p>
<p>A minute afterwards the vicar, a thick-set gray-haired man of sixty, accompanied by a tall
      younger man in clerical dress, emerged upon the lawn.</p>
<p>'Welcome sight!' cried Mr. Thornburgh; 'Robert and I have been coveting that tea for the
      last hour. You guessed very well, Emma, to have it just ready for us.'</p>
<p>'Oh, that was Sarah. She saw you coming down to the stepping-stones,' replied his wife,
      pleased, however, by any mark of appreciation from her mankind, however small. 'Robert, I hope
      you haven't been walked off your legs?'</p>
<p>'What, in this air, cousin Emma? I could walk from sunrise to sundown. Let no one call me an
      invalid any more. Henceforth I am a Hercules.'</p>
<p>And he threw himself on the rug which Mrs. Thornburgh's motherly providence had spread on
      the grass for him, with a smile and a look of supreme physical contentment, which did indeed
      almost efface the signs of recent illness in the ruddy boyish face.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh studied him; her eye caught first of all by the stubble of reddish hair
      which as he took off his hat stood up straight and stiff all over his head with an odd
      wildness and aggressiveness. She involuntarily thought, basing her inward comment on a
      complexity of reasons—'Dear me, what a pity; it spoils his appearance!'</p>
<p>'I apologise, I apologise, cousin Emma, once for all,' said the young man, surprising her
      glance, and despairingly smoothing down his recalcitrant locks. 'Let us hope that mountain air
      will quicken the pace of it before it is necessary for me to present a dignified appearance at
      Murewell.'</p>
<p>He looked up at her with a merry flash in his gray eyes, and her old face brightened visibly
      as she realised afresh that in spite of the grotesqueness of his cropped hair, her guest was a
      most attractive creature. Not that he could boast much in the way of regular good looks: the
      mouth was large, the nose of no particular outline, and in general the cutting of the face,
      though strong and characteristic, had a bluntness and <hi>naïveté</hi> like a vigorous
      unfinished sketch. This bluntness of line, however, was balanced by a great delicacy of
      tint—the pink and white complexion of a girl, indeed—enhanced by the bright reddish hair, and
      quick gray eyes.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>The figure was also a little out of drawing, so to speak; it was tall and loosely-jointed.
      The general impression was one of agility and power. But if you looked closer you saw that the
      shoulders were narrow, the arms inordinately long, and the extremities too small for the
      general height. Robert Elsmere's hand was the hand of a woman, and few people ever exchanged a
      first greeting with its very tall owner without a little shock of surprise.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh and his guest had visited a few houses in the course of their walk, and the
      vicar plunged for a minute or two into some conversation about local matters with his wife.
      But Mrs. Thornburgh, it was soon evident, was giving him but a scatterbrained attention. Her
      secret was working in her ample breast. Very soon she could contain it no longer, and breaking
      in upon her husband's parish news, she tumbled it all out pell-mell, with a mixture of
      discomfiture and defiance infinitely diverting. She could not keep a secret, but she also
      could not bear to give William an advantage.</p>
<p>William certainly took his advantage. He did what his wife in her irritation had precisely
      foreseen that he would do. He first stared, then fell into a guffaw of laughter, and as soon
      as he had recovered breath, into a series of unfeeling comments which drove Mrs. Thornburgh to
      desperation.</p>
<p>'If you will set your mind, my dear, on things we plain folks can do perfectly well
      without'—et cetera, et cetera—the husband's point of view can be imagined. Mrs. Thornburgh
      could have shaken her good man, especially as there was nothing new to her in his remarks; she
      had known to a T beforehand exactly what he would say. She took up her knitting in a great
      hurry, the needles clicking angrily, her gray curls quivering under the energy of her hands
      and arms, while she launched at her husband various retorts as to his lack of consideration
      for her efforts and her inconvenience, which were only very slightly modified by the presence
      of a stranger.</p>
<p>Robert Elsmere meanwhile lay on the grass, his face discreetly turned away, an
      uncontrollable smile twitching the corners of his mouth. Everything was fresh and piquant up
      here in this remote corner of the north country, whether the mountain air or the wind-blown
      streams, or the manners and customs of the inhabitants. His cousin's wife, in spite of her
      ambitious conventionalities, was really the child of Nature to a refreshing degree. One does
      not see these types, he said to himself, in the cultivated monotony of Oxford or London. She
      was like a bit of a bygone world—Miss Austen's or Miss Ferrier's—unearthed for his amusement.
      He could not for the life of him help taking the scenes of this remote rural existence, which
      was quite new to him, as though they were the scenes of some comedy of manners.</p>
<p>Presently, however, the vicar became aware that the passage of arms between himself and his
      spouse was becoming just a
      <pb/> little indecorous. He got up with a 'Hem!' intended to put an end to it, and
      deposited his cup.</p>
<p>'Well, my dear, have it as you please. It all comes of your determination to have Mrs.
      Seaton. Why couldn't you just ask the Leyburns and let us enjoy ourselves?'</p>
<p>With this final shaft he departed to see that Jane, the little maid whom Sarah ordered
      about, had not, in cleaning the study for the evening's festivities, put his last sermon into
      the waste-paper basket. His wife looked after him with eyes that spoke unutterable things.</p>
<p>'You would never think,' she said in an agitated voice to young Elsmere, 'that I had
      consulted Mr. Thornburgh as to every invitation, that he entirely agreed with me that one
       <hi>must</hi> be civil to Mrs. Seaton, considering that she can make anybody's life a burden
      to them about here that isn't; but it's no use.'</p>
<p>And she fell back on her knitting with redoubled energy, her face full of a half-tearful
      intensity of meaning. Robert Elsmere restrained a strong inclination to laugh, and set himself
      instead to distract and console her. He expressed sympathy with her difficulties, he talked to
      her about her party, he got from her the names and histories of the guests. How Miss Austenish
      it sounded: the managing rector's wife, her still more managing old maid of a sister, the
      neighbouring clergyman who played the flute, the local doctor, and a pretty daughter just
      out—'Very pretty,' sighed Mrs. Thornburgh, who was now depressed all round, 'but all flounces
      and frills and nothing to say'—and last of all, those three sisters, the Leyburns, who seemed
      to be on a different level, and whom he had heard mentioned so often since his arrival by both
      husband and wife.</p>
<p>'Tell me about the Miss Leyburns,' he said presently. 'You and cousin William seem to have a
      great affection for them. Do they live near?'</p>
<p>'Oh, quite close,' cried Mrs. Thornburgh, brightening at last, and like a great general,
      leaving one scheme in ruins, only the more ardently to take up another. 'There is the house,'
      and she pointed out Burwood among its trees. Then with her eye eagerly fixed upon him, she
      fell into a more or less incoherent account of her favourites. She laid on her colours
      thickly, and Elsmere at once assumed extravagance.</p>
<p>'A saint, a beauty, and a wit all to yourselves in these wilds!' he said, laughing. 'What
      luck! But what on earth brought them here—a widow and three daughters—from the south? It was
      an odd settlement surely, though you have one of the loveliest valleys and the purest airs in
      England.'</p>
<p>'Oh, as to lovely valleys,' said Mrs. Thornburgh, sighing, 'I think it very dull; I always
      have. When one has to depend for everything on a carrier that gets drunk, too! Why, you know
      they belong here. They're real Westmoreland people.'</p>
<p>'What does that mean exactly?'</p>
<p>'Oh, their grandfather was a farmer, just like one of the
      <pb/> common farmers about. Only his land was his own, and theirs isn't.'</p>
<p>'He was one of the last of the statesmen,' interposed Mr. Thornburgh—who, having rescued his
      sermon from Jane's tender mercies, and put out his modest claret and sherry for the evening,
      had strolled out again and found himself impelled as usual to put some precision into his
      wife's statements—'one of the small freeholders who have almost disappeared here as elsewhere.
      The story of the Leyburns always seems to me typical of many things.'</p>
<p>Robert looked inquiry, and the vicar, sitting down—having first picked up his wife's ball of
      wool as a peace-offering, which was loftily accepted—launched into a narrative which may be
      here somewhat condensed.</p>
<p>The Leyburns' grandfather, it appeared, had been a typical north-country peasant—honest,
      with strong passions both of love and hate, thinking nothing of knocking down his wife with
      the poker, and frugal in all things save drink. Drink, however, was ultimately his ruin, as it
      was the ruin of most of the Cumberland statesmen. 'The people about here,' said the vicar,
      'say he drank away an acre a year. He had some fifty acres, and it took about thirty years to
      beggar him.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this brutal, rollicking, strong-natured person had sons and daughters—plenty of
      them. Most of them, even the daughters, were brutal and rollicking too. Of one of the
      daughters, now dead, it was reported that, having on one occasion discovered her father, then
      an old infirm man, sitting calmly by the fire beside the prostrate form of his wife, whom he
      had just felled with his crutch, she had taken off her wooden shoe and given her father a
      clout on the head, which left his gray hair streaming with blood; after which she had calmly
      put the horse into the cart, and driven off to fetch the doctor to both her parents. But among
      this grim and earthy crew there was one exception, a 'hop out of kin,' of whom all the rest
      made sport. This was the second son, Richard, who showed such a persistent tendency to
      'book-larnin',' and such a persistent idiocy in all matters pertaining to the land, that
      nothing was left to the father at last but to send him with many oaths to the grammar school
      at Whinborough. From the moment the boy got a footing in the school he hardly cost his father
      another penny. He got a local bursary which paid his school expenses, he never missed a remove
      or failed to gain a prize, and finally won a close scholarship which carried him triumphantly
      to Queen's College.</p>
<p>His family watched his progress with a gaping, half-contemptuous amazement, till he
      announced himself as safely installed at Oxford, having borrowed from a Whinborough patron the
      modest sum necessary to pay his college valuation—a sum which wild horses could not have
      dragged out of his father, now sunk over head and ears in debt and drink.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>From that moment they practically lost sight of him. He sent the class list which contained
      his name among the Firsts to his father; in the same way he communicated the news of his
      Fellowship at Queen's, his ordination and his appointment to the headmastership of a
      south-country grammar school. None of his communications were ever answered till, in the very
      last year of his father's life, the eldest son, who had a shrewder eye all round to the main
      chance than the rest, applied to 'Dick' for cash wherewith to meet some of the family
      necessities. The money was promptly sent, together with photographs of Dick's wife and
      children. These last were not taken much notice of. These Leyburns were a hard, limited,
      incurious set, and they no longer regarded Dick as one of themselves.</p>
<p>'Then came the old man's death,' said Mr. Thornburgh. 'It happened the year after I took the
      living. Richard Leyburn was sent for and came. I never saw such a scene in my life as the
      funeral supper. It was kept up in the old style. Three of Leyburn's sons were there: two of
      them farmers like himself, one a clerk from Manchester, a daughter married to a tradesman in
      Whinborough, a brother of the old man, who was under the table before supper was half over,
      and so on. Richard Leyburn wrote to ask me to come, and I went to support his cloth. But I was
      new to the place,' said the vicar, flushing a little, 'and they belonged to a race that had
      never been used to pay much respect to parsons. To see that man among the rest! He was thin
      and dignified; he looked to me as if he had all the learning imaginable, and he had large,
      absent-looking eyes, which, as George, the eldest brother, said, gave you the impression of
      some one that "had lost somethin' when he was nobbut a lad, and had gone seekin' it iver
      sence." He was formidable to me; but between us we couldn't keep the rest of the party in
      order, so when the orgie had gone on a certain time, we left it and went out into the air. It
      was an August night. I remember Leyburn threw back his head and drank it in. "I haven't
      breathed this air for five-and-twenty years," he said. "I thought I hated the place, and in
      spite of that drunken crew in there, it draws me to it like a magnet. I feel, after all, that
      I have the fells in my blood." He was a curious man, a refined-looking melancholy creature,
      with a face that reminded you of Wordsworth, and cold donnish ways, except to his children and
      the poor. I always thought his life had disappointed him somehow.'</p>
<p>'Yet one would think,' said Robert, opening his eyes, 'that he had made a very considerable
      success of it!'</p>
<p>'Well, I don't know how it was,' said the vicar, whose analysis of character never went very
      far. 'Anyhow, next day he went peering about the place and the mountains and the lands his
      father had lost. And George, the eldest brother, who had inherited the farm, watched him
      without a word, in the way these Westmoreland folk have, and at last offered him what remained
      of the place for a fancy price. I told him it was a preposterous
      <pb/> sum, but he wouldn't bargain. "I shall bring my wife and children here in the
      holidays," he said, "and the money will set George up in California." So he paid through the
      nose, and got possession of the old house, in which, I should think, he had passed about as
      miserable a childhood as it was possible to pass. There's no accounting for tastes.'</p>
<p>'And then the next summer they all came down,' interrupted Mrs. Thornburgh. She disliked a
      long story as she disliked being read aloud to. 'Catherine was fifteen, not a bit like a
      child. You used to see her everywhere with her father. To my mind he was always exciting her
      brain too much, but he was a man you could not say a word to. I don't care what William says
      about his being like Wordsworth; he just gave you the blues to look at.'</p>
<p>'It was so strange,' said the vicar meditatively, 'to see them in that house. If you knew
      the things that used to go on there in old days—the savages that lived there. And then to see
      those three delicately brought-up children going in and out of the parlour where old Leyburn
      used to sit smoking and drinking; and Dick Leyburn walking about in a white tie, and the same
      men touching their hats to him who had belaboured him when he was a boy at the village
      school—it was queer.'</p>
<p>'A curious little bit of social history,' said Elsmere. 'Well, and then he died and the
      family lived on?'</p>
<p>'Yes, he died the year after he bought the place. And perhaps the most interesting thing of
      all has been the development of his eldest daughter. She has watched over her mother, she has
      brought up her sisters; but much more than that: she has become a sort of Deborah in these
      valleys,' said the vicar, smiling. 'I don't count for much, she counts for a great deal. I
      can't get the people to tell me their secrets, she can. There is a sort of natural sympathy
      between them and her. She nurses them, she scolds them, she preaches to them, and they take it
      from her when they won't take it from us. Perhaps it is the feeling of blood. Perhaps they
      think it as mysterious a dispensation of Providence as I do that that brutal, swearing,
      whisky-drinking stock should have ended in anything so saintly and so beautiful as Catherine
      Leyburn.'</p>
<p>The quiet, commonplace clergyman spoke with a sudden tremor of feeling. His wife, however,
      looked at him with a dissatisfied expression.</p>
<p>'You always talk,' she said, 'as if there were no one but Catherine. People generally like
      the other two much better. Catherine is so stand-off.'</p>
<p>'Oh, the other two are very well,' said the vicar, but in a different tone.</p>
<p>Robert sat ruminating. Presently his host and hostess went in, and the young man went
      sauntering up the climbing garden-path to the point where only a railing divided it from the
      fell-side. From here his eye commanded the whole of the upper end
      <pb/> of the valley—a bare, desolate recess filled with evening shadow, and walled round
      by masses of gray and purple crag, except in one spot, where a green intervening fell marked
      the course of the pass connecting the dale with the Ullswater district. Below him were church
      and parsonage; beyond, the stone-filled babbling river, edged by intensely green fields, which
      melted imperceptibly into the browner stretches of the opposite mountain. Most of the scene,
      except where the hills at the end rose highest and shut out the sun, was bathed in quiet
      light. The white patches on the farmhouses, the heckberry trees along the river and the road,
      caught and emphasised the golden rays which were flooding into the lower valley as into a
      broad green cup. Close by, in the little vicarage orchard, were fruit trees in blossom; the
      air was mild and fragrant, though to the young man from the warmer south there was still a
      bracing quality in the soft western breeze which blew about him.</p>
<p>He stood there bathed in silent enchantment, an eager nature going out to meet and absorb
      into itself the beauty and peace of the scene. Lines of Wordsworth were on his lips; the
      little well-worn volume was in his pocket, but he did not need to bring it out; and his voice
      had all a poet's intensity of emphasis as he strolled along, reciting under his breath—</p>
<quote>
<l>'It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,</l>
<l>The holy time is quiet as a nun</l>
<l>Breathless with adoration!'</l>
</quote>
<p>Presently his eye was once more caught by the roof of Burwood, lying beneath him on its
      promontory of land, in the quiet shelter of its protecting trees. He stopped, and a delicate
      sense of harmonious association awoke in him. That girl, atoning as it were by her one white
      life for all the crimes and coarseness of her ancestry: the idea of her seemed to steal into
      the solemn golden evening and give it added poetry and meaning. The young man felt a sudden
      strong curiosity to see her.</p>
