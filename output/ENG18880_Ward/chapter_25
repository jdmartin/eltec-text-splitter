<head>CHAPTER XXV</head>
<p>And he did face it through.</p>
<p>The next three months were the bitterest months of Elsmere's life. They were marked by
      anguished mental struggle, by a consciousness of painful separation from the soul nearest to
      his own, and by a constantly increasing sense of oppression, of
      <pb/> closing avenues and narrowing alternatives, which for weeks together seemed to hold
      the mind in a grip whence there was no escape.</p>
<p>That struggle was not hurried and embittered by the bodily presence of the squire. Mr.
      Wendover went off to Italy a few days after the conversation we have described. But though he
      was not present in the flesh the great book of his life was in Elsmere's hands, he had
      formally invited Elsmere's remarks upon it; and the air of Murewell seemed still echoing with
      his sentences, still astir with his thoughts. That curious instinct of pursuit, that avid
      imperious wish to crush an irritating resistance, which his last walk with Elsmere had first
      awakened in him with any strength, persisted. He wrote to Robert from abroad, and the proud
      fastidious scholar had never taken more pains with anything than with those letters.</p>
<p>Robert might have stopped them, might have cast the whole matter from him with one resolute
      effort. In other relations he had will enough and to spare.</p>
<p>Was it an unexpected weakness of fibre that made it impossible?—that had placed him in this
      way at the squire's disposal? Half the world would answer yes. Might not the other half plead
      that in every generation there is a minority of these mobile, impressionable, defenceless
      natures, who are ultimately at the mercy of experience, at the mercy of thought, at the mercy
      (shall we say?) of truth; and that, in fact, it is from this minority that all human advance
      comes?</p>
<p>During these three miserable months it cannot be said—poor Elsmere!—that he attempted any
      systematic study of Christian evidence. His mind was too much torn, his heart too sore. He
      pounced feverishly on one test point after another, on the Pentateuch, the Prophets, the
      relation of the New Testament to the thoughts and beliefs of its time, the Gospel of St. John,
      the evidence as to the Resurrection, the intellectual and moral conditions surrounding the
      formation of the Canon. His mind swayed hither and thither, driven from each resting-place in
      turn by the pressure of some new difficulty. And—let it be said again—all through, the only
      constant element in the whole dismal process was his trained historical sense. If he had gone
      through this conflict at Oxford, for instance, he would have come out of it unscathed: for he
      would simply have remained throughout it ignorant of the true problems at issue. As it was,
      the keen instrument he had sharpened so laboriously on indifferent material now ploughed its
      agonising way, bit by bit, into the most intimate recesses of thought and faith.</p>
<p>Much of the actual struggle he was able to keep from Catherine's view, as he had vowed to
      himself to keep it. For after the squire's departure Mrs. Darcy too went joyously up to London
      to flutter a while through the golden alleys of Mayfair; and Elsmere was left once more in
      undisturbed possession of the Murewell library. There for a while on every day—
      <pb/>oh, pitiful relief!—he could hide himself from the eyes he loved.</p>
<p>But, after all, married love allows of nothing but the shallowest concealments. Catherine
      had already had one or two alarms. Once, in Robert's study, among a tumbled mass of books he
      had pulled out in search of something missing, and which she was putting in order, she had
      come across that very book on the Prophecies which at a critical moment had so deeply affected
      Elsmere. It lay open, and Catherine was caught by the heading of a section: 'The Messianic
      Idea.'</p>
<p>She began to read, mechanically at first, and read about a page. That page so shocked a mind
      accustomed to a purely traditional and mystical interpretation of the Bible that the book
      dropped abruptly from her hand, and she stood a moment by her husband's table, her fine face
      pale and frowning.</p>
<p>She noticed, with bitterness, Mr. Wendover's name on the title-page. Was it right for Robert
      to have such books? Was it wise, was it prudent, for the Christian to measure himself against
      such antagonism as this? She wrestled painfully with the question. 'Oh, but I can't
      understand,' she said to herself with an almost agonised energy. 'It is I who am timid,
      faithless! He <hi>must</hi>—he <hi>must</hi>—know what they say; he must have gone through the
      dark places if he is to carry others through them.'</p>
<p>So she stilled and trampled on the inward protest. She yearned to speak of it to Robert, but
      something withheld her. In her passionate wifely trust she could not bear to seem to question
      the use he made of his time and thought; and a delicate moral scruple warned her she might
      easily allow her dislike of the Wendover friendship to lead her into exaggeration and
      injustice.</p>
<p>But the stab of that moment recurred—dealt now by one slight incident, now by another. And
      after the squire's departure Catherine suddenly realised that the whole atmosphere of their
      home-life was changed.</p>
<p>Robert was giving himself to his people with a more scrupulous energy than ever. Never had
      she seen him so pitiful, so full of heart for every human creature. His sermons, with their
      constant imaginative dwelling on the earthly life of Jesus, affected her now with a poignancy,
      a pathos, which were almost unbearable. And his tenderness to <hi>her</hi> was beyond words.
      But with that tenderness there was constantly mixed a note of remorse, a painful
      self-depreciation which she could hardly notice in speech, but which every now and then wrung
      her heart. And in his parish work he often showed a depression, an irritability, entirely new
      to her. He who had always the happiest power of forgetting to-morrow all the rubs of to-day,
      seemed now quite incapable of saving himself and his cheerfulness in the old ways, nay, had
      developed a capacity for sheer worry she had never seen in him before. And meanwhile all the
      old
      <pb/> gossips of the place spoke their mind freely to Catherine on the subject of the
      rector's looks, coupling their remarks with a variety of prescriptions, out of which Robert
      did sometimes manage to get one of his old laughs. His sleeplessness, too, which had always
      been a constitutional tendency, had become now so constant and wearing that Catherine began to
      feel a nervous hatred of his book-work, and of those long mornings at the Hall; a passionate
      wish to put an end to it, and carry him away for a holiday.</p>
<p>But he would not hear of the holiday, and he could hardly bear any talk of himself. And
      Catherine had been brought up in a school of feeling which bade love be very scrupulous, very
      delicate, and which recognised in the strongest way the right of every human soul to its own
      privacy, its own reserves. That something definite troubled him she was certain. What it was
      he clearly avoided telling her, and she could not hurt him by impatience.</p>
<p>He would tell her soon—when it was right—she cried pitifully to herself. Meantime both
      suffered, she not knowing why, clinging to each other the while more passionately than
      ever.</p>
<p>One night, however, coming down in her dressing-gown into the study in search of a
       <hi>Christian Year</hi> she had left behind her, she found Robert with papers strewn before
      him, his arms on the table and his head laid down upon them. He looked up as she came in, and
      the expression of his eyes drew her to him irresistibly.</p>
<p>'Were you asleep, Robert? Do come to bed!'</p>
<p>He sat up, and with a pathetic gesture held out his arms to her. She came on to his knee,
      putting her white arms round his neck, while he leant his head against her breast.</p>
<p>'Are you tired with all your walking to-day?' she said presently, a pang at her heart.</p>
<p>'I am tired,' he said, 'but not with walking.'</p>
<p>'Does your book worry you? You shouldn't work so hard, Robert—you shouldn't!'</p>
<p>He started.</p>
<p>'Don't talk of it. Don't let us talk or think at all, only feel!'</p>
<p>And he tightened his arms round her, happy once more for a moment in this environment of a
      perfect love. There was silence for a few moments, Catherine feeling more and more disturbed
      and anxious.</p>
<p>'Think of your mountains,' he said presently, his eyes still pressed against her, 'of High
      Fell and the moonlight and the house where Mary Backhouse died. Oh! Catherine, I see you
      still, and shall always see you, as I saw you then, my angel of healing and of grace!'</p>
<p>'I too have been thinking of her to-night,' said Catherine softly, 'and of the walk to
      Shanmoor. This evening in the
      <pb/> garden it seemed to me as though there were Westmoreland scents in the air! I was
      haunted by a vision of bracken, and rocks, and sheep browsing up the fell slopes.'</p>
<p>'Oh for a breath of the wind on High Fell!' cried Robert,—it was so new to her, the dear
      voice with this accent in it of yearning depression! 'I want more of the spirit of the
      mountains, their serenity, their strength. Say me that Duddon sonnet you used to say to me
      there, as you said it to me that last Sunday before our wedding, when we walked up the
      Shanmoor road to say good-bye to that blessed spot. Oh! how I sit and think of it sometimes,
      when life seems to be going crookedly, that rock on the fell-side where I found you, and
      caught you, and snared you, my dove, for ever.'</p>
<p>And Catherine, whose mere voice was as balm to this man of many impulses, repeated to him,
      softly in the midnight silence, those noble lines in which Wordsworth has expressed, with the
      reserve and yet the strength of the great poet, the loftiest yearning of the purest
      hearts—</p>
<quote>
<l>'Enough, if something from our hand have power</l>
<l>To live and move, and serve the future hour,</l>
<l>And if, as towards the silent tomb we go,</l>
<l>Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower,</l>
<l>We feel that we are greater than we know.'</l>
</quote>
<p>'He has divined it all,' said Robert, drawing a long breath when she stopped, which seemed
      to relax the fibres of the inner man, 'the fever and the fret of human thought, the sense of
      littleness, of impotence, of evanescence—and he has soothed it all!'</p>
<p>'Oh, not all, not all!' cried Catherine, her look kindling, and her rare passion breaking
      through; 'how little in comparison!'</p>
<p>For her thoughts were with him of whom it was said, <hi>'He needed not that any one should
       bear witness concerning man, for he knew what was in man</hi>.' But Robert's only response
      was silence and a kind of quivering sigh.</p>
<p>'Robert!' she cried, pressing her cheek against his temple, 'tell me, my dear, dear husband,
      what it is troubles you. Something does—I am certain—certain!'</p>
<p>'Catherine—wife—beloved!' he said to her, after another pause, in a tone of strange tension
      she never forgot; 'generations of men and women have known what it is to be led spiritually
      into the desert, into that outer wilderness where even the Lord was "tempted." What am I that
      I should claim to escape it? And you cannot come through it with me, my darling—no, not even
      you! It is loneliness—it is solitariness itself——' and he shuddered. 'But pray for me—pray
      that <hi>He</hi> may be with me, and that at the end there may be light!'</p>
<p>He pressed her to him convulsively, then gently released her. His solemn eyes, fixed upon
      her as she stood there beside him,
      <pb/> seemed to forbid her to say a word more. She stooped; she laid her lips to his; it
      was a meeting of soul with soul; then she went softly out, breaking the quiet of the house by
      a stifled sob as she passed upstairs.</p>
<p>Oh! but at last she thought she understood him. She had not passed her girlhood, side by
      side with a man of delicate fibre, of melancholy and scrupulous temperament, and within
      hearing of all the natural interests of a deeply religious mind, religious biography,
      religious psychology, and—within certain sharply defined limits—religious speculation, without
      being brought face to face with the black possibilities of 'doubts' and 'difficulties' as
      barriers in the Christian path. Has not almost every Christian of illustrious excellence been
      tried and humbled by them? Catherine, looking back upon her own youth, could remember certain
      crises of religious melancholy, during which she had often dropped off to sleep at night on a
      pillow wet with tears. They had passed away quickly, and for ever. But she went back to them
      now, straining her eyes through the darkness of her own past, recalling her father's days of
      spiritual depression, and the few difficult words she had sometimes heard from him as to those
      bitter times of religious dryness and hopelessness, by which God chastens from time to time
      His most faithful and heroic souls. A half-contempt awoke in her for the unclouded serenity
      and confidence of her own inner life. If her own spiritual experience had gone deeper, she
      told herself with the strangest self-blame, she would have been able now to understand Robert
      better—to help him more.</p>
<p>She thought as she lay awake after those painful moments in the study, the tears welling up
      slowly in the darkness, of many things that had puzzled her in the past. She remembered the
      book she had seen on his table; her thoughts travelled over his months of intercourse with the
      squire; and the memory of Mr. Newcome's attitude towards the man whom he conceived to be his
      Lord's adversary, as contrasted with Robert's, filled her with a shrinking pain she dared not
      analyse.</p>
<p>Still all through, her feeling towards her husband was in the main akin to that of the
      English civilian at home towards English soldiers abroad, suffering and dying that England may
      be great. <hi>She</hi> had sheltered herself all her life from those deadly forces of unbelief
      which exist in English society, by a steady refusal to know what, however, any educated
      university man must perforce know. But such a course of action was impossible for Robert. He
      had been forced into the open, into the full tide of the Lord's battle. The chances of that
      battle are many; and the more courage the more risk of wounds and pain. But the great Captain
      knows—the great Captain does not forget His own!</p>
<p>For never, never had she the smallest doubt as to the issue of this sudden crisis in her
      husband's consciousness, even when she came nearest to apprehending its nature. As well might
      <pb/> she doubt the return of daylight, as dream of any permanent eclipse descending upon
      the faith which had shone through every detail of Robert's ardent impulsive life, with all its
      struggles, all its failings, all its beauty, since she had known him first. The dread did not
      even occur to her. In her agony of pity and reverence she thought of him as passing through a
      trial, which is specially the believer's trial—the chastening by which God proves the soul He
      loves. Let her only love and trust in patience.</p>
<p>So that day by day as Robert's depression still continued, Catherine surrounded him with the
      tenderest and wisest affection. Her quiet common sense made itself heard, forbidding her to
      make too much of the change in him, which might after all, she thought, be partly explained by
      the mere physical results of his long strain of body and mind during the Mile End epidemic.
      And for the rest she would not argue; she would not inquire. She only prayed that she might so
      lead the Christian life beside him, that the Lord's tenderness, the Lord's consolation, might
      shine upon him through her. It had never been her wont to speak to him much about his own
      influence, his own effect, in the parish. To the austerer Christian considerations of this
      kind are forbidden: 'It is not I, but Christ that worketh in me.' But now, whenever she came
      across any striking trace of his power over the weak or the impure, the sick or the sad, she
      would in some way make it known to him, offering it to him in her delicate tenderness, as
      though it were a gift that the Father had laid in her hand for him—a token that the Master was
      still indeed with His servant, and that all was fundamentally well!</p>
<p>And so much, perhaps, the contact with his wife's faith, the power of her love, wrought in
      Robert, that during these weeks and months he also never lost his own certainty of emergence
      from the shadow which had overtaken him. And, indeed, driven on from day to day as he was by
      an imperious intellectual thirst which would be satisfied, the religion of the heart, the
      imaginative emotional habit of years, that incessant drama which the soul enacts with the
      Divine Powers to which it feels itself committed, lived and persisted through it all. Feeling
      was untouched. The heart was still passionately on the side of all its old loves and
      adorations, still blindly trustful that in the end, by some compromise as yet unseen, they
      would be restored to it intact.</p>
<p>Some time towards the end of July Robert was coming home from the Hall before lunch, tired
      and worn, as the morning always left him, and meditating some fresh sheets of the squire's
      proofs which had been in his hands that morning. On the road crossing that to the rectory he
      suddenly saw Reginald Newcome, thinner and whiter than ever, striding along as fast as cassock
      and cloak would let him, his eyes on the ground, and his wideawake drawn over them. He and
      Elsmere had scarcely met for
      <pb/> months, and Robert had lately made up his mind that Newcome was distinctly less
      friendly, and wished to show it.</p>
<p>Elsmere had touched his arm before Newcome had perceived any one near him. Then he drew back
      with a start.</p>
<p>'Elsmere, you here! I had an idea you were away for a holiday!'</p>
<p>'Oh dear, no!' said Robert, smiling. 'I may get away in September, perhaps—not till
      then.'</p>
<p>'Mr. Wendover at home?' said the other, his eyes turning to the Hall, of which the chimneys
      were just visible from where they stood.</p>
<p>'No, he is abroad.'</p>
<p>'You and he have made friends, I understand,' said the other abruptly, his eagle look
      returning to Elsmere; 'I hear of you as always together.'</p>
<p>'We have made friends, and we walk a great deal when the squire is here,' said Robert,
      meeting Newcome's harshness of tone with a bright dignity 'Mr. Wendover has even been doing
      something for us in the village. You should come and see the new Institute. The roof is on,
      and we shall open it in August or September. The best building of the kind in the country by
      far, and Mr. Wendover's gift.'</p>
<p>'I suppose you use the library a great deal?' said Newcome, paying no attention to these
      remarks, and still eyeing his companion closely.</p>
<p>'A great deal.'</p>
<p>Robert had at that moment under his arm a German treatise on the history of the Logos
      doctrine, which afterwards, looking back on the little scene, he thought it probable Newcome
      recognised. They turned towards the rectory together, Newcome still asking abrupt questions as
      to the squire, the length of time he was to be away, Elsmere's work, parochial and literary,
      during the past six months, the numbers of his Sunday congregation, of his communicants, etc.
      Elsmere bore his catechism with perfect temper, though Newcome's manner had in it a strange
      and almost judicial imperativeness.</p>
<p>'Elsmere,' said his questioner presently, after a pause, 'I am going to have a retreat for
      priests at the Clergy House next month. Father H——,' mentioning a famous High Churchman, 'will
      conduct it. You would do me a special favour'—and suddenly the face softened, and shone with
      all its old magnetism on Elsmere—'if you would come. I believe you would find nothing to
      dislike in it, or in our rule, which is a most simple one.'</p>
<p>Robert smiled, and laid his hand on the other's arm.</p>
<p>'No, Newcome, no; I am in no mood for H——.'</p>
<p>The High Churchman looked at him with a quick and painful anxiety visible in the stern
      eyes.</p>
<p>'Will you tell me what that means?'</p>
<p>'It means,' said Robert, clasping his hands tightly behind him, his pace slackening a little
      to meet that of Newcome—'it
      <pb/> means that if you will give me your prayers, Newcome, your companionship sometimes,
      your pity always, I will thank you from the bottom of my heart. But I am in a state just now
      when I must fight my battles for myself, and in God's sight only!'</p>
<p>It was the first burst of confidence which had passed his lips to any one but Catherine.</p>
<p>Newcome stood still, a tremor of strong emotion running through the emaciated face.</p>
<p>'You are in trouble, Elsmere; I felt it, I knew it, when I first saw you!'</p>
<p>'Yes, I am in trouble,' said Robert quietly.</p>
<p>'Opinions?'</p>
<p>'Opinions, I suppose—or facts,' said Robert, his arms dropping wearily beside him. 'Have you
      ever known what it is to be troubled in mind, I wonder, Newcome?'</p>
<p>And he looked at his companion with a sudden pitiful curiosity.</p>
<p>A kind of flash passed over Mr. Newcome's face.</p>
<p>'<hi>Have I ever known?</hi>' he repeated vaguely, and then he drew his thin hand, the hand
      of the ascetic and the mystic, hastily across his eyes, and was silent—his lips moving, his
      gaze on the ground, his whole aspect that of a man wrought out of himself by a sudden passion
      of memory.</p>
<p>Robert watched him with surprise, and was just speaking, when Mr. Newcome looked up, every
      drawn attenuated feature working painfully.</p>
<p>'Did you never ask yourself, Elsmere,' he said slowly, 'what it was drove me from the bar
      and journalism to the East End? Do you think I don't know,' and his voice rose, his eyes
      flamed, 'what black devil it is that is gnawing at your heart now? Why, man, I have been
      through darker gulfs of hell than you have ever sounded! Many a night I have felt myself
       <hi>mad—mad of doubt</hi>—a castaway on a shoreless sea; doubting not only God or Christ, but
      myself, the soul, the very existence of good. I found only one way out of it, and <hi>you</hi>
      will find only one way.'</p>
<p>The lithe hand caught Robert's arm impetuously—the voice with its accent of fierce
      conviction was at his ear.</p>
<p>'Trample on yourself! Pray down the demon, fast, scourge, kill the body, that the soul may
      live! What are we, miserable worms, that we should defy the Most High, that we should set our
      wretched faculties against His Omnipotence? Submit—submit—humble yourself, my brother! Fling
      away the freedom which is your ruin. There is no freedom for man. Either a slave to Christ, or
      a slave to his own lusts—there is no other choice. Go away; exchange your work here for a time
      for work in London. You have too much leisure here: Satan has too much opportunity. I foresaw
      it—I foresaw it when you and I first met. I felt I had a message for you, and here I deliver
      it. In the Lord's name, I bid you fly; I bid you yield in time. Better to be the Lord's
      captive than <hi>the Lord's betrayer</hi>!'</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>The wasted form was drawn up to its full height, the arm was outstretched, the long cloak
      fell back from it in long folds—voice and eye were majesty itself. Robert had a tremor of
      responsive passion. How easy it sounded, how tempting, to cut the knot, to mutilate and starve
      the rebellious intellect which would assert itself against the soul's purest instincts!
      Newcome had done it—why not he?</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, as he stood gazing at his companion, the spring sun, and murmur all
      about them, another face, another life, another message, flashed on his inmost sense—the face
      and life of Henry Grey. Words torn from their context but full for him of intensest meaning,
      passed rapidly through his mind: '<hi>God is not wisely trusted when declared
       unintelligible.</hi>' '<hi>Such honour rooted in dishonour stands; such faith unfaithful
       makes us falsely true.</hi>' '<hi>God is for ever reason: and His communication, His
       revelation, is reason.</hi>'</p>
<p>He turned away with a slight sad shake of the head. The spell was broken. Mr. Newcome's arm
      dropped, and he moved sombrely on beside Robert—the hand, which held a little book of Hours
      against his cloak, trembling slightly.</p>
<p>At the rectory gate he stopped.</p>
<p>'Good-bye—I must go home.'</p>
<p>'You won't come in?—No, no, Newcome; believe me, I am no rash careless egotist, risking
      wantonly the most precious things in life! But the call is on me, and I must follow it. All
      life is God's, and all thought—not only a fraction of it. He cannot let me wander very
      far!'</p>
<p>But the cold fingers he held so warmly dropped from his, and Newcome turned away.</p>
<p>A week afterwards, or thereabouts, Robert had in some sense followed Newcome's counsel.
      Admonished perhaps by sheer physical weakness, as much as by anything else, he had for the
      moment laid down his arms; he had yielded to an invading feebleness of the will, which
      refused, as it were, to carry on the struggle any longer, at such a life-destroying pitch of
      intensity. The intellectual oppression of itself brought about wild reaction and recoil, and a
      passionate appeal to that inward witness of the soul which holds its own long after the reason
      has practically ceased to struggle.</p>
<p>It came about in this way. One morning he stood reading in the window of the library the
      last of the squire's letters. It contained a short but masterly analysis of the mental habits
      and idiosyncrasies of St. Paul, <hi>à propos</hi> of St. Paul's witness to the Resurrection.
      Every now and then, as Elsmere turned the pages, the orthodox protest would assert itself, the
      orthodox arguments make themselves felt as though in mechanical involuntary protest. But their
      force and vitality was gone. Between the Paul of Anglican theology and the fiery fallible man
      of genius—so weak logically, so strong in poetry, in rhetoric, in moral passion, whose
      portrait has been drawn for us by a free
      <pb/> and temperate criticism—the rector knew, in a sort of dull way, that his choice was
      made. The one picture carried reason and imagination with it; the other contented neither.</p>
<p>But as he put down the letter something seemed to snap within him. Some chord of physical
      endurance gave way. For five months he had been living intellectually at a speed no man
      maintains with impunity, and this letter of the squire's, with its imperious demands upon the
      tired irritable brain, was the last straw.</p>
<p>He sank down on the oriel seat, the letter dropping from his hands. Outside, the little
      garden, now a mass of red and pink roses, the hill and the distant stretches of park were
      wrapped in a thick sultry mist, through which a dim far-off sunlight struggled on to the
      library floor, and lay in ghostly patches on the polished boards and lower ranges of
      books.</p>
<p>The simplest religious thoughts began to flow over him—the simplest childish words of prayer
      were on his lips. He felt himself delivered, he knew not how or why.</p>
<p>He rose deliberately, laid the squire's letter among his other papers, and tied them up
      carefully; then he took up the books which lay piled on the squire's writing-table: all those
      volumes of German, French, and English criticism, liberal or apologetic, which he had been
      accumulating round him day by day with a feverish toilsome impartiality, and began rapidly and
      methodically to put them back in their places on the shelves.</p>
<p>'I have done too much thinking, too much reading,' he was saying to himself as he went
      through his task. 'Now let it be the turn of something else!'</p>
<p>And still as he handled the books, it was as though Catherine's figure glided backwards and
      forwards beside him, across the smooth floor, as though her hand were on his arm, her eyes
      shining into his. Ah—he knew well what it was had made the sharpest sting of this wrestle
      through which he had been passing! It was not merely religious dread, religious shame; that
      terror of disloyalty to the Divine Images which have filled the soul's inmost shrine since its
      first entry into consciousness, such as every good man feels in a like strait. This had been
      strong indeed; but men are men, and love is love! Ay, it was to the dark certainty of
      Catherine's misery that every advance in knowledge and intellectual power had brought him
      nearer. It was from that certainty that he now, and for the last time, recoiled. It was too
      much. It could not be borne.</p>
<p>He walked home, counting up the engagements of the next few weeks—the school-treat, two club
      field-days, a sermon in the county town, the probable opening of the new Workmen's Institute,
      and so on. Oh! to be through them all and away, away amid Alpine scents and silences. He stood
      a moment beside the gray slowly-moving river, half hidden beneath the rank flower-growth, the
      tansy and willow-herb, the luxuriant elder and trailing brambles of its August banks, and
      thought
      <pb/> with hungry passion of the clean-swept Alpine pasture, the fir-woods, and the
      tameless mountain streams. In three weeks or less he and Catherine should be climbing the
      Jaman or the Dent du Midi. And till then he would want all his time for men and women. Books
      should hold him no more.</p>
<p>Catherine only put her arms round his neck in silence when he told her. The relief was too
      great for words. He, too, held her close, saying nothing. But that night, for the first time
      for weeks, Elsmere's wife slept in peace and woke without dread of the day before her.</p>
