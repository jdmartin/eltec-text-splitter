<head>CHAPTER XXXVI</head>
<p>Langham parted with Rose at the corner of Martin Street. She would not let him take her any
      farther.</p>
<p>'I will say nothing,' she whispered to him, as he put her into a passing hansom, wrapping
      her cloak warmly round her, 'till I see you again. To-morrow?'</p>
<p>'To-morrow morning,' he said, waving his hand to her, and in another instant he was facing
      the north wind alone.</p>
<p>He walked on fast towards Beaumont Street, but by the time he reached his destination
      midnight had struck. He made his way into his room where the fire was still smouldering, and
      striking a light, sank into his large reading chair, beside which the volumes used in the
      afternoon lay littered on the floor.</p>
<p>He was suddenly penetrated with the cold of the night, and hung shivering over the few
      embers which still glowed. What had happened to him? In this room, in this chair, the
      self-forgetting excitement of that walk, scarcely half an hour old, seems to him already long
      passed—incredible almost.</p>
<p>And yet the brain was still full of images, the mind still full of a hundred new
      impressions. That fair head against his breast, those soft confiding words, those yielding
      lips. Ah! it is the poor, silent, insignificant student that has conquered. It is he, not the
      successful man of the world, that has held that young and beautiful girl in his arms, and
      heard from her the sweetest and humblest confession of love. Fate can have neither wit nor
      conscience to have ordained it so; but fate has so ordained it. Langham takes note of his
      victory, takes dismal note also that the satisfaction of it has already half departed.</p>
<p>So the great moment has come and gone! The one supreme experience which life and his own
      will had so far rigidly denied him, is his. He has felt the torturing thrill of passion—he has
      <pb/> evoked such an answer as all men might envy him,—and fresh from Rose's kiss, from
      Rose's beauty, the strange maimed soul falls to a pitiless analysis of his passion, her
      response! One moment he is at her feet in a voiceless trance of gratitude and tenderness; the
      next—is nothing what it promises to be?—and has the boon already, now that he has it in his
      grasp, lost some of its beauty, just as the sea-shell drawn out of the water, where its lovely
      iridescence tempted eye and hand, loses half its fairy charm?</p>
<p>The night wore on. Outside an occasional cab or cart would rattle over the stones of the
      street, an occasional voice or step would penetrate the thin walls of the house, bringing a
      shock of sound into that silent upper room. Nothing caught Langham's ear. He was absorbed in
      the dialogue which was to decide his life.</p>
<p>Opposite to him, as it seemed, there sat a spectral reproduction of himself, his true self,
      with whom he held a long and ghastly argument.</p>
<p>'But I love her!—I love her! A little courage—a little effort—and I too can achieve what
      other men achieve. I have gifts, great gifts. Mere contact with her, the mere necessities of
      the situation, will drive me back to life, teach me how to live normally, like other men. I
      have not forced her love—it has been a free gift. Who can blame me if I take it, if I cling to
      it, as the man freezing in a crevasse clutches the rope thrown to him?'</p>
<p>To which the pale spectre self said scornfully—</p>
<p>'<hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>effort</hi> may as well be dropped out of your vocabulary. They
      are words that you have no use for. Replace them by two others—<hi>habit</hi> and
       <hi>character</hi>. Slave as you are of habit, of the character you have woven for yourself
      out of years of deliberate living—what wild unreason to imagine that love can unmake, can
      recreate! What you are, you are to all eternity. Bear your own burden, but for God's sake
      beguile no other human creature into trusting you with theirs!'</p>
<p>'But she loves me! Impossible that I should crush and tear so kind, so warm a heart! Poor
      child—poor child! I have played on her pity. I have won all she had to give. And now to throw
      her gift back in her face—oh monstrous—oh inhuman!' and the cold drops stood on his
      forehead.</p>
<p>But the other self was inexorable. 'You have acted as you were bound to act—as any man may
      be expected to act in whom will and manhood and true human kindness are dying out, poisoned by
      despair and the tyranny of the critical habit. But at least do not add another crime to the
      first. What in God's name have you to offer a creature of such claims, such ambitions? You are
      poor—you must go back to Oxford—you must take up the work your soul loathes—grow more soured,
      more embittered—maintain a useless degrading struggle, till her youth is done, her beauty
      wasted, and till you yourself have lost every shred of decency and dignity, even that decorous
      <pb/> outward life in which you can still wrap yourself from the world! Think of the
      little house—the children—the money difficulties—she, spiritually starved, every illusion
      gone,—you incapable soon of love, incapable even of pity, conscious only of a dull rage with
      her, yourself, the world! Bow the neck—submit—refuse that long agony for yourself and her,
      while there is still time. <hi>Kismet—Kismet!</hi>'</p>
<p>And spread out before Langham's shrinking soul there lay a whole dismal Hogarthian series,
      image leading to image, calamity to calamity, till in the last scene of all the maddened
      inward sight perceived two figures, two gray and withered figures, far apart, gazing at each
      other with cold and sunken eyes across dark rivers of sordid irremediable regret.</p>
<p>The hours passed away, and in the end, the spectre self, a cold and bloodless conqueror,
      slipped back into the soul which remorse and terror, love and pity, a last impulse of hope, a
      last stirring of manhood, had been alike powerless to save.</p>
<p>The February dawn was just beginning when he dragged himself to a table and wrote.</p>
<p>Then for hours afterwards he sat sunk in his chair, the stupor of fatigue broken every now
      and then by a flash of curious introspection. It was a base thing which he had done—it was
      also a strange thing psychologically; and at intervals he tried to understand it, to track it
      to its causes.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock he crept out into the frosty daylight, found a commissionaire who was
      accustomed to do errands for him, and sent him with a letter to Lerwick Gardens.</p>
<p>On his way back he passed a gunsmith's, and stood looking fascinated at the shining barrels.
      Then he moved away, shaking his head, his eyes gleaming as though the spectacle of himself had
      long ago passed the bounds of tragedy—become farcical even.</p>
<p>'I should only stand a month—arguing—with my finger on the trigger.'</p>
<p>In the little hall his landlady met him, gave a start at the sight of him, and asked him if
      he ailed and if she could do anything for him. He gave her a sharp answer and went upstairs,
      where she heard him dragging books and boxes about as though he were packing.</p>
<p>A little later Rose was standing at the dining-room window of No. 27, looking on to a few
      trees bedecked with rime which stood outside. The ground and roofs were white, a promise of
      sun was struggling through the fog. So far everything in these unfrequented Campden Hill roads
      was clean, crisp, enlivening, and the sparkle in Rose's mood answered to that of Nature.</p>
<p>Breakfast had just been cleared away. Agnes was upstairs with Mrs. Leyburn. Catherine, who
      was staying in the house for a day or two, was in a chair by the fire reading some letters
      forwarded to her from Bedford Square.</p>
<p>He would appear some time in the morning, she supposed.
      <pb/> With an expression half rueful, half amused, she fell to imagining his interview
      with Catherine, with her mother. Poor Catherine! Rose feels herself happy enough to allow
      herself a good honest pang of remorse for much of her behaviour to Catherine this winter; how
      thorny she has been, how unkind often, to this sad changed sister. And now this will be a
      fresh blow! 'But afterwards, when she has got over it,—when she knows that it makes me
      happy,—that nothing else would make me happy,—then she will be reconciled, and she and I
      perhaps will make friends, all over again, from the beginning. I won't be angry or hard over
      it—poor Cathie!'</p>
<p>And with regard to Mr. Flaxman. As she stands there waiting idly for what destiny may send
      her, she puts herself through a little light catechism about this other friend of hers. He had
      behaved somewhat oddly towards her of late; she begins now to remember that her exit from Lady
      Charlotte's house the night before had been a very different matter from the royally attended
      leave-takings, presided over by Mr. Flaxman, which generally befell her there. Had he
      understood? With a little toss of her head she said to herself that she did not care if it was
      so. 'I have never encouraged Mr. Flaxman to think I was going to marry him.'</p>
<p>But of course Mr. Flaxman will consider she has done badly for herself. So will Lady
      Charlotte and all her outer world. They will say she is dismally throwing herself away, and
      her mother, no doubt influenced by the clamour, will take up very much the same line.</p>
<p>What matter! The girl's spirit seemed to rise against all the world. There was a sort of
      romantic exaltation in her sacrifice of herself, a jubilant looking forward to remonstrance, a
      wilful determination to overcome it. That she was about to do the last thing she could have
      been expected to do, gave her pleasure. Almost all artistic faculty goes with a love of
      surprise and caprice in life. Rose had her full share of the artistic love for the impossible
      and the difficult.</p>
<p>Besides—success! To make a man hope and love, and live again—<hi>that</hi> shall be her
      success. She leaned against the window, her eyes filling, her heart very soft.</p>
<p>Suddenly she saw a commissionaire coming up the little flagged passage to the door. He gave
      in a note, and immediately afterwards the dining-room door opened.</p>
<p>'A letter for you, Miss,' said the maid.</p>
<p>Rose took it—glanced at the handwriting. A bright flush—a surreptitious glance at Catherine
      who sat absorbed in a wandering letter from Mrs. Darcy. Then the girl carried her prize to the
      window and opened it.</p>
<p>Catherine read on, gathering up the Murewell names and details as some famished gleaner
      might gather up the scattered ears on a plundered field. At last something in the silence of
      the room, and of the other inmate in it, struck her.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'Rose,' she said, looking up, 'was that some one brought you a note?'</p>
<p>The girl turned with a start—a letter fell to the ground. She made a faint ineffectual
      effort to pick it up, and sank into a chair.</p>
<p>'Rose—darling!' cried Catherine, springing up, 'are you ill?'</p>
<p>Rose looked at her with a perfectly colourless fixed face, made a feeble negative sign, and
      then laying her arms on the breakfast-table in front of her, let her head fall upon them.</p>
<p>Catherine stood over her aghast. 'My darling—what is it? Come and lie down—take this
      water.'</p>
<p>She put some close to her sister's hand, but Rose pushed it away. 'Don't talk to me,' she
      said with difficulty.</p>
<p>Catherine knelt beside her in helpless pain and perplexity, her cheek resting against her
      sister's shoulder as a mute sign of sympathy. What could be the matter? Presently her gaze
      travelled from Rose to the letter on the floor. It lay with the address uppermost, and she at
      once recognised Langham's handwriting. But before she could combine any rational ideas with
      this quick perception, Rose had partially mastered herself. She raised her head slowly and
      grasped her sister's arm.</p>
<p>'I was startled,' she said, a forced smile on her white lips. 'Last night Mr. Langham asked
      me to marry him—I expected him here this morning to consult with mamma and you. That letter is
      to inform me that—he made a mistake—and he is very sorry! So am I! It is
      so—so—bewildering!'</p>
<p>She got up restlessly and went to the fire as though shivering with cold. Catherine thought
      she hardly knew what she was saying. The elder sister followed her, and throwing an arm round
      her, pressed the slim irresponsive figure close. Her eyes were bright with anger, her lips
      quivering.</p>
<p>'That he should <hi>dare</hi>!' she cried. 'Rose—my poor little Rose.'</p>
<p>'Don't blame him!' said Rose, crouching down before the fire, while Catherine fell into the
      armchair again. 'It doesn't seem to count, from you—you have always been so ready to blame
      him!'</p>
<p>Her brow contracted; she looked frowning into the fire, her still colourless mouth working
      painfully.</p>
<p>Catherine was cut to the heart. 'Oh, Rose!' she said, holding out her hands, 'I will blame
      no one, dear. I seem hard—but I love you so. Oh, tell me—you would have told me everything
      once!'</p>
<p>There was the most painful yearning in her tone. Rose lifted a listless right hand and put
      it into her sister's outstretched palms. But she made no answer, till suddenly, with a
      smothered cry, she fell towards Catherine.</p>
<p>'Catherine! I cannot bear it. I said I loved him—he kissed me—I could kill myself and
      him.'</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>Catherine never forgot the mingled tragedy and domesticity of the hour that followed—the
      little familiar morning sounds in and about the house, maids running up and down stairs,
      tradesmen calling, bells ringing,—and here, at her feet, a spectacle of moral and mental
      struggle which she only half understood, but which wrung her inmost heart. Two strains of
      feeling seemed to be present in Rose—a sense of shock, of wounded pride, of intolerable
      humiliation, and a strange intervening passion of pity, not for herself but for Langham, which
      seemed to have been stirred in her by his letter. But though the elder questioned, and the
      younger seemed to answer, Catherine could hardly piece the story together, nor could she find
      the answer to the question filling her own indignant heart, 'Does she love him?'</p>
<p>At last Rose got up from her crouching position by the fire and stood, a white ghost of
      herself, pushing back the bright encroaching hair from eyes that were dry and feverish.</p>
<p>'If I could only be angry—downright angry,' she said, more to herself than Catherine, 'it
      would do one good.'</p>
<p>'Give others leave to be angry for you!' cried Catherine.</p>
<p>'Don't!' said Rose, almost fiercely, drawing herself away. 'You don't know. It is a fate.
      Why did we ever meet? You may read his letter; you must—you misjudge him—you always have. No,
      no'—and she nervously crushed the letter in her hand—'not yet. But you shall read it some
      time—you and Robert too. Married people always tell one another. It is due to him, perhaps due
      to me too,' and a hot flush transfigured her paleness for an instant. 'Oh, my head! Why does
      one's mind affect one's body like this? It shall not—it is humiliating! "Miss Leyburn has been
      jilted and cannot see visitors,"—that is the kind of thing. Catherine, when you have finished
      that document, will you kindly come and hear me practise my last Raff—I am going.
      Good-bye.'</p>
<p>She moved to the door, but Catherine had only just time to catch her, or she would have
      fallen over a chair from sudden giddiness.</p>
<p>'Miserable!' she said, dashing a tear from her eyes, 'I must go and lie down then in the
      proper missish fashion. Mind, on your peril, Catherine, not a word to any one but Robert. I
      shall tell Agnes. And Robert is not to speak to me! No, don't come—I will go alone.'</p>
<p>And warning her sister back, she groped her way upstairs. Inside her room, when she had
      locked the door, she stood a moment upright with the letter in her hand,—the blotted
      incoherent scrawl, where Langham had for once forgotten to be literary, where every pitiable
      half-finished sentence pleaded with her—even in the first smart of her wrong—for pardon, for
      compassion, as towards something maimed and paralysed from birth, unworthy even of her
      contempt. Then the tears began to rain over her cheeks.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'I was not good enough—I was not good enough—God would not let me!'</p>
<p>And she fell on her knees beside the bed, the little bit of paper crushed in her hands
      against her lips. Not good enough for what? <hi>To save?</hi></p>
<p>How lightly she had dreamed of healing, redeeming, changing! And the task is refused her. It
      is not so much the cry of personal desire that shakes her as she kneels and weeps, nor is it
      mere wounded woman's pride. It is a strange stern sense of law. Had she been other than she
      is—more loving, less self-absorbed, loftier in motive—he could not have loved her so, have
      left her so. Deep undeveloped forces of character stir within her. She feels herself
      judged,—and with a righteous judgment—issuing inexorably from the facts of life and
      circumstance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Catherine was shut up downstairs with Robert, who had come over early to see how
      the household fared.</p>
<p>Robert listened to the whole luckless story with astonishment and dismay. This particular
      possibility of mischief had gone out of his mind for some time. He had been busy in his East
      End work. Catherine had been silent. Over how many matters they would once have discussed with
      open heart was she silent now?</p>
<p>'I ought to have been warned,' he said with quick decision, 'if you knew this was going on.
      I am the only man among you, and I understand Langham better than the rest of you. I might
      have looked after the poor child a little.'</p>
<p>Catherine accepted the reproach mutely as one little smart the more. However, what had she
      known? She had seen nothing unusual of late, nothing to make her think a crisis was
      approaching. Nay, she had flattered herself that Mr. Flaxman, whom she liked, was gaining
      ground.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Robert stood pondering anxiously what could be done. Could anything be done?</p>
<p>'I must go and see him,' he said presently. 'Yes, dearest, I must. Impossible the thing
      should be left so! I am his old friend,—almost her guardian. You say she is in great
      trouble—why, it may shadow her whole life! No—he must explain things to us—he is bound to—he
      shall. It may be something comparatively trivial in the way after all—money or prospects or
      something of the sort. You have not seen the letter, you say? It is the last marriage in the
      world one could have desired for her—but if she loves him, Catherine, if she loves him——'</p>
<p>He turned to her—appealing, remonstrating. Catherine stood pale and rigid. Incredible that
      he should think it right to intermeddle—to take the smallest step towards reversing so plain a
      declaration of God's will! She could not sympathise—she would not consent. Robert watched her
      in painful indecision. He knew that she thought him indifferent to her true reason
      <pb/> for finding some comfort even in her sister's trouble—that he seemed to her mindful
      only of the passing human misery, indifferent to the eternal risk.</p>
<p>They stood sadly looking at one another. Then he snatched up his hat.</p>
<p>'I must go,' he said in a low voice; 'it is right.'</p>
<p>And he went—stepping, however, with the best intentions in the world, into a blunder.</p>
<p>Catherine sat painfully struggling with herself after he had left her. Then some one came
      into the room—some one with pale looks and flashing eyes. It was Agnes.</p>
<p>'She just let me in to tell me, and put me out again,' said the girl—her whole, even,
      cheerful self one flame of scorn and wrath. 'What are such creatures made for, Catherine—why
      do they exist?'</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Robert had trudged off through the frosty morning streets to Langham's lodgings.
      His mood was very hot by the time he reached his destination, and he climbed the staircase to
      Langham's room in some excitement. When he tried to open the door after the answer to his
      knock bidding him enter, he found something barring the way. 'Wait a little,' said the voice
      inside, 'I will move the case.'</p>
<p>With difficulty the obstacle was removed and the door opened. Seeing his visitor, Langham
      stood for a moment in sombre astonishment. The room was littered with books and packing-cases
      with which he had been busy.</p>
<p>'Come in,' he said, not offering to shake hands.</p>
<p>Robert shut the door, and, picking his way among the books, stood leaning on the back of the
      chair Langham pointed out to him. Langham paused opposite to him, his waving jet-black hair
      falling forward over the marble pale face which had been Robert's young ideal of manly
      beauty.</p>
<p>The two men were only six years distant in age, but so strong is old association that
      Robert's feeling towards his friend had always remained in many respects the feeling of the
      undergraduate towards the don. His sense of it now filled him with a curious awkwardness.</p>
<p>'I know why you are come,' said Langham slowly, after a scrutiny of his visitor.</p>
<p>'I am here by a mere accident,' said the other, thinking perfect frankness best. 'My wife
      was present when her sister received your letter. Rose gave her leave to tell me. I had gone
      up to ask after them all, and came on to you,—of course on my own responsibility entirely!
      Rose knows nothing of my coming—nothing of what I have to say.'</p>
<p>He paused, struck against his will by the looks of the man before him. Whatever he had done
      during the past twenty-four hours he had clearly had the grace to suffer in the doing of
      it.</p>
<p>'You can have nothing to say!' said Langham, leaning
      <pb/> against the chimney piece and facing him with black, darkly-burning eyes. 'You know
      me.'</p>
<p>Never had Robert seen him under this aspect. All the despair, all the bitterness hidden
      under the languid student's exterior of every day, had, as it were, risen to the surface. He
      stood at bay, against his friend, against himself.</p>
<p>'No!' exclaimed Robert stoutly, 'I do not know you in the sense you mean. I do not know you
      as the man who could beguile a girl on to a confession of love, and then tell her that for you
      marriage was too great a burden to be faced!'</p>
<p>Langham started, and then closed his lips in an iron silence. Robert repented him a little.
      Langham's strange individuality always impressed him against his will.</p>
<p>'I did not come simply to reproach you, Langham,' he went on, 'though I confess to being
      very hot! I came to try and find out—for myself only, mind—whether what prevents you from
      following up what I understand happened last night is really a matter of feeling, or a matter
      of outward circumstance. If, upon reflection, you find that your feeling for Rose is not what
      you imagined it to be, I shall have my own opinion about your conduct—but I shall be the first
      to acquiesce in what you have done this morning. If, on the other hand, you are simply afraid
      of yourself in harness, and afraid of the responsibilities of practical married life, I cannot
      help begging you to talk the matter over with me, and let us face it together. Whether Rose
      would ever, under any circumstances, get over the shock of this morning I have not the
      remotest idea. But'—and he hesitated—'it seems the feeling you appealed to yesterday has been
      of long growth. You know perfectly well what havoc a thing of this kind <hi>may</hi> make in a
      girl's life. I don't say it will. But, at any rate, it is all so desperately serious I could
      not hold my hand. I am doing what is no doubt wholly unconventional; but I am your friend and
      her brother; I brought you together, and I ask you to take me into counsel. If you had but
      done it before!'</p>
<p>There was a moment's dead silence.</p>
<p>'You cannot pretend to believe,' said Langham at last, with the same sombre
      self-containedness, 'that a marriage with me would be for your sister-in-law's happiness?'</p>
<p>'I don't know what to believe!' cried Robert. 'No,' he added frankly, 'no; when I saw you
      first attracted by Rose at Murewell I disliked the idea heartily; I was glad to see you
      separated; <hi>à priori</hi>, I never thought you suited to each other. But reasoning that
      holds good when a thing is wholly in the air looks very different when a man has committed
      himself and another, as you have done.'</p>
<p>Langham surveyed him for a moment, then shook his hair impatiently from his eyes and rose
      from his bending position by the fire.</p>
<p>'Elsmere, there is nothing to be said! I have behaved as
      <pb/> vilely as you please. I have forfeited your friendship. But I should be an even
      greater fiend and weakling than you think me if, in cold blood, I could let your sister run
      the risk of marrying me. I could not trust myself—you may think of the statement as you like—I
      should make her <hi>miserable</hi>. Last night I had not parted from her an hour before I was
      utterly and irrevocably sure of it. My habits are my masters. I believe,' he added slowly, his
      eyes fixed weirdly on something beyond Robert, 'I could even grow to <hi>hate</hi> what came
      between me and them!'</p>
<p>Was it the last word of the man's life? It struck Robert with a kind of shiver.</p>
<p>'Pray heaven,' he said with a groan, getting up to go, 'you may not have made her miserable
      already!'</p>
<p>'Did it hurt her so much?' asked Langham almost inaudibly, turning away, Robert's tone
      meanwhile calling up a new and scorching image in the subtle brain tissue.</p>
<p>'I have not seen her,' said Robert abruptly; 'but when I came in I found my wife—who has no
      light tears—weeping for her sister.'</p>
<p>His voice dropped as though what he were saying were in truth too pitiful and too intimate
      for speech.</p>
<p>Langham said no more. His face had become a marble mask again.</p>
<p>'Good-bye!' said Robert, taking up his hat with a dismal sense of having got foolishly
      through a fool's errand. 'As I said to you before, what Rose's feeling is at this moment I
      cannot even guess. Very likely she would be the first to repudiate half of what I have been
      saying. And I see that you will not talk to me—you will not take me into your confidence and
      speak to me not only as her brother but as your friend. And—and—are you going? What does this
      mean?'</p>
<p>He looked interrogatively at the open packing-cases.</p>
<p>'I am going back to Oxford,' said the other briefly. 'I cannot stay in these rooms, in these
      streets.'</p>
<p>Robert was sore perplexed. What real—nay, what terrible suffering—in the face and manner,
      and yet how futile, how needless! He felt himself wrestling with something intangible and
      phantom-like, wholly unsubstantial, and yet endowed with a ghastly indefinite power over human
      life.</p>
<p>'It is very hard,' he said hurriedly, moving nearer, 'that our old friendship should be
      crossed like this. Do trust me a little! You are always undervaluing yourself. Why not take a
      friend into council sometimes when you sit in judgment on yourself and your possibilities?
      Your own perceptions are all warped!'</p>
<p>Langham, looking at him, thought his smile one of the most beautiful and one of the most
      irrelevant things he had ever seen.</p>
<p>'I will write to you, Elsmere,' he said, holding out his hand,
      <pb/> 'speech is impossible to me. I never had any words except through my pen.'</p>
<p>Robert gave it up. In another minute Langham was left alone.</p>
<p>But he did no more packing for hours. He spent the middle of the day sitting dumb and
      immovable in his chair. Imagination was at work again more feverishly than ever. He was
      tortured by a fixed image of Rose, suffering and paling.</p>
<p>And after a certain number of hours he could no more bear the incubus of this thought than
      he could put up with the flat prospects of married life the night before. He was all at sea,
      barely sane, in fact. His life had been so long purely intellectual that this sudden strain of
      passion and fierce practical interests seemed to unhinge him, to destroy his mental
      balance.</p>
<p>He bethought him. This afternoon he knew she had a last rehearsal at Searle House.
      Afterwards her custom was to come back from St. James's Park to High Street, Kensington, and
      walk up the hill to her own home. He knew it, for on two occasions after these rehearsals he
      had been at Lerwick Gardens, waiting for her, with Agnes and Mrs. Leyburn. Would she go this
      afternoon? A subtle instinct told him that she would.</p>
<p>It was nearly six o'clock that evening when Rose, stepping out from the High Street station,
      crossed the main road and passed into the darkness of one of the streets leading up the hill.
      She had forced herself to go, and she would go alone. But as she toiled along she felt weary
      and bruised all over. She carried with her a heart of lead—a sense of utter soreness—a longing
      to hide herself from eyes and tongues. The only thing that dwelt softly in the shaken mind was
      a sort of inconsequent memory of Mr. Flaxman's manner at the rehearsal. Had she looked so ill?
      She flushed hotly at the thought, and then realised again, with a sense of childish comfort,
      the kind look and voice, the delicate care shown in shielding her from any unnecessary
      exertion, the brotherly grasp of the hand with which he had put her into the cab that took her
      to the Underground.</p>
<p>Suddenly, where the road made a dark turn to the right, she saw a man standing. As she came
      nearer she saw that it was Langham.</p>
<p>'You!' she cried, stopping.</p>
<p>He came up to her. There was a light over the doorway of a large detached house not far off,
      which threw a certain illumination over him, though it left her in shadow. He said nothing,
      but he held out both his hands mutely. She fancied rather than saw the pale emotion of his
      look.</p>
<p>'What?' she said, after a pause. 'You think to-night is last night! You and I have nothing
      to say to each other, Mr. Langham.'</p>
<p>'I have everything to say,' he answered, under his breath; 'I have committed a crime—a
      villainy.'</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'And it is not pleasant to you?' she said, quivering. 'I am sorry—I cannot help you. But you
      are wrong—it was no crime—it was necessary and profitable, like the doses of one's childhood!
      Oh! I might have guessed you would do this; No, Mr. Langham, I am in no danger of an
      interesting decline. I have just played my <hi>concerto</hi> very fairly. I shall not disgrace
      myself at the concert to-morrow night. You may be at peace—I have learnt several things to-day
      that have been salutary—very salutary.'</p>
<p>She paused. He walked beside her while she pelted him,—unresisting, helplessly silent.</p>
<p>'Don't come any farther,' she said resolutely after a minute, turning to face him. 'Let us
      be quits! I was a temptingly easy prey. I bear no malice. And do not let me break your
      friendship with Robert; that began before this foolish business—it should outlast it. Very
      likely <hi>we</hi> shall be friends again, like ordinary people, some day. I do not imagine
      your wound is very deep, and——'</p>
<p>But no! Her lips closed; not even for pride's sake, and retort's sake, will she desecrate
      the past, belittle her own first love.</p>
<p>She held out her hand. It was very dark. He could see nothing among her furs but the
      gleaming whiteness of her face. The whole personality seemed centred in the voice—the
      half-mocking vibrating voice. He took her hand and dropped it instantly.</p>
<p>'You do not understand,' he said hopelessly—feeling as though every phrase he uttered, or
      could utter, were equally fatuous, equally shameful. 'Thank heaven, you never will
      understand.'</p>
<p>'I think I do,' she said with a change of tone, and paused. He raised his eyes
      involuntarily, met hers, and stood bewildered. What <hi>was</hi> the expression in them? It
      was yearning—but not the yearning of passion. 'If things had been different—if one could
      change the self—if the past were nobler!'—was that the cry of them? A painful humility—a
      boundless pity—the rise of some moral wave within her he could neither measure nor
      explain—these were some of the impressions which passed from her to him. A fresh gulf opened
      between them, and he saw her transformed on the farther side, with, as it were, a loftier
      gesture, a nobler stature, than had ever yet been hers.</p>
<p>He bent forward quickly, caught her hands, held them for an instant to his lips in a
      convulsive grasp, dropped them, and was gone.</p>
<p>He gained his own room again. There lay the medley of his books, his only friends, his real
      passion. Why had he ever tampered with any other?</p>
<p>'<hi>It was not love—not love!</hi>' he said to himself, with an accent of infinite relief
      as he sank into his chair. '<hi>Her</hi> smart will heal.'</p>
