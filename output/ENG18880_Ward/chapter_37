<head>CHAPTER XXXVII</head>
<p>Ten days after Langham's return to Oxford Elsmere received a characteristic letter from him,
      asking whether their friendship was to be considered as still existing or at an end. The calm
      and even proud melancholy of the letter showed a considerable subsidence of that state of
      half-frenzied irritation and discomfort in which Elsmere had last seen him. The writer,
      indeed, was clearly settling down into another period of pessimistic quietism such as that
      which had followed upon his first young efforts at self-assertion years before. But this
      second period bore the marks of an even profounder depression of all the vital forces than the
      first, and as Elsmere, with a deep sigh, half-angry, half-relenting, put down the letter, he
      felt the conviction that no fresh influence from outside would ever again be allowed to
      penetrate the solitude of Langham's life. In comparison with the man who had just addressed
      him, the tutor of his undergraduate recollections was a vigorous and sociable human being.</p>
<p>The relenting grew upon him, and he wrote a sensible affectionate letter in return. Whatever
      had been his natural feelings of resentment, he said, he could not realise, now that the
      crisis was past, that he cared less about his old friend. 'As far as we two are concerned, let
      us forget it all. I could hardly say this, you will easily imagine, if I thought that you had
      done serious or irreparable harm. But both my wife and I agree now in thinking that by a pure
      accident, as it were, and to her own surprise, Rose has escaped either. It will be some time,
      no doubt, before she will admit it. A girl is not so easily disloyal to her past. But to us it
      is tolerably clear. At any rate, I send you our opinion for what it is worth, believing that
      it will and must be welcome to you.'</p>
<p>Rose, however, was not so long in admitting it. One marked result of that new vulnerableness
      of soul produced in her by the shock of that February morning was a great softening towards
      Catherine. Whatever might have been Catherine's intense relief when Robert returned from his
      abortive mission, she never afterwards let a disparaging word towards Langham escape her lips
      to Rose. She was tenderness and sympathy
      <pb/> itself, and Rose, in her curious reaction against her old self, and against the
      noisy world of flattery and excitement in which she had been living, turned to Catherine as
      she had never done since she was a tiny child. She would spend hours in a corner of the
      Bedford Square drawing-room, pretending to read, or play with little Mary, in reality
      recovering, like some bruised and trodden plant, under the healing influence of thought and
      silence.</p>
<p>One day, when they were alone in the firelight, she startled Catherine by saying with one of
      her old odd smiles—</p>
<p>'Do you know, Cathie, how I always see myself nowadays? It is a sort of hallucination. I see
      a girl at the foot of a precipice. She has had a fall, and she is sitting up, feeling all her
      limbs. And, to her great astonishment, there is no bone broken!'</p>
<p>And she held herself back from Catherine's knee lest her sister should attempt to caress
      her, her eyes bright and calm. Nor would she allow an answer, drowning all that Catherine
      might have said in a sudden rush after the child, who was wandering round them in search of a
      playfellow.</p>
<p>In truth, Rose Leyburn's girlish passion for Edward Langham had been a kind of accident
      unrelated to the main forces of character. He had crossed her path in a moment of discontent,
      of aimless revolt and longing, when she was but fresh emerged from the cramping conditions of
      her childhood and trembling on the brink of new and unknown activities. His intellectual
      prestige, his melancholy, his personal beauty, his very strangenesses and weaknesses, had made
      a deep impression on the girl's immature romantic sense. His resistance had increased the
      charm, and the interval of angry resentful separation had done nothing to weaken it. As to the
      months in London, they had been one long duel between herself and him—a duel which had all the
      fascination of difficulty and uncertainty, but in which pride and caprice had dealt and
      sustained a large proportion of the blows. Then, after a moment of intoxicating victory,
      Langham's endangered habits and threatened individuality had asserted themselves once for all.
      And from the whole long struggle—passion, exultation, and crushing defeat—it often seemed to
      her that she had gained neither joy nor irreparable grief, but a new birth of character, a
      soul!</p>
<p>It may be easily imagined that Hugh Flaxman felt a peculiarly keen interest in Langham's
      disappearance. On the afternoon of the Searle House rehearsal he had awaited Rose's coming in
      a state of extraordinary irritation. He expected a blushing <hi>fiancée</hi>, in a fool's
      paradise, asking by manner, if not by word, for his congratulations, and taking a decent
      feminine pleasure perhaps in the pang she might suspect in him. And he had already taken his
      pleasure in the planning of some double-edged congratulations.</p>
<p>Then up the steps of the concert platform there came a pale
      <pb/> tired girl, who seemed specially to avoid his look, who found a quiet corner and
      said hardly a word to anybody till her turn came to play.</p>
<p>His revulsion of feeling was complete. After her piece he made his way up to her, and was
      her watchful unobtrusive guardian for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
<p>He walked home after he had put her into her cab in a whirl of impatient conjecture.</p>
<p>'As compared to last night, she looks this afternoon as if she had had an illness! What on
      earth has that philandering ass been about? If he did not propose to her last night, he ought
      to be shot—and if he did, <hi>à fortiori</hi>, for clearly she is <hi>miserable</hi>. But what
      a brave child! How she played her part! I wonder whether she thinks that <hi>I</hi> saw
      nothing, like all the rest! Poor little cold hand!'</p>
<p>Next day in the street he met Elsmere, turned and walked with him, and by dint of leading
      the conversation a little discovered that Langham had left London.</p>
<p>Gone! But not without a crisis—that was evident. During the din of preparations for the
      Searle House concert, and during the meetings which it entailed, now at the Varleys', now at
      the house of some other connection of his—for the concert was the work of his friends, and
      given in the town house of his decrepit great-uncle, Lord Daniel—he had many opportunities of
      observing Rose. And he felt a soft indefinable change in her which kept him in a perpetual
      answering vibration of sympathy and curiosity. She seemed to him for the moment to have lost
      her passionate relish for living, that relish which had always been so marked with her. Her
      bubble of social pleasure was pricked. She did everything she had to do, and did it admirably.
      But all through she was to his fancy absent and <hi>distraite</hi>, pursuing through the
      tumult of which she was often the central figure some inner meditations of which neither he
      nor any one else knew anything. Some eclipse had passed over the girl's light self-satisfied
      temper; some searching thrill of experience had gone through the whole nature. She had
      suffered, and she was quietly fighting down her suffering without a word to anybody.</p>
<p>Flaxman's guesses as to what had happened came often very near the truth, and the mixture of
      indignation and relief with which he received his own conjectures amused himself.</p>
<p>'To think,' he said to himself once with a long breath, 'that that creature was never at a
      public school, and will go to his death without any one of the kickings due to him!'</p>
<p>Then his very next impulse, perhaps, would be an impulse of gratitude towards this same
      'creature,' towards the man who had released a prize he had had the tardy sense to see was not
      meant for him. <hi>Free</hi> again—to be loved, to be won! There was the fact of facts after
      all.</p>
<p>His own future policy, however, gave him much anxious thought. Clearly at present the one
      thing to be done was to
      <pb/> keep his own ambitions carefully out of sight. He had the skill to see that she was
      in a state of reaction, of moral and mental fatigue. What she mutely seemed to ask of her
      friends was not to be made to feel.</p>
<p>He took his cue accordingly. He talked to his sister. He kept Lady Charlotte in order. After
      all her eager expectation on Hugh's behalf, Lady Helen had been dumfoundered by the sudden
      emergence of Langham at Lady Charlotte's party for their common discomfiture. Who was the
      man?—why, what did it all mean? Hugh had the most provoking way of giving you half his
      confidence. To tell you he was seriously in love, and to omit to add the trifling item that
      the girl in question was probably on the point of engaging herself to somebody else! Lady
      Helen made believe to be angry, and it was not till she had reduced Hugh to a whimsical
      penitence and a full confession of all he knew or suspected, that she consented, with as much
      loftiness as the physique of an elf allowed her, to be his good friend again, and to play
      those cards for him which at the moment he could not play for himself.</p>
<p>So in the cheeriest daintiest way Rose was made much of by both brother and sister. Lady
      Helen chatted of gowns and music and people, whisked Rose and Agnes off to this party and
      that, brought fruit and flowers to Mrs. Leyburn, made pretty deferential love to Catherine,
      and generally, to Mrs. Pierson's disgust, became the girls' chief chaperon in a fast-filling
      London. Meanwhile, Mr. Flaxman was always there to befriend or amuse his sister's
       <hi>protégés</hi>—always there, but never in the way. He was bantering, sympathetic,
      critical, laudatory, what you will; but all the time he preserved a delicate distance between
      himself and Rose, a bright nonchalance and impersonality of tone towards her which made his
      companionship a perpetual tonic. And, between them, he and Helen coerced Lady Charlotte. A few
      inconvenient inquiries after Rose's health, a few unexplained stares and 'humphs' and grunts,
      a few irrelevant disquisitions on her nephew's merits of head and heart, were all she was able
      to allow herself. And yet she was inwardly seething with a mass of sentiments, to which it
      would have been pleasant to give expression—anger with Rose for having been so blind and so
      presumptuous as to prefer some one else to Hugh; anger with Hugh for his persistent disregard
      of her advice and the duke's feelings; and a burning desire to know the precise why and
      wherefore of Langham's disappearance. She was too lofty to become Rose's aunt without a
      struggle, but she was not too lofty to feel the hungriest interest in her love affairs.</p>
<p>But, as we have said, the person who for the time profited most by Rose's shaken mood was
      Catherine. The girl coming over, restless under her own smart, would fall to watching the
      trial of the woman and the wife, and would often perforce forget herself and her smaller woes
      in the pity of it. She stayed in
      <pb/> Bedford Square once for a week, and then for the first time she realised the
      profound change which had passed over the Elsmeres' life. As much tenderness, between husband
      and wife as ever—perhaps more expression of it even than before, as though from an instinctive
      craving to hide the separateness below from each other and from the world. But Robert went his
      way, Catherine hers. Their spheres of work lay far apart; their interests were diverging fast;
      and though Robert at any rate was perpetually resisting, all sorts of fresh invading silences
      were always coming in to limit talk, and increase the number of sore points which each
      avoided. Robert was hard at work in the East End under Murray Edwardes's auspices. He was
      already known to certain circles as a seceder from the Church who was likely to become both
      powerful and popular. Two articles of his in the <hi>Nineteenth Century</hi>, on disputed
      points of Biblical criticism, had distinctly made their mark, and several of the veterans of
      philosophical debate had already taken friendly and flattering notice of the new writer.
      Meanwhile Catherine was teaching in Mr. Clarendon's Sunday school, and attending his
      prayer-meetings. The more expansive Robert's energies became, the more she suffered, and the
      more the small daily opportunities for friction multiplied. Soon she could hardly bear to hear
      him talk about his work, and she never opened the number of the <hi>Nineteenth Century</hi>
      which contained his papers. Nor had he the heart to ask her to read them.</p>
<p>Murray Edwardes had received Elsmere, on his first appearance in R——, with a cordiality and
      a helpfulness of the most self-effacing kind. Robert had begun with assuring his new friend
      that he saw no chance, at any rate for the present, of his formally joining the
      Unitarians.</p>
<p>'I have not the heart to pledge myself again just yet! And I own I look rather for a
      combination from many sides than for the development of any now existing sect. But supposing,'
      he added, smiling, 'supposing I do in time set up a congregation and a service of my own, is
      there really room for you and me? Should I not be infringing on a work I respect a great deal
      too much for anything of the sort?'</p>
<p>Edwardes laughed the notion to scorn.</p>
<p>The parish, as a whole, contained 20,000 persons. The existing churches, which, with the
      exception of St. Wilfrid's, were miserably attended, provided accommodation at the outside for
      3000. His own chapel held 400, and was about half full.</p>
<p>'You and I may drop our lives here,' he said, his pleasant friendliness darkened for a
      moment by the look of melancholy which London work seems to develop even in the most buoyant
      of men, 'and only a few hundred persons, at the most, be ever the wiser. Begin with us—then
      make your own circle.'</p>
<p>And he forthwith carried off his visitor to the point from which, as it seemed to him,
      Elsmere's work might start, viz. a
      <pb/> lecture-room half a mile from his own chapel, where two helpers of his had just
      established an independent venture.</p>
<p>Murray Edwardes had at the time an interesting and miscellaneous staff of lay-curates. He
      asked no questions as to religious opinions, but in general the men who volunteered under
      him—civil servants, a young doctor, a briefless barrister or two—were men who had drifted from
      received beliefs, and found a pleasure and freedom in working for and with him they could
      hardly have found elsewhere. The two who had planted their outpost in what seemed to them a
      particularly promising corner of the district were men of whom Edwardes knew personally
      little. 'I have really not much concern with what they do,' he explained to Elsmere, 'except
      that they get a small share of our funds. But I know they want help, and if they will take you
      in, I think you will make something of it.'</p>
<p>After a tramp through the muddy winter streets, they came upon a new block of warehouses, in
      the lower windows of which some bills announced a night-school for boys and men. Here, to
      judge from the commotion round the doors, a lively scene was going on. Outside, a gang of
      young roughs were hammering at the doors, and shrieking witticisms through the keyhole.
      Inside, as soon as Murray Edwardes and Elsmere, by dint of good humour and strong shoulders,
      had succeeded in shoving their way through and shutting the door behind them, they found a
      still more animated performance in progress. The schoolroom was in almost total darkness; the
      pupils, some twenty in number, were racing about, like so many shadowy demons, pelting each
      other and their teachers with the 'dips' which, as the buildings were new, and not yet fitted
      for gas, had been provided to light them through their three R's. In the middle stood the two
      philanthropists they were in search of, freely bedaubed with tallow, one employed in boxing a
      boy's ears, the other in saving a huge inkbottle whereon some enterprising spirit had just
      laid hands by way of varying the rebel ammunition. Murray Edwardes, who was in his element,
      went to the rescue at once, helped by Robert. The boy-minister, as he looked, had been, in
      fact, 'bow' of the Cambridge eight, and possessed muscles which men twice his size might have
      envied. In three minutes he had put a couple of ringleaders into the street by the scruff of
      the neck, relit a lamp which had been turned out, and got the rest of the rioters in hand.
      Elsmere backed him ably, and in a very short time they had cleared the premises.</p>
<p>Then the four looked at each other, and Edwardes went off into a shout of laughter.</p>
<p>'My dear Wardlaw, my condolences to your coat! But I don't believe if I were a rough myself
      I could resist "dips." Let me introduce a friend—Mr. Elsmere—and if you will have him, a
      recruit for your work. It seems to me another pair of arms will hardly come amiss to you!'</p>
<p>The short red-haired man addressed shook hands with Elsmere,
      <pb/> scrutinising him from under bushy eyebrows. He was panting and beplastered with
      tallow, but the inner man was evidently quite unruffled, and Elsmere liked the shrewd Scotch
      face and gray eyes.</p>
<p>'It isn't only a pair of arms we want,' he remarked drily, 'but a bit of science behind
      them. Mr. Elsmere, I observed, can use his.'</p>
<p>Then he turned to a tall affected-looking youth with a large nose and long fair hair, who
      stood gasping with his hands upon his sides, his eyes, full of a moody wrath, fixed on the
      wreck and disarray of the schoolroom.</p>
<p>'Well, Mackay, have they knocked the wind out of you? My friend and helper—Mr. Elsmere. Come
      and sit down, won't you, a minute. They've left us the chairs, I perceive, and there's a spark
      or two of fire. Do you smoke? Will you light up?'</p>
<p>The four men sat on chatting some time, and then Wardlaw and Elsmere walked home together.
      It had been all arranged. Mackay, a curious morbid fellow, who had thrown himself into
      Unitarianism and charity mainly out of opposition to an orthodox and <hi>bourgeois</hi>
      family, and who had a great idea of his own social powers, was somewhat grudging and
      ungracious through it all. But Elsmere's proposals were much too good to be refused. He
      offered to bring to the undertaking his time, his clergyman's experience, and as much money as
      might be wanted. Wardlaw listened to him cautiously for an hour, took stock of the whole man
      physically and morally, and finally said, as he very quietly and deliberately knocked the
      ashes out of his pipe,—</p>
<p>'All right, I'm your man, Mr. Elsmere. If Mackay agrees, I vote we make you captain of this
      venture.'</p>
<p>'Nothing of the sort,' said Elsmere. 'In London I am a novice; I come to learn, not to
      lead.'</p>
<p>Wardlaw shook his head with a little shrewd smile. Mackay faintly endorsed his companion's
      offer, and the party broke up.</p>
<p>That was in January. In two months from that time, by the natural force of things, Elsmere,
      in spite of diffidence and his own most sincere wish to avoid a premature leadership, had
      become the head and heart of the Elgood Street undertaking, which had already assumed much
      larger proportions. Wardlaw was giving him silent approval and invaluable help, while young
      Mackay was in the first uncomfortable stages of a hero-worship which promised to be
      exceedingly good for him.</p>
