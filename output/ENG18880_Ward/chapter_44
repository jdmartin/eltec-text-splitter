<head>CHAPTER XLIV</head>
<p>The saddest moment in the lives of these two persons whose history we have followed for so
      long was over and done with. Henceforward to the end Elsmere and his wife were lovers as of
      old.</p>
<p>But that day and night left even deeper marks on Robert than on Catherine. Afterwards she
      gradually came to feel, running all through his views of life, a note sterner, deeper, maturer
      than any present there before. The reasons for it were unknown to her, though sometimes her
      own tender, ignorant remorse supplied them. But they were hidden deep in Elsmere's memory.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards he was casually told that Madame de Netteville had left England for
      some time. As a matter of fact he never set eyes on her again. After a while the extravagance
      of his self-blame abated. He saw things as they were—without morbidness. But a certain boyish
      carelessness of mood he never afterwards quite recovered. Men and women of all classes, and
      not only among the poor, became more real and more tragic—moral truths more awful—to him. It
      was the penalty of a highly-strung nature set with exclusive intensity towards certain
      spiritual ends.</p>
<p>On the first opportunity after that conversation with Hugh Flaxman which had so deeply
      affected her, Catherine accompanied Elsmere to his Sunday lecture. He tried a little,
      tenderly, to dissuade her. But she went, shrinking and yet determined.</p>
<p>She had not heard him speak in public since that last sermon of his in Murewell Church,
      every detail of which by long brooding had been burnt into her mind. The bare Elgood Street
      room, the dingy outlook on the high walls of a warehouse oppo
      <pb/>site, the lines of blanched quick-eyed artisans, the dissent from what she loved,
      and he had once loved, implied in everything, the lecture itself, on the narratives of the
      Passion; it was all exquisitely painful to her, and, yet, yet she was glad to be there.</p>
<p>Afterwards Wardlaw, with the brusque remark to Elsmere that 'any fool could see he was
      getting done up,' insisted on taking the children's class. Catherine, too, had been impressed,
      as she saw Robert raised a little above her in the glare of many windows, with the sudden
      perception that the worn, exhausted look of the preceding summer had returned upon him. She
      held out her hand to Wardlaw with a quick, warm word of thanks. He glanced at her curiously.
      What had brought her there after all?</p>
<p>Then Robert, protesting that he was being ridiculously coddled, and that Wardlaw was much
      more in want of a holiday than he, was carried off to the Embankment, and the two spent a
      happy hour wandering westward, Somerset House, the bridges, the Westminster towers rising
      before them into the haze of the June afternoon. A little fresh breeze came off the river;
      that, or his wife's hand on his arm, seemed to put new life into Elsmere. And she walked
      beside him, talking frankly, heart to heart, with flashes of her old sweet gaiety, as she had
      not talked for months.</p>
<p>Deep in her mystical sense all the time lay the belief in a final restoration, in an
      all-atoning moment, perhaps at the very end of life, in which the blind would see, the doubter
      be convinced. And, meanwhile, the blessedness of this peace, this surrender! Surely the air
      this afternoon was pure and life-giving for them, the bells rang for them, the trees were
      green for them!</p>
<p>He had need in the week that followed of all that she had given back to him. For Mr. Grey's
      illness had taken a dangerous and alarming turn. It seemed to be the issue of long ill-health,
      and the doctors feared that there were no resources of constitution left to carry him through
      it. Every day some old St. Anselm's friend on the spot wrote to Elsmere, and with each post
      the news grew more despairing. Since Elsmere had left Oxford he could count on the fingers of
      one hand the occasions on which he and Grey had met face to face. But for him, as for many
      another man of our time, Henry Grey's influence was not primarily an influence of personal
      contact. His mere life, that he was there, on English soil, within a measurable distance, had
      been to Elsmere in his darkest moments one of his thoughts of refuge. At a time when a
      religion which can no longer be believed clashes with a scepticism full of danger to conduct,
      every such witness as Grey to the power of a new and coming truth holds a special place in the
      hearts of men who can neither accept fairy tales, nor reconcile themselves to a world without
      faith. The saintly life grows to be a beacon, a witness.
      <pb/> Men cling to it as they have always clung to each other, to the visible and the
      tangible; as the elders of Miletus, though the Way lay before them, clung to the man who had
      set their feet therein, 'sorrowing most of all that they should see his face no more.'</p>
<p>The accounts grew worse—all friends shut out, no possibility of last words—the whole of
      Oxford moved and sorrowing. Then at last, on a Friday, came the dreaded expected letter: 'He
      is gone! He died early this morning, without pain, conscious almost to the end. He mentioned
      several friends by name, you among them, during the night. The funeral is to be on Tuesday.
      You will be here, of course.'</p>
<p>Sad and memorable day! By an untoward chance it fell in Commemoration week, and Robert found
      the familiar streets teeming with life and noise, under a showery uncertain sky, which every
      now and then would send the bevies of lightly-gowned maidens, with their mothers and attendant
      squires, skurrying for shelter, and leave the roofs and pavements glistening. He walked up to
      St. Anselm's—found, as he expected, that the first part of the service was to be in the
      chapel, the rest in the cemetery, and then mounted the well-known staircase to Langham's
      rooms. Langham was apparently in his bedroom. Lunch was on the table—the familiar commons, the
      familiar toast-and-water. There, in a recess, were the same splendid wall maps of Greece he
      had so often consulted after lecture. There was the little case of coins, with the gold
      Alexanders he had handled with so much covetous reverence at eighteen. Outside, the irregular
      quadrangle with its dripping trees stretched before him; the steps of the new Hall, now the
      shower was over, were crowded with gowned figures. It might have been yesterday that he had
      stood in that room, blushing with awkward pleasure under Mr. Grey's first salutation.</p>
<p>The bedroom door opened and Langham came in.</p>
<p>'Elsmere! But of course I expected you.'</p>
<p>His voice seemed to Robert curiously changed. There was a flatness in it, an absence of
      positive cordiality which was new to him in any greeting of Langham's to himself, and had a
      chilling effect upon him. The face, too, was changed. Tint and expression were both dulled;
      its marble-like sharpness and finish had coarsened a little, and the figure, which had never
      possessed the erectness of youth, had now the pinched look and the confirmed stoop of the
      valetudinarian.</p>
<p>'I did not write to you, Elsmere,' he said immediately, as though in anticipation of what
      the other would be sure to say; 'I knew nothing but what the bulletins said, and I was told
      that Cathcart wrote to you. It is many years now since I have seen much of Grey. Sit down and
      have some lunch. We have time, but not too much time.'</p>
<p>Robert took a few mouthfuls. Langham was difficult, talked disconnectedly of trifles, and
      Robert was soon painfully con
      <pb/>scious that the old sympathetic bond between them no longer existed. Presently,
      Langham, as though with an effort to remember, asked after Catherine, then inquired what he
      was doing in the way of writing, and neither of them mentioned the name of Leyburn. They left
      the table and sat spasmodically talking, in reality expectant. And at last the sound present
      already in both minds made itself heard—the first long solitary stroke of the chapel bell.</p>
<p>Robert covered his eyes.</p>
<p>'Do you remember in this room, Langham, you introduced us first?'</p>
<p>'I remember,' replied the other abruptly. Then, with a half-cynical, half-melancholy
      scrutiny of his companion, he said, after a pause, 'What a faculty of hero-worship you have
      always had, Elsmere!'</p>
<p>'Do you know anything of the end?' Robert asked him presently, as that tolling bell seemed
      to bring the strong feeling beneath more irresistibly to the surface.</p>
<p>'No, I never asked!' cried Langham, with sudden harsh animation. 'What purpose could be
      served? Death should be avoided by the living. We have no business with it. Do what we will,
      we cannot rehearse our own parts. And the sight of other men's performances helps us no more
      than the sight of a great actor gives the dramatic gift. All they do for us is to imperil the
      little nerve, break through the little calm, we have left.'</p>
<p>Elsmere's hand dropped, and he turned round to him with a flashing smile.</p>
<p>'Ah—I know it now—you loved him still.'</p>
<p>Langham, who was standing, looked down on him sombrely, yet more indulgently.</p>
<p>'How much you always made of feeling,' he said after a little pause, 'in a world where,
      according to me, our chief object should be not to feel!'</p>
<p>Then he began to hunt for his cap and gown. In another minute the two made part of the crowd
      in the front quadrangle, where the rain was sprinkling, and the insistent grief-laden voice of
      the bell rolled, from pause to pause, above the gowned figures, spreading thence in wide waves
      of mourning sound over Oxford.</p>
<p>The chapel service passed over Robert like a solemn pathetic dream. The lines of
      undergraduate faces, the provost's white head, the voice of the chaplain reading, the full
      male unison of the voices replying—how they carried him back to the day when as a lad from
      school he had sat on one of the chancel benches beside his mother, listening for the first
      time to the subtle simplicity, if one may be allowed the paradox, of the provost's preaching!
      Just opposite to where he sat now with Langham, Grey had sat that first afternoon; the
      freshman's curious eyes had been drawn again and again to the dark
      <pb/> massive head, the face with its look of reposeful force, of righteous strength.
      During the lesson from Corinthians, Elsmere's thoughts were irrelevantly busy with all sorts
      of mundane memories of the dead. What was especially present to him was a series of Liberal
      election meetings in which Grey had taken a warm part, and in which he himself had helped just
      before he took Orders. A hundred odd, incongruous details came back to Robert now with
      poignant force. Grey had been to him at one time primarily the professor, the philosopher, the
      representative of all that was best in the life of the University; now, fresh from his own
      grapple with London and its life, what moved him most was the memory of the citizen, the
      friend and brother of common man, the thinker who had never shirked action in the name of
      thought, for whom conduct had been from beginning to end the first reality.</p>
<p>The procession through the streets afterwards, which conveyed the body of this great son of
      modern Oxford to its last resting-place in the citizens' cemetery on the western side of the
      town, will not soon be forgotten, even in a place which forgets notoriously soon. All the
      University was there, all the town was there. Side by side with men honourably dear to
      England, who had carried with them into one or other of the great English careers the memory
      of the teacher, were men who had known from day to day the cheery modest helper in a hundred
      local causes; side by side with the youth of Alma Mater went the poor of Oxford; tradesmen and
      artisans followed or accompanied the group of gowned and venerable figures, representing the
      Heads of Houses and the Professors, or mingled with the slowly pacing crowd of Masters; while
      along the route groups of visitors and merrymakers, young men in flannels or girls in light
      dresses, stood with suddenly grave faces here and there, caught by the general wave of
      mourning, and wondering what such a spectacle might mean.</p>
<p>Robert, losing sight of Langham as they left the chapel, found his arm grasped by young
      Cathcart, his correspondent. The man was a junior Fellow who had attached himself to Grey
      during the two preceding years with especial devotion. Robert had only a slight knowledge of
      him, but there was something in his voice and grip which made him feel at once infinitely more
      at home with him at this moment than he had felt with the old friend of his undergraduate
      years.</p>
<p>They walked down Beaumont Street together. The rain came on again, and the long black crowd
      stretched before them was lashed by the driving gusts. As they went along, Cathcart told him
      all he wanted to know.</p>
<p>'The night before the end he was perfectly calm and conscious. I told you he mentioned your
      name among the friends to whom he sent his good-bye. He thought for everybody. For all those
      of his house he left the most minute and tender directions. He forgot nothing. And all with
      such extraordinary
      <pb/> simplicity and quietness, like one arranging for a journey! In the evening an old
      Quaker aunt of his, a North-country woman whom he had been much with as a boy, and to whom he
      was much attached, was sitting with him. I was there too. She was a beautiful old figure in
      her white cap and kerchief, and it seemed to please him to lie and look at her. "It'll not be
      for long, Henry," she said to him once. "I'm seventy-seven this spring. I shall come to you
      soon." He made no reply, and his silence seemed to disturb her. I don't fancy she had known
      much of his mind of late years. "You'll not be doubting the Lord's goodness, Henry?" she said
      to him, with the tears in her eyes. "No," he said, "no, never. Only it seems to be His Will,
      we should be certain of nothing—<hi>but Himself</hi>! I ask no more." I shall never forget the
      accent of those words: they were the breath of his inmost life. If ever man was
       <hi>Gottbetrunken</hi> it was he—and yet not a word beyond what he felt to be true, beyond
      what the intellect could grasp!'</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later Robert stood by the open grave. The rain beat down on the black
      concourse of mourners. But there were blue spaces in the drifting sky, and a wavering rainy
      light played at intervals over the Wytham and Hinksey Hills, and over the butter-cupped river
      meadows, where the lush hay-grass bent in long lines under the showers. To his left, the
      provost, his glistening white head bare to the rain, was reading the rest of the service.</p>
<p>As the coffin was lowered Elsmere bent over the grave. 'My friend, my master,' cried the
      yearning filial heart, 'oh, give me something of yourself to take back into life, something to
      brace me through this darkness of our ignorance, something to keep hope alive as you kept it
      to the end!'</p>
<p>And on the inward ear there rose, with the solemnity of a last message, words which years
      before he had found marked in a little book of Meditations borrowed from Grey's table—words
      long treasured and often repeated—</p>
<p>'Amid a world of forgetfulness and decay, in the sight of his own shortcomings and
      limitations, or on the edge of the tomb, he alone who has found his soul in losing it, who in
      singleness of mind <hi>has lived in order to love and understand</hi>, will find that the God
      who is near to him as his own conscience has a face of light and love!'</p>
<p>Pressing the phrases into his memory, he listened to the triumphant outbursts of the
      Christian service.</p>
<p>'Man's hope,' he thought, 'has grown humbler than this. It keeps now a more modest mien in
      the presence of the Eternal Mystery; but is it in truth less real, less sustaining? Let Grey's
      trust answer for me.'</p>
<p>He walked away absorbed, till at last in the little squalid street outside the cemetery it
      occurred to him to look round for Langham. Instead, he found Cathcart, who had just come up
      with him.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'Is Langham behind?' he asked. 'I want a word with him before I go.'</p>
<p>'Is he here?' asked the other with a change of expression.</p>
<p>'But of course! He was in the chapel. How could you——'</p>
<p>'I thought he would probably go away,' said Cathcart with some bitterness. 'Grey made many
      efforts to get him to come and see him before he became so desperately ill. Langham came once.
      Grey never asked for him again.'</p>
<p>'It is his old horror of expression, I suppose,' said Robert troubled; 'his dread of being
      forced to take a line, to face anything certain and irrevocable. I understand. He could not
      say good-bye to a friend to save his life. There is no shirking that! One must either do it or
      leave it!'</p>
<p>Cathcart shrugged his shoulders, and drew a masterly little picture of Langham's life in
      college. He had succeeded by the most adroit devices in completely isolating himself both from
      the older and the younger men.</p>
<p>'He attends college-meeting sometimes, and contributes a sarcasm or two on the cramming
      system of the college. He takes a constitutional to Summertown every day on the least
      frequented side of the road, that he may avoid being spoken to. And as to his ways of living,
      he and I happen to have the same scout—old Dobson, you remember? And if I would let him, he
      would tell me tales by the hour. He is the only man in the University who knows anything about
      it. I gather from what he says that Langham is becoming a complete valetudinarian. Everything
      must go exactly by rule—his food, his work, the management of his clothes—and any little
       <hi>contretemps</hi> makes him ill. But the comedy is to watch him when there is anything
      going on in the place that he thinks may lead to a canvass and to any attempt to influence him
      for a vote. On these occasions he goes off with automatic regularity to an hotel at West
      Malvern, and only reappears when the <hi>Times</hi> tells him the thing is done with.'</p>
<p>Both laughed. Then Robert sighed. Weaknesses of Langham's sort may be amusing enough to the
      contemptuous and unconcerned outsider. But the general result of them, whether for the man
      himself or those whom he affects, is tragic, not comic; and Elsmere had good reason for
      knowing it.</p>
<p>Later, after a long talk with the provost, and meetings with various other old friends, he
      walked down to the station, under a sky clear from rain, and through a town gay with festal
      preparations. Not a sign now, in these crowded, bustling streets, of that melancholy pageant
      of the afternoon. The heroic memory had flashed for a moment like something vivid and gleaming
      in the sight of all, understanding and ignorant. Now it lay committed to a few faithful
      hearts, there to become one seed among many of a new religious life in England.</p>
<p>On the platform Robert found himself nervously accosted by a tall shabbily-dressed man.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'Elsmere, have you forgotten me?'</p>
<p>He turned and recognised a man whom he had last seen as a St. Anselm's undergraduate—one
      MacNiell, a handsome rowdy young Irishman, supposed to be clever, and decidedly popular in the
      college. As he stood looking at him, puzzled by the difference between the old impression and
      the new, suddenly the man's story flashed across him; he remembered some disgraceful
      escapade—an expulsion.</p>
<p>'You came for the funeral, of course?' said the other, his face flushing consciously.</p>
<p>'Yes—and you too?'</p>
<p>The man turned away, and something in his silence led Robert to stroll on beside him to the
      open end of the platform.</p>
<p>'I have lost my only friend,' MacNiell said at last hoarsely. 'He took me up when my own
      father would have nothing to say to me. He found me work; he wrote to me; for years he stood
      between me and perdition. I am just going out to a post in New Zealand he got for me, and next
      week before I sail—I—I—am to be married—and he was to be there. He was so pleased—he had seen
      her.'</p>
<p>It was one story out of a hundred like it, as Robert knew very well. They talked for a few
      minutes, then the train loomed in the distance.</p>
<p>'He saved you,' said Robert, holding out his hand, 'and at a dark moment in my own life I
      owed him everything. There is nothing we can do for him in return but—to remember him! Write
      to me, if you can or will, from New Zealand, for his sake.'</p>
<p>A few seconds later the train sped past the bare little cemetery, which lay just beyond the
      line. Robert bent forward. In the pale yellow glow of the evening he could distinguish the
      grave, the mound of gravel, the planks, and some figures moving beside it. He strained his
      eyes till he could see no more, his heart full of veneration, of memory, of prayer. In himself
      life seemed so restless and combative. Surely he, more than others, had need of the lofty
      lessons of death!</p>
