<head>CHAPTER XLVIII</head>
<p>After the little incident recorded at the end of the preceding chapter, Hugh Flaxman may be
      forgiven if, as he walked home along the valley that night towards the farmhouse where he had
      established himself, he entertained a very comfortable scepticism as to the permanence of that
      curious contract into which Rose had just forced him. However, he was quite mistaken. Rose's
      maiden dignity avenged itself abundantly on Hugh Flaxman for the injuries it had received at
      the hands of Langham. The restraints, the anomalies, the hairsplittings of the situation
      delighted her ingenuous youth. 'I am free—he is free. We will be friends for six months.
      Possibly we may not suit one another at all. If we do—<hi>then</hi>——'</p>
<p>In the thrill of that <hi>then</hi> lay, of course, the whole attraction of the
      position.</p>
<p>So that next morning Hugh Flaxman saw the comedy was to be scrupulously kept up. It required
      a tolerably strong masculine certainty at the bottom of him to enable him to resign himself
      once more to his part. But he achieved it, and being himself a modern of the moderns, a lover
      of half-shades and refinements of all sorts, he began very soon to enjoy it, and to play it
      with an increasing cleverness and perfection.</p>
<p>How Rose got through Agnes's cross-questioning on the matter history sayeth not. Of one
      thing, however, a <pb/>conscientious historian may be sure, namely, that Agnes succeeded in knowing as much as she
      wanted to know. Mrs. Leyburn was a little puzzled by the erratic lines of Mr. Flaxman's
      journeys. It was, as she said, curious that a man should start on a tour through the Lakes
      from Long Whindale.</p>
<p>But she took everything naïvely as it came, and as she was told. Nothing with her ever
      passed through any changing crucible of thought. It required no planning to elude her. Her
      mind was like a stretch of wet sand, on which all impressions are equally easy to make and
      equally fugitive. He liked them all, she supposed, in spite of the comparative scantiness of
      his later visits to Lerwick Gardens, or he would not have come out of his way to see them. But
      as nobody suggested anything else to her, her mind worked no further, and she was as easily
      beguiled after his appearance as before it by the intricacies of some new knitting.</p>
<p>Things of course might have been different if Mrs. Thornburgh had interfered again; but, as
      we know, poor Catherine's sorrows had raised a whole odd host of misgivings in the mind of the
      vicar's wife. She prowled nervously round Mrs. Leyburn, filled with contempt for her
      placidity; but she did not attack her. She spent herself, indeed, on Rose and Agnes, but long
      practice had made them adepts in the art of baffling her; and when Mr. Flaxman went to tea at
      the vicarage in their company, in spite of an absorbing desire to get at the truth, which
      caused her to forget a new cap, and let fall a plate of tea-cakes, she was obliged to confess
      crossly to the vicar afterwards that 'no one could tell what a man like that was after. She
      supposed his manners were very aristocratic, but for her part she liked plain people.'</p>
<p>On the last morning of Mr. Flaxman's stay in the valley he entered the Burwood drive about
      eleven o'clock, and Rose came down the steps to meet him. For a moment he flattered himself
      that her disturbed looks were due to the nearness of their farewells.</p>
<p>'There is something wrong,' he said, softly detaining her hand a moment—so much, at least,
      was in his right.</p>
<p>'Robert is ill. There has been an accident at Petites Dalles. He has been in bed for a week.
      They hope to get home in a few days. Catherine writes bravely, but she is evidently very
      low.'</p>
<p>Hugh Flaxman's face fell. Certain letters he had received from Elsmere in July had lain
      heavy on his mind ever since, so pitiful was the half-conscious revelation in them of an
      incessant physical struggle. An accident! Elsmere was in no state for accidents. What
      miserable ill-luck!</p>
<p>Rose read him Catherine's account. It appeared that on a certain stormy day a swimmer had
      been observed in difficulties among the rocks skirting the northern side of the Petites Dalles
      bay. The old <hi>baigneur</hi> of the place, owner of the still primitive
      <pb/>
<hi>établissement des bains</hi>, without stopping to strip, or even to take off his heavy
      boots, went out to the man in danger with a plank. The man took the plank and was safe. Then
      to the people watching, it became evident that the <hi>baigneur</hi> himself was in peril. He
      became unaccountably feeble in the water, and the cry rose that he was sinking. Robert, who
      happened to be bathing near, ran off to the spot, jumped in, and swam out. By this time the
      old man had drifted some way. Robert succeeded, however, in bringing him in, and then, amid an
      excited crowd, headed by the <hi>baigneur's</hi> wailing family, they carried the unconscious
      form on to the higher beach. Elsmere was certain life was not extinct, and sent off for a
      doctor. Meanwhile no one seemed to have any common sense, or any knowledge of how to proceed,
      but himself. For two hours he stayed on the beach in his dripping bathing-clothes, a cold wind
      blowing, trying every device known to him: rubbing, hot bottles, artificial respiration. In
      vain. The man was too old and too bloodless. Directly after the doctor arrived he breathed his
      last, amid the wild and passionate grief of wife and children.</p>
<p>Robert, with a cloak flung about him, still stayed to talk to the doctor, to carry one of
      the <hi>baigneur's</hi> sobbing grandchildren to its mother in the village. Then, at last,
      Catherine got hold of him, and he submitted to be taken home, shivering, and deeply depressed
      by the failure of his efforts. A violent gastric and lung chill declared itself almost
      immediately, and for three days he had been anxiously ill. Catherine, miserable, distrusting
      the local doctor, and not knowing how to get hold of a better one, had never left him night or
      day. 'I had not the heart to write even to you,' she wrote to her mother. 'I could think of
      nothing but trying one thing after another. Now he has been in bed eight days, and is much
      better. He talks of getting up to-morrow, and declares he must go home next week. I have tried
      to persuade him to stay here another fortnight, but the thought of his work distresses him so
      much that I hardly dare urge it. I cannot say how I dread the journey. He is not fit for it in
      any way.'</p>
<p>Rose folded up the letter, her face softened to a most womanly gravity. Hugh Flaxman paused
      a moment outside the door, his hands on his sides, considering.</p>
<p>'I shall not go on to Scotland,' he said; 'Mrs. Elsmere must not be left. I will go off
      there at once.'</p>
<p>In Rose's soberly-sweet looks as he left her, Hugh Flaxman saw for an instant, with the
      stirring of a joy as profound as it was delicate, not the fanciful enchantress of the day
      before, but his wife that was to be. And yet she held him to his bargain. All that his lips
      touched as he said good-bye was the little bunch of yellow briar roses she gave him from her
      belt.</p>
<p>Thirty hours later he was descending the long hill from Sassetôt to Petites Dalles. It was
      the 1st of September. A chilly west wind blew up the dust before him and stirred the
      <pb/> parched leafage of the valley. He knocked at the door, of which the woodwork was
      all peeled and blistered by the sun. Catherine herself opened it.</p>
<p>'This is kind—this is like yourself!' she said, after a first stare of amazement, when he
      had explained himself. 'He is in there, much better.'</p>
<p>Robert looked up, stupefied, as Hugh Flaxman entered. But he sprang up with his old
      brightness.</p>
<p>'Well, this <hi>is</hi> friendship! What on earth brings you here, old fellow? Why aren't
      you in the stubbles celebrating St. Partridge?'</p>
<p>Hugh Flaxman said what he had to say very shortly, but so as to make Robert's eyes gleam,
      and to bring his thin hand with a sort of caressing touch upon Flaxman's shoulder.</p>
<p>'I shan't try to thank you—Catherine can if she likes. How relieved she will be about that
      bothering journey of ours! However, I am really ever so much better. It was very sharp while
      it lasted; and the doctor no great shakes. But there never was such a woman as my wife; she
      pulled me through! And now then, sir, just kindly confess yourself a little more plainly. What
      brought you and my sisters-in-law together? You need not try and persuade <hi>me</hi> that
      Long Whindale is the natural gate of the Lakes, or the route intended by Heaven from London to
      Scotland, though I have no doubt you tried that little fiction on them.'</p>
<p>Hugh Flaxman laughed, and sat down very deliberately.</p>
<p>'I am glad to see that illness has not robbed you of that perspicacity for which you are so
      remarkable, Elsmere. Well, the day before yesterday I asked your sister Rose to marry me.
      She——'</p>
<p>'Go on, man,' cried Robert, exasperated by his pause.</p>
<p>'I don't know how to put it,' said Flaxman calmly. 'For six months we are to be rather more
      than friends, and a good deal less than <hi>fiancés</hi>. I am to be allowed to write to her.
      You may imagine how seductive it is to one of the worst and laziest letter-writers in the
      three kingdoms that his fortunes in love should be made to depend on his correspondence. I may
      scold her <hi>if</hi> she gives me occasion. And in six months, as one says to a publisher,
      "the agreement will be open to revision."'</p>
<p>Robert stared.</p>
<p>'And you are not engaged?'</p>
<p>'Not as I understand it,' replied Flaxman. 'Decidedly not!' he added with energy,
      remembering that very platonic farewell.</p>
<p>Robert sat with his hands on his knees, ruminating.</p>
<p>'A fantastic thing, the modern young woman! Still I think I can understand. There may have
      been more than mere caprice in it.'</p>
<p>His eye met his friend's significantly.</p>
<p>'I suppose so,' said Flaxman quietly. Not even for Robert's
      <pb/> benefit was he going to reveal any details of that scene on High Fell 'Never mind,
      old fellow, I am content. And, indeed, <hi>faute de mieux</hi>, I should be content with
      anything that brought me nearer to her, were it but by the thousandth of an inch.'</p>
<p>Robert grasped his hand affectionately.</p>
<p>'Catherine,' he called through the door, 'never mind the supper; let it burn. Flaxman brings
      news.'</p>
<p>Catherine listened to the story with amazement. Certainly her ways would never have been as
      her sister's.</p>
<p>'Are we supposed to know?' she asked, very naturally.</p>
<p>'She never forbade me to tell,' said Flaxman smiling. 'I think, however, if I were you, I
      should say nothing about it—yet. I told her it was part of our bargain that <hi>she</hi>
      should explain my letters to Mrs. Leyburn. I gave her free leave to invent any fairy tale she
      pleased, but it was to be <hi>her</hi> invention, not mine.</p>
<p>Neither Robert nor Catherine were very well pleased. But there was something reassuring as
      well as comic in the stoicism with which Flaxman took his position. And clearly the matter
      must be left to manage itself.</p>
<p>Next morning the weather had improved. Robert, his hand on Flaxman's arm, got down to the
      beach. Flaxman watched him critically, did not like some of his symptoms, but thought on the
      whole he must be recovering at the normal rate, considering how severe the attack had
      been.</p>
<p>'What do you think of him?' Catherine asked him next day, with all her soul in her eyes.
      They had left Robert established in a sunny nook, and were strolling on along the sands.</p>
<p>'I think you must get him home, call in a first-rate doctor, and keep him quiet,' said
      Flaxman. 'He will be all right presently.'</p>
<p>'How <hi>can</hi> we keep him quiet?' said Catherine, with a momentary despair in her fine
      pale face. 'All day long and all night long he is thinking of his work. It is like something
      fiery burning the heart out of him.'</p>
<p>Flaxman felt the truth of the remark during the four days of calm autumn weather he spent
      with them before the return journey. Robert would talk to him for hours, now on the sands,
      with the gray infinity of sea before them, now pacing the bounds of their little room till
      fatigue made him drop heavily into his long chair; and the burden of it all was the religious
      future of the working-class. He described the scene in the Club, and brought out the dreams
      swarming in his mind, presenting them for Flaxman's criticism, and dealing with them himself,
      with that startling mixture of acute common-sense and eloquent passion which had always made
      him so effective as an initiator. Flaxman listened dubiously at first, as he generally
      listened to Elsmere, and then was carried away, not by the beliefs, but by the man.
       <hi>He</hi> found his pleasure in dallying with the magnificent <hi>possibility</hi> of the
      Church; doubt with him
      <pb/> applied to all propositions, whether positive or negative; and he had the dislike
      of the aristocrat and the cosmopolitan for the provincialisms of religious dissent. Political
      dissent or social reform was another matter. Since the Revolution, every generous child of the
      century has been open to the fascination of political or social Utopias. But religion!
       <hi>What—what is truth?</hi> Why not let the old things alone?</p>
<p>However, it was through the social passion, once so real in him, and still living, in spite
      of disillusion and self-mockery, that Robert caught him, had in fact been slowly gaining
      possession of him all these months.</p>
<p>'Well,' said Flaxman one day, 'suppose I grant you that Christianity of the old sort shows
      strong signs of exhaustion, even in England, and in spite of the Church expansion we hear so
      much about; and suppose I believe with you that things will go badly without religion—what
      then? Who can have a religion for the asking?'</p>
<p>'But who can have it without? <hi>Seek</hi>, that you may find. Experiment; try new
      combinations. If a thing is going that humanity can't do without, and you and I believe it,
      what duty is more urgent for us than the effort to replace it?'</p>
<p>Flaxman shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>'What will you gain? A new sect?'</p>
<p>'Possibly. But what we <hi>stand</hi> to gain is a new social bond,' was the flashing
      answer—'a new compelling force in man and in society. Can you deny that the world wants it?
      What are you economists and sociologists of the new type always pining for? Why, for that
      diminution of the self in man which is to enable the individual to see the <hi>world's</hi>
      ends clearly, and to care not only for his own but for his neighbour's interest, which is to
      make the rich devote themselves to the poor, and the poor bear with the rich. If man only
       <hi>would</hi>, he <hi>could</hi>, you say, solve all the problems which oppress him. It is
      man's will which is eternally defective, eternally inadequate. Well, the great religions of
      the world are the stimulants by which the power at the root of things has worked upon this
      sluggish instrument of human destiny. Without religion you cannot make the will equal to its
      tasks. Our present religion fails us; we must, we will have another!'</p>
<p>He rose and began to pace along the sands, now gently glowing in the warm September evening,
      Flaxman beside him.</p>
<p><hi>A new religion!</hi> Of all words, the most tremendous! Flaxman pitifully weighed
      against it the fraction of force fretting and surging in the thin elastic frame beside him. He
      knew well, however—few better—that the outburst was not a mere dream and emptiness. There was
      experience behind it—a burning, driving experience of actual fact.</p>
<p>Presently Robert said, with a change of tone, 'I must have that whole block of warehouses,
      Flaxman.'</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'Must you?' said Flaxman, relieved by the drop from speculation to the practical. 'Why?'</p>
<p>'Look here!' And sitting down again on a sand-hill overgrown with wild grasses and mats of
      sea-thistle, the poor pale reformer began to draw out the details of his scheme on its
      material side. Three floors of rooms brightly furnished, well lit and warmed; a large hall for
      the Sunday lectures, concerts, entertainments, and story-telling; rooms for the boys' club;
      two rooms for women and girls, reached by a separate entrance; a library and reading-room open
      to both sexes, well stored with books, and made beautiful by pictures; three or four smaller
      rooms to serve as committee rooms and for the purposes of the Naturalist Club which had been
      started in May on the Murewell plan; and, if possible, a gymnasium.</p>
<p>'<hi>Money!</hi>' he said, drawing up with a laugh in mid-career. 'There's the rub, of
      course. But I shall manage it.'</p>
<p>To judge from the past, Flaxman thought it extremely likely that he would. He studied the
      cabalistic lines Elsmere's stick had made in the sand for a minute or two; then he said dryly,
      'I will take the first expense: and draw on me afterwards up to five hundred a year, for the
      first four years.'</p>
<p>Robert turned upon him and grasped his hand.</p>
<p>'I do not thank you,' he said quietly, after a moment's pause; 'the work itself will do
      that.'</p>
<p>Again they strolled on, talking, plunging into details, till Flaxman's pulse beat as fast as
      Robert's; so full of infectious hope and energy was the whole being of the man before him.</p>
<p>'I can take in the women and girls now,' Robert said once. 'Catherine has promised to
      superintend it all.'</p>
<p>Then suddenly something struck the mobile mind, and he stood an instant looking at his
      companion. It was the first time he had mentioned Catherine's name in connection with the
      North R—— work. Flaxman could not mistake the emotion, the unspoken thanks in those eyes. He
      turned away, nervously knocking off the ashes of his cigar. But the two men understood each
      other.</p>
