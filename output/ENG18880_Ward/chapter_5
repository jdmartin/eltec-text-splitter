<head>CHAPTER V</head>
<p>In his Oxford life Robert surrendered himself to the best and most stimulating influences of
      the place, just as he had done at school. He was a youth of many friends, by virtue of a
      natural gift of sympathy, which was no doubt often abused, and by no means invariably
      profitable to its owner, but wherein, at any rate, his power over his fellows, like the power
      of half the potent men in the world's history, always lay rooted. He had his mother's delight
      in living. He loved the cricket-field, he loved the river; his athletic instincts and his
      athletic friends were always fighting in him with his literary instincts and the friends who
      appealed primarily to the intellectual and moral side of him. He made many mistakes alike in
      friends and in pursuits; in the freshness of a young and roving curiosity he had great
      difficulty in submitting himself to the intellectual routine of the University, a difficulty
      which ultimately cost him much; but at the bottom of the lad, all the time, there was a
      strength of will, a force and even tyranny of conscience, which kept his charm and pliancy
      from degenerating into weakness, and made it not only delightful, but profitable to love him.
      He knew that his mother was bound up in him, and his being was set to satisfy, so far as he
      could, all her honourable ambitions.</p>
<p>His many undergraduate friends, strong as their influence must have been in the aggregate on
      a nature so receptive, hardly concern us here. His future life, so far as we can see, was most
      noticeably affected by two men older than himself, and belong
      <pb/>ing to the dons—both of them fellows and tutors of St. Anselm's, though on different
      planes of age.</p>
<p>The first one, Edward Langham, was Robert's tutor, and about seven years older than himself.
      He was a man about whom, on entering the college, Robert heard more than the usual crop of
      stories. The healthy young English barbarian has an aversion to the intrusion of more manner
      into life than is absolutely necessary. Now, Langham was overburdened with manner, though it
      was manner of the deprecating and not of the arrogant order. Decisions, it seemed, of all
      sorts were abominable to him. To help a friend he had once consented to be Pro-proctor. He
      resigned in a month, and none of his acquaintances ever afterwards dared to allude to the
      experience. If you could have got at his inmost mind, it was affirmed, the persons most
      obnoxious there would have been found to be the scout, who intrusively asked him every morning
      what he would have for breakfast, and the college cook, who, till such a course was strictly
      forbidden him, mounted to his room at half-past nine to inquire whether he would 'dine in.'
      Being a scholar of considerable eminence, it pleased him to assume on all questions an
      exasperating degree of ignorance; and the wags of the college averred that when asked if it
      rained, or if collections took place on such and such a day, it was pain and grief to him to
      have to affirm positively, without qualifications, that so it was.</p>
<p>Such a man was not very likely, one would have thought, to captivate an ardent, impulsive
      boy like Elsmere. Edward Langham, however, notwithstanding undergraduate tales, was a very
      remarkable person. In the first place, he was possessed of exceptional personal beauty. His
      colouring was vividly black and white, closely curling jet-black hair, and fine black eyes
      contrasting with a pale, clear complexion and even, white teeth. So far he had the
      characteristics which certain Irishmen share with most Spaniards. But the Celtic or Iberian
      brilliance was balanced by a classical delicacy and precision of feature. He had the brow, the
      nose, the upper lip, the finely-moulded chin, which belong to the more severe and spiritual
      Greek type. Certainly of Greek blitheness and directness there was no trace. The eye was
      wavering and profoundly melancholy; all the movements of the tall, finely-built frame were
      hesitating and doubtful. It was as though the man were suffering from paralysis of some moral
      muscle or other; as if some of the normal springs of action in him had been profoundly and
      permanently weakened.</p>
<p>He had a curious history. He was the only child of a doctor in a Lincolnshire country town.
      His old parents had brought him up in strict provincial ways, ignoring the boy's
      idiosyncrasies as much as possible. They did not want an exceptional and abnormal son, and
      they tried to put down his dreamy, self-conscious habits by forcing him into the common,
      middle-class, Evangelical groove. As soon as he got to college, however, the
      <pb/> brooding, gifted nature had a moment of sudden and, as it seemed to the old people
      in Gainsborough, most reprehensible expansion. Poems were sent to them, cut out of one or the
      other of the leading periodicals, with their son's initials appended, and articles of
      philosophical art-criticism, published while the boy was still an undergraduate—which seemed
      to the stern father everything that was sophistical and subversive. For they treated
      Christianity itself as an open question, and showed especially scant respect for the
      'Protestantism of the Protestant religion.' The father warned him grimly that he was not going
      to spend his hard-earned savings on the support of a free-thinking scribbler, and the young
      man wrote no more till just after he had taken a double first in Greats. Then the publication
      of an article in one of the leading Reviews on 'The Ideals of Modern Culture' not only brought
      him a furious letter from home stopping all supplies, but also lost him a probable fellowship.
      His college was one of the narrowest and most backward in Oxford, and it was made perfectly
      plain to him before the fellowship examination that he would not be elected.</p>
<p>He left the college, took pupils for a while, then stood for a vacant fellowship at St.
      Anselm's, the Liberal headquarters, and got it with flying colours.</p>
<p>Thenceforward one would have thought that a brilliant and favourable mental development was
      secured to him. Not at all. The moment of his quarrel with his father and his college had, in
      fact, represented a moment of energy, of comparative success, which never recurred. It was as
      though this outburst of action and liberty had disappointed him, as if some deep-rooted
      instinct—cold, critical, reflective—had reasserted itself, condemning him and his censors
      equally. The uselessness of utterance, the futility of enthusiasm, the inaccessibility of the
      ideal, the practical absurdity of trying to realise any of the mind's inward dreams: these
      were the kind of considerations which descended upon him, slowly and fatally, crushing down
      the newly springing growths of action or of passion. It was as though life had demonstrated to
      him the essential truth of a childish saying of his own which had startled and displeased his
      Calvinist mother years before. 'Mother,' the delicate, large-eyed child had said to her one
      day in a fit of physical weariness, 'how is it I dislike the things I dislike so much more
      than I like the things I like?'</p>
<p>So he wrote no more, he quarrelled no more, he meddled with the great passionate things of
      life and expression no more. On his taking up residence in St. Anselm's, indeed, and on his
      being appointed first lecturer and then tutor, he had a momentary pleasure in the thought of
      teaching. His mind was a storehouse of thought and fact, and to the man brought up at a dull
      provincial day-school and never allowed to associate freely with his kind, the bright lads
      fresh from Eton and Harrow about him were singularly attractive. But a few terms were enough
      to
      <pb/> scatter this illusion too. He could not be simple, he could not be spontaneous; he
      was tormented by self-consciousness, and it was impossible to him to talk and behave as those
      talk and behave who have been brought up more or less in the big world from the beginning. So
      this dream, too, faded, for youth asks, before all things, simplicity and spontaneity in those
      who would take possession of it. His lectures, which were at first brilliant enough to attract
      numbers of men from other colleges, became gradually mere dry, ingenious skeletons, without
      life or feeling. It was possible to learn a great deal from him; it was not possible to catch
      from him any contagion of that <hi>amor intellectualis</hi> which had flamed at one moment so
      high within him. He ceased to compose; but as the intellectual faculty must have some
      employment, he became a translator, a contributor to dictionaries, a microscopic student of
      texts, not in the interest of anything beyond, but simply as a kind of mental
      stone-breaking.</p>
<p>The only survival of that moment of glow and colour in his life was his love of music and
      the theatre. Almost every year he disappeared to France to haunt the Paris theatres for a
      fortnight; to Berlin or Bayreuth to drink his fill of music. He talked neither of music nor of
      acting; he made no one sharer of his enjoyment, if he did enjoy. It was simply his way of
      cheating his creative faculty, which, though it had grown impotent, was still there, still
      restless. Altogether a melancholy, pitiable man—at once thorough-going sceptic and
      thorough-going idealist, the victim of that critical sense which says No to every impulse, and
      is always restlessly, and yet hopelessly, seeking the future through the neglected and
      outraged present.</p>
<p>And yet the man's instincts, at this period of his life at any rate, were habitually kindly
      and affectionate. He knew nothing of women, and was not liked by them, but it was not his
      fault if he made no impression on the youth about him. It seemed to him that he was always
      seeking in their eyes and faces for some light of sympathy which was always escaping him, and
      which he was powerless to compel. He met it for the first time in Robert Elsmere. The
      susceptible, poetical boy was struck at some favourable moment by that romantic side of the
      ineffective tutor—his silence, his melancholy, his personal beauty—which no one else, with
      perhaps one or two exceptions among the older men, cared to take into account; or touched
      perhaps by some note in him, surprised in passing, of weariness or shrinking, as compared with
      the contemptuous tone of the College towards him. He showed his liking impetuously, boyishly,
      as his way was, and thenceforward during his University career Langham became his slave. He
      had no ambition for himself; his motto might have been that dismal one—'The small things of
      life are odious to me, and the habit of them enslaves me; the great things of life are
      eternally attractive to me, and indolence and fear put them by;' but for the University
      chances of this lanky, red-haired youth—with his eagerness, his boundless curi
      <pb/>osity, his genius for all sorts of lovable mistakes—he disquieted himself greatly.
      He tried to discipline the roving mind, to infuse into the boy's literary temper the delicacy,
      the precision, the subtlety of his own. His fastidious, critical habits of work supplied
      exactly that antidote which Elsmere's main faults of haste and carelessness required. He was
      always holding up before him the inexhaustible patience and labour involved in all true
      knowledge; and it was to the germs of critical judgment so implanted in him that Elsmere owed
      many of the later growths of his development—growths with which we have not yet to concern
      ourselves.</p>
<p>And in return, the tutor allowed himself rarely, very rarely, a moment of utterance from the
      depths of his real self. One evening in the summer term following the boy's matriculation,
      Elsmere brought him an essay after Hall, and they sat on talking afterwards. It was a rainy,
      cheerless evening; the first contest of the Boats week had been rowed in cold wind and sleet;
      a dreary blast whistled through the College. Suddenly Langham reached out his hand for an open
      letter. 'I have had an offer, Elsmere,' he said abruptly.</p>
<p>And he put it into his hand. It was the offer of an important Scotch professorship, coming
      from the man most influential in assigning it. The last occupant of the post had been a
      scholar of European eminence. Langham's contributions to a great foreign review, and certain
      Oxford recommendations, were the basis of the present overture, which, coming from one who was
      himself a classic of the classics, was couched in terms flattering to any young man's
      vanity.</p>
<p>Robert looked up with a joyful exclamation when he had finished the letter.</p>
<p>'I congratulate you, sir.'</p>
<p>'I have refused it,' said Langham abruptly.</p>
<p>His companion sat open-mouthed. Young as he was, he knew perfectly well that this particular
      appointment was one of the blue ribbons of British scholarship.</p>
<p>'Do you think—' said the other in a tone of singular vibration, which had in it a note of
      almost contemptuous irritation—'do you think <hi>I</hi> am the man to get and keep a hold on a
      rampagious class of hundreds of Scotch lads? Do you think <hi>I</hi> am the man to carry on
      what Reid began—Reid, that old fighter, that preacher of all sorts of jubilant dogmas?'</p>
<p>He looked at Elsmere under his straight black brows imperiously. The youth felt the nervous
      tension in the elder man's voice and manner, was startled by a confidence never before
      bestowed upon him, close as that unequal bond between them had been growing during the six
      months of his Oxford life, and plucking up courage hurled at him a number of frank, young
      expostulations, which really put into friendly shape all that was being said about Langham in
      his College and in the University. Why was he so self-distrustful, so absurdly diffident
      <pb/> of responsibility, so bent on hiding his great gifts under a bushel?</p>
<p>The tutor smiled sadly, and, sitting down, buried his head in his hands and said nothing for
      a while. Then he looked up and stretched out a hand towards a book which lay on a table near.
      It was the <hi>Réveries</hi> of Senancour. 'My answer is written <hi>here</hi>,' he said. 'It
      will seem to you now, Elsmere, mere Midsummer madness. May it always seem so to you. Forgive
      me. The pressure of solitude sometimes is too great.'</p>
<p>Elsmere looked up with one of his flashing, affectionate smiles, and took the book from
      Langham's hand. He found on the open page a marked passage:</p>
<p>'Oh swiftly passing seasons of life! There was a time when men seemed to be sincere; when
      thought was nourished on friendship, kindness, love; when dawn still kept its brilliance, and
      the night its peace. <hi>I can</hi>, the soul said to itself, and <hi>I will</hi>; I will do
      all that is right—all that is natural. But soon resistance, difficulty, unforeseen, coming we
      know not whence, arrest us, undeceive us, and the human yoke grows heavy on our necks.
      Thenceforward we become merely sharers in the common woe. Hemmed in on all sides, we feel our
      faculties only to realise their impotence: we have time and strength to do what we
       <hi>must</hi>, never what we will. Men go on repeating the words <hi>work, genius,
       success</hi>. Fools! Will all these resounding projects, though they enable us to cheat
      ourselves, enable us to cheat the icy fate which rules us and our globe, wandering forsaken
      through the vast silence of the heavens?'</p>
<p>Robert looked up startled, the book dropping from his hand. The words sent a chill to the
      heart of one born to hope, to will, to crave.</p>
<p>Suddenly Langham dashed the volume from him, almost with violence.</p>
<p>'Forget that drivel, Elsmere. It was a crime to show it to you. It is not sane; neither
      perhaps am I. But I am not going to Scotland. They would request me to resign in a week.'</p>
<p>Long after Elsmere, who had stayed talking a while on other things, had gone, Langham sat on
      brooding over the empty grate.</p>
<p>'Corrupter of youth!' he said to himself once bitterly. And perhaps it was to a certain
      remorse in the tutor's mind that Elsmere owed an experience of great importance to his after
      life.</p>
<p>The name of a certain Mr. Grey had for some time before his entry at Oxford been more or
      less familiar to Robert's ears as that of a person of great influence and consideration at St.
      Anselm's. His tutor at Harden had spoken of him in the boy's hearing as one of the most
      remarkable men of the generation, and had several times impressed upon his pupil that nothing
      could be so desirable for him as to secure the friendship of such a man. It was on the
      occasion of his first interview with the
      <pb/> Provost, after the scholarship examination, that Robert was first brought face to
      face with Mr. Grey. He could remember a short dark man standing beside the Provost, who had
      been introduced to him by that name, but the nervousness of the moment had been so great that
      the boy had been quite incapable of giving him any special attention.</p>
<p>During his first term and a half of residence, Robert occasionally met Mr. Grey in the
      quadrangle or in the street, and the tutor, remembering the thin, bright-faced youth, would
      return his salutations kindly, and sometimes stop to speak to him, to ask him if he were
      comfortably settled in his rooms, or make a remark about the boats. But the acquaintance did
      not seem likely to progress, for Mr. Grey was a Greats tutor, and Robert naturally had nothing
      to do with him as far as work was concerned.</p>
<p>However, a day or two after the conversation we have described, Robert, going to Langham's
      rooms late in the afternoon to return a book which had been lent to him, perceived two figures
      standing talking on the hearth-rug, and by the western light beating in recognised the
      thick-set frame and broad brow of Mr. Grey.</p>
<p>'Come in, Elsmere,' said Langham, as he stood hesitating on the threshold. 'You have met Mr.
      Grey before, I think?'</p>
<p>'We first met at an anxious moment,' said Mr. Grey, smiling and shaking hands with the boy
      'A first interview with the Provost is always formidable. I remember it too well myself. You
      did very well, I remember, Mr. Elsmere. Well, Langham, I must be off. I shall be late for my
      meeting as it is. I think we have settled our business. Good-night.'</p>
<p>Langham stood a moment after the door closed, eyeing young Elsmere. There was a curious
      struggle going on in the tutor's mind.</p>
<p>'Elsmere,' he said at last abruptly, 'would you like to go to-night and hear Grey
      preach?'</p>
<p>'Preach!' exclaimed the lad. 'I thought he was a layman.'</p>
<p>'So he is. It will be a lay sermon. It was always the custom here with the clerical tutors
      to address their men once a term before Communion Sunday, and some years ago, when Grey first
      became tutor, he determined, though he was a layman, to carry on the practice. It was an
      extraordinary effort, for he is a man to whom words on such a subject are the coining of his
      heart's blood, and he has repeated it very rarely. It is two years now since his last
      address.'</p>
<p>'Of course I should like to go,' said Robert with eagerness. 'Is it open?'</p>
<p>'Strictly it is for his Greats pupils, but I can take you in. It is hardly meant for
      freshmen; but—well, you are far enough on to make it interesting to you.'</p>
<p>'The lad will take to Grey's influence like a fish to water,' thought the tutor to himself
      when he was alone, not without
      <pb/> a strange reluctance. 'Well, no one can say I have not given him his opportunity to
      be "earnest."'</p>
<p>The sarcasm of the last word was the kind of sarcasm which a man of his type in an earlier
      generation might have applied to the 'earnestness' of an Arnoldian Rugby.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock that evening Robert found himself crossing the quadrangle with Langham on
      the way to one of the larger lecture rooms, which was to be the scene of the address. The room
      when they got in was already nearly full, all the working fellows of the college were present,
      and a body of some thirty men besides, most of them already far on in their University career.
      A minute or two afterwards Mr. Grey entered. The door opening on to the quadrangle, where the
      trees, undeterred by east wind, were just bursting into leaf, was shut; and the little
      assembly knelt, while Mr. Grey's voice with its broad intonation, in which a strong native
      homeliness lingered under the gentleness of accent, recited the collect 'Lord of all power and
      might,' a silent pause following the last words. Then the audience settled itself, and Mr.
      Grey, standing by a small deal table with the gaslight behind him, began his address.</p>
<p>All the main points of the experience which followed stamped themselves on Robert's mind
      with extraordinary intensity. Nor did he ever lose the memory of the outward scene. In after
      years, memory could always recall to him at will the face and figure of the speaker, the
      massive head, the deep eyes sunk under the brows, the Midland accent, the make of limb and
      feature which seemed to have some suggestion in them of the rude strength and simplicity of a
      peasant ancestry; and then the nobility, the fire, the spiritual beauty flashing through it
      all! Here, indeed, was a man on whom his fellows might lean, a man in whom the generation of
      spiritual force was so strong and continuous that it overflowed of necessity into the poorer,
      barrener lives around him, kindling and enriching. Robert felt himself seized and penetrated,
      filled with a fervour and an admiration which he was too young and immature to analyse, but
      which was to be none the less potent and lasting.</p>
<p>Much of the sermon itself, indeed, was beyond him. It was on the meaning of St. Paul's great
      conception, 'Death unto sin and a new birth unto righteousness.' What did the Apostle mean by
      a death to sin and self? What were the precise ideas attached to the words 'risen with
      Christ'? Are this death and this resurrection necessarily dependent upon certain alleged
      historical events? Or are they not primarily, and were they not, even in the mind of St. Paul,
      two aspects of a spiritual process perpetually re-enacted in the soul of man, and constituting
      the veritable revelation of God? Which is the stable and lasting witness of the Father: the
      spiritual history of the individual and the world, or the envelope of miracle to which
      hitherto mankind has attributed so much importance?</p>
<p>Mr. Grey's treatment of these questions was clothed, through
      <pb/>out a large portion of the lecture, in metaphysical language, which no boy fresh
      from school, however intellectually quick, could be expected to follow with any precision. It
      was not, therefore, the argument, or the logical structure of the sermon, which so profoundly
      affected young Elsmere. It was the speaker himself, and the occasional passages in which,
      addressing himself to the practical needs of his hearers, he put before them the claims and
      conditions of the higher life with a pregnant simplicity and rugged beauty of phrase. Conceit,
      selfishness, vice—how, as he spoke of them, they seemed to wither from his presence! How the
      'pitiful, earthy self' with its passions and its cravings sank into nothingness beside the
      'great ideas' and the 'great causes' for which, as Christians and as men, he claimed their
      devotion.</p>
<p>To the boy sitting among the crowd at the back of the room, his face supported in his hands
      and his gleaming eyes fixed on the speaker, it seemed as if all the poetry and history through
      which a restless curiosity and ideality had carried him so far, took a new meaning from this
      experience. It was by men like this that the moral progress of the world had been shaped and
      inspired; he felt brought near to the great primal forces breathing through the divine
      workshop; and in place of natural disposition and reverent compliance, there sprang up in him
      suddenly an actual burning certainty of belief. 'Axioms are not axioms,' said poor Keats,
      'till they have been proved upon our pulses;' and the old familiar figure of the Divine
      combat, of the struggle in which man and God are one, was proved once more upon a human pulse
      on that May night, in the hush of that quiet lecture room.</p>
<p>As the little moving crowd of men dispersed over the main quadrangle to their respective
      staircases, Langham and Robert stood together a moment in the windy darkness, lit by the
      occasional glimmering of a cloudy moon.</p>
<p>'Thank you, thank you, sir!' said the lad, eager and yet afraid to speak, lest he should
      break the spell of memory. 'I should be sorry indeed to have missed that!'</p>
<p>'Yes, it was fine, extraordinarily fine, the best he has ever given, I think.
      Good-night.'</p>
<p>And Langham turned away, his head sunk on his breast, his hands behind him. Robert went to
      his room conscious of a momentary check of feeling. But it soon passed, and he sat up late,
      thinking of the sermon, or pouring out in a letter to his mother the new hero-worship of which
      his mind was full.</p>
<p>A few days later, as it happened, came an invitation to the junior exhibitioner to spend an
      evening at Mr. Grey's house. Elsmere went in a state of curious eagerness and trepidation, and
      came away with a number of fresh impressions which, when he had put them into order, did but
      quicken his new-born sense of devotion. The quiet unpretending house with its exquisite
      <pb/> neatness and its abundance of books, the family life, with the heart-happiness
      underneath, and the gentle trust and courtesy on the surface, the little touches of austerity
      which betrayed themselves here and there in the household ways—all these surroundings stole
      into the lad's imagination, touched in him responsive fibres of taste and feeling.</p>
<p>But there was some surprise, too, mingled with the charm. He came, still shaken, as it were,
      by the power of the sermon, expecting to see in the preacher of it the outward and visible
      signs of a leadership which, as he already knew, was a great force in Oxford life. His mood
      was that of the disciple only eager to be enrolled. And what he found was a quiet, friendly,
      host, surrounded by a group of men talking the ordinary pleasant Oxford chit-chat—the river,
      the schools, the Union, the football matches, and so on. Every now and then, as Elsmere stood
      at the edge of the circle listening, the rugged face in the centre of it would break into a
      smile, or some boyish speaker would elicit the low spontaneous laugh in which there was such a
      sound of human fellowship, such a genuine note of self-forgetfulness. Sometimes the
      conversation strayed into politics, and then Mr. Grey, an eager politician, would throw back
      his head, and talk with more sparkle and rapidity, flashing occasionally into grim humour
      which seemed to throw light on the innate strength and pugnacity of the peasant and Puritan
      breed from which he sprang. Nothing could be more unlike the inspired philosopher, the mystic
      surrounded by an adoring school, whom Robert had been picturing to himself in his walk up to
      the house, through the soft May twilight.</p>
<p>It was not long before the tutor had learned to take much kindly notice of the ardent and
      yet modest exhibitioner, in whose future it was impossible not to feel a sympathetic
      interest.</p>
<p>'You will always find us on Sunday afternoons, before chapel,' he said to him one day as
      they parted after watching a football match in the damp mists of the Park, and the boy's flush
      of pleasure showed how much he valued the permission.</p>
<p>For three years those Sunday half-hours were the great charm of Robert Elsmere's life. When
      he came to look back upon them, he could remember nothing very definite. A few interesting
      scraps of talk about books; a good deal of talk about politics, showing in the tutor a living
      interest in the needs and training of that broadening democracy on which the future of England
      rests; a few graphic sayings about individuals; above all, a constant readiness on the host's
      part to listen, to sit quiet, with the slight unconscious look of fatigue which was so
      eloquent of a strenuous intellectual life, taking kindly heed of anything that sincerity, even
      a stupid awkward sincerity, had got to say—these were the sort of impressions they had left
      behind them, reinforced always, indeed, by the one continuous impression of a great soul
      speaking with difficulty and labour, but still clearly,
      <pb/> still effectually, through an unblemished series of noble acts and efforts.</p>
<p>Term after term passed away. Mrs. Elsmere became more and more proud of her boy, and more
      and more assured that her years of intelligent devotion to him had won her his entire love and
      confidence, 'so long as they both should live;' she came up to see him once or twice, making
      Langham almost flee the University because she would be grateful to him in public, and
      attending the boat-races in festive attire to which she had devoted the most anxious attention
      for Robert's sake, and which made her, dear, good, impracticable soul, the observed of all
      observers. When she came she and Robert talked all day, so far as lectures allowed, and most
      of the night, after their own eager, improvident fashion; and she soon gathered, with that
      solemn, half-tragic sense of change which besets a mother's heart at such a moment, that there
      were many new forces at work in her boy's mind, deep under-currents of feeling, stirred in him
      by the Oxford influences, which must before long rise powerfully to the surface.</p>
<p>He was passing from a bright buoyant lad into a man, and a man of ardour and conviction. And
      the chief instrument in the transformation was Mr. Grey.</p>
<p>Elsmere got his first in Moderations easily. But the Final Schools were a different matter.
      In the first days of his return to Oxford, in the October of his third year, while he was
      still making up his lecture list, and taking a general oversight of the work demanded from
      him, before plunging definitely into it, he was oppressed with a sense that the two years
      lying before him constituted a problem which would be harder to solve than any which had yet
      been set him. It seemed to him in a moment which was one of some slackness and reaction, that
      he had been growing too fast. He had been making friends besides in far too many camps, and
      the thought, half attractive, half repellent, of all those midnight discussions over
      smouldering fires, which Oxford was preparing for him, those fascinating moments of
      intellectual fence with minds as eager and as crude as his own, and of all the delightful
      dipping into the very latest literature, which such moments encouraged and involved, seemed to
      convey a sort of warning to the boy's will that it was not equal to the situation. He was
      neither dull enough nor great enough for a striking Oxford success. How was he to prevent
      himself from attempting impossibilities and achieving a final mediocrity? He felt a dismal
      certainty that he should never be able to control the strayings of will and curiosity, now
      into this path, now into that; and a still stronger and genuine certainty that it is not by
      such digression that a man gets up the Ethics or the Annals.</p>
<p>Langham watched him with a half irritable attention. In spite of the paralysis of all
      natural ambitions in himself, he was illogically keen that Elsmere should win the distinctions
      of the
      <pb/> place. He, the most laborious, the most disinterested of scholars, turned himself
      almost into a crammer for Elsmere's benefit. He abused the lad's multifarious reading,
      declared it was no better than dram-drinking, and even preached to him an ingenious variety of
      mechanical aids to memory and short cuts to knowledge, till Robert would turn round upon him
      with some triumphant retort drawn from his own utterances at some sincerer and less discreet
      moment. In vain. Langham felt a dismal certainty before many weeks were over that Elsmere
      would miss his first in Greats. He was too curious, too restless, too passionate about many
      things. Above all he was beginning, in the tutor's opinion, to concern himself disastrously
      early with that most overwhelming and most brain-confusing of all human interests—the interest
      of religion. Grey had made him 'earnest' with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Elsmere was now attending Grey's philosophical lectures, following them with enthusiasm, and
      making use of them, as so often happens, for the defence and fortification of views quite
      other than his teacher's. The whole basis of Grey's thought was ardently idealist and
      Hegelian. He had broken with the popular Christianity, but for him, God, consciousness, duty,
      were the only realities. None of the various forms of materialist thought escaped his
      challenge; no genuine utterance of the spiritual life of man but was sure of his sympathy. It
      was known that after having prepared himself for the Christian ministry he had remained a
      layman because it had become impossible to him to accept miracle; and it was evident that the
      commoner type of Churchmen regarded him as an antagonist all the more dangerous because he was
      so sympathetic. But the negative and critical side of him was what in reality told least upon
      his pupils. He was reserved, he talked with difficulty, and his respect for the immaturity of
      the young lives near him was complete. So that what he sowed others often reaped, or to quote
      the expression of a well-known rationalist about him: 'The Tories were always carrying off his
      honey to their hive.' Elsmere, for instance, took in all that Grey had to give, drank in all
      the ideal fervour, the spiritual enthusiasm of the great tutor, and then, as Grey himself
      would have done some twenty years earlier, carried his religious passion so stimulated into
      the service of the great positive tradition around him.</p>
<p>And at that particular moment in Oxford history, the passage from philosophic idealism to
      glad acquiescence in the received Christian system, was a peculiarly easy one. It was the most
      natural thing in the world that a young man of Elsmere's temperament should rally to the
      Church. The place was passing through one of those periodical crises of reaction against an
      overdriven rationalism, which show themselves with tolerable regularity in any great centre of
      intellectual activity. It had begun to be recognised with a great burst of enthusiasm and
      astonishment, that, after all, Mill and Herbert Spencer had not
      <pb/> said the last word on all things in heaven and earth. And now there was exaggerated
      recoil. A fresh wave of religious romanticism was fast gathering strength; the spirit of
      Newman had reappeared in the place which Newman had loved and left; religion was becoming once
      more popular among the most trivial souls, and a deep reality among a large proportion of the
      nobler ones.</p>
<p>With this movement of opinion Robert had very soon found himself in close and sympathetic
      contact. The meagre impression left upon his boyhood by the somewhat grotesque succession of
      the Harden curates, and by his mothers shafts of wit at their expense, was soon driven out of
      him by the stateliness and comely beauty of the Church order as it was revealed to him at
      Oxford. The religious air, the solemn beauty of the place itself, its innumerable associations
      with an organised and venerable faith, the great public functions and expressions of that
      faith, possessed the boy's imagination more and more. As he sat in the undergraduates' gallery
      at St. Mary's on the Sundays, when the great High Church preacher of the moment occupied the
      pulpit, and looked down on the crowded building, full of grave black-gowned figures, and
      framed in one continuous belt of closely packed boyish faces; as he listened to the preacher's
      vibrating voice, rising and falling with the orator's instinct for musical effect; or as he
      stood up with the great surrounding body of undergraduates to send the melody of some Latin
      hymn rolling into the far recesses of the choir, the sight and the experience touched his
      inmost feeling, and satisfied all the poetical and dramatic instincts of a passionate nature.
      The system behind the sight took stronger and stronger hold upon him; he began to wish
      ardently and continuously to become a part of it, to cast in his lot definitely with it.</p>
<p>One May evening he was wandering by himself along the towing-path which skirts the upper
      river, a prey to many thoughts, to forebodings about the schools which were to begin in three
      weeks, and to speculations as to how his mother would take the news of the second class, which
      he himself felt to be inevitable. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, there flashed into his
      mind the little conversation with his mother, which had taken place nearly four years before,
      in the garden at Trinity. He remembered the antagonism which the idea of a clerical life for
      him had raised in both of them, and a smile at his own ignorance and his mother's prejudice
      passed over his quick young face. He sat down on the grassy bank, a mass of reeds at his feet,
      the shadows of the poplars behind him lying across the still river; and opposite, the wide
      green expanse of the great town-meadow, dotted with white patches of geese and herds of
      grazing horses. There, with a sense of something solemn and critical passing over him, he
      began to dream out his future life.</p>
<p>And when he rose half an hour afterwards, and turned his
      <pb/> steps homewards, he knew with an inward tremor of heart that the next great step of
      the way was practically taken. For there by the gliding river, and in view of the distant
      Oxford spires, which his fancy took to witness the act, he had vowed himself in prayer and
      self-abasement to the ministry of the Church.</p>
<p>During the three weeks that followed he made some frantic efforts to make up lost ground. He
      had not been idle for a single day, but he had been unwise, an intellectual spendthrift,
      living in a continuous succession of enthusiasms, and now at the critical moment his stock of
      nerve and energy was at a low ebb. He went in depressed and tired, his friends watching
      anxiously for the result. On the day of the Logic paper, as he emerged into the Schools
      quadrangle, he felt his arm caught by Mr. Grey.</p>
<p>'Come with me for a walk, Elsmere; you look as if some air would do you good.'</p>
<p>Robert acquiesced, and the two men turned into the passage way leading out on to Radcliffe
      Square.</p>
<p>'I have done for myself, sir,' said the youth with a sigh, half impatience, half depression.
      'It seems to me to-day that I had neither mind nor memory. If I get a second I shall be
      lucky.'</p>
<p>'Oh, you will get your second whatever happens,' said Mr. Grey quietly, 'and you mustn't be
      too much cast down about it if you don't get your first.'</p>
<p>This implied acceptance of his partial defeat, coming from another's lips, struck the
      excitable Robert like a lash. It was only what he had been saying to himself, but in the most
      pessimist forecasts we make for ourselves, there is always an under protest of hope.</p>
<p>'I have been wasting my time here lately,' he said, hurriedly raising his college cap from
      his brows as if it oppressed them, and pushing his hair back with a weary restless
      gesture.</p>
<p>'No,' said Mr. Grey, turning his kind frank eyes upon him. 'As far as general training goes,
      you have not wasted your time at all. There are many clever men who don't get a first class,
      and yet it is good for them to be here—so long as they are not loungers and idlers, of course.
      And you have not been a lounger; you have been headstrong, and a little over-confident,
      perhaps,' —the speaker's smile took all the sting out of the words—'but you have grown into a
      man, and you are fit now for man's work. Don't let yourself be depressed, Elsmere. You will do
      better in life than you have done in examination.'</p>
<p>The young man was deeply touched. This tone of personal comment and admonition was very rare
      with Mr. Grey. He felt a sudden consciousness of a shared burden which was infinitely
      soothing, and though he made no answer, his face lost something of its harassed look as the
      two walked on together down Oriel Street and into Merton Meadows.</p>
<p>'Have you any immediate plans?' said Mr. Grey, as they turned into the Broad Walk, now in
      the full leafage of June,
      <pb/> and rustling under a brisk western wind blowing from the river.</p>
<p>'No; at least I suppose it will be no good my trying for a fellowship. But I meant to tell
      you, sir, of one thing—I have made up my mind to take orders.'</p>
<p>'You have? When?'</p>
<p>'Quite lately. So that fixes me, I suppose, to come back for divinity lectures in the
      autumn.'</p>
<p>Mr. Grey said nothing for a while, and they strolled in and out of the great shadows thrown
      by the elms across their path.</p>
<p>'You feel no difficulties in the way?' he asked at last, with a certain quick brusqueness of
      manner.</p>
<p>'No,' said Robert eagerly. 'I never had any. Perhaps,' he added, with a sudden humility, 'it
      is because I have never gone deep enough. What I believe might have been worth more if I had
      had more struggle; but it has all seemed so plain.'</p>
<p>The young voice speaking with hesitation and reserve, and yet with a deep inner conviction,
      was pleasant to hear. Mr. Grey turned towards it, and the great eyes under the furrowed brow
      had a peculiar gentleness of expression.</p>
<p>'You will probably be very happy in the life,' he said. 'The Church wants men of your
      sort.'</p>
<p>But through all the sympathy of the tone Robert was conscious of a veil between them. He
      knew, of course, pretty much what it was, and with a sudden impulse he felt that he would have
      given worlds to break through it and talk frankly with this man whom he revered beyond all
      others, wide as was the intellectual difference between them. But the tutor's reticence and
      the younger man's respect prevented it.</p>
<p>When the unlucky second class was actually proclaimed to the world, Langham took it to heart
      perhaps more than either Elsmere or his mother. No one knew better than he what Elsmere's
      gifts were. It was absurd that he should not have made more of them in sight of the public.
       '<hi>Le cléricalisme, voilà l'ennemi!</hi>' was about the gist of Langham's mood during the
      days that followed on the class list.</p>
<p>Elsmere, however, did not divulge his intention of taking orders to him till ten days
      afterwards, when he had carried off Langham to stay at Harden, and he and his old tutor were
      smoking in his mother's little garden one moonlit night.</p>
<p>When he had finished his statement Langham stood still a moment watching the wreaths of
      smoke as they curled and vanished. The curious interest in Elsmere's career, which during a
      certain number of months had made him almost practical, almost energetic, had disappeared. He
      was his own languid, paradoxical self.</p>
<p>'Well, after all,' he said at last, very slowly, 'the difficulty lies in preaching anything.
      One may as well preach a respectable mythology as anything else.'</p>
<p>'What do you mean by a mythology?' cried Robert hotly.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'Simply ideas, or experiences, personified,' said Langham, puffing away. 'I take it they are
      the subject-matter of all theologies.'</p>
<p>'I don't understand you,' said Robert, flushing. 'To the Christian, facts have been the
      medium by which ideas the world could not otherwise have come at have been communicated to
      man. Christian theology is a system of ideas indeed, but of ideas realised, made manifest in
      facts.'</p>
<p>Langham looked at him for a moment, undecided; then that suppressed irritation we have
      already spoken of broke through. 'How do you know they are facts?' he said drily.</p>
<p>The younger man took up the challenge with all his natural eagerness, and the conversation
      resolved itself into a discussion of Christian evidences. Or rather Robert held forth, and
      Langham kept him going by an occasional remark which acted like the prick of a spur. The
      tutor's psychological curiosity was soon satisfied. He declared to himself that the intellect
      had precious little to do with Elsmere's Christianity. He had got hold of all the stock
      apologetic arguments, and used them, his companion admitted, with ability and ingenuity. But
      they were merely the outworks of the citadel. The inmost fortress was held by something wholly
      distinct from intellectual conviction—by moral passion, by love, by feeling, by that
      mysticism, in short, which no healthy youth should be without.</p>
<p>'He imagines he has satisfied his intellect,' was the inward comment of one of the most
      melancholy of sceptics, 'and he has never so much as exerted it. What a brute I am to
      protest!'</p>
<p>And suddenly Langham threw up the sponge. He held out his hand to his companion, a momentary
      gleam of tenderness in his black eyes, such as on one or two critical occasions before had
      disarmed the impetuous Elsmere.</p>
<p>'No use to discuss it further. You have a strong case, of course, and you have put it well.
      Only, when you are pegging away at reforming and enlightening the world, don't trample too
      much on the people who have more than enough to do to enlighten themselves.'</p>
<p>As to Mrs. Elsmere, in this new turn of her son's fortunes, she realised with humorous
      distinctness that for some years past Robert had been educating her as well as himself. Her
      old rebellious sense of something inherently absurd in the clerical status had been gradually
      slain in her by her long contact through him with the finer and more imposing aspects of
      church life. She was still on light skirmishing terms with the Harden curates, and at times
      she would flame out into the wildest, wittiest threats and gibes, for the momentary
      satisfaction of her own essentially lay instincts; but at bottom she knew perfectly well that,
      when the moment came, no mother could be more loyal, more easily imposed upon, than she would
      be.</p>
<p>'I suppose, then, Robert, we shall be back at Murewell before
      <pb/> very long,' she said to him one morning abruptly, studying him the while out of her
      small twinkling eyes. What dignity there was already in the young lightly-built frame! what
      frankness and character in the irregular, attractive face!</p>
<p>'Mother,' cried Elsmere indignantly, 'what do you take me for? Do you imagine I am going to
      bury myself in the country at five or six-and-twenty, take six hundred a year, and nothing to
      do for it? That would be a deserter's act indeed.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Elsmere shrugged her shoulders. 'Oh, I supposed you would insist on killing yourself,
      to begin with. To most people nowadays that seems to be the necessary preliminary of a useful
      career.'</p>
<p>Robert laughed and kissed her, but her question had stirred him so much that he sat down
      that very evening to write to his cousin Mowbray Elsmere. He announced to him that he was
      about to read for orders, and that at the same time he relinquished all claim on the living of
      Murewell. 'Do what you like with it when it falls vacant,' he wrote, 'without reference to me.
      My views are strong that before a clergyman in health and strength, and in no immediate want
      of money, allows himself the luxury of a country parish, he is bound, for some years at any
      rate, to meet the challenge of evil and poverty where the fight is hardest—among our English
      town population.'</p>
<p>Sir Mowbray Elsmere replied curtly in a day or two to the effect that Robert's letter seemed
      to him superfluous. He, Sir Mowbray, had nothing to do with his cousin's views. When the
      living was vacant—the present holder, however, was uncommon tough and did not mean dying—he
      should follow out the instructions of his father's will, and if Robert did not want the thing
      he could say so.</p>
<p>In the autumn Robert and his mother went back to Oxford. The following spring he redeemed
      his Oxford reputation completely by winning a Fellowship at Merton after a brilliant fight
      with some of the best men of his year, and in June he was ordained.</p>
<p>In the summer term some teaching work was offered him at Merton, and by Mr. Grey's advice he
      accepted it, thus postponing for a while that London curacy and that stout grapple with human
      need at its sorest for which his soul was pining. 'Stay here a year or two,' Grey said
      bluntly; 'you are at the beginning of your best learning time, and you are not one of the
      natures who can do without books. You will be all the better worth having afterwards, and
      there is no lack of work here for a man's moral energies.'</p>
<p>Langham took the same line, and Elsmere submitted. Three happy and fruitful years followed.
      The young lecturer developed an amazing power of work. That concentration which he had been
      unable to achieve for himself his will was strong enough to maintain when it was a question of
      meeting the demands of a college class in which he was deeply interested.
      <pb/> He became a stimulating and successful teacher, and one of the most popular of men.
      His passionate sense of responsibility towards his pupils made him load himself with burdens
      to which he was constantly physically unequal, and fill the vacations almost as full as the
      terms. And as he was comparatively a man of means, his generous impetuous temper was able to
      gratify itself in ways that would have been impossible to others. The story of his summer
      reading parties, for instance, if one could have unravelled it, would have been found to be
      one long string of acts of kindness towards men poorer and duller than himself.</p>
<p>At the same time he formed close and eager relations with the heads of the religious party
      in Oxford. His mother's Evangelical training of him and Mr. Grey's influence, together,
      perhaps, with certain drifts of temperament, prevented him from becoming a High Churchman. The
      sacramental, ceremonial view of the Church never took hold upon him. But to the English Church
      as a great national institution for the promotion of God's work on earth no one could have
      been more deeply loyal, and none coming close to him could mistake the fervour and passion of
      his Christian feeling. At the same time he did not know what rancour or bitterness meant, so
      that men of all shades of Christian belief reckoned a friend in him, and he went through life
      surrounded by an unusual, perhaps a dangerous amount of liking and affection. He threw himself
      ardently into the charitable work of Oxford, now helping a High Church vicar, and now toiling
      with Grey and one or two other Liberal fellows, at the maintenance of a coffee-palace and
      lecture-room just started by them in one of the suburbs; while in the second year of his
      lectureship the success of some first attempts at preaching fixed the attention of the
      religious leaders upon him as upon a man certain to make his mark.</p>
<p>So the three years passed—years not, perhaps, of great intellectual advance, for other
      forces in him than those of the intellect were mainly to the fore, but years certainly of
      continuous growth in character and moral experience. And at the end of them Mowbray Elsmere
      made his offer, and it was accepted.</p>
<p>The secret of it, of course, was overwork. Mrs. Elsmere, from the little house in Merton
      Street, where she had established herself, had watched her boy's meteoric career through these
      crowded months with very frequent misgivings. No one knew better than she that Robert was
      constitutionally not of the toughest fibre, and she realised long before he did that the
      Oxford life as he was bent on leading it must end for him in premature breakdown. But, as
      always happens, neither her remonstrances, nor Mr. Grey's common-sense, nor Langham's fidgety
      protests had any effect on the young enthusiast to whom self-slaughter came so easy. During
      the latter half of his third year of teaching he was continually being sent away by the
      doctors, and coming back only to break down again. At last,
      <pb/> in the January of his fourth year, the collapse became so decided that he
      consented, bribed by the prospect of the Holy Land, to go away for three months to Egypt and
      the East, accompanied by his mother and a college friend.</p>
<p>Just before their departure news reached him of the death of the rector of Murewell,
      followed by a formal offer of the living from Sir Mowbray. At the moment when the letter
      arrived he was feeling desperately tired and ill, and in after-life he never forgot the
      half-superstitious thrill and deep sense of depression with which he received it. For within
      him was a slowly-emerging, despairing conviction that he was indeed physically unequal to the
      claims of his Oxford work, and if so, still more unequal to grappling with the hardest
      pastoral labour and the worst forms of English poverty. And the coincidence of the Murewell
      incumbent's death struck his sensitive mind as a Divine leading.</p>
<p>But it was a painful defeat. He took the letter to Grey, and Grey strongly advised him to
      accept.</p>
<p>'You overdrive your scruples, Elsmere,' said the Liberal tutor with emphasis. 'No one can
      say a living with 1200 souls, and no curate, is a sinecure. As for hard town work, it is
      absurd—you couldn't stand it. And after all, I imagine, there are some souls worth saving out
      of the towns.'</p>
<p>Elsmere pointed out vindictively that family livings were a corrupt and indefensible
      institution. Mr. Grey replied calmly that they probably were, but that the fact did not
      affect, so far as he could see, Elsmere's competence to fulfil all the duties of rector of
      Murewell.</p>
<p>'After all, my dear fellow,' he said, a smile breaking over his strong expressive face, 'it
      is well even for reformers to be sane.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Elsmere was passive. It seemed to her that she had foreseen it all along. She was
      miserable about his health, but she too had a moment of superstition, and would not urge him.
      Murewell was no name of happy omen to her—she had passed the darkest hours of her life
      there.</p>
<p>In the end Robert asked for delay, which was grudgingly granted him. Then he and his mother
      and friend fled over seas: he feverishly determined to get well and cheat the fates. But,
      after a halcyon time in Palestine and Constantinople, a whiff of poisoned air at Cannes, on
      their way home, acting on a low constitutional state, settled matters. Robert was laid up for
      weeks with malarious fever, and when he struggled out again into the hot Riviera sunshine it
      was clear to himself and everybody else that he must do what he could, and not what he would,
      in the Christian vineyard.</p>
<p>'Mother,' he said one day, suddenly looking up at her as she sat near him working, 'can
       <hi>you</hi> be happy at Murewell?'</p>
<p>There was a wistfulness in the long thin face, and a pathetic accent of surrender in the
      voice, which hurt the mother's heart.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'I can be happy wherever you are,' she said, laying her brown nervous hand on his blanched
      one.</p>
<p>'Then give me pen and paper and let me write to Mowbray. I wonder whether the place has
      changed at all. Heigh ho! How is one to preach to people who have stuffed you up with
      gooseberries, or swung you on gates, or lifted you over puddles to save your petticoats? I
      wonder what has become of that boy whom I hit in the eye with my bow and arrow, or of that
      other lout who pummelled me into the middle of next week for disturbing his bird-trap? By the
      way, is the Squire—is Roger Wendover—living at the Hall now?'</p>
