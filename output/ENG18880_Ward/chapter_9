<head>CHAPTER IX</head>
<p>Robert was very nearly reduced to despair by the scene with Catherine we have described. He
      spent a brooding and miserable hour in the vicar's study afterwards, making up his mind as to
      what he should do. One phrase of hers which had passed almost unnoticed in the shock of the
      moment was now ringing in his ears, maddening him by a sense of joy just within his reach, and
      yet barred away from him by an obstacle as strong as it was intangible. '<hi>We are not here
       only to be happy</hi>,' she had said to him, with a look of ethereal exaltation worthy of her
      namesake of Alexandria. The words had slipped from her involuntarily in the spiritual tension
      of her mood. They were now filling Robert Elsmere's mind with a tormenting, torturing bliss.
      What could they mean? What had her paleness, her evident trouble and weakness meant, but that
      the inmost self of hers was his, was conquered; and that, but for the shadowy obstacle between
      them, all would be well?</p>
<p>As for the obstacle in itself, he did not admit its force for a moment. No sane and
      practical man, least of all when that man happened to be Catherine Leyburn's lover, could
      regard it as a binding obligation upon her that she should sacrifice her own life and
      happiness to three persons, who were in no evident moral straits, no physical or pecuniary
      need, and who, as Rose
      <pb/> incoherently put it, might very well be rather braced than injured by the
      withdrawal of her strong support.</p>
<p>But the obstacle of character—ah, there was a different matter! He realised with despair the
      brooding scrupulous force of moral passion to which her lonely life, her antecedents, and her
      father's nature working in her had given so rare and marked a development. No temper in the
      world is so little open to reason as the ascetic temper. How many a lover and husband, how
      many a parent and friend, have realised to their pain, since history began, the overwhelming
      attraction which all the processes of self-annihilation have for a certain order of minds!
      Robert's heart sank before the memory of that frail indomitable look, that aspect of sad yet
      immovable conviction with which she had bade him farewell. And yet, surely—surely under the
      willingness of the spirit there had been a pitiful, a most womanly weakness of the flesh.
      Surely, now memory reproduced the scene, she had been white—trembling: her hand had rested on
      the moss-grown wall beside her for support. Oh, why had he been so timid? why had he let that
      awe of her, which her personality produced so readily, stand between them? why had he not
      boldly caught her to himself, and, with all the eloquence of a passionate nature, trampled on
      her scruples, marched through her doubts, convinced—reasoned her into a blessed
      submission!</p>
<p>'And I will do it yet!' he cried, leaping to his feet with a sudden access of hope and
      energy. And he stood awhile looking out into the rainy evening, all the keen irregular face
      and thin pliant form hardening into the intensity of resolve, which had so often carried the
      young tutor through an Oxford difficulty, breaking down antagonism and compelling consent.</p>
<p>At the high tea which represented the late dinner of the household he was wary and
      self-possessed. Mrs. Thornburgh got out of him that he had been for a walk, and had seen
      Catherine, but for all her ingenuities of cross-examination she got nothing more. Afterwards,
      when he and the vicar were smoking together, he proposed to Mr. Thornburgh that they two
      should go off for a couple of days on a walking tour to Ullswater.</p>
<p>'I want to go away,' he said, with a hand on the vicar's shoulder, '<hi>and I want to come
       back</hi>.' The deliberation of the last words was not to be mistaken. The vicar emitted a
      contented puff, looked the young man straight in the eyes, and without another word began to
      plan a walk to Patterdale <hi>viâ</hi> High Street, Martindale, and Howtown, and back by
      Haweswater.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Thornburgh Robert announced that he must leave them on the following Saturday, June
      24.</p>
<p>'You <hi>have</hi> given me a good time, Cousin Emma,' he said to her, with a bright
      friendliness which dumbfoundered her. A good time, indeed! with everything begun and nothing
      finished; with two households thrown into perturbation for a delusion,
      <pb/> and a desirable marriage spoilt, all for want of a little common sense and plain
      speaking, which <hi>one</hi> person at least in the valley could have supplied them with, had
      she not been ignored and brow beaten on all sides. She contained herself, however, in his
      presence, but the vicar suffered proportionately in the privacy of the connubial chamber. He
      had never seen his wife so exasperated. To think what might have been, what she might have
      done for the race, but for the whims of two stuck-up, superior, impracticable young persons,
      that would neither manage their own affairs nor allow other people to manage them for them!
      The vicar behaved gallantly, kept the secret of Elsmere's remark to himself like a man, and
      allowed himself certain counsels against matrimonial meddling which plunged Mrs. Thornburgh
      into well-simulated slumber. However, in the morning he was vaguely conscious that some time
      in the visions of the night his spouse had demanded of him peremptorily, 'When do you get
      back, William?' To the best of his memory the vicar had sleepily murmured, 'Thursday'; and had
      then heard, echoed through his dreams, a calculating whisper, 'He goes Saturday—one clear
      day!'</p>
<p>The following morning was gloomy but fine, and after breakfast the vicar and Elsmere started
      off. Robert turned back at the top of the High Fell pass and stood leaning on his alpenstock,
      sending a passionate farewell to the gray distant house, the upper window, the copper beech in
      the garden, the bit of winding road, while the vicar discreetly stepped on northward, his eyes
      fixed on the wild regions of Martindale.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh, left alone, absorbed herself to all appearance in the school treat which
      was to come off in a fortnight, in a new set of covers for the drawing-room, and in Sarah's
      love affairs, which were always passing through some tragic phase or other, and into which
      Mrs. Thornburgh was allowed a more unencumbered view than she was into Catherine Leyburn's.
      Rose and Agnes dropped in now and then, and found her not at all disposed to talk to them on
      the great event of the day—Elsmere's absence and approaching departure. They cautiously
      communicated to her their own suspicions as to the incident of the preceding afternoon; and
      Rose gave vent to one fiery onslaught on the 'moral obstacle' theory, during which Mrs.
      Thornburgh sat studying her with small attentive eyes and curls slowly waving from side to
      side. But for once in her life the vicar's wife was not communicative in return. That the
      situation should have driven even Mrs. Thornburgh to finesse was a surprising testimony to its
      gravity. What between her sudden taciturnity and Catherine's pale silence, the girls' sense of
      expectancy was roused to its highest pitch.</p>
<p>'They come back to-morrow night,' said Rose thoughtfully, 'and he goes Saturday—10:20 from
      Whinborough—one day for the Fifth Act! By the way, why did Mrs. Thornburgh ask us to say
      nothing about Saturday at home?'</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>She <hi>had</hi> asked them, however; and with a pleasing sense of conspiracy they
      complied.</p>
<p>It was late on Thursday afternoon when Mrs. Thornburgh, finding the Burwood front door open,
      made her unchallenged way into the hall, and after an unanswered knock at the drawing-room
      door, opened it and peered in to see who might be there.</p>
<p>'May I come in?'</p>
<p>Mrs. Leyburn, who was a trifle deaf, was sitting by the window absorbed in the intricacies
      of a heel which seemed to her more than she could manage. Her card was mislaid, the girls were
      none of them at hand, and she felt as helpless as she commonly did when left alone.</p>
<p>'Oh, do come in, please! So glad to see you. Have you been nearly blown away?'</p>
<p>For, though the rain had stopped, a boisterous north-west wind was still rushing through the
      valley, and the trees round Burwood were swaying and groaning under the force of its
      onslaught.</p>
<p>'Well, it is stormy,' said Mrs. Thornburgh, stepping in and undoing all the various safety
      pins and elastics which had held her dress high above the mud. 'Are the girls out?'</p>
<p>'Yes, Catherine and Agnes are at the school; and Rose, I think, is practising.'</p>
<p>'Ah, well,' said Mrs. Thornburgh, settling herself in a chair close by her friend, 'I wanted
      to find you alone.'</p>
<p>Her face, framed in bushy curls and an old garden bonnet, was flushed and serious. Her
      mittened hands were clasped nervously on her lap, and there was about her such an air of
      forcibly restrained excitement that Mrs. Leyburn's mild eyes gazed at her with some
      astonishment. The two women were a curious contrast: Mrs. Thornburgh short, inclined, as we
      know, to be stout, ample and abounding in all things, whether it were curls or cap-strings or
      conversation; Mrs. Leyburn tall and well proportioned, well dressed, with the same graceful
      ways and languid pretty manners as had first attracted her husband's attention thirty years
      before. She was fond of Mrs. Thornburgh, but there was something in the ebullient energies of
      the vicar's wife which always gave her a sense of bustle and fatigue.</p>
<p>'I am sure you will be sorry to hear,' began her visitor, 'that Mr. Elsmere is going.'</p>
<p>'Going?' said Mrs. Leyburn, laying down her knitting. 'Why, I thought he was going to stay
      with you another ten days at least.'</p>
<p>'So did I—so did he,' said Mrs. Thornburgh, nodding, and then pausing with a most effective
      air of sudden gravity and 'recollection.'</p>
<p>'Then why—what's the matter?' asked Mrs. Leyburn, wondering.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh did not answer for a minute, and Mrs. Leyburn began to feel a little
      nervous, her visitor's eyes were fixed upon her with so much meaning. Urged by a sudden
      impulse she bent forward; so did Mrs. Thornburgh, and their two elderly heads nearly
      touched.</p>
<p>'The young man is in love!' said the vicar's wife in a stage whisper, drawing back after a
      pause, to see the effect of her announcement.</p>
<p>'Oh! with whom?' asked Mrs. Leyburn, her look brightening. She liked a love affair as much
      as ever.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh furtively looked round to see if the door was shut and all safe—she felt
      herself a criminal, but the sense of guilt had an exhilarating rather than a depressing effect
      upon her.</p>
<p>'Have you guessed nothing? have the girls told you anything?'</p>
<p>'No!' said Mrs. Leyburn, her eyes opening wider and wider. She never guessed anything; there
      was no need, with three daughters to think for her, and give her the benefit of their young
      brains. 'No,' she said again. 'I can't imagine what you mean.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh felt a rush of inward contempt for so much obtuseness.</p>
<p>'Well, then, <hi>he is in love with Catherine!</hi>' she said abruptly, laying her hand on
      Mrs. Leyburn's knee, and watching the effect.</p>
<p>'With Catherine!' stammered Mrs. Leyburn; '<hi>with Catherine!</hi>'</p>
<p>The idea was amazing to her. She took up her knitting with trembling fingers, and went on
      with it mechanically a second or two. Then laying it down—'Are you quite sure? has he told
      you?'</p>
<p>'No, but one has eyes,' said Mrs. Thornburgh hastily. 'William and I have seen it from the
      very first day. And we are both certain that on Tuesday she made him understand in some way or
      other that she wouldn't marry him, and that is why he went off to Ullswater, and why he made
      up his mind to go south before his time is up.'</p>
<p>'Tuesday?' cried Mrs. Leyburn. 'In that walk, do you mean, when Catherine looked so tired
      afterwards? You think he proposed in that walk?'</p>
<p>She was in a maze of bewilderment and excitement.</p>
<p>'Something like it—but if he did, she said "No"; and what I want to know is <hi>why</hi> she
      said "No."'</p>
<p>'Why, of course, because she didn't care for him!' exclaimed Mrs. Leyburn, opening her blue
      eyes wider and wider. 'Catherine's not like most girls; she would always know what she felt,
      and would never keep a man in suspense.'</p>
<p>'Well, I don't somehow believe,' said Mrs. Thornburgh boldly, 'that she doesn't care for
      him. He is just the young man Catherine might care for. You can see that yourself.'</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>Mrs. Leyburn once more laid down her knitting and stared at her visitor. Mrs. Thornburgh,
      after all her meditations, had no very precise idea as to <hi>why</hi> she was at that moment
      in the Burwood drawing-room bombarding Mrs. Leyburn in this fashion. All she knew was that she
      had sallied forth determined somehow to upset the situation, just as one gives a shake
      purposely to a bundle of spillikins on the chance of more favourable openings. Mrs. Leyburn's
      mind was just now playing the part of spillikins, and the vicar's wife was shaking it
      vigorously, though with occasional qualms as to the lawfulness of the process.</p>
<p>'You think Catherine does care for him?' resumed Mrs. Leyburn tremulously.</p>
<p>'Well, isn't he just the kind of man one would suppose Catherine would like?' repeated Mrs.
      Thornburgh persuasively; 'he is a clergyman, and she likes serious people; and he's sensible
      and nice and well-mannered. And then he can talk about books, just like her father used—I'm
      sure William thinks he knows everything! He isn't as nice-looking as he might be just now, but
      then that's his hair and his fever, poor man. And then he isn't hanging about. He's got a
      living, and there'd be the poor people all ready, and everything else Catherine likes. And now
      I'll just ask you—did you ever see Catherine more—more—<hi>lively</hi>—well, I know that's not
      just the word, but you know what I mean—than she has been the last fortnight?'</p>
<p>But Mrs. Leyburn only shook her head helplessly. She did not know in the least what Mrs.
      Thornburgh meant. She never thought Catherine doleful, and she agreed that certainly 'lively'
      was not the word.</p>
<p>'Girls get so frightfully particular nowadays,' continued the vicar's wife, with reflective
      candour. 'Why, when William fell in love with me, I just fell in love with him—at once—because
      he did. And if it hadn't been William, but somebody else, it would have been the same. I don't
      believe girls have got hearts like pebbles—if the man's nice, of course!'</p>
<p>Mrs. Leyburn listened to this summary of matrimonial philosophy with the same yielding
      flurried attention as she was always disposed to give to the last speaker.</p>
<p>'But,' she said, still in a maze, 'if she did care for him, why should she send him
      away?'</p>
<p>'<hi>Because she won't have him!</hi>' said Mrs. Thornburgh energetically, leaning over the
      arm of her chair that she might bring herself nearer to her companion.</p>
<p>The fatuity of the answer left Mrs. Leyburn staring.</p>
<p>'Because she won't have him, my dear Mrs. Leyburn! And—and—I'm sure nothing would make me
      interfere like this if I weren't so fond of you all, and if William and I didn't know for
      certain that there never was a better young man born! And then I was just sure you'd be the
      last person in the world, if you knew, to stand in young people's way!'</p>
<p>'<hi>I!</hi>' cried poor Mrs. Leyburn—'I stand in the way!' She
      <pb/> was getting tremulous and tearful, and Mrs. Thornburgh felt herself a brute.</p>
<p>'Well,' she said, plunging on desperately, 'I have been thinking over it night and day. I've
      been watching him, and I've been talking to the girls, and I've been putting two and two
      together, and I'm just about sure that there might be a chance for Robert, if only Catherine
      didn't feel that you and the girls couldn't get on without her!'</p>
<p>Mrs. Leyburn took up her knitting again with agitated fingers. She was so long in answering
      that Mrs. Thornburgh sat and thought with trepidation of all sorts of unpleasant consequences
      which might result from this audacious move of hers.</p>
<p>'I don't know how we <hi>should</hi> get on,' cried Mrs. Leyburn at last, with a sort of
      suppressed sob, while something very like a tear fell on the stocking she held.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh was still more frightened, and rushed into a flood of apologetic speech.
      Very likely she was wrong, perhaps it was all a mistake, she was afraid she had done harm, and
      so on. Mrs. Leyburn took very little heed, but at last she said, looking up and applying a
      soft handkerchief gently to her eyes—</p>
<p>'Is his mother nice? Where's his living? Would he want to be married soon?'</p>
<p>The voice was weak and tearful, but there was in it unmistakable eagerness to be informed.
      Mrs. Thornburgh, overjoyed, let loose upon her a flood of particulars, painted the virtues and
      talents of Mrs. Elsmere, described Robert's Oxford career, with an admirable sense for effect,
      and a truly feminine capacity for murdering every university detail, drew pictures of the
      Murewell living and rectory, of which Robert had photographs with him, threw in adroit
      information about the young man's private means, and in general showed what may be made of a
      woman's mind under the stimulus of one of the occupations most proper to it. Mrs. Leyburn
      brightened visibly as the flood proceeded. Alas, poor Catherine! How little room there is for
      the heroic in this trivial everyday life of ours!</p>
<p>Catherine a bride, Catherine a wife and mother, dim visions of a white soft morsel in which
      Catherine's eyes and smile should live again—all these thoughts went trembling and flashing
      through Mrs. Leyburn's mind as she listened to Mrs. Thornburgh. There is so much of the artist
      in the maternal mind, of the artist who longs to see the work of his hand in fresh
      combinations and under all points of view. Catherine, in the heat of her own self-surrender,
      had perhaps forgotten that her mother too had a heart!</p>
<p>'Yes, it all sounds very well,' said Mrs. Leyburn at last, sighing, 'but, you know,
      Catherine isn't easy to manage.'</p>
<p>'Could you talk to her—find out a little?'</p>
<p>'Well, not to-day; I shall hardly see her. Doesn't it seem to you that when a girl takes up
      notions like Catherine's, she
      <pb/> hasn't time for thinking about the young men? Why, she's as full of business all
      day long as an egg's full of meat. Well, it was my poor Richard's doing—it was his doing,
      bless him! I am not going to say anything against it. But it <hi>was</hi> different—once.'</p>
<p>'Yes, I know,' said Mrs. Thornburgh thoughtfully. 'One had plenty of time, when you and I
      were young, to sit at home and think what one was going to wear, and how one would look, and
      whether <hi>he</hi> had been paying attention to any one else; and if he had, why; and all
      that. And now the young women are so superior. But the marrying has got to be done somehow all
      the same. What is she doing to-day?'</p>
<p>'Oh, she'll be busy all to-day and to-morrow; I hardly expect to see her till Saturday.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh gave a start of dismay.</p>
<p>'Why, what <hi>is</hi> the matter now?' she cried in her most aggrieved tones. 'My dear Mrs.
      Leyburn, one would think we had the cholera in the parish. Catherine just spoils the
      people.'</p>
<p>'Don't you remember,' said Mrs. Leyburn, staring in her turn, and drawing herself up a
      little, 'that to-morrow is Midsummer Day, and that Mary Backhouse is as bad as she can
      be?'</p>
<p>'Mary Backhouse! Why, I had forgotten all about her!' cried the vicar's wife, with sudden
      remorse. And she sat pensively eyeing the carpet awhile.</p>
<p>Then she got what particulars she could out of Mrs. Leyburn. Catherine, it appeared, was at
      this moment at High Ghyll, was not to return till late, and would be with the dying girl
      through the greater part of the following day, returning for an hour or two's rest in the
      afternoon, and staying in the evening till the twilight, in which the ghost always made her
      appearances, should have passed into night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh listened to it all, her contriving mind working the while at railway speed
      on the facts presented to her.</p>
<p>'How do you get her home to-morrow night?' she asked, with sudden animation.</p>
<p>'Oh, we send our man Richard at ten. He takes a lantern if it's dark.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Thornburgh said no more. Her eyes and gestures were all alive again with energy and
      hope. She had given her shake to Mrs. Leyburn's mind. Much good might it do! But, after all,
      she had the poorest opinion of the widow's capacities as an ally.</p>
<p>She and her companion said a few more excited, affectionate, and apologetic things to one
      another, and then she departed.</p>
<p>Both mother and knitting were found by Agnes half an hour later in a state of considerable
      confusion. But Mrs. Leyburn kept her own counsel, having resolved for once, with a timid and
      yet delicious excitement, to act as the head of the family.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Thornburgh was laying plans on her own account.</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'Ten o'clock—moonlight,' said that contriving person to herself going home—'at least if the
      clouds hold up—that'll do—couldn't be better.'</p>
<p>To any person familiar with her character the signs of some unusual preoccupation were clear
      enough in Mrs. Leyburn during this Thursday evening. Catherine noticed them at once when she
      got back from High Ghyll about eight o'clock, and wondered first of all what was the matter;
      and then, with more emphasis, why the trouble was not immediately communicated to her. It had
      never entered into her head to take her mother into her confidence with regard to Elsmere.
      Since she could remember, it had been an axiom in the family to spare the delicate nervous
      mother all the anxieties and perplexities of life. It was a system in which the subject of it
      had always acquiesced with perfect contentment, and Catherine had no qualms about it. If there
      was good news, it was presented in its most sugared form to Mrs. Leyburn; but the moment any
      element of pain and difficulty cropped up in the common life, it was pounced upon and
      appropriated by Catherine, aided and abetted by the girls, and Mrs. Leyburn knew no more about
      it than an unweaned babe.</p>
<p>So that Catherine was thinking at most of some misconduct of a Perth dyer with regard to her
      mother's best gray poplin, when one of the greatest surprises of her life burst upon her.</p>
<p>She was in Mrs. Leyburn's bedroom that night, helping to put away her mother's things, as
      her custom was. She had just taken off the widow's cap, caressing as she did so the brown hair
      underneath, which was still soft and plentiful, when Mrs. Leyburn turned upon her.
      'Catherine!' she said in an agitated voice, laying a thin hand on her daughter's arm. 'Oh,
      Catherine, I want to speak to you!'</p>
<p>Catherine knelt lightly down by her mother's side, and put her arms round her waist.</p>
<p>'Yes, mother darling,' she said, half smiling.</p>
<p>'Oh, Catherine! if—if—you like Mr. Elsmere, don't mind—don't think—about us, dear. We can
      manage—we can manage, dear!'</p>
<p>The change that took place in Catherine Leyburn's face is indescribable. She rose instantly,
      her arms falling behind her, her beautiful brows drawn together. Mrs. Leyburn looked up at her
      with a pathetic mixture of helplessness, alarm, entreaty.</p>
<p>'Mother, who has been talking to you about Mr. Elsmere and me?' demanded Catherine.</p>
<p>'Oh, never mind, dear, never mind,' said the widow hastily; 'I should have seen it
      myself—oh, I know I should; but I'm a bad mother, Catherine!' And she caught her daughter's
      dress and drew her towards her. '<hi>Do</hi> you care for him?'</p>
<p>Catherine did not answer. She knelt down again, and laid her head on her mother's hands.</p>
<p>'I want nothing,' she said presently in a low voice of intense
      <pb/> emotion—'I want nothing but you and the girls. You are my life, I ask for nothing
      more. I am abundantly—content.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Leyburn gazed down on her with infinite perplexity. The brown hair, escaped from the
      cap, had fallen about her still pretty neck, a pink spot of excitement was on each
      gently-hollowed cheek; she looked almost younger than her pale daughter.</p>
<p>'But—he is very nice,' she said timidly. 'And he has a good living. Catherine, you ought to
      be a clergyman's wife.'</p>
<p>'I ought to be, and I am your daughter,' said Catherine, smiling a little with an unsteady
      lip, and kissing her hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leyburn sighed and looked straight before her. Perhaps in imagination she saw the
      vicar's wife. 'I think—I think,' she said very seriously, 'I should like it!'</p>
<p>Catherine straightened herself brusquely at that. It was as though she had felt a blow.</p>
<p>'Mother!' she cried, with a stifled accent of pain, and yet still trying to smile, 'do you
      want to send me away?'</p>
<p>'No, no!' cried Mrs. Leyburn hastily. 'But if a nice man wants you to marry him, Catherine?
      Your father would have liked him—oh, I know your father would have liked him! And his manners
      to me are so pretty, I shouldn't mind being <hi>his</hi> mother-in-law. And the girls have no
      brother, you know, dear. Your father was always so sorry about that.'</p>
<p>She spoke with pleading agitation, her own tempting imaginations—the pallor, the latent
      storm of Catherine's look—exciting her more and more.</p>
<p>Catherine was silent a moment, then she caught her mother's hand again.</p>
<p>'Dear little mother—dear, kind little mother! You are an angel, you always are. But I think,
      if you'll keep me, I'll stay.'</p>
<p>And she once more rested her head clingingly on Mrs. Leyburn's knee.</p>
<p>'But <hi>do</hi> you—<hi>do</hi> you love him, Catherine?'</p>
<p>'I love you, mother, and the girls, and my life here.'</p>
<p>'Oh dear,' sighed Mrs. Leyburn, as though addressing a third person, the tears in her mild
      eyes, 'she won't, and she <hi>would</hi> like it, and so should I!'</p>
<p>Catherine rose, stung beyond bearing.</p>
<p>'And I count for nothing to you, mother!' her deep voice quivering. 'You could put me aside,
      you and the girls, and live as though I had never been!'</p>
<p>'But you would be a great deal to us if you did marry, Catherine!' cried Mrs. Leyburn,
      almost with an accent of pettishness. 'People have to do without their daughters. There's
      Agnes—I often think, as it is, you might let her do more. And if Rose were troublesome, why,
      you know it might be a good thing—a very good thing—if there were a man to take her in
      hand!'</p>
<p>
<pb/></p>
<p>'And you, mother, without me?' cried poor Catherine, choked.</p>
<p>'Oh, I should come and see you,' said Mrs. Leyburn, brightening. 'They say it <hi>is</hi>
      such a nice house, Catherine, and such pretty country; and I'm sure I should like his mother,
      though she <hi>is</hi> Irish!'</p>
<p>It was the bitterest moment of Catherine Leyburn's life. In it the heroic dream of years
      broke down. Nay, the shrivelling ironic touch of circumstance laid upon it made it look even
      in her own eyes almost ridiculous. What had she been living for, praying for, all these years?
      She threw herself down by the widow's side, her face working with a passion that terrified
      Mrs. Leyburn.</p>
<p>'Oh, mother, say you would miss me—say you would miss me if I went!'</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Leyburn herself broke down, and the two women clung to each other, weeping.
      Catherine's sore heart was soothed a little by her mother's tears, and by the broken words of
      endearment that were lavished on her. But through it all she felt that the excited imaginative
      desire in Mrs. Leyburn still persisted. It was the cheapening—the vulgarising, so to speak, of
      her whole existence.</p>
<p>In the course of their long embrace Mrs. Leyburn let fall various items of news that showed
      Catherine very plainly who had been at work upon her mother, and one of which startled
      her.</p>
<p>'He comes back to-night, my dear—and he goes on Saturday. Oh, and, Catherine, Mrs.
      Thornburgh says he <hi>does</hi> care so much. Poor young man!'</p>
<p>And Mrs. Leyburn looked up at her now standing daughter with eyes as woe-begone for Elsmere
      as for herself.</p>
<p>'Don't talk about it any more, mother,' Catherine implored. 'You won't sleep, and I shall be
      more wroth with Mrs. Thornburgh than I am already.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Leyburn let herself be gradually soothed and coerced, and Catherine, with a last kiss
      to the delicate emaciated fingers on which the worn wedding-ring lay slipping forward—in
      itself a history—left her at last to sleep.</p>
<p>'And I don't know much more than when I began!' sighed the perplexed widow to herself. 'Oh,
      I wish Richard was here—I do!'</p>
<p>Catherine's night was a night of intense mental struggle. Her struggle was one with which
      the modern world has perhaps but scant sympathy. Instinctively we feel such things out of
      place in our easy indifferent generation. We think them more than half unreal. We are so apt
      to take it for granted that the world has outgrown the religious thirst for sanctification,
      for a perfect moral consistency, as it has outgrown so many of the older complications of the
      sentiment of honour. And meanwhile half the tragedy of our time lies in this perpetual
      clashing of
      <pb/> two estimates of life—the estimate which is the offspring of the scientific spirit,
      and which is for ever making the visible world fairer and more desirable in mortal eyes; and
      the estimate of Saint Augustine.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, owing to some travelling difficulties, the vicar and Elsmere did not
      get home till noon on Friday. Catherine knew nothing of either delay or arrival. Mrs. Leyburn
      watched her with anxious timidity, but she never mentioned Elsmere's name to any one on the
      Friday morning, and no one dared speak of him to her. She came home in the afternoon from the
      Backhouses' absorbed apparently in the state of the dying girl, took a couple of hours' rest,
      and hurried off again. She passed the vicarage with bent head, and never looked up.</p>
<p>'She is gone!' said Rose to Agnes as she stood at the window looking after her sister's
      retreating figure. 'It is all over! They can't meet now. He will be off by nine
      to-morrow.'</p>
<p>The girl spoke with a lump in her throat, and flung herself down by the window, moodily
      watching the dark form against the fells. Catherine's coldness seemed to make all life colder
      and more chilling—to fling a hard denial in the face of the dearest claims of earth.</p>
<p>The stormy light of the afternoon was fading towards sunset. Catherine walked on fast
      towards the group of houses at the head of the valley, in one of which lived the two old
      carriers who had worked such havoc with Mrs. Thornburgh's housekeeping arrangements. She was
      tired physically, but she was still more tired mentally. She had the bruised feeling of one
      who has been humiliated before the world and before herself. Her self-respect was for the
      moment crushed, and the breach made in the wholeness of personal dignity had produced a
      strange slackness of nerve, extending both to body and mind. She had been convicted, it seemed
      to her, in her own eyes, and in those of her world, of an egregious over-estimate of her own
      value. She walked with hung head like one ashamed, the overstrung religious sense deepening
      her discomfiture at every step. How rich her life had always been in the conviction of
      usefulness—nay, indispensableness! Her mother's persuasions had dashed it from her. And
      religious scruple, for her torment, showed her her past, transformed, alloyed with all sorts
      of personal prides and cravings, which stood unmasked now in a white light.</p>
<p>And he? Still near her for a few short hours! Every pulse in her had thrilled as she had
      passed the house which sheltered him. But she will see him no more. And she is glad. If he had
      stayed on, he too would have discovered how cheaply they held her—those dear ones of hers for
      whom she had lived till now! And she might have weakly yielded to his pity what she had
      refused to his homage. The strong nature is half tortured, half soothed by the prospect of his
      going. Perhaps when he is gone she will recover something of that moral equilibrium which
      <pb/> has been so shaken. At present she is a riddle to herself, invaded by a force she
      has no power to cope with, feeling the moral ground of years crumbling beneath her, and
      struggling feverishly for self-control.</p>
<p>As she neared the head of the valley the wind became less tempestuous. The great wall of
      High Fell, towards which she was walking, seemed to shelter her from its worst violence. But
      the hurrying clouds, the gleams of lurid light which every now and then penetrated into the
      valley from the west, across the dip leading to Shanmoor, the voice of the river answering the
      voice of the wind, and the deep unbroken shadow that covered the group of houses and trees
      towards which she was walking, all served to heighten the nervous depression which had taken
      hold of her. As she neared the bridge, however, leading to the little hamlet, beyond which
      northwards all was stony loneliness and desolation, and saw in front of her the gray stone
      house, backed by the sombre red of a great copper beech, and overhung by crags, she had
      perforce to take herself by both hands, try and realise her mission afresh, and the scene
      which lay before her.</p>
