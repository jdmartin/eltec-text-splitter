<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<p>There are few things more difficult than when one's mind is full of the interests, cares,
      and sorrows of one set of friends, to have to empty it suddenly of them, and refill it as
      suddenly with the entirely different, and perhaps discrepant interests, cares, and sorrows of
      an altogether alien set.</p>
<p>Seldom in the course of their old and tried friendship has Jim Burgoyne felt less disposed
      for the company and conversation of his valued ally, Mrs. Byng, than when he knocks at the
      door of her sitting-room on the morning following the excursion to Certosa. He cannot talk to
      her about the Le Marchants, seeing that she has never even heard of their existence; and if
      out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh, his talk upon any other topic must be
      scant and jejune indeed. The only cheerful side which his prospective visit turns to him is,
      that if he were not with Mrs. Byng, he would be with Amelia; and that the friendlily
      indifferent eyes of the former will, at all events, be less likely than the hungrily loving
      ones of the latter to detect that he has not slept a wink, and that he has not the remotest
      idea what he is talking about. If he were to follow his inclination, he would be bestowing his
      company this morning upon neither friend nor sweetheart, but would be ransacking Florence for
      the piece of information he had yesterday promised those two woebegone women to procure for
      them. Even into the very midst of his heartfelt sore compassion for them, there pierces a
      shamed unwilling flash of elation at the thought of what a stride to intimacy his being
      entrusted with this commission implies, of what an opening to indefinitely numerous future
      visits it affords. His determination to conduct the search is at present a good deal more
      clearly defined than the method in which that search is to be effected. He can consult
       <hi>Galignani</hi> as to the names and whereabouts of new arrivals; but they could do that
      much for themselves. He could examine the visitors' books of the different hotels; but
      Florence, though a little city, is rich in hostelries, and this course would take time. He
      could consult Mr. Greenock, the head and fount of all Florentine gossip, and who, since he had
      seen him in conversation with the object of his inquiries, would probably be able to satisfy
      them; but his acquaintance with the good-natured newsmonger is not sufficiently intimate for
      him to be able to pay him a morning visit with any air of probability of having been impelled
      thereto by a desire for his company; and, moreover, he shrinks with a morbid fear from any
      action which may lead, however obliquely, to his being himself apprised of the terrible secret
      which—it is no longer mere matter of conjecture—lies couched somewhere in those two poor
      creatures' past.</p>
<p>And meanwhile he knocks at Mrs. Byng's door, and is quickly bidden enter by a cheerful
      English voice, the welcoming alacrity of whose tones shames his own want of pleasure in the
      meeting. But he is too unfortunately honest to express a joy he does not experience, and only
      says, with a slight accent of reproach as he takes her ready hand, heartily held out:</p>
<p>"You should not spring these surprises upon us."</p>
<p>She laughs a little guiltily.</p>
<p>"It—it was a sudden thought; you see I—I had never seen Perugia."</p>
<p>He laughs too. "Poor Perugia! I think it would have blushed unseen for a good many more
      years if you had not begun to doubt the efficiency of my chaperonage. Confess! you have come
      to look after the precious baby-boy, have not you?"</p>
<p>His tone is, as he himself feels, not quite a pleasant one; but the mother is scarcely more
      prone to take offence than the son; and she answers with an amiably hasty disclaimer:</p>
<p>"It was not that I felt the least want of confidence in you—you must not think that; but—but
      I had one of my presentiments! you know that I am always a little superstitious; and three
      nights running an owl came and hooted quite close under my window!"</p>
<p>"As long as I have known your wood, it has had owls; and as long as I have known them, they
      have hooted."</p>
<p>"In the wood, yes, of course, and I like to hear them; but this one was close under my
      window."</p>
<p>Jim's only answer is to lift his hands and shoulders in protest against his friend's
      weak-mindedness.</p>
<p>"I had quite made up my mind that something had happened," continues she, not much abashed
      by his scorn; "and it was the greatest relief when I first caught sight of him at the station
      yesterday, looking just as usual, a little thinner perhaps—does not he strike you as a little
      thin? Has he been weighed lately? He gives me the idea of having lost a pound or two since I
      last saw him. Is there a weighing-machine in the hotel?"</p>
<p>"It will be very easy to ascertain."</p>
<p>"And how is Amelia?"—her cheerful eyes resting in friendly and half-inquisitive interest on
      his sombre face.</p>
<p>"Amelia is very well, thank you."</p>
<p>"Amelia Wilson still?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"For how long?"—laughing—"another ten years, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"For three months, I believe; we are to be married as soon as they return to England."</p>
<p>"You do not say so?"—with an accent of lively and delighted incredulity—"hurrah! poor
      Amelia! '<hi>Tout vient à point à qui sait attendre</hi>;' and she has <hi>su attendre</hi>
      with a vengeance, has not she?"</p>
<p>"She is not going to <hi>attendre</hi> any more," replies Jim dryly.</p>
<p>"Then I shall have to give you a present, I suppose!" cries Mrs. Byng, still with that
      delighted accent. "Something useful, I have no doubt. I feel sure that Amelia would like
      something useful; why should not we choose it to-day? Florence is an ideal place for buying
      presents; do you think that Amelia would spare you to me for a whole morning?"</p>
<p>Jim hesitates. It is not that he has any doubt as to Amelia's cheerful renunciation of any
      portion of his time that he may see fit to abstract from her; but the occupation
      suggested—that of squiring Mrs. Byng—is not that to which he had purposed devoting his
      forenoon. She sees his unreadiness to answer, and attributes it to a wrong cause.</p>
<p>"Amelia will not?" cries she in a tone of surprise and disappointment. "Well, I could not
      have believed it of her! Not even if you told her that it is on purpose to buy her a
      present?"</p>
<p>Jim breaks into an unavoidable smile. "How frightfully quickly your mind moves! It leaps
      like a kangaroo! I never said that she would not resign the precious boon of my society; on
      the contrary, I am sure that nothing would give her greater pleasure, but—but—what will Willy
      say to my monopolizing you?"</p>
<p>At the excessive disingenuousness of this speech his conscience gives him a severe prick,
      recalling to his mind the attitude of prostrate affliction—stretched face downwards on his
      bed—in which his young friend had received the news of his parent's prospective approach. A
      light cloud passes over that parent's sunny face.</p>
<p>"Willy has an engagement this morning," she answers more slowly, and with less radiance than
      has hitherto marked her utterances; "nothing could be sweeter and dearer than he was, and he
      is going to take me somewhere this afternoon—to Fiesole or Petraia, or somewhere else
      delightful; but this morning he has an engagement. He did not tell me what it was, and I did
      not like to tease him with questions. You"—with a rather wistful glance of interrogation at
      her companion—"do not happen to know what it is?"</p>
<p>Jim shakes his head, while a rather deeper shade than habitually lies upon it settles on his
      careworn forehead. It is perfectly true that he knows nothing of young Byng's engagement, but
      yet he has a shrewd suspicion to what quarter of the town that engagement will lead him.</p>
<p>"So that I rather counted upon you," continues Mrs. Byng, turning with a somewhat
      crestfallen air to the window.</p>
<p>"And you did not count in vain," replies Burgoyne, with a sort of forced gallantry. It has
      flashed upon him that he will have to consent under penalty of giving a detailed account of
      the reasons for his inability, and that therefore he had better make a virtue of necessity,
      and do it with a good grace. After all, the deferring for a couple of hours of his researches
      cannot be of any great consequence to the persons in whose behalf those researches are set on
      foot. To a suspicious ear there might be something dubious in the sudden and galvanized
      alacrity of his assent; but not a shadow of doubt crosses Mrs. Byng's mind as to her old and
      tried ally being as pleased to avail himself of an opportunity for enjoying her society as he
      has always showed himself during the twenty years and more of their acquaintance.</p>
<p>Protected by this happy misconception, she sets off, all smiles, though at the outset of the
      expedition she finds that she has to modify her project; and that Burgoyne shows himself
      restive as to <hi>bric-à-brac</hi> shops, and declines peremptorily to be any party to buying
      himself a wedding present. He puts his objection upon the semi-jocose ground that he shall be
      unable to avoid overhearing the price of her intended gift, and that his modesty could not
      stand the strain of helping her to haggle over it. Perhaps, however, deep in his heart is an
      unconscious feeling that to receive nuptial offerings gives an almost greater body and
      certainty to his on-striding fate than even the buying of dinner-services and saucepans. So
      they go to the Accademia delle Belli Arti instead, it having occurred to Jim that in a
      picture-gallery there will be less opportunity for conversation, less opening for interested
      inquiries on his companion's part as to Amelia and the minutiæ of his future life with her,
      than there would be in the green walks of the Cascine, or on the slopes of Fiesole.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Byng, who is of almost as enjoying a nature as her son, and whose spirits have been
      raised to a pitch even higher than their usual one, by the disproof of her presentiments, it
      is all one where she goes, so that she is taken somewhere, to see something. They stare up at
      the big young David, and stand before Fra Angelico's ineffably happy Paradiso, which yet
      brings the tears to the looker's eyes, perhaps out of sheer envy of the little blissful saints
      dancing and frolicking so gaily, or pacing so softly in the assured joy of the heavenly
      country. They look at Botticelli's "Spring," fantastic wanton, with her wildly-flowered gown,
      and her lapful of roses. The room in which she and her joyous mates stand, with their odd
      smiles, is one of the smaller of the gallery. It is rather a narrow one, and has an open
      window, giving upon a little court, where, in a neglected garden-close, wallflowers are
      growing, and sending in their familiar perfume. The sweet Francia saints in the picture hung
      on the wall directly opposite, and the rapt Madonna, must surely smell them. If they do not,
      it must be because a young couple, he and she, who are leaning out in their eagerness to enjoy
      it, have intercepted all the homely fragrance. Jim's eyes are still on the "Spring," and he is
      thinking half absently how little kinship she has with the goitred green women, whom his
      nineteenth-century disciples present to the confiding British public as representatives of
      Sandro Botticelli's manner, when his attention is diverted by hearing the voice of Mrs. Byng
      at his elbow addressing him in an excited tone:</p>
<p>"Why, there's Willy! Do not you see? There! leaning out of that window, and who—who is the
      lady whom he has with him?"</p>
<p>Jim looks quickly in the direction indicated, and at once recognises a slender gray figure
      which to-day has not assumed its white holiday gown. Elizabeth, whom he had been pitifully
      picturing lying heart-struck on a sofa in the seclusion of her own little <hi>entresol</hi>,
      probably with lowered blinds and tear-smarting eyes, is leaning on the window-ledge with her
      back to the pictures—she whom he had always credited with so delicate a sensibility for Art,
      with her back to the pictures, as if the live picture which Byng's eager face presents to her
      pleases her better. A sense of indignation at having been tricked out of his compassion—who
      had ever seemed to need it less than the suave little figure about whose blonde head a Tuscan
      sunbeam, stolen through the easement, is amorously playing?—makes him forget to answer the
      question addressed to him, until it is repeated in a still more urgent key.</p>
<p>"Who <hi>is</hi> she? Who <hi>can</hi> she be? Have not you an idea? He has not seen us! Had
      not we better creep quietly away? Most likely he would rather not meet me; I could not bear to
      make him look foolish!"</p>
<p>The suggestion that there can be anything calculated to put Willy to the blush in being
      discovered in conversation with Miss Le Marchant has the effect of giving Burgoyne rapidly
      back his power of speech.</p>
<p>"What nonsense!" he cries almost rudely; "I wish you would not let your imagination run away
      with you so, and of course I know who she is; she is an—an acquaintance of mine. I—I presented
      Willy to her; she is Miss Le Marchant."</p>
<p>"Miss Le Who?" repeats the mother eagerly, catching the name imperfectly, as we usually do a
      name that is unfamiliar to us, proving how much of imagination and memory must go to eke out
      all our hearing—"an acquaintance of yours, is she? Oh, then, of course" (drawing a long breath
      of relief), "she is all right."</p>
<p>"All right!" echoes Jim, with an unconscious snappishness of tone, greater than he would
      have employed in defence of the reputation of any other lady of his acquaintance, probably
      because, ever since the day when he stood an unwilling eaves-dropper by that well on
      Bellosguardo, a hideous low voice has been whispering to his own sick heart that perhaps she
      is not "all right!" "All right! of course she is all right."</p>
<p>"But she is lovely!" cries Mrs. Byng, not paying much heed to the testy emphasis of her
      companion's asseveration, and continuing to stare at the unwitting girl; "what a dear little
      face! but," the alarm returning again into her voice, "is it possible that she is here alone
      with him? If so, of course she is American. Oh! do not say that she is American."</p>
<p>"Of course she is not," answers Burgoyne, half laughing at the plaintive intensity of this
      last appeal; "of course she is all that there is of most English, and there is her mother, as
      large as life, within a yard and a half of her; there, do not you see? looking at the
      Ghirlandajo."</p>
<p>Mrs. Byng removes her eyes from the daughter, and fixes them with a scarcely less degree of
      interest upon the then indicated parent.</p>
<p>"So that is the mother, is it? a very nice-looking woman, and what beautiful white hair!
      Mrs. Le——what did you say their name was? Ah! Willy has seen us, poor boy!"—laughing—"how
      guilty he looks! here he comes!"</p>
<p>And in point of fact the young man, having given a very indubitable start and said something
      hurried to his companion, is seen advancing quasi-carelessly to meet the two persons, the
      object of whose observation he has for some minutes so unconsciously been.</p>
<p>"Is not this a coincidence?" cries Mrs. Byng, with a rather nervously-playful accent; "it
       <hi>is</hi> a coincidence, though it may not look like one! But do not be afraid; we know our
      places, we are not going to offer to join you!"</p>
<p>"What should I be afraid of?" replies the young man, the colour—always as ready as a school
      miss's to put him to shame—mantling in his handsome smooth cheeks. "I am like the Spanish
      hidalgo, who never knew what fear was till he snuffed a candle with his fingers. So you and
      Jim are having a happy day among the pictures. Do not you like 'Spring'? I love her, though I
      am sure she was a real baggage!"</p>
<p>But this ingenious attempt to divert the current of his parents' ideas into another channel
      is scarcely so successful as it deserves.</p>
<p>"Will not you introduce me to her?" she asks eagerly, and not heeding, evidently not even
      hearing, the empty question contained in the last half of his speech; "does she know that I am
      your mother? Will not you introduce me to her?"</p>
<p>It seems a simple and natural request enough, and yet the young man perceptibly hesitates.
      He even tries to turn it off by a clumsy and entirely pointless jest.</p>
<p>"Introduce you to her? to whom? to 'Spring'? I am really afraid that my acquaintance with
      her scarcely justifies such a liberty!"</p>
<p>A look of surprise and of natural annoyance clouds the cheerful eagerness of Mrs. Byng's
      face.</p>
<p>"Is that a joke, dear?" she asks, with a rather vexed smile; "it is not a very good one, is
      it? Well, Jim, I must apply to you then; <hi>you</hi> can have no objection to presenting me
      to your friends?"</p>
<p>"Of course not, of course not," replies he, with a stammering unreadiness, which contrasts
      somewhat ludicrously with the acquiescence conveyed by his words, "I shall be delighted,
      only——"</p>
<p>"Only what? Ah, here they come! they save us the trouble of going after them."</p>
<p>As she speaks, indeed, Mrs. Le Marchant and Elizabeth are seen nearing the little group; but
      it is soon apparent that this movement on their part is by no means owing to any wish or even
      willingness to make Mrs. Byng's acquaintance. It is indeed solely due to there being no egress
      from the room at that end of it where they have been standing, so that, if they wish to leave
      it, they must necessarily retrace their steps and pass the three persons who are so busily
      discussing them. They do this so quickly and with so resolute an air of not wishing to be
      delayed in their exit, bestowing a couple of such smileless and formal bows upon the two men,
      that it would have needed a much more determined obstruction than either of those gentlemen is
      prepared to offer to arrest their progress. In a moment they are through the doorway and out
      of sight. Mrs. Byng looks after them, with her mouth open.</p>
<p>"They—they—are obliged to go home, they—they are in a great hurry!" says the younger man,
      observing the displeased astonishment expressed by his mother's countenance, and with a lame
      effort at explanation.</p>
<p>"So they seemed when first we caught sight of them," retorts she dryly.</p>
<p>"They—they are not going out at all at present, they—they do not wish to make any fresh
      acquaintance: oh, by-the-bye, I forgot something I had to say to—I will be back in a
      moment!"</p>
<p>So saying, he shoots off in pursuit of the retreated figures, and Mrs. Byng and her escort
      are again left <hi>tête-à-tête</hi>.</p>
<p>"Are you quite sure that she is all right?" asks the lady, looking at Jim with a penetrating
      glance that he does not enjoy; "because, if so, why was she so determined not to know me?"</p>
<p>"How can I tell?" answers he testily. "Perhaps—who knows?"—laughing unmirthfully—"perhaps
      she was not sure that <hi>you</hi> were all right!"</p>
