<head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
<p>Jim refrains from saying how likely this culmination of his friend's woes has appeared to
      him, since it would have been the height of the illogical for the Le Marchants to have put
      themselves to extreme inconvenience in order to escape from a person to whom they immediately
      afterwards gave the power of following them. He refrains from saying it, because he knows of
      how very little consoling power the "told you so" philosophy is possessed.</p>
<p>"And what will you do now?"</p>
<p>"Do! What is there to do? What does a man do when he is shot through the heart?"</p>
<p>"I believe that in point of fact he jumps his own height in the air. I know that a buffalo
      does," replies Burgoyne with a matter-of-fact dryness, which proceeds less from want of
      sympathy, than from an honest belief that it is the best and kindest method of dealing with
      Byng's heroics.</p>
<p>"<hi>Shot through the heart!</hi>" murmurs the latter, repeating his own phrase as if he
      found a dismal pleasure in it. "I had always been told that it was a painless death; I now
      know to the contrary."</p>
<p>"Shall you stay here? There is no longer any use in your staying here."</p>
<p>"There is no longer any use in my doing anything, or leaving anything undone.</p>

<l>Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,</l>

</quote>
<p>So saying, he replaces his head upon his arms, and his arms upon the chair-rail, with the
      air of one who, upon mature consideration, has decided to maintain that attitude for the
      remainder of his life.</p>
<p>A week has passed; a week upon which Burgoyne looks back as upon a blur of wretchedness,
      with distinct points of pain sticking up here and there out of it. It is a blur; for it is a
      time-space, without the usual limitations and divisions of time; a week not cut up into
      orderly lengths of day and night, but in which each has puzzlingly run into and overlapped
      each. There have been nights when he has not been in bed at all, and there have been days when
      he has slept heavily at unaccustomed hours. He has not dined at any particular time; he has
      shared forlorn breakfast, dotted about the morning as the less or more anxiety about Amelia
      dictated, with the Wilsons. He has drunk more tea than he ever did in his life before, and the
      result of this whole condition of things is, that he cannot for the life of him tell whether
      the day of the week is Wednesday, or Thursday, or Friday, and that he has lost all sense of
      proportion. He has not the least idea whether the dreadful moments when he stood on the
      landing outside Amelia's door, and heard her heartrendingly beg him not to go away from her
      for <hi>quite</hi> so long, to be a little gladder to see her when he came back; or again
      affectingly assure him that she can do quite well, be quite cheerful without him—whether, I
      say, those dreadful moments were really only moments, or stretched into hours.</p>
<p>Besides the agony of remorse that the impotent listening to those pathetic prayers and
      unselfish assurances causes him, he suffers too from another agony of shame, that the father
      and sister, standing like himself with ears stretched at that shut door, should be let into
      the long secret of his cruelty and coldness, that secret which for eight years she has so
      gallantly been hiding. It is an inexpressible relief to him that at least the old man's
      thickened hearing admits but very imperfectly his daughter's rapid utterances.</p>
<p>"Poor soul! I cannot quite make out what it is all about," he says, with his hand to his
      ear; "but I catch your name over and over again, Jim; I suppose it is all about you."</p>
<p>Cecilia, however, naturally hears as well as he himself does, and apparently pitying the
      drawn misery of his face, whispers to him comfortingly—</p>
<p>"You must not mind, you know it is all nonsense. She talks very differently when she is
      well."</p>
<p>The Wilson family have never hitherto shown any very marked affection for Burgoyne, but now
      it seems as if they could hardly bear him out of their sight. They cling to him, not because
      he is <hi>he</hi>—Jim makes himself no illusion on that head—but because they have got into
      such a habit of leaning, that it is no longer possible to them to stand upright. He had never
      realized till now how helpless they are. He had known that Amelia was the pivot upon which the
      whole family turned; but he had not brought home to himself how utterly the machine fell to
      pieces when that pivot was withdrawn.</p>
<p>In the course of the past week each member of the family has confided to him separately how
      far more she or he misses Amelia, than can be possible to either of the others. Upon this head
      Sybilla's lamentations are the loudest and most frequent. She had at first refused to admit
      that there was anything at all the matter with her sister, but has now fallen into the no less
      trying opposite extreme of refusing to allow that there is any possibility of her recovery,
      talking of her as if she were almost beyond the reach of human aid. Sybilla's grief for her
      sister is perfectly genuine; none the less so that it is complicated by irritation at her own
      deposition from her post of first invalid, at having been compelled to confess the existence
      in the bosom of her own family of a traitor, with an indisputably higher temperature and more
      wavering pulse than she.</p>
<p>"It is ridiculous to suppose that a person in such rude health as Cecilia <hi>can</hi> miss
      her as I do," she says querulously; "I was always her first object, she always knew by
      instinct when I was more suffering than usual; who cares now"—breaking into a deluge of
      self-compassionating tears—"whether I am suffering or not?"</p>
<p>Then, when next he happens to be alone with Cecilia, it is her turn to assert a superiority
      of woe; a superiority claimed with still more emphasis the next half hour by the father. With
      a patience which would have surprised those persons who had seen him only in his former
      relations with the family of his betrothed he tries to soothe the sorrow of each—even that of
      Sybilla—in turn; but to his own heart he says that not one of their griefs is worthy to be
      weighed in the balance with his. In the case of none of theirs is the woof crossed by the
      hideous warp of self-reproach that is woven inextricably into his. They have worked her to
      death, they have torn her to pieces by their conflicting claims; their love has been exacting,
      selfish, inconsiderate; but at least it has been love; they have prized her at almost her full
      worth while they had her. For him it has been reserved as for the base Indian, to</p>

<l>Richer than all his tribe."</l>
</quote>
<p>In the intervals—neither long nor many—between his ministrations at the Anglo-Américain,
      Burgoyne hurries back to the Minerva to see that Byng has not blown his brains out. In the
      present state of mind of that young gentleman this catastrophe does not appear to be among the
      least likely ones. He has refused to leave Florence, always answering the suggestion with the
      same question, "Where else should I go?" and if pressed, adding invariably in the same words
      as those employed by him on the first day of his loss, when his friend had urged the
      advisability of his removing his countenance from the beaded stool—"Where shall I find such
      recent and authentic traces of her as here?"</p>
<p>He passes his time either on the Lung' Arno, staring at the water, or stretched face
      downwards upon his bed. He walks about the town most of the night, and Jim suspects him of
      beginning to take chloral. Occasionally he rouses up into a quick and almost passionate
      sympathy with his friend's trouble, asking for nothing better than to be sent on any errand,
      however trivial, or however tiresome, in Amelia's behalf. But no sooner have the immediate
      effects of the appeal to his kind-heartedness died away, than he sinks back into his lethargy,
      and Jim is at once too much occupied and too miserable to use any very strenuous endeavours to
      shake him out of it. But yet the consciousness of the tacit engagement, under which he lies to
      the young man's mother, to look after him, coupled with the absolute impossibility, under his
      present circumstances, of fulfilling that engagement, and his uneasiness as to what new form
      the insanity of Byng's grief may take on, from day to day, add very perceptibly to the weight
      of his own already sufficiently ponderous burden.</p>
<p>It is the ninth day since Amelia fell sick, that ninth day which, in maladies such as hers,
      is, or is at least reckoned to be, the crisis and turning-point of the disease. Jim has been
      up all night, and has just rushed back to the Minerva, for the double purpose of taking a
      bath, and of casting an uneasy eye upon his charge. He finds the latter not in his room, but
      leaning over the little spiky balcony, out of his window, hanging over it so far, and so
      absorbedly, that he does not hear his friend's approach, and starts violently when Jim lays a
      hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"What are you looking at?"</p>
<p>"I; oh—nothing particular! What should I be looking at? What is there to look to? I was
      only—only—wondering as a mere matter of curiosity, how many feet it is from here to the
      pavement? Sixteen? eighteen? twenty?"</p>
<p>Jim's only answer is to look at him sadly and sternly; then he says coldly:</p>
<p>"I do not recommend it; it would be a clumsy way of doing it."</p>
<p>"What matter how clumsy the way, so that one attains the end?" asks Byng extravagantly,
      throwing off even the thin pretence he had at first assumed; "who cares how bad the road is so
      that it leads him to the goal?</p>
<quote>
<l>"'Oh, amiable lovely death!</l>
<l>Thou odoriferous stench, sound rottenness!'"</l>
</quote>
<p>Jim shudders. Death has been so near to him for the last nine days, that the terrific
      realism of Constance's apostrophe seems to be almost more than he can bear.</p>
<p>"It is silliness to live when to live is a torment, and then, have we a prescription to die,
      when death is our physician?" continues Byng loudly and wildly, clasping his hands above his
      head, and apparently perfectly indifferent as to whether the other inmates of the hotel, or
      passers-by on the piazza, overhear him.</p>
<p>"If you stay here much longer you will spare yourself the trouble of putting an end to your
      existence," replies Jim, glancing at the other's head, exposed hatless to the scorch of the
      Tuscan sun, "for you will certainly get a sunstroke."</p>
<p>So saying, he takes him quietly, yet decidedly, by the arm, and leads him within the room.
      Either his matter-of-fact manner, or the sight of his face, upon which, well-seasoned as it
      is, vigil and sorrow have begun to write their unavoidable marks, brings the young madman back
      to some measure of sense and self-control.</p>
<p>"I had no fixed intention," he says apologetically, still looking white and wild; "you must
      not think I meant anything; but, even if I had—do you know—have you ever happened to read
      anything about the statistics of suicide? Do you know what an increasing number of people
      every year find life intolerable?"</p>
<p>"I know that you are fast making <hi>my</hi> life intolerable," answers Jim, fixing his
      tired, sleepless eyes with melancholy severity upon his companion. "Amelia is—you are as well
      aware of it as I am—probably dying, and yet even now, thanks to you, into my thoughts of her
      is continually pushing the fear that I may have to tell your mother that you have had the
      colossal selfishness to rush out of the world, because, for the first time in your pampered
      life, the toy you cried for has not been put into your hand."</p>
<p>Burgoyne's hopes have not been high, as to any salutary result of his own philippic while
      uttering it. But our words, sometimes, to our surprise, turn from wooden swords to steel
      daggers in our hands. For a moment Byng stands as if stunned; then he breaks into a tornado of
      sobs and tears, such tears as have often before angered his friend, but which now he welcomes
      the sight of, as perhaps precursors of a saner mood.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear old chap!" he cries, catching at Jim's unresponsive hand, and wringing it hard,
      "she is not dying <hi>really</hi>? You do not mean it? You are only saying it to frighten me?
      Oh! dear, kind Amelia. Not dying! not dying?"</p>
<p>"I do not know: to-day is the turning-point, they say; even now it may have come."</p>
<p>"And why are not you with her? Why do not you go back to her?" cries Byng, in a broken voice
      of passionate excitement, the tears still racing down his face.</p>
<p>"And leave you to go tomfooling out there again?" asks Jim, with a nod of his head towards
      the balcony, seen from where they stand, grilling in the midday blaze.</p>
<p>The verb employed, if closely looked into, bears a ludicrous disproportion to the intended
      action indicated, but neither of the men sees anything ridiculous in it.</p>
<p>"I will not!" cries Byng, in eager asseveration; "I give you my word of honour I will not;
      if you do not believe me, take me with you! Keep me with you all day! Do you think that I,
      too, do not want to know how Amelia is? Do you think that I am indifferent as to whether she
      lives or dies? Poor, good Amelia! When I think of that drive to Vallombrosa, only ten days
      ago! They two sitting side by side, so happy, laughing and making friends with each
      other!"</p>
<p>He covers his face with his hands, and through them the scalding drops trickle; but only for
      a moment. In the next, he has dashed them away, and is moving restlessly about the room,
      looking for his hat.</p>
<p>"Let us go this instant," he says urgently; "my poor old man, do you think I would willingly
      add a feather weight to your burden? I should never forgive myself if I kept you a second
      longer from her at such a time; let us go at once."</p>
<p>Burgoyne complies; but under pretext of making some change in his dress, escapes from his
      friend, for just the few minutes necessary to write and despatch a telegram to the young man's
      mother. It runs thus:</p>
<p>"<hi>No cause for alarm, but come at once. He is perfectly well, but needs you.</hi>"</p>
<p>If, as is to be hoped, Mrs. Byng is still in London, reaping the succession of the old
      relative whose death-bed she had quitted Florence to attend, his message will bring her hither
      within forty-eight hours, and the burden of responsibility, now grown so insupportable, will
      be shifted from his shoulders. Until those forty-eight hours have elapsed, he must not again
      let Byng out of his sight.</p>
<p>The day rolls by, the critical ninth day rolls by on its torrid wheels to eventide, and when
      that eventide comes, it finds Cecilia Wilson running down from Amelia's room, to give the last
      news of her to the three men and one woman waiting below.</p>
<p>"I think he seems quite satisfied," she says, in answer to the silent hungry looks of
      question addressed to her, and alluding to the doctor, who is still with the patient; "the
      strength is maintained; the temperature lower." What a dreadful parrot-sound the two phrases,
      so familiar to us all in the newspaper bulletins of distinguished men on their death-beds,
      have during the last week assumed in Burgoyne's ears; "you can speak to him yourself when he
      comes down, of course, Jim; but I am sure he is satisfied."</p>
<p>"She is better!—she is saved!" cries Byng, rushing forward and snatching both Cecilia's
      hands—"do you say that she is really saved?"</p>
<p>"Oh, are you here still, Mr. Byng? how very kind of you!" replies Cecilia, a tinge of colour
      rushing over her mealy face—that face, ten days ago, clothed in so many roses—"well, I am
      afraid he does not go quite so far as that, but he says it is as much as we can expect, and
      even I can see that she is not nearly so restless."</p>
<p>"Thank God!—thank God!"</p>
<p>In the ardour of his thanksgiving he presses her hands closer, instead of dropping them, a
      fact of which he is entirely unaware, but so is not she; and who knows, even at that serious
      moment, what tiny genial hope may slide into her plump heart!</p>
<p>Again this night Burgoyne does not go to bed, from a superstitious fear that if he does, if
      he seems to take for granted an improvement, that very taking for granted may annul it—may
      bring on a relapse. But when the next morning finds no such backsliding to have taken place,
      when each hour through the cheerfully broadening day brings falling fever and steadying pulse,
      then indeed he cautiously opens the door of his heart to let a tiny rose-pinioned hope creep
      in—then at last, on the third night, he stretches his tired limbs in deep slumber upon his
      bed.</p>
<p>He has received a brief telegram from Mrs. Byng to announce her arrival as fast as boat and
      train can bring her; and seven o'clock on Saturday morning—he having sent his despatch to her
      on the previous Wednesday—finds him pacing the platform of the railway-station, awaiting the
      incoming of the morning express from Turin. He is pacing it alone, for he has thought it best
      not to reveal to her son the fact of her expected return, not being at all sure in what spirit
      he will receive it, nor whether indeed the news of it might not even drive him, in his present
      unsound state of mind, to fly from the place at her approach.</p>
<p>The morning air, in its early clear coolness, blows sweet here, under the station-roof,
      unconquered even by engine smoke, and on Jim's face as he walks up and down—careworn as it
      still is—there comes, now and again, a half-born smile. He is never one to hope very easily,
      but surely now—now that yet another night has been prosperously tided over, there can, even to
      him, seem no reasonable ground for doubt that Amelia has turned the corner. Amelia, with the
      corner turned—Byng, in five minutes wholly off his hands! The only wonder is, that the small
      smile never comes quite to the birth.</p>
<p>The train is punctual, and almost at its due moment draws up in dusty length at the
      platform. Its passengers are comparatively few; for at this latening season most of the
      English are winging home to their rooky woods; and he has no difficulty in at once discovering
      among them the tall smart figure—smart even after forty-eight hours of the unluxurious luxury
      of a <hi>wagon-lit</hi>—of the lady he is awaiting. As he gives her his hand to help her down
      the high step, the admiring thought crosses his mind of what a large quantity of fatigue,
      dust, and uneasiness of mind a radically good-looking Englishwoman, in radically good clothes,
      can undergo without seeming much the worse for them. Before her neat narrow foot has touched
      the pavement, a brace of eager questions shoots out of her mouth.</p>
<p>"Am I in time? Am I too late?"</p>
<p>"In time for <hi>what</hi>? Too late for <hi>what</hi>?"</p>
<p>"Has he—has he done anything—anything irrevocable? Is he—is he? I suppose that horrid woman
      has got hold of him? I suppose that is why you sent for me!"</p>
<p>By this time she is safely landed at his side, which is possibly the reason why he at once
      lets fall her hand.</p>
<p>"I am not aware that there is any 'horrid woman' in the case."</p>
<p>"Oh, what does it matter what I call her?" cries the mother, fast becoming frantic at the
      delay in answering her passionate questions. "I will call her what you please; you know
      perfectly whom I mean; she <hi>has</hi> got hold of him, I suppose. I always knew she would!
      Did not I tell you so? but is it too late? is there no way of getting him off?"</p>
<p>Now that Burgoyne has a nearer view of Mrs. Byng, he sees that she has a more fagged and
      travel-worn air than he had at first supposed, and her dusty eyes are fastened upon him with
      such a hunger of interrogation, that, angered and jarred as he is by her tone, he has not the
      heart any longer to keep her in suspense.</p>
<p>"If you are alluding to Miss Le Marchant, I may as well tell you at once that she has left
      Florence."</p>
<p>"Left Florence! Do you mean to say that she has run away with someone else?"</p>
<p>She puts the question in all good faith, her lively imagination having easily made the not
      very wide jump from the fact already established in her own mind of Elizabeth being an
      adventuress, to the not much more difficult one to swallow, of her having devoured another
       <hi>fils de famille</hi>, as well as Mrs. Byng's own.</p>
<p>For a moment, Burgoyne turns away, voice and countenance alike beyond his control. He has by
      no means perfectly recovered either, when he answers—</p>
<p>"Yes, with someone else—she has reached the pitch of turpitude of leaving Florence with her
      mother."</p>
<p>"She is gone?" cries Mrs. Byng, with an accent of the highest relief and joy; "gone away
      altogether, do you mean?—oh, thank God!"—then, with a sudden lapse into affright, she adds
      rapidly—"and he is gone after her?—he is not here?"</p>
<p>"No, he is here."</p>
<p>"Then why has not he come to meet me?"—suspiciously.</p>
<p>"He did not know you were expected."</p>
<p>"You did not tell him?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Why did not you tell him?"</p>
<p>"I did not know how he would take it."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say"—falling from her former rapidity of utterance to a dismayed incredulous
      slowness—"that he will not be glad to see me?—that <hi>Willy</hi> will not be glad to see
       <hi>me</hi>?"</p>
<p>"I mean to say that I am afraid you will not find him very much in sympathy with you; I do
      not think he will find it easy to hear you speak of Miss Le Marchant in the terms, and make
      the implication about her that you did just now," replies Jim, avenging by this sentence the
      wrongs done to Elizabeth, and doing it so well, that a moment later a feeling of compunction
      comes over him at the success of his own attempt at retributive justice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Byng turns pale.</p>
<p>"Then she has got hold of him?" she says under her breath.</p>
<p>"Got hold of him?" repeats Jim, his ire aroused again, no sooner than allayed, by this mode
      of expression; "you certainly have the most extraordinary way of misconceiving the situation!
       <hi>Got hold of him?</hi> when she had to leave Florence at a moment's notice to escape his
      importunities!"</p>
<p>But at this, Mr. Burgoyne's auditor looks so hopelessly bewildered that he thinks it the
      simplest plan at once, in the fewest possible words, to put her in possession of the tale of
      her son's achievements and disasters. He does this, partly to stem the torrent of her
      questions, the form that they have hitherto taken producing in him a feeling of frenzied
      indignation, which he doubts his own power much longer to conceal—partly in order to set
      Elizabeth's conduct with the least possible delay in its true light before her. Surely, when
      she has been told of her magnanimous renunciation, she will do her justice, will cease to load
      her with those hard names and insulting assertions that have made him grind his own teeth to
      listen to. But in this expectation he soon finds that he is mistaken. The wrath of Mrs. Byng
      against Elizabeth for having "drawn in" her son, as she persists in stating the case, is
      surpassed only by indignation at her insolence in having "thrown him over." As to the
      genuineness of this last action she expresses, it is true, the most complete incredulity.</p>
<p>"It was only to enhance her own value. Do you suppose that she expected him to take her at
      her word? She thought, of course, that he would follow her—that he would employ detectives—it
      is a proof"—with an angry laugh—"that he cannot be quite so bad as you make him out, that he
      has not done so."</p>
<p>"I would not put it into his head, if I were you," replies Jim, with an anger no less real,
      and a merriment no less spurious than her own.</p>
<p>By this time they have reached the hotel; and Jim, having helped his companion out of the
      fiacre, shows symptoms of leaving her.</p>
<p>"Will not you stay to breakfast with me?" she asks, a little aghast at this unexpected
      manœuvre; "I cannot make my toilette till the luggage arrives: and I suppose that he"—her eyes
      wandering wistfully over the hotel front till they rest on her son's closed persiennes—"that
      he is not up yet; it would be a sin to wake him; do stay with me."</p>
<p>"I am afraid I cannot."</p>
<p>"Why cannot you?"—with an impatient but friendly little mocking imitation of his tone. "You
      are not"—with a conciliatory smile—"angry with an old hen for standing up for her own
      chick?"</p>
<p>Jim smiles too.</p>
<p>"I do not think that the old hen need have clucked quite so loudly; but that is not why I am
      leaving her; I <hi>must</hi> go."</p>
<p>"Where <hi>must</hi> you go?"</p>
<p>"To the Anglo-Américain."</p>
<p>She lifts her eyebrows.</p>
<p>"At this hour—you forget how early it is. Well, Amelia <hi>has</hi> got you into good
      training; but I can assure you that you will still find her in bed."</p>
<p>He sighs.</p>
<p>"I am afraid that there is not much doubt of that."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?—she is not ill, surely?"—in a tone of lively surprise—"Amelia
      ill?—impossible!"</p>
<p>He looks at her with an irrational stupefaction. It appears to him now, in the distortion of
      all objects that the last fortnight has brought, as if Amelia's illness had spread over the
      whole of his life, as if there had never been a time when she had not been ill, and yet of
      this event, immense as it seems to him in its duration, the woman before him obviously has
      never heard. When he comes to think of it, how should she? In point of fact it is not a
      fortnight since Miss Wilson fell sick, and during that fortnight he himself has not written
      her a line; neither, he is equally sure, has her son.</p>
<p>"I am evidently very much behind the time," she says, noting the, to her, unintelligible
      astonishment in his face; "but you must remember that I have been kept completely in the
      dark—has she been ill?"</p>
<p>In answer he tells her, with as much brevity and compression as he had employed in the tale
      of Elizabeth's disappearance, that of Amelia's illness, often interrupted by her expressions
      of sympathy. At the end she says:</p>
<p>"I am so thankful I did not hear till she was getting better! It would have made me so
      wretched to be such a long way off!"</p>
<p>Her adoption of his trouble as her own, an adoption whose sincerity is confirmed by her
      impulsive seizure of his hand, and the feeling look in her handsome eyes make him forgive the
      exaggeration of her statement, and go some way towards replacing her in that position in his
      esteem which her diatribes against Elizabeth had gone near to making her forfeit.</p>
<p>"But it will be all right now," continues she sanguinely; "there will be nothing to do but
      to build up her strength again, and she is young—at least"—as the reminiscence of Amelia's
      unyouthful appearance evidently flashes across her mind, of that prematurely middle-aged look
      which an unequal fortune gives to some plain women—"at least, young enough for all practical
      purposes."</p>
<p>Whether it be due to the possession of this modified form of juvenility, to an excellent
      constitution, or to what other reason, certain it is that the next two days go by without any
      diminution, rather with a sensible and steady increase, in Miss Wilson's favourable symptoms,
      and, on the afternoon of the latter of these days, Cecilia, in rather impatient answer to
      Jim's long daily string of questions about her, says:</p>
<p>"You could judge much better if you saw her yourself. I do not see why you should not see
      her to-morrow for a minute, that is to say, if you would promise not to talk or ask her any
      questions."</p>
<p>"But would it be safe?" inquires he, with a tremble in his voice. He desires passionately to
      see her; until he does he will never believe that she is really going to live; he has a hunger
      to assure himself that no terrible metamorphosis has passed over her in these nightmare days;
      and yet, coupled with that hunger, is a deep dread, which translates itself into his next
      halting words.</p>
<p>"Shall I be—shall I be very much shocked? is she—is she very much changed?"</p>
<p>"She does look pretty bad," replies Cecilia half sadly, yet with the sub-lying cheerfulness
      of assured hope; "for one thing she is so wasted. I suppose that that is what makes her look
      so much older; but then you know Amelia never did look young."</p>
<p>It is the second time within two days that the fact of his betrothed's maturity has been
      impressed upon him, and formerly it would have caused him a pang; but now, of what moment is
      it to him that she looks a hundred, if only she is living, and going to live?</p>
<p>"Has she—has she asked after me?"</p>
<p>"We do not allow her to speak, but if anyone mentions your name there comes a sort of smile
      over her face; such a ridiculous-sized face as it is now!"</p>
<p>The tears have come into Cecilia's large stupid eyes, and Jim himself is, with regard to
      her, in the position of the great Plantagenet, when he heard the lovely tale of York and
      Suffolk's high death.</p>

<l>"I blame you not</l>
<l>For hearing this; I must perforce compound</l>
<l>With mistful eyes; or they will issue too!"</l>
</quote>
<p>As he walks away he is filled with a solemn joy, one of those deep serious gladnesses with
      which not the stranger, no, nor even the close friend or loving kinsman intermeddleth. He is
      under an engagement to meet Mrs. Byng at a certain hour, but although that hour has already
      come and passed, he feels that he cannot face all her sincere congratulations without some
      preparatory toning down of his mood.</p>
<p>The streets, with their gay <hi>va-et-vient</hi>, their cracking whips and shouting drivers,
      seem all too secular and every-day to match the profundity of his reverent thankfulness. He
      takes it with him into the great cool church that stands so nigh at hand to his hotel, Santa
      Maria Novella. The doors fall behind him noiselessly as he enters, shutting out the fiery hot
      piazza, and the garish noises of the world. In the great dim interior, cold and tranquil,
      there is the usual sprinkling of tourists peering up at its soaring columns, trying to read
      themselves, out of their guide-books, into a proper admiration for Cimabue's large-faced
      Virgin and ugly Bambino, folded, with all its gold and sombre colours, in the dignity of its
      twice two centuries of gloom. There are the usual three or four blue-trousered soldiers
      strolling leisurely about, there is a curly-tailed little dog trotting hither and thither
      unforbidden, ringing his bell, and there are the invariable tanned peasant-women kneeling at
      the side-altars. He does not belong to the ancient Church, but to-day he kneels beside them,
      and the tears he had hastened away to hide from Cecilia come back to make yet dimmer to his
      view the details of the dim altar-pieces behind the tall candles. His eye, as he rises to his
      feet again, falls on the contadina nearest him. What is she praying for? In the expansion of
      his own deep joy he longs to tell her how much he hopes that, whatever it is, she will obtain
      it. It is not the contadina who, standing a little behind, joins him as he turns away from the
      altar.</p>
<p>"I saw you go into the church," says Mrs. Byng, her smile growing somewhat diffident as she
      sees the solemnity of his face, "so I thought I would follow you; do you mind? shall I go
      away?"</p>
<p>He would, of the two, have preferred that she had not followed him, that he had been given
      five more minutes to himself; but he naturally does not say so.</p>
<p>"Since we are here, shall we go into the cloisters?" and he assents.</p>
<p>A small Dominican monk, with a smile and a bunch of keys, is opening a door to some
      strangers, prowling like our friends about the church. The latter follow, the little monk
      enveloping them too in his civil smile. Down some steps into the great cloister, under whose
      arches pale frescoes cover the ancient walls—where in Florence are there not frescoes?—and the
      hands that painted them seem all to have wielded their brushes in that astounding fifteenth
      century, which was to Florence's life what May is to Italy's year. For some moments they stand
      silent, side by side, perhaps picking out familiar scenes from among the sweet faded groups—a
      slim Rebecca listening to Eliezar's tale, and looking maiden pleasure at his gifts; a
      shivering Adam and Eve chased out of Paradise; an Adam and Eve dismally digging and stitching
      respectively; Old Testament stories that time has blurred, that weather—even in this dry
      air—has rubbed out and bedimmed, and that yet, in many cases, still tell their curious faint
      tale decipherably.</p>
<p>"Good news this evening, I hope?" says Mrs. Byng presently, growing a little tired of her
      companion's taciturnity, being indeed always one of those persons who are of opinion that the
      gold of which silence is said to be made has a good deal of alloy in it.</p>
<p>"I am to see her to-morrow."</p>
<p>He speaks almost under his breath, either because he has no great confidence in his voice,
      if he employ a higher key, or because there seems to him a certain sanctity in this promised
      meeting on the kindly hither side of the grave which has so lately yawned.</p>
<p>Mrs. Byng is much too old and intimate a friend of Jim's not to have been pretty well aware
      of the state of his feelings during the past eight years, though certainly not through any
      communication from him. So it is, perhaps, scarcely to be wondered at that she presently says,
      in a tone tinged with admiring surprise:</p>
<p>"How fond you are of her!"</p>
<p>He receives the remark in a jarred silence, his eye resting on the square of neglected
      graves in the middle of the cloister, how unlike our turfy quads and lawns. A commonplace
      nineteenth century photographer, with his vulgar camera planted on the time-worn stones, is
      evidently trying to persuade the little monk to pose for his picture. The gentle-looking Fra
      laughs, and draws up his cowl, then lowers it again, folding his arms, and trying various
      postures.</p>
<p>"You are so much fonder of her than you were!"</p>
<p>This speech—though such is certainly far from the good-natured speaker's intention—stings
      Burgoyne like a whip-lash.</p>
<p>"I was always fond of her—I always thought her the very best woman in the world; you
      know!"—with an accent of almost anguished appeal—"that I always thought her the very best
      woman in the world."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; of course, I know you did," replies she, astonished and concerned at the evident
      and extreme distress of his tone. "That is not quite the same thing as being <hi>fond</hi> of
      her, is it? But"—with a laugh that is at once uneasy and reassuring—"what does that matter
       <hi>now</hi>? <hi>Now</hi> your fondness for her is as indisputable as Tilburina's madness;
      and, for my part, I always think people get on quite as well, if not better, afterwards, if
      they do not begin quite so volcanically."</p>
<p>But her light and well-meant words fail to remove the painful impression from her hearer's
      mind. Has she, during all these years, been crediting him with a wish for Amelia's death, that
      she should be so much astonished at his thankfulness for her being given back to him?</p>
<p>"I believe that this illness is the best thing that could have happened to you both,"
      continues Mrs. Byng, feeling uncomfortably that she has not been happy in her choice of a
      topic, and yet unable to leave it alone. "It will have drawn you so much together: in
      fact"—again laughing nervously—"I think we are all looking up. As I told you, after the first
      shock, Willy really was rather glad to see me; and you would not believe how discreetly I
      handle the burning subject—yes, everything is on the mend, and we are all going to have a
      lovely time, as the Yankees say!"</p>
