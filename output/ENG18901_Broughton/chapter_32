<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>One of the reasons, though not the sole or even the main one, of Burgoyne's visit to Algiers
      is that the Wilson family are wintering there. And yet he dreads the meeting with them
      inexpressibly. When they last parted, immediately after having stood together round Amelia's
      open grave, they had all been at a high pressure of emotion, and of demonstrative
      affectionateness, which nothing in their tastes, habits, or natures could possibly make
      continuous. He has a horrible fear that they will expect to take up their relations at the
      same point at which he had left them. He would do it if he could, but he feels that it is
      absolutely impossible to him. The door of that room in his memory which is labelled "Amelia"
      is for ever locked. It is only in deepest silence and solitude that he permits himself now and
      again to turn the key and sparely and painfully look in. How will he bear it if they insist on
      throwing the portals wide, dragging its disused furniture to the light, rummaging in its
      corners?</p>
<p>He sleeps ill on this, his first night of Africa; and even when at length he succeeds in
      losing importunate consciousness, he is teased by absurd yet painful dreams, in which Amelia
      and Elizabeth jostle each other impossibly with jumbled personalities and changed attributes.
      Extravagant as his visions are, they have yet such a solid vividness that, at his first
      waking, he feels a strange sense of unsureness as to which of the two women that have beset
      his pillow is the dead, and which the living one. In dreams, how often our lost ones, and
      those whom we still possess, take hands together on equal terms! Even when he is wide awake,
      nay more, dressed and breakfasted, that feeling of uncertainty, that something akin to the <quote>
<l>"Blank misgivings of a creature,</l>
<l>Moving about in worlds not realized,"</l>
</quote> remains strong enough to drive him once again to the list of visitors in the
      entrance-hall, in order to assure himself that his brain has not been the dupe of his eye.</p>
<p>M. Cipriani has been as good as his word. The corrected list, promised overnight, has
      replaced the incomplete one, and almost the first names that Jim's eye alights upon are those
      of "Mr., Mrs., and Miss Le Marchant, England." His own name immediately follows, and he takes
      as a good augury what is merely an accident due to the fact of his room and theirs being on
      one floor. Elizabeth is, beyond question, beneath the same roof as himself; nay, even now she
      may probably be sunning herself like a white pigeon on that terrace, whose red tiles he sees
      shining in the morning sun through an open side-door.</p>
<p>The thought is no sooner formed than he follows whither it leads him; but she is not on the
      terrace; and though a moment ago his nerves were tingling at the thought of speech with her,
      yet he is conscious of a feeling of relief that their meeting is, for the moment, deferred.
      What can he say to her? What can she say to him?</p>
<p>He stands looking down on the green sea of richly-clothed dark trees beneath him—ilex and
      eucalyptus, and all the unfamiliar verdure of the soft South. From the fiercely-blazing red
      purple of a Bougainvillia, so unlike the pale, cold lilac blossom, to which in our
      conservatories we give that name, his eye travels over tree-tops and snowy villas, cool summer
      palace and domy mosque, to the curving bay, round which the Atlas Mountains are gently laying
      their arms; and Cape Matifou, with the haze of day's young prime about it, is running out into
      the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>He is alone at first, but presently other people come forth; the old valetudinarian, for
      once delivered from his fostering widow, sits down with a pile of English newspapers to enjoy
      himself in the sun, which does not yet ride so high as to be sun-strokey. Jim's last night's
      neighbour in the red shirt comes out too, bonneted and prayer-booked. She is going to church;
      so is he: but he does not tell her so, for fear she should offer to accompany him. She
      observes to him that the climate is a fraud; that this is the first day for three weeks in
      which she is able to go out without a mackintosh and umbrella.</p>
<p>"We are not so green for nothing, I can tell you," says she, with a laugh, and a rather
      resentful glance at the splendid verdure around her, and so leaves him.</p>
<p>He, too, as I have said, is going to church, and is presently asking his way to the English
      chapel. The Wilson family will certainly be there, and it has struck him that the dreaded
      meeting will be robbed of half its painful awkwardness if it takes place in public. At a
      church-porch, crowded with issuing congregation, Sybilla cannot fall into hysterics—it is true
      that Sybilla never attends divine service—nor can Cecilia weepingly throw her arms about his
      neck. But whatever means he may take to lessen the discomfort and smart of that expected
      encounter, the thought of it sits like lead upon his spirits, as he walks quickly—it is
      difficult to descend slowly so steep a hill—down the precipitous lane, which is the only mode
      of approach for man or labouring beast to the high-perched hotel he has chosen. But he is
      young, and presently the cheerful, clean loveliness of the day and the sight of Nature's
      superb vigour work their natural effect upon him. It must, indeed, be an inveterate grief that
      refuses to be soothed by the influences of this green Eden.</p>
<p>What a generosity of vegetation, as evidenced by the enormous garlands of great-leaved ivy,
      waving from tree to tree as for some perpetual fête! Along the high hill bank that skirts this
      steep by-road, eucalyptus rear their lofty heads and their faintly-scented blossoms, aloe
      draws her potent sword, and thick-fleshed prickly pear displays her uncouth malignity.
      Beneath, what a lush undergrowth of riotous great-foliaged plants—acanthus, and a hundred
      other green sisters, all flourishing and waxing, so unstinted, so at large! He has reached the
      main road—the shady road that leads by a three-mile descent from Mustapha Supérieur to the
      town.</p>
<p>How shady it is! Pepper-trees hang their green hair, so thick and fine, over it; and ilexes
      hold the thatch of their little dark leaves. Past the Governor's summer palace, with its snowy
      dome and Moorish arcades gleaming through its iron gates. From a villa garden a flowering
      shrub sends a mixed perfume of sweet and bitter, as of honey and hops, from its long yellow
      flower-tassels to his pleased nostrils.</p>
<p>At a sharp turn, where the hill falls away more precipitously than before, the bay, the
      mole, the shipping, the dazzling little city, burst upon him—the little city swarming up her
      hill, from where the French town bathes its feet in the azure ripples, to where the Arab town
      loses the peak of its triangle, in the Casbah and the fort of the now execrated Emperor.
      Blinding white, ardent blue, profound green—what a pleasant picture for a summer Sunday
      morning! And how gay the road is too, as the East and the West step along it together!</p>
<p>Here is a tram tearing down the steep incline with five poor little thin horses abreast. It
      is full of English church-goers, and yet, oh anomaly! standing up in the vulgarest of modern
      vehicles, with his slight dark hands grasping the tramrail, is a tall Arab, draped with the
      grave grace of the Vatican Demosthenes. But alas! alas! even upon him the West has laid its
      claw, for, as the tram rushes past, Jim's shocked eyes realize that he, who in other respects
      might have fed the flocks of Laban in Padan-aram, wears on his feet a pair of old
      elastic-sided boots.</p>
<p>Here come clattering a couple of smart Chasseurs d'Afrique, in blue and red, followed by a
      woman dressed as Rachel was at the palmy well—so dressed, that is to say, as to her
      white-shrouded upper woman, for, indeed, there is no reason for supposing that Rachel wore a
      pair of Rob Roy Tartan trousers! Past the Plateau Saulière, where, in the lichen-roofed lavoir
      Frenchwomen are sousing their linen in water that—oh, hideous thought!—is changed but once a
      week; along an ugly suburb, and past a little wood; through the arch in the fortifications,
      the Porte d'Isly, till at length the Episcopal chapel—why are the Protestant places of worship
      scattered over the habitable globe everywhere so frightful?—stands before him.</p>
<p>He had thought himself in good time, but he must have loitered more than he had been aware
      of, as the bell is silent and the porch closed. He enters as quietly as may be, and takes his
      place near the door. The building strikes damp and chilly, despite the warming presence of the
      whole English colony, emptied out of the four hotels sacred to Anglo-Saxons, and out of many
      an ilex-shaded orange-groved campagne besides. The building is quite full, which is, no doubt,
      the reason why Jim fails to catch any glimpse of the Wilson family throughout the service. He
      has plenty of time to interrogate with his eye the numerous rows of backs before him, as the
      sermon is long. Jim had known that it would be so from the moment when the clergyman entered
      the pulpit with an open Bible—no written sermon—in his hand. The sound of a brogue, piercing,
      even through the giving out of the text, soon puts him in possession of the further fact that
      he is in the clutches, and at the mercy, of an entirely uneducated yet curiously fluent
      Irishman.</p>
<p>Is Elizabeth writhing under the infliction too? Never, in the Moat days, was she very
      patient under prolonged pulpit eloquence. He can see her with his memory's eye not very
      covertly reading her hymn-book—can hear her foot tapping. Several people around him now are,
      not very covertly, reading <hi>their</hi> hymn-books, but she is not among them. He has no
      more sight of her than he has of Cecilia; but in neither case—such are the disadvantages of
      his position—does his failure to see prove the absence of the object he seeks. He is one of
      the first persons to be out of church when at length set free, and stands just outside the
      porch while the long stream of worshippers defiles before him. It takes some time to empty
      itself into the sunshine, and nearly as long before he catches sight of any member of either
      of the families he is on the look-out for. Of the Le Marchants, indeed, he never catches
      sight, for the excellent reason that they are not to be caught sight of, not being there. In
      the case of the Wilsons he is more fortunate, though here, too, a sort of surprise is in store
      for him. He has involuntarily been scanning, in his search for them, only those of the
      congregation who are dressed in mourning. The picture that the retina of his eye has kept of
      Cecilia is of one tear-swollen and crape-swaddled; and though, if he had thought of it, his
      reason would have told him that, after seven months, she is probably no longer sobbing and
      sabled, yet even then the impression that he would expect to receive from her would be a grave
      and a black one. This is why, although he is on the look-out for her, she yet comes upon him
      at last as a surprise.</p>
<p>"Jim!" cries a voice, pitched a good deal higher than is wont to make itself heard within
      the precincts of a church—a female voice of delighted surprise and cheerful welcome; "father,
      here is Jim!"</p>
<p>Burgoyne turns, and sees a lady in a very smart bonnet, full of spring flowers, and with a
      red <hi>en tout cas</hi>—for they have now issued into the day's potent beam—shading her rosy
      face; a lady whose appearance presents about as wide a contrast to the serious and inky figure
      he had expected to see as it is well possible to imagine.</p>
<p>Cecilia, indeed, is looking, what her maid admiringly pronounced her before sending her
      forth to triumph, "very dressy." Mr. Wilson is black, certainly—but, then, clergymen always
      are black—and he still has a band upon his hat; but it is a very narrow one—sorrow nearing its
      vanishing-point. In answer to his daughter's joyous apostrophe, he answers:</p>
<p>"'Sh, Cecilia! do not talk so loud. How are you, Jim?"</p>
<p>And then the meeting is over—that first meeting which Jim had shrunk from with such
      inexpressible apprehension—as certain to be so fraught with intolerable emotion; with calls
      upon him that he would not be able to answer; with baring of incurable wounds. The contrast
      with the reality is so startling that at first it makes him almost dizzy. Can the showy
      creature beside him, preening herself under her gay sunshade, be the same overwhelmed, shrunk,
      tear-drenched Cecilia whom at their last meeting he had folded in so solemn an embrace? Her
      cheerful voice answers for herself:</p>
<p>"It is so nice to see you again! When did you come? We did not expect you quite so soon; in
      your last letter you were rather vague as to dates; I can't say that you shine as a
      correspondent. You will come back to luncheon with us, of course, will not you?
       <hi>déjeûner</hi>, as they call it here; I always thought <hi>déjeûner</hi> meant breakfast.
      You will come, will not you? Sybilla will be so glad to see you—glad, that is to say, in her
      dismal way."</p>
<p>She ends with a laugh, which he listens to in a silence that is almost stunned. The sound of
      her voice, though set to so different a tune from what he had anticipated, has brought back
      the past with such astonishing vividness to him; her very fleer at Sybilla seems so much a
      part of the old life that he half turns his head, expecting once more to see Amelia's
      deprecating face, to hear her peace-making voice put in a plea, as it has done so many hundred
      times, for the peevish <hi>malade imaginaire</hi>.</p>
<p>They have been strolling towards the carriages waiting outside, and have now reached one,
      driven by an <hi>indigène</hi>, a Moor, dusky as Othello, solemn as Rhadamanthus, and with his
      serious charms set off by a striped yellow and white jacket and a red sash.</p>
<p>"Is not he beautiful?" asks Cecilia, with another laugh, alluding to her coachman, as she
      and Burgoyne set off upon their <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> drive, Mr. Wilson seeing, apparently, no
      reason in the fact of his (Burgoyne's) appearance on the scene for departing from his
      invariable custom of walking home from church; "is not he beautiful? When first we came here
      we were in mourning; as if"—catching herself up with a stifled sigh—"there were any need to
      tell <hi>you</hi> that; and father wanted to put him into black, but I would not hear of it:
      was not I right? He would have been nothing in black; it is his red and yellow that give him
      his <hi>cachet</hi>."</p>
<p>Jim feels inclined to burst out laughing. There is something so ludicrous in the
      disproportion between his fears and their fulfilment, in the fact of the whole importance of
      Amelia's death resolving itself into a sash or no sash for an Arab coachman, that he has some
      difficulty in answering in a key of which the irony shall not be too patent:</p>
<p>"I think you were perfectly right."</p>
<p>He does not know whether she perceives the dryness of his tone; he thinks probably not, as
      she goes on to ask him a great many questions as to his journey, etc., talking quickly and
      rather flightily, scarcely leaving room between her queries for his monosyllabic replies, and
      ending with the ejaculation:</p>
<p>"How nice it is to see you again!"</p>
<p>"Thank you." His acknowledgment seems to himself so curt that, after a moment, he feels
      constrained to add something to it. That something is the bald and trivial inquiry: "And
      you—how have you all been getting on?"</p>
<p>Cecilia shrugs her shoulders.</p>
<p>"We are better off than we were; you know that, of course. Nobody ever thought that father's
      brother would have died before him. Wait till you see our villa—it is one of the show ones
      here; and of course it is very pleasant having more money; but one cannot help wishing that it
      had come earlier." She sighs as she speaks; not an ostentatious sigh, but a repressed and
      strangled one; and, despite the flower-garden in her bonnet, his heart softens to her. Perhaps
      his look has rested on that flower-garden with a more open disapprobation than he knows, for
      she says presently: "I think that one may be very bright-coloured outside, and very black
      inside. Father and I are sometimes very black inside."</p>
<p>"Are you?"</p>
<p>"We do very well when we are alone together, father and I; we like to talk about her. Dear
      me! what a place Algiers is for dust! that is why there are so many blind people here. How it
      gets into one's eyes!" She puts her handkerchief up hastily to her face as she speaks; but Jim
      is not taken in by the poor little ruse, and he listens to her in a silence that is almost
      tender, as she goes on: "Sybilla begins to cry if we even distantly allude to her; yet I
      know"—with exasperation—"that she talks of her by the hour to strangers—to her new doctor, for
      instance; yes, she has picked up a new doctor here—a dreadful little adventurer! She will
      probably talk of nothing else but her to you."</p>
<p>"God forbid!"</p>
<p>They have by this time left the town behind them, and have turned through a stone-pillared
      gate down an ilex and ficus-sheltered drive, along which the <hi>indigène</hi>, whipping up
      his horses to an avenue canter, lands them at the arched door of a snowy Moorish house, whose
      whitewash shows dazzling through the interstices of a Bougainvillia fire blazing all over its
      front.</p>
<p>Two minutes later Jim is standing by Sybilla's couch. She is holding both his hands in hers,
      and there is something in her face which tells him that she means that he shall kiss her.</p>
<p>"When I think—when I think of our last meeting!" she says hysterically.</p>
<p>"Yes," he says, gasping; "yes, of course. What a beautiful villa you have here!"</p>
<p>The observation is a true one, though, for the moment, he has not the least idea whether it
      is beautiful or not, as he turns his tormented eyes round upon the delicious little court,
      with its charming combination of slender twisted marble columns, of mellow-tinted tiles, of
      low plashing fountain. Originally it has been open, roofless to the eye and the breath and the
      rains of heaven; but its Northern purchaser has covered it in with glass, and set low divans
      and luxuriantly cushioned bamboo chairs about its soft-tumbling water.</p>
<p>Sybilla has let fall her hands, and the expression of the wish for a sisterly embrace has
      disappeared out of her face. For a few moments she remains absolutely silent. He looks round
      anxiously for Cecilia, but she has gone to take off her bonnet, and Mr. Wilson has not yet
      come in. Under pretence of examining the tiles, he walks towards the lovely little colonnade
      of horseshoe arches that form the court, and his uneasy look rests, scarcely seeing them, upon
      the vertical lines of lovely old faïence that intersect the whitewash with softest blues and
      greens and yellows.</p>
<p>When will Cecilia return? Behind him he presently hears the invalid's voice, steadied and
      coldened.</p>
<p>"It is very beautiful; and, of course, it is everything for weary eyes to have such pleasant
      objects to rest upon. I believe"—with a little laugh—"that we sick people really take in most
      of our nourishment through the eyes. Was not it wonderfully enterprising of us to come here? I
      suppose your first thought when you heard the news was, 'How mad of Sybilla to attempt
      it!'"</p>
<p>It is needless to say how innocent of the mental ejaculation attributed to him Jim has been,
      and the consciousness of it makes him inquire with guilty haste:</p>
<p>"But you were none the worse? you got over it all right?"</p>
<p>"I was really wonderful," replies she; "we sick people"—with a little air of playfulness—"do
      give you well ones these surprises sometimes; but I must not take the credit to myself: it is
      really every bit due to Dr. Crump, my new doctor, who is a perfect marvel of intuition. I
      always tell him that he never need ask; he <hi>divines</hi> how one is; he says he is a mere
      bundle of nerves himself; that is, I suppose, why one can talk to him upon subjects that are
      sealed books with one's nearest and dearest."</p>
<p>Her voice has a suspicious tremble in it which frightens Jim anew.</p>
<p>He looks again apprehensively for help towards the two tiers of curving column and rounding
      arch, which rise in cool grace above each other, and sees, with relief, the figure of Cecilia
      leaning over the balustrade that runs along the upper tier, and looking down upon him. At the
      same moment Mr. Wilson enters, and shortly afterwards they all go to luncheon. It is not a
      very pleasant repast, although the cool dining-room, with its beautiful old pierced stucco
      ceiling and its hanging brass lamps, contributes its part handsomely towards what should be
      their enjoyment. There is no overt family quarrel, but just enough of covert recrimination and
      sub-acid sparring to make an outsider feel thoroughly uncomfortable, and to prove how
      inharmonious a whole the soured little family now forms.</p>
<p>"We quarrel more than we used to do, do not we?" says Cecilia, when Jim, a little later,
      takes leave, and she walks, under her red sunshade, up the ilexed drive with him to the
      pillared gate; "and to-day we were better than usual, because you were by. Oh, I wish you were
      always by!"</p>
<p>He cannot echo the wish. He had thought that he had already held his dead Amelia at her true
      value; but never, until to-day, has he realized through what a long purgatory of obscure
      heroisms she had passed to her reward.</p>
<p>"I do hope you will not drop us altogether. Of course, now that the link that bound us to
      you is broken"—her voice quivers, but he feels neither the fear nor the rage that a like
      phenomenon in Sybilla has produced in him—"there is nothing to hold you any longer; but I do
      trust you will not quite throw us over."</p>
<p>"My dear old girl, why should I? I hope that you and I shall always be the best of friends,
      and that before long I shall see you settled in a home of your own."</p>
<p>"You mean that I shall marry? Well, to be sure"—with a recurrence to that business-like tone
      which had always amused him formerly in her discussion of her affairs of the heart—"I ought to
      have a better chance now than ever, as I shall have a larger fortune; but"—with a lapse into
      depression—"this is not a good place for men—I mean Englishmen. There are troops of
      delightful-looking Frenchmen, Chasseurs d'Afrique, and Zouaves; but, then, we do not know any
      of them—not one. Well, perhaps"—philosophically—"it is for the best; one always hears that
      Frenchmen make very bad husbands."</p>
