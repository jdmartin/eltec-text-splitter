<head> I.</head>
<p>In the west of Ireland, on the 9th of December, in the town of Ballah, in the Imperial Hotel
      there was a single guest, clerical and youthful. With the exception of a stray commercial
      traveller, who stopped once for a night, there had been nobody for a whole month but this
      guest, and now he was thinking of going away. The town, full enough in summer of trout and
      salmon fishers, slept all winter like the bears.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 9th of December, in the coffee-room of the Imperial Hotel, there was
      nobody but this guest. The guest was irritated. It had rained all day, and now that it
      <pb n="6"/> was clearing up night had almost fallen. He had packed his portmanteau: his
      stockings, his clothes-brush, his razor, his dress shoes were each in their corner, and now he
      had nothing to do. He had tried the paper that was lying on the table. He did not agree with
      its politics.</p>
<p>The waiter was playing an accordion in a little room over the stairs. The guest’s irritation
      increased, for the more he thought about it the more he perceived that the accordion was badly
      played. There was a piano in the coffee-room; he sat down at it and played the tune correctly,
      as loudly as possible. The waiter took no notice. He did not know that he was being played
      for. He was wholly absorbed in his own playing, and besides he was old, obstinate, and deaf.
      The guest could stand it no longer. He rang for the waiter, and then, remembering that he did
      not need anything, went out before he came.</p>
<p>
<pb n="7"/> He went through Martin’s Street, and Peter’s Lane, and turned down by the burnt
      house at the corner of the fish-market, picking his way towards the bridge. The town was
      dripping, but the rain was almost over. The large drops fell seldomer and seldomer into the
      puddles. It was the hour of ducks. Three or four had squeezed themselves under a gate, and
      were now splashing about in the gutter of the main street. There was scarcely any one abroad.
      Once or twice a countryman went by in yellow gaiters covered with mud and looked at the guest.
      Once an old woman with a basket of clothes, recognizing the Protestant curate’s <hi>locum
       tenens</hi>, made a low curtsey.</p>
<p>The clouds gradually drifted away, the twilight deepened and the stars came out. The guest,
      having bought some cigarettes, had spread his waterproof on the parapet of the bridge and was
      now leaning his elbows upon it,
      <pb n="8"/> looking at the river and feeling at last quite tranquil. His meditations, he
      repeated, to himself, were plated with silver by the stars. The water slid noiselessly, and
      one or two of the larger stars made little roadways of fire into the darkness. The light from
      a distant casement made also its roadway. Once or twice a fish leaped. Along the banks were
      the vague shadows of houses, seeming like phantoms gathering to drink.</p>
<p>Yes; he felt now quite contented with the world. Amidst his enjoyment of the shadows and the
      river—a veritable festival of silence—was mixed pleasantly the knowledge that, as he leant
      there with the light of a neighbouring gas-jet, flickering faintly on his refined form and
      nervous face and glancing from the little medal of some Anglican order that hung upon his
      watch-guard, he must have seemed—if there had been any to witness—a being
      <pb n="9"/> of a different kind to the inhabitants—at once rough and conventional—of this
      half-deserted town. Between these two feelings the unworldly and the worldly tossed a leaping
      wave of perfect enjoyment. How pleasantly conscious of his own identity it made him when he
      thought how he and not those whose birthright it was, felt most the beauty of these shadows
      and this river? To him who had read much, seen operas and plays, known religious experiences,
      and written verse to a waterfall in Switzerland, and not to those who dwelt upon its borders
      for their whole lives, did this river raise a tumult of images and wonders. What meaning it
      had for them he could not imagine. Some meaning surely it must have!</p>
<p>As he gazed out into the darkness, spinning a web of thoughts from himself to the river,
      from the river to himself, he saw, with a corner of his eye, a spot of red light moving in the
      <pb n="10"/> air at the other end of the bridge. He turned towards it. It came closer and
      closer, there appearing behind it the while a man and a cigar. The man carried in one hand a
      mass of fishing-line covered with hooks, and in the other a tin porringer full of bait.</p>
<p>“Good evening, Howard.”</p>
<p>“Good evening,” answered the guest, taking his elbows off the parapet and looking in a
      preoccupied way at the man with the hooks. It was only gradually he remembered that he was in
      Ballah among the barbarians, for his mind had strayed from the last evening gnats, making
      circles on the water beneath, to the devil’s song against “the little spirits” in
      “Mefistofele.” Looking down at the stone parapet he considered a moment and then burst
      out—</p>
<p>“Sherman, how do you stand this place—you who have thoughts above mere eating and sleeping
      and are not always grinding
      <pb n="11"/> at the stubble mill? Here everybody lives in the eighteenth century—the squalid
      century. Well, I am going to-morrow, you know. Thank Heaven, I am done with your grey streets
      and grey minds! The curate must come home, sick or well. I have a religious essay to write,
      and besides I should die. Think of that old fellow at the corner there, our most important
      parishioner. There are no more hairs on his head than thoughts in his skull. To merely look at
      him is to rob life of its dignity. Then there is nothing in the shops but school-books and
      Sunday-school prizes. Excellent, no doubt, for any one who has not had to read as many as I
      have. Such a choir! such rain!”</p>
<p>“You need some occupation peculiar to the place,” said the other, baiting his hooks with
      worms out of the little porringer. “I catch eels. You should set some night-lines too. You
      bait
      <pb n="12"/> them with worms in this way, and put them among the weeds at the edge of the
      river. In the morning you find an eel or two, if you have good fortune, turning round and
      round and making the weeds sway. I shall catch a great many after this rain.”</p>
<p>“What a suggestion! Do you mean to stay here,” said Howard, “till your mind rots like our
      most important parishioner’s?”</p>
<p>“No, no! To be quite frank with you,” replied the other, “I have some good looks and shall
      try to turn them to account by going away from here pretty soon and trying to persuade some
      girl with money to fall in love with me. I shall not be altogether a bad match, you see,
      because after she has made me a little prosperous my uncle will die and make me much more so.
      I wish to be able always to remain a lounger. Yes, I shall marry money. My mother has set her
      heart on it, and I am not, you see, the kind of person who falls
      <pb n="13"/> in love inconveniently. For the present——”</p>
<p>“You are vegetating,” interrupted the other.</p>
<p>“No, I am seeing the world. In your big towns a man finds his minority and knows nothing
      outside its border. He knows only the people like himself. But here one chats with the whole
      world in a day’s walk, for every man one meets is a class. The knowledge I am picking up may
      be useful to me when I enter the great cities and their ignorance. But I have lines to set.
      Come with me. I would ask you home, but you and my mother, you know, do not get on well.”</p>
<p>“I could not live with any one I did not believe in,” said Howard; “you are so different
      from me. You can live with mere facts, and that is why, I suppose, your schemes are so
      mercenary. Before this beautiful river, these stars, these great purple shadows, do you not
      feel
      <pb n="14"/> like an insect in a flower? As for me, I also have planned my future. Not too
      near or too far from a great city I see myself in a cottage with diamond panes, sitting by the
      fire. There are books everywhere and etchings on the wall; on the table is a manuscript essay
      on some religious matter. Perhaps I shall marry some day. Probably not, for I shall ask so
      much. Certainly I shall not marry for money, for I hold the directness and sincerity of the
      nature to be its compass. If we once break it the world grows trackless.”</p>
<p>“Good-bye,” said Sherman, briskly; “I have baited the last hook. Your schemes suit you, but
      a sluggish fellow like me, poor devil, who wishes to lounge through the world, would find them
      expensive.”</p>
<p>They parted; Sherman to set his lines and Howard to his hotel in high spirits, for it seemed
      to him he had been eloquent. The billiard-room, which opened
      <pb n="15"/> on the street, was lighted up. A few young men came round to play sometimes. He
      went in, for among these provincial youths he felt <hi>recherché</hi>; besides, he was a
      really good player. As he came in one of the players missed and swore. Howard reproved him
      with a look. He joined the play for a time, and then catching sight through a distant door of
      the hotel-keeper’s wife putting a kettle on the hob he hurried off, and, drawing a chair to
      the fire, began one of those long gossips about everybody’s affairs peculiar to the cloth.</p>
<p>As Sherman, having set his lines, returned home, he passed a tobacconist’s—a sweet-shop and
      tobacconist’s in one—the only shop in town, except public-houses, that remained open. The
      tobacconist was standing in his door, and, recognizing one who dealt consistently with a rival
      at the other end of the town, muttered: “There goes that <hi>gluggerabunthaun</hi> and Jack o’
      <pb n="16"/> Dreams; been fishing most likely. Ugh!” Sherman paused for a moment as he
      repassed the bridge and looked at the water, on which now a new-risen and crescent moon was
      shining dimly. How full of memories it was to him! what playmates and boyish adventures did it
      not bring to mind! To him it seemed to say, “Stay near to me,” as to Howard it had said, “Go
      yonder, to those other joys and other sceneries I have told you of.” It bade him who loved
      stay still and dream, and gave flying feet to him who imagined.</p>
