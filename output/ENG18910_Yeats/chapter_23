<head> I.</head>
<p>This being the homeward trip, SS. <hi>Lavinia</hi> carried no cattle, but many passengers.
      As the sea was smooth and the voyage near its end, they lounged about the deck in groups. Two
      cattle merchants were leaning over the taffrail smoking. In appearance they were something
      between betting men and commercial travellers. For years they had done all their sleeping in
      steamers and trains. A short distance from them a clerk from Liverpool, with a consumptive
      cough, walked to and fro, a little child holding his hand. Shortly he would be landed in a
      boat putting off from
      <pb n="146"/> the shore for the purpose. He had come hoping that his native air of Teeling
      Head would restore him. The little child was a strange contrast—her cheeks ruddy with perfect
      health. Further forward, talking to one of the crew, was a man with a red face and slightly
      unsteady step. In the companion house was a governess, past her first youth, very much afraid
      of seasickness. She had brought her luggage up and heaped it round her to be ready for
      landing. Sherman sat on a pile of cable looking out over the sea. It was just noon; SS.
       <hi>Lavinia</hi>, having passed by Tory and Rathlin, was approaching the Donegal cliffs. They
      were covered by a faint mist, which made them loom even vaster than they were. To westward the
      sun shone on a perfectly blue sea. Seagulls come out of the mist and plunged into the
      sunlight, and out of the sunlight and plunged into the mist. To the westward
      <pb n="147"/> gannets were striking continually, and a porpoise showed now and then, his fin
      and back gleaming in the sun. Sherman was more perfectly happy than he had been for many a
      day, and more ardently thinking. All nature seemed full of a Divine fulfilment. Everything
      fulfilled its law—fulfilment that is peace, whether it be for good or for evil, for evil also
      has its peace, the peace of the birds of prey. Sherman looked from the sea to the ship and
      grew sad. Upon this thing, crawling slowly along the sea, moved to and fro many mournful and
      slouching figures. He looked from the ship to himself and his eyes filled with tears. On
      himself, on these moving figures, hope and memory fed like flames.</p>
<p>Again his eyes gladdened, for he knew he had found his present. He would live in his love
      and the day as it passed. He would live that his law might be fulfilled. Now, was he sure of
      this truth?—the
      <pb n="148"/> saints on the one hand, the animals on the other, live in the moment as it
      passes. Thitherward had his days brought him. This was the one grain they had ground. To grind
      one grain is sufficient for a lifetime.</p>
