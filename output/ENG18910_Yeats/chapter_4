<p>On January the 5th about two in the afternoon, Sherman sat on the deck of the steamer
       <hi>Lavinia</hi> enjoying a period of sunshine between two showers. The steamer
       <hi>Lavinia</hi> was a cattle boat. It had been his wish to travel by some more expensive
      route, but his mother, with her old-fashioned ideas of duty, would not hear of it, and now, as
      he foresaw, was extremely uncomfortable below, while he, who was a good sailor, was pretty
      happy on deck, and would have been quite so if the pigs would only tire of their continual
      squealing. With the exception
      <pb n="40"/> of a very dirty old woman sitting by a crate of geese, all the passengers but
      himself were below. This old woman made the journey monthly with geese for the Liverpool
      market.</p>
<p>Sherman was dreaming. He began to feel very desolate, and commenced a letter to Mary Carton
      in his notebook to state this fact. He was a laborious and unpractised writer, and found it
      helped him to make a pencil copy. Sometimes he stopped and watched the puffin sleeping on the
      waves. Each one of them had its head tucked in in a somewhat different way.</p>
<p>“That is because their characters are different,” he thought.</p>
<p>Gradually he began to notice a great many corks floating by, one after the other. The old
      woman saw them too, and said, waking out of a half sleep—</p>
<p>“Misther John Sherman, we will be in the Mersey before evening. Why are ye goin’ among them
      savages in London,
      <pb n="41"/> Misther John? Why don’t ye stay among your own people—for what have we in this
      life but a mouthful of air?”</p>
