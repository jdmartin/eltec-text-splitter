<p>Gowing explains his conduct. Lupin takes us for a drive, which we don't enjoy. Lupin
     introduces us to Mr. Murray Posh.</p>
<p><label>February 8</label>—It does seem hard I cannot get good sausages for breakfast. They
     are either full of bread or spice, or are as red as beef. Still anxious about the £20 I
     invested last week by Lupin's advice. However, Cummings has done the same.</p>
<p/>
<p><label>February 9.</label>—Exactly a fortnight has passed, and I have neither seen nor heard
     from Gowing respecting his extraordinary conduct in asking us round to his house, and then
     being out. In the evening Carrie was engaged marking a half-dozen new collars I had purchased.
     I'll back Carrie's marking against anybody's. While I was drying them at the fire, and Carrie
     was rebuking me for scorching them, Cummings came in.</p>
<p>He seemed quite well again, and chaffed us about
     <pb n="194"/> marking the collars. I asked him if he had heard from Gowing, and he replied that
     he had not. I said I should not have believed that Gowing could have acted in such an
     ungentlemanly manner. Cummings said: "You are mild in your description of him; I think he has
     acted like a cad."</p>
<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when the door opened, and Gowing, putting in his
     head, said: "May I come in?" I said: "Certainly." Carrie said very pointedly: "Well, you
      <hi>are</hi> a stranger." Gowing said: "Yes, I've been on and off to Croydon during the last
     fortnight." I could see Cummings was boiling over, and eventually he tackled Gowing very
     strongly respecting his conduct last Saturday week. Gowing appeared surprised, and said: "Why,
     I posted a letter to you in the morning announcing that the party was 'off, very much off.'" I
     said: "I never got it." Gowing, turning to Carrie, said: "I suppose letters sometimes
      <hi>miscarry</hi>, don't they, <hi>Mrs. Carrie?</hi>" Cummings sharply said: "This is not a
     time for joking. <hi>I</hi> had no notice of the party being put off." Gowing replied: "I told
     Pooter in my note to tell you, as I was in a hurry. However, I'll inquire at the post-office,
     and we must meet again at my place." I added that I hoped he would be
     <pb n="195"/> present at the next meeting. Carrie roared at this, and even Cummings could not
     help laughing.</p>
<p><label>February 10, Sunday.</label>—Contrary to my wishes, Carrie allowed Lupin to persuade
     her to take her for a drive in the afternoon in his trap. I quite disapprove of driving on a
     Sunday, but I did not like to trust Carrie alone with Lupin, so I offered to go too. Lupin
     said: "Now, that is nice of you, Guv., but you won't mind sitting on the back-seat of the
     cart?"</p>
<p>Lupin proceeded to put on a bright-blue coat that seemed miles too large for him. Carrie said
     it wanted taking in considerably at the back. Lupin said: "Haven't you seen a box-coat before?
     You can't drive in anything else."</p>
<p>He may wear what he likes in the future, for I shall never drive with him again. His conduct
     was shocking. When we passed Highgate Archway, he tried to pass everything and everybody. He
     shouted to respectable people who were walking quietly in the road to get out of the way; he
     flicked at the horse of an old man who was riding, causing it to rear; and, as I had to ride
     backwards, I was compelled to face a gang of roughs in a donkey-cart, whom Lupin had chaffed,
     and who turned and followed us for nearly
     <pb n="196"/> a mile, bellowing, indulging in coarse jokes and laughter, to say nothing of
     occasionally pelting us with orange-peel.</p>
<p>Lupin's excuse-that the Prince of Wales would have to put up with the same sort of thing if
     he drove to the Derby-was of little consolation to either Carrie or myself. Frank Mutlar called
     in the evening, and Lupin went out with him.</p>
<p><label>February 11.</label>—Feeling a little concerned about Lupin, I mustered up courage to
     speak to Mr. Perkupp about him. Mr. Perkupp has always been most kind to me, so I told him
     everything, including yesterday's adventure. Mr. Perkupp kindly replied: "There is no necessity
     for you to be anxious, Mr. Pooter. It would be impossible for a son of such good parents to
     turn out erroneously. Remember he is young, and will soon get older. I wish we could find room
     for him in this firm." The advice of this good man takes loads off my mind. In the evening
     Lupin came in.</p>
<p>After our little supper, he said: "My dear parents, I have some news, which I fear will
     affect you considerably." I felt a qualm come over me, and said nothing. Lupin then said: "It
     may
     <pb n="197"/> distress you-in fact, I'm sure it will-but this afternoon I have given up my pony
     and trap for ever." It may seem absurd, but I was so pleased, I immediately opened a bottle of
     port. Gowing dropped in just in time, bringing with him a large sheet, with a print of a
     tailless donkey, which he fastened against the wall. He then produced several separate tails,
     and we spent the remainder of the evening trying blindfolded to pin a tail on in the proper
     place. My sides positively ached with laughter when I went to bed.</p>
<p><label>February 12.</label>—In the evening I spoke to Lupin about his engagement with Daisy
     Mutlar. I asked if he had heard from her. He replied: "No; she promised that old windbag of a
     father of hers that she would not communicate with me. I see Frank Mutlar, of course; in fact,
     he said he might call again this evening." Frank called, but said he could not stop, as he had
     a friend waiting outside for him, named Murray Posh, adding he was quite a swell. Carrie asked
     Frank to bring him in.</p>
<p>He was brought in, Gowing entering at the same time. Mr. Murray Posh was a tall, fat young
     man, and was evidently of a very nervous disposition, as he subsequently confessed he would
     never go in a
     <pb n="198"/> hansom cab, nor would he enter a four-wheeler until the driver had first got on
     the box with his reins in his hands.</p>
<gap n="" unit="graphic"/>
<p>On being introduced, Gowing, with his usual want of tact, said: "Any relation to 'Posh's
     three-shilling hats'?" Mr. Posh replied: "Yes; but please understand I don't try on hats
     myself. I take no <hi>active</hi> part in the business." I replied: "I wish I had a business
     like it." Mr. Posh seemed pleased, and gave a long but most interesting history of the
     extraordinary difficulties in the manufacture of cheap hats.</p>
<p>Murray Posh evidently knew Daisy Mutlar very intimately from the way he was talking of her;
     and Frank said to Lupin once, laughingly: "If you don't look out, Posh will cut you out!" When
     they had all gone, I referred to this flippant conversation; and Lupin said, sarcastically: "A
     <pb n="199-200"/> man who is jealous has no respect for himself. A man who would be jealous
     of an elephant like Murray Posh could only have a contempt for himself. I know Daisy. She would
     wait ten years for me, as I said before; in fact, if necessary, <hi>she would wait twenty years
      for me</hi>."</p>
