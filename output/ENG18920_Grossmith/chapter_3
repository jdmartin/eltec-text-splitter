<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>A conversation with Mr. Merton on Society. Mr. and Mrs. James, of Sutton, come up. A
     miserable evening at the Tank Theatre. Experiments with enamel paint. I make another good joke;
     but Gowing and Cummings are unnecessarily offended. I paint the bath red, with unexpected
     result.</p>
<p><label>April 19</label>—Cummings called, bringing with him his friend Merton, who is in the
     wine trade. Gowing also called. Mr. Merton made himself at home at once, and Carrie and I were
     both struck with him immediately, and thoroughly approved of his sentiments.</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair and said: "You must take me as I am;" and I replied: "Yes—and you
     must take us as we are. We're homely people, we are not swells."</p>
<p>He answered: "No, I can see that," and Gowing roared with laughter; but Merton in a most
     gentlemanly
     <pb n="40"/> manner said to Gowing, "I don't think you quite understand me. I intended to
     convey that our charming host and hostess were superior to the follies of fashion, and
     preferred leading a simple and wholesome life to gadding about to twopenny-halfpenny
     tea-drinking afternoons, and living above their incomes."</p>
<p>I was immensely pleased with these sensible remarks of Merton's, and concluded that subject
     by saying: "No, candidly, Mr. Merton, we don't go into Society, because we do not care for it;
     and what with the expense of cabs here and cabs there, and white gloves and white ties,
     etc., it doesn't seem worth the money."</p>
<p>Merton said in reference to <hi>friends</hi>, "My motto is 'Few and True;' and, by the way, I
     also apply that to wine, 'Little and Good.'" Gowing said: "Yes, and sometimes 'cheap and
     tasty,' eh, old man?" Merton still continuing, said he should treat me as a friend, and put me
     down for a dozen of his "Lockanbar" whisky, and as I was an old friend of Gowing, I should have
     it for 36<hi>s.</hi>, which was considerably under what he paid for it.</p>
<p>He booked his own order, and further said that at any time I wanted any passes for the
     theatre
     <pb n="41"/> I was to let him know, as his name stood good for any theatre in London.</p>
<p><label>April 20.</label>—Carrie reminded me that as her old school friend, Annie Fullers (now
     Mrs. James), and her husband had come up from Sutton for a few days, it would look kind to take
     them to the theatre, and would I drop a line to Mr. Merton asking him for passes for four,
     either for the Italian Opera, Haymarket, Savoy, or Lyceum. I wrote Merton to that effect.</p>
<p><label>April 21.</label>—Got a reply from Merton, saying he was very busy, and just at
     present couldn't manage passes for the Italian Opera, Haymarket, Savoy, or Lyceum, but the best
     thing going on in London was the <title>Brown Bushes</title>, at the Tank Theatre, Islington,
     and enclosed seats for four; also bill for whisky.</p>
<p><label>April 23.</label>—Mr. and Mrs. James (Miss Fullers that was), came to meat tea, and we
     left directly after for the Tank Theatre. We got a 'bus that took us to King's Cross, and then
     changed into one that took us to the "Angel." Mr. James each time insisting on paying for all,
     saying that I had paid for the tickets and that was quite enough.</p>
<pb n="42"/>
<p>We arrived at theatre, where, curiously enough, all our 'bus-load except an old woman with a
     basket seemed to be going in. I walked ahead and presented the tickets. The man looked at them,
     and called out "Mr. Willowly! do you know anything about these?" holding up my tickets. The
     gentleman called to, came up and examined my tickets, and said: "Who gave you these?" I said
     rather indignantly: "Mr. Merton, of course." He said: "Merton? Who's he?" I answered rather
     sharply, "You ought to know, his name's good at any theatre in London." He replied: "Oh! is it?
     Well, it ain't no good here. These tickets which are <hi>not</hi> dated, were issued under Mr.
     Swinstead's management, which has since changed hands." While I was having some very unpleasant
     words with the man, James, who had gone upstairs with the ladies, called out: "Come on!" I went
     up after them, and a very civil attendant said: "This way, please, box H." I said to James:
     "Why, how on earth did you manage it?" and to my horror he replied: "Why, paid for it of
     course."</p>
<p>This was humiliating enough, and I could scarcely follow the play, but I was doomed to still
     further humiliation. I was leaning out of
     <pb n="43"/> the box, when my tie—a little black bow which fastened on to the stud by means of
     a new patent—fell into the pit below. A clumsy man not noticing it, had his foot on it for ever
     so long before he discovered it. He then picked it up and eventually flung it under the next
     seat in disgust. What with the box incident and the tie, I felt quite miserable. Mr. James, of
     Sutton, was very good. He said: "Don't worry—no one will notice it with your beard. That is the
     only advantage of growing one that I can see." There was no occasion for that remark, for
     Carrie is very proud of my beard.</p>
<p>To hide the absence of the tie I had to keep my chin down the rest of the evening, which
     caused a pain at the back of my neck.</p>
<p><label>April 24.</label>—Could scarcely sleep a wink through thinking of having brought up
     Mr. and Mrs. James from the country to go to the theatre last night, and his having paid for a
     private box because our order was not honoured; and such a poor play too. I wrote a very
     satirical letter to Merton, the wine merchant, who gave us the pass, and said, "Considering we
     had to <hi>pay</hi> for our seats, we did our <hi>best</hi> to appreciate the performance." I
     thought this line
     <pb n="44"/> rather cutting, and I asked Carrie how many p's there were in appreciate, and she
     said, "One." After I sent off the letter I looked at the dictionary and found there were two.
     Awfully vexed at this.</p>
<p>Decided not to worry myself any more about the James's; for, as Carrie wisely said, "We'll
     make it all right with them by asking them up from Sutton one evening next week, to play at
     Bézique."</p>
<p><label>April 25.</label>—In consequence of Brickwell telling me his wife was working wonders
     with the new Pinkford's enamel paint, I determined to try it. I bought two tins of red on my
     way home. I hastened through tea, went into the garden and painted some flower-pots. I called
     out Carrie, who said: "You've always got some new-fangled craze;" but she was obliged to admit
     that the flower-pots looked remarkably well. Went upstairs into the servant's bedroom and
     painted her washstand, towel-horse, and chest of drawers. To my mind it was an extraordinary
     improvement, but as an example of the ignorance of the lower classes in the matter of taste,
     our servant Sarah, on seeing them, evinced no sign of pleasure, but merely said: "she thought
     they looked very well as they was before."</p>
<pb n="45"/>
<p/>
<gap n="pic45" unit="graphic"/>
<p><label>April 26.</label>—Got some more red enamel paint (red, to my mind, being the best
     colour), and painted the coal-scuttle, and the backs of our <title>Shakspeare</title>, the
     binding of which had almost worn out.</p>
<pb n="46"/>
<p><label>April 27.</label>—Painted the bath red, and was delighted with the result. Sorry to
     say Carrie was not, in fact we had a few words about it. She said I ought to have consulted
     her, and she had never heard of such a thing as a bath being painted red. I replied: "It's
     merely a matter of taste."</p>
<p>Fortunately, further argument on the subject was stopped by a voice saying, "May I come in?"
     It was only Cummings, who said, "Your maid opened the door, and asked me to excuse her showing
     me in, as she was wringing out some socks." I was delighted to see him, and suggested we should
     have a game of whist with a dummy, and by way of merriment said: "<hi>You</hi> can be the
     dummy." Cummings (I thought rather ill-naturedly) replied: "Funny as usual." He said he
     couldn't stop, he only called to leave me the <title>Bicycle News</title>, as he had done with
     it.</p>
<p>Another ring at the bell; it was Gowing, who said "he must apologise for coming so often, and
     that one of these days <hi>we</hi> must come round to <hi>him</hi>." I said: "A very
     extraordinary thing has struck me." "Something funny, as usual," said Cummings. "Yes," I
     replied; "I think even <hi>you</hi> will say so this time. It's concerning you both; for
     doesn't it seem odd that Gowing's always <hi>coming</hi>, and Cumming's always <hi>going?</hi>"
     <pb n="47"/> Carrie, who had evidently quite forgotten about the bath, went into fits of
     laughter, and as for myself, I fairly doubled up in my chair, till it cracked beneath me. I
     think this was one of the best jokes I have ever made.</p>
<p>Then imagine my astonishment on perceiving both Cummings and Gowing perfectly silent, and
     without a smile on their faces. After rather an unpleasant pause, Cummings, who had opened a
     cigar-case, closed it up again and said: "Yes—I think, after that, I <hi>shall</hi> be going,
     and I am sorry I fail to see the fun of your jokes." Gowing said he didn't mind a joke when it
     wasn't rude, but a pun on a name, to his thinking, was certainly a little wanting in good
     taste. Cummings followed it up by saying, if it had been said by any one else but myself, he
     shouldn't have entered the house again. This rather unpleasantly terminated what might have
     been a cheerful evening. However, it was as well they went, for the charwoman had finished up
     the remains of the cold pork.</p>
<p><label>April 28.</label>—At the office, the new and very young clerk Pitt, who was very
     impudent to me a week or so ago, was late again. I told him it would be my duty to inform Mr.
     Perkupp, the principal. To my
     <pb n="48"/> surprise Pitt apologised most humbly and in a most gentlemanly fashion. I was
     unfeignedly pleased to notice this improvement in his manner towards me, and told him I would
     look over his unpunctuality. Passing down the room an hour later, I received a smart smack in
     the face from a rolled-up ball of hard foolscap. I turned round sharply, but all the clerks
     were apparently riveted to their work. I am not a rich man, but I would give half-a-sovereign
     to know whether that was thrown by accident or design. Went home early and bought some more
     enamel paint-black this time—and spent the evening touching up the fender, picture-frames, and
     an old pair of boots, making them look as good as new. Also painted Gowing's walking-stick,
     which he left behind, and made it look like ebony.</p>
<p><label>April 29, Sunday.</label>—Woke up with a fearful headache and strong symptoms of a
     cold. Carrie, with a perversity which is just like her, said it was "painter's colic," and was
     the result of my having spent the last few days with my nose over a paint-pot. I told her
     firmly that I knew a great deal better what was the matter with me than she did. I had got a
     chill, and decided to have a bath as hot as I could bear it. Bath ready—could scarcely bear
     <pb n="49"/> it so hot. I persevered, and got in; very hot, but very acceptable. I lay still
     for some time.</p>
<p/>
<gap n="pic49" unit="graphic"/>
<p>On moving my hand above the surface of the water, I experienced the greatest fright I ever
     received in the whole course of my life; for imagine my horror on discovering my hand, as I
     thought, full of blood.
     <pb n="50"/> My first thought was that I had ruptured an artery, and was bleeding to death, and
     should be discovered, later on, looking like a second Marat, as I remember seeing him in Madame
     Tussaud's. My second thought was to ring the bell, but remembered there was no bell to ring. My
     third was, that there was nothing but the enamel paint, which had dissolved with boiling water.
     I stepped out of the bath, perfectly red all over, resembling the Red Indians I have seen
     depicted at an East-End theatre. I determined not to say a word to Carrie, but to tell
     Farmerson to come on Monday and paint the bath white.</p>
