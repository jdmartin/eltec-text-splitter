<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>After the Mansion House Ball. Carrie offended. Gowing also offended. A pleasant party at the
     Cummings'. Mr. Franching, of Peckham, visits us.</p>
<p><label>May 8</label>—I woke up with a most terrible headache. I could scarcely see, and the
     back of my neck was as if I had given it a crick. I thought first of sending for a doctor; but
     I did not think it necessary. When up, I felt faint, and went to Brownish's, the chemist, who
     gave me a draught. So bad at the office, had to get leave to come home. Went to another chemist
     in the City, and I got a draught. Brownish's dose seems to have made me worse; have eaten
     nothing all day. To make matters worse, Carrie, every time I spoke to her, answered me
     sharply—that is, when she answered at all.</p>
<p>In the evening I felt very much worse again and said to her: "I do believe I've been poisoned
     by the lobster mayonnaise at the Mansion House last night;" she simply replied, without taking
     her eyes from her
     <pb n="68"/> sewing: "Champagne never did agree with you." I felt irritated, and said: "What
     nonsense you talk; I only had a glass and a half, and you know as well as I do——" Before I
     could complete the sentence she bounced out of the room. I sat over an hour waiting for her to
     return; but as she did not, I determined I would go to bed. I discovered Carrie had gone to bed
     without even saying "good-night"; leaving me to bar the scullery door and feed the cat. I shall
     certainly speak to her about this in the morning.</p>
<p><label>May 9.</label>—Still a little shaky, with black specs. The <title>Blackfriars
      Bi-weekly News</title>, contains a long list of the guests at the Mansion House ball.
     Disappointed to find our names omitted, though Farmerson's is in plainly enough with M.L.L.
     after it, whatever that may mean. More than vexed because we had ordered a dozen copies to send
     to our friends. Wrote to the <title>Blackfriars Bi-weekly News</title>, pointing out their
     omission.</p>
<p>Carrie had commenced her breakfast when I entered the parlour. I helped myself to a cup of
     tea, and I said, perfectly calmly and quietly: "Carrie, I wish a little explanation of your
     conduct last night."</p>
<pb n="69"/>
<p>She replied, "Indeed! and I desire something more than a <hi>little</hi> explanation of your
     conduct the night before."</p>
<p>I said, coolly: "Really, I don't understand you."</p>
<p>Carrie said sneeringly: "Probably not; you were scarcely in a condition to understand
     anything."</p>
<p>I was astounded at this insinuation and simply ejaculated: "Caroline!"</p>
<p>She said: "Don't be theatrical, it has no effect on me. Reserve that tone for your new
     friend. <hi>Mister</hi> Farmerson, the ironmonger."</p>
<p>I was about to speak, when Carrie, in a temper such as I have never seen her in before, told
     me to hold my tongue. She said: "Now <hi>I'm</hi> going to say something! After professing to
     snub Mr. Farmerson, you permit him to snub <hi>you</hi>, in my presence, and then accept his
     invitation to take a glass of champagne with you, and you don't limit yourself to one glass.
     You then offer this vulgar man, who made a bungle of repairing our scraper, a seat in our cab
     on the way home. I say nothing about his tearing my dress in getting in the cab, nor of
     treading on Mrs. James's expensive fan, which you knocked out of my hand, and for which he
     never
     <pb n="70"/> even apologised; but you smoked all the way home without having the decency to ask
     my permission. That is not all! At the end of the journey, although he did not offer you a
     farthing towards his share of the cab, you asked him in. Fortunately, he was sober enough to
     detect, from my manner, that his company was not desirable."</p>
<p/>
<gap n="pic70" unit="graphic"/>
<p>Goodness knows I felt humiliated enough at this; but, to make matters worse, Gowing entered
     the room, without knocking, with two hats on his head and holding the garden-rake in his hand,
     with Carrie's fur tippet (which he had taken off the downstairs hall-peg) round his neck, and
     announced himself in a loud, coarse voice: "His Royal Highness, the Lord Mayor!" He marched
     twice round the
     <pb n="71"/> room like a buffoon, and, finding we took no notice, said: "Hulloh! what's up?
     Lovers' quarrel, eh?"</p>
<p>There was a silence for a moment, so I said quietly: "My dear Gowing, I'm not very well, and
     not quite in the humour for joking; especially when you enter the room without knocking, an act
     which I fail to see the fun of."</p>
<p>Gowing said: "I'm very sorry, but I called for my stick, which I thought you would have sent
     round." I handed him his stick, which I remembered I had painted black with the enamel paint,
     thinking to improve it. He looked at it for a minute with a dazed expression and said: "Who did
     this?"</p>
<p>I said: "Eh? Did what?"</p>
<p>He said: "Did what? Why, destroyed my stick! It belonged to my poor uncle, and I value it
     more than anything I have in the world! I'll know who did it."</p>
<p>I said: "I'm very sorry. I daresay it will come off. I did it for the best."</p>
<p>Gowing said: "Then all I can say is, it's a confounded liberty; and I <hi>would</hi> add,
     you're a bigger fool than you look, only <hi>that's</hi> absolutely impossible."</p>
<pb n="72"/>
<p><label>May 12.</label>—Got a single copy of the <title>Blackfriars Bi-weekly News</title>.
     There was a short list of several names they had omitted; but the stupid people had mentioned
     our names as "Mr. and Mrs. C. Porter." Most annoying! Wrote again and I took particular care to
     write our name in capital letters, <hi>POOTER</hi>, so that there should be no possible mistake
     this time.</p>
<p><label>May 16.</label>—Absolutely disgusted on opening the <title>Blackfriars Bi-weekly
      News</title> of to-day, to find the following paragraph: "We have received two letters from
     Mr. and Mrs. Charles Pewter, requesting us to announce the important fact that they were at the
     Mansion House Ball." I tore up the paper and threw it in the waste-paper basket. My time is far
     too valuable to bother about such trifles.</p>
<p><label>May 21.</label>—The last week or ten days terribly dull, Carrie being away at Mrs.
     James's, at Sutton. Cummings also away. Gowing, I presume, is still offended with me for
     black-enamelling his stick without asking him.</p>
<p><label>May 22.</label>—Purchased a new stick mounted with silver, which cost
     seven-and-sixpence (shall tell
     <pb n="73"/> Carrie five shillings), and sent it round with nice note to Gowing.</p>
<p><label>May 23.</label>—Received strange note from Gowing; he says: "Offended? not a bit, my
     boy. I thought you were offended with me for losing my temper. Besides, I found after all, it
     was not my poor old uncle's stick you painted. It was only a shilling thing I bought at a
     tobacconist's. However, I am much obliged to you for your handsome present all same."</p>
<p><label>May 24.</label>—Carrie back. Hoorah! She looks wonderfully well, except that the sun
     has caught her nose.</p>
<p><label>May 25.</label>—Carrie brought down some of my shirts and advised me to take them to
     Trillip's round the corner. She said: "The fronts and cuffs are much frayed." I said without a
     moment's hesitation: "I'm <hi>'frayed</hi> they are." Lor! how we roared. I thought we should
     never stop laughing. As I happened to be sitting next the driver going to town on the 'bus, I
     told him my joke about the "frayed" shirts. I thought he would have rolled off his seat. They
     laughed at the office a good bit too over it.</p>
<pb n="74"/>
<p><label>May 26.</label>—Left the shirts to be repaired at Trillip's. I said to him: "I'm
      <hi>'fraid</hi> they are <hi>frayed</hi>." He said, without a smile: "They're bound to do
     that, sir." Some people seem to be quite destitute of a sense of humour.</p>
<p>June 1.—The last week has been like old times, Carrie being back, and Gowing and Cummings
     calling every evening nearly. Twice we sat out in the garden quite late. This evening we were
     like a pack of children, and played "consequences." It is a good game.</p>
<p><label>June 2.</label>—"Consequences" again this evening. Not quite so successful as last
     night; Gowing having several times over-stepped the limits of good taste.</p>
<p><label>June 4.</label>—In the evening Carrie and I went round to Mr. and Mrs. Cummings' to
     spend a quiet evening with them. Gowing was there, also Mr. Stillbrook. It was quiet but
     pleasant. Mrs. Cummings sang five or six songs, "No, Sir," and "The Garden of Sleep," being
     best in my humble judgment; but what pleased me most was the duet she sang with
     Carrie—classical duet, too. I think
     <pb n="75"/> it is called, "I would that my love!" It was beautiful. If Carrie had been in
     better voice, I don't think professionals could have sung it better. After supper we made them
     sing it again. I never liked Mr. Stillbrook since the walk that Sunday to the "Cow and Hedge,"
     but I must say he sings comic-songs well. His song: "We don't Want the old men now," made us
     shriek with laughter, especially the verse referring to Mr. Gladstone; but there was one verse
     I think he might have omitted, and I said so, but Gowing thought it was the best of the
     lot.</p>
<p><label>June 6.</label>—Trillip brought round the shirts and, to my disgust, his charge for
     repairing was more than I gave for them when new. I told him so, and he impertinently replied:
     "Well, they are better now than when they were new." I paid him, and said it was a robbery. He
     said: "If you wanted your shirt-fronts made out of pauper-linen, such as is used for packing
     and bookbinding, why didn't you say so?"</p>
<p/>
<gap n="pic76" unit="graphic"/>
<p><label>June 7.</label>—A dreadful annoyance. Met Mr. Franching, who lives at Peckham, and who
     is a great swell in his way. I ventured to ask him to come home to meat-tea and take pot-luck.
     I did
     <pb n="76"/> not think he would accept such a humble invitation; but he did, saying, in a most
     friendly way, he would rather "peck" with us than by himself. I said: "We had better get into
     this blue 'bus." He replied: "No blue-bussing for me. I have had enough of the blues lately. I
     lost a cool 'thou' over the Copper Scare. Step in here."</p>
<p>We drove up home in style, in a hansom-cab, and I knocked three times at the front door
     without getting an answer. I saw Carrie, through the panels of ground-glass (with stars),
     rushing up stairs. I told Mr. Franching to wait at the door while I went round to the side.
     There I saw the grocer's boy actually picking off the paint on the door, which had formed into
     blisters. No time to reprove him; so went round and effected an entrance through the kitchen
     window. I let in
     <pb n="78"/> Mr. Franching, and showed him into the drawing-room. I went up stairs to Carrie,
     who was changing her dress, and told her I had persuaded Mr. Franching to come home. She
     replied: "How can you do such a thing? You know it's Sarah's holiday, and there's not a thing
     in the house, the cold mutton having turned with the hot weather."</p>
<pb n="[77]"/>
<p/>
<gap n="pic77" unit="graphic"/>
<p>Eventually Carrie, like a good creature as she is, slipped down, washed up the tea-cups, and
     laid the cloth, and I gave Franching our views of Japan to look at while I ran round to the
     butcher's to get three chops.</p>
<p><label>July 30.</label>—The miserable cold weather is either upsetting me or Carrie, or both.
     We seem to break out into an argument about absolutely nothing, and this unpleasant state of
     things usually occurs at meal times.</p>
<p>This morning, for some unaccountable reason, we were talking about balloons, and we were as
     merry as possible; but the conversation drifted into family matters, during which Carrie,
     without the slightest reason, referred in the most uncompli­mentary manner to my poor father's
     pecuniary trouble. I retorted by saying that "Pa, at all events, was a gentleman," whereupon
     Carrie burst
     <pb n="79"/> out crying. I positively could not eat any breakfast.</p>
<p>At the office I was sent for by Mr. Perkupp, who said he was very sorry, but I should have to
     take my annual holidays from next Saturday. Franching called at office and asked me to dine at
     his club, "The Constitutional." Fearing disagreeables at home after the "tiff" this morning, I
     sent a telegram to Carrie, telling her I was going out to dine and she was not to sit up.
     Bought a little silver bangle for Carrie.</p>
<p><label>July 31.</label>—Carrie was very pleased with the bangle, which I left with an
     affectionate note on her dressing-table last night before going to bed. I told Carrie we should
     have to start for our holiday next Saturday. She replied quite happily that she did not mind,
     except that the weather was so bad, and she feared that Miss Jibbons would not be able to get
     her a seaside dress in time. I told Carrie that I thought the drab one with pink bows looked
     quite good enough; and Carrie said she should not think of wearing it. I was about to discuss
     the matter, when, remembering the argument yesterday, resolved to hold my tongue.</p>
<p>I said to Carrie: "I don't think we can
     <pb n="80"/> do better than 'Good old Broad­stairs.'" Carrie not only, to my astonishment,
     raised an objection to Broad­stairs, for the first time; but begged me not to use the
     expression, "Good old," but to leave it to Mr. Stillbrook and other <hi>gentlemen</hi> of his
     type. Hearing my 'bus pass the window, I was obliged to rush out of the house without kissing
     Carrie as usual, and I shouted to her: "I leave it to you to decide." On returning in the
     evening, Carrie said she thought as the time was so short she had decided on Broad­stairs, and
     had written to Mrs. Beck, Harbour View Terrace, for apartments.</p>
<p><label>August 1.</label>—Ordered a new pair of trousers at Edwards's, and told them not to
     cut them so loose over the boot; the last pair being so loose and also tight at the knee,
     looked like a sailor's, and I heard Pitt, that objectionable youth at the office, call out
     "Hornpipe" as I passed his desk. Carrie has ordered of Miss Jibbons a pink Garibaldi and
     blue-serge skirt, which I always think looks so pretty at the seaside. In the evening she
     trimmed herself a little sailor-hat, while I read to her the <title>Exchange and Mart</title>.
     We had a good laugh over my trying on the hat when she had finished it; Carrie saying it looked
     so funny with my beard, and how the
     <pb n="81"/> people would have roared if I went on the stage like it.</p>
<p/>
<gap n="pic81" unit="graphic"/>
<p><label>August 2.</label>—Mrs. Beck wrote to say we could have our usual rooms at
     Broad­stairs. That's off our mind. Bought a coloured shirt and a pair of
     <pb n="82"/> tan-coloured boots, which I see many of the swell clerks wearing in the City, and
     I hear are all the "go."</p>
<p><label>August 3.</label>—A beautiful day. Looking forward to to-morrow. Carrie bought a
     parasol about five feet long. I told her it was ridiculous. She said: "Mrs. James, of Sutton,
     has one twice as long;" so the matter dropped. I bought a capital hat for hot weather at the
     seaside. I don't know what it is called, but it is the shape of the helmet worn in India, only
     made of straw. Got three new ties, two coloured handkerchiefs, and a pair of navy-blue socks at
     Pope Brothers. Spent the evening packing. Carrie told me not to forget to borrow Mr.
     Higgsworth's telescope, which he always lends me, knowing I know how to take care of it. Sent
     Sarah out for it. While everything was seeming so bright, the last post brought us a letter
     from Mrs. Beck, saying: "I have just let all my house to one party, and am sorry I must take
     back my words, and am sorry you must find other apartments; but Mrs. Womming, next door, will
     be pleased to accommodate you, but she cannot take you before Monday, as her rooms are engaged
     Bank Holiday week."</p>
