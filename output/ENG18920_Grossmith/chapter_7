<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>Home again. Mrs. James' influence on Carrie. Can get nothing for Lupin. Next-door neighbours
     are a little troublesome. Some one tampers with my diary. Got a place for Lupin. Lupin startles
     us with an announcement.</p>
<p><label>August 22</label>—Home sweet Home again! Carrie bought some pretty blue-wool mats to
     stand vases on. Fripps, Janus and Co. write to say they are sorry they have no vacancy among
     their staff of clerks for Lupin.</p>
<p><label>August 23.</label>—I bought a pair of stags' heads made of plaster-of-Paris and
     coloured brown. They will look just the thing for our little hall, and give it style; the heads
     are excellent imitations. Poolers and Smith are sorry they have nothing to offer Lupin.</p>
<pb n="100"/>
<p><label>August 24.</label>—Simply to please Lupin, and make things cheerful for him, as he is
     a little down, Carrie invited Mrs. James to come up from Sutton and spend two or three days
     with us. We have not said a word to Lupin, but mean to keep it as a surprise.</p>
<gap n="" unit="graphic"/>
<p><label>August 25.</label>—Mrs. James, of Sutton, arrived in the afternoon, bringing with her
     an enormous bunch of wild flowers. The more I see of Mrs. James the nicer I think she is, and
     she is devoted to Carrie. She went into Carrie's room to take off her bonnet, and remained
     there nearly an hour talking about dress. Lupin said he was not a bit surprised at Mrs. James'
      <hi>visit</hi>, but was surprised at <hi>her</hi>.</p>
<p><label>August 26, Sunday.</label>—Nearly late for church, Mrs. James having talked
     considerably about what to
     <pb n="101"/> wear all the morning. Lupin does not seem to get on very well with Mrs. James. I
     am afraid we shall have some trouble with our next-door neighbours who came in last Wednesday.
     Several of their friends, who drive up in dog-carts, have already made themselves
     objectionable.</p>
<p>An evening or two ago I had put on a white waistcoat for coolness, and while walking past
     with my thumbs in my waistcoat pockets (a habit I have), one man, seated in the cart, and
     looking like an American, commenced singing some vulgar nonsense about "<title>I had thirteen
      dollars in my waistcoat pocket</title>." I fancied it was meant for me, and my suspicions were
     confirmed; for while walking round the garden in my tall hat this afternoon, a "throw-down"
     cracker was deliberately aimed at my hat, and exploded on it like a percussion cap. I turned
     sharply, and am positive I saw the man who was in the cart retreating from one of the bedroom
     windows.</p>
<p><label>August 27.</label>—Carrie and Mrs. James went off shopping, and had not returned when
     I came back from the office. Judging from the subsequent conversation, I am afraid Mrs. James
     is filling Carrie's head with a lot of nonsense about dress. I walked
     <pb n="102"/> over to Gowing's, and asked him to drop in to supper, and make things
     pleasant.</p>
<p>Carrie prepared a little extemporised supper, consisting of the remainder of the cold joint,
     a small piece of salmon (which I was to refuse, in case there was not enough to go round), and
     a blanc-mange and custards. There was also a decanter of port and some jam puffs on the
     sideboard. Mrs. James made us play rather a good game with cards, called "Muggins." To my
     surprise, in fact disgust, Lupin got up in the middle, and, in a most sarcastic tone, said:
     "Pardon me, this sort of thing is too fast for me. I shall go and enjoy a quiet game of marbles
     in the back-garden."</p>
<p>Things might have become rather disagreeable but for Gowing (who seems to have taken to
     Lupin) suggesting they should invent games. Lupin said: "Let's play 'monkeys.'" He then led
     Gowing all round the room, and brought him in front of the looking-glass. I must confess I
     laughed heartily at this. I was a little vexed at everybody subsequently laughing at some joke
     which they did not explain, and it was only on going to bed I discovered I must have been
     walking about all the evening with an antimacassar on one button of my coat-tails.</p>
<pb n="103"/>
<p><label>August 28.</label>—Found a large brick in the middle bed of geraniums, evidently come
     from next door. Pattles and Pattles can't find a place for Lupin.</p>
<p><label>August 29.</label>—Mrs. James is making a positive fool of Carrie. Carrie appeared in
     a new dress like a smock-frock. She said "smocking" was all the rage. I replied it put me in a
     rage. She also had on a hat as big as a kitchen coal-scuttle, and the same shape. Mrs. James
     went home, and both Lupin and I were somewhat pleased-the first time we have agreed on a single
     subject since his return. Merkins and Son write they have no vacancy for Lupin.</p>
<p><label>October 30.</label>—I should very much like to know who has wilfully torn the last
     five or six weeks out of my diary. It is perfectly monstrous! Mine is a large scribbling diary,
     with plenty of space for the record of my everyday events, and in keeping up that record I take
     (with much pride) a great deal of pains.</p>
<p>I asked Carrie if she knew anything about it. She replied it was my own fault for leaving the
     diary about with a charwoman cleaning and the sweeps in the house. I said that was not an
     answer
     <pb n="104"/> to my question. This retort of mine, which I thought extremely smart, would have
     been more effective had I not jogged my elbow against a vase on a table temporarily placed in
     the passage, knocked it over, and smashed it.</p>
<p>Carrie was dreadfully upset at this disaster, for it was one of a pair of vases which cannot
     be matched, given to us on our wedding-day by Mrs. Burtsett, an old friend of Carrie's cousins,
     the Pommertons, late of Dalston. I called to Sarah, and asked her about the diary. She said she
     had not been in the sitting-room at all; after the sweep had left, Mrs. Birrell (the charwoman)
     had cleaned the room and lighted the fire herself. Finding a burnt piece of paper in the grate,
     I examined it, and found it was a piece of my diary. So it was evident someone had torn my
     diary to light the fire. I requested Mrs. Birrell to be sent to me to-morrow.</p>
<p><label>October 31.</label>—Received a letter from our principal, Mr. Perkupp, saying that he
     thinks he knows of a place at last for our dear boy Lupin. This, in a measure, consoles me for
     the loss of a portion of my diary; for I am bound to confess the last few weeks have been
     devoted to the record of disappointing
     <pb n="105"/> answers received from people to whom I had applied for appointments for Lupin.
     Mrs. Birrell called, and, in reply to me, said: "She never <hi>see</hi> no book, much less take
     such a liberty as <hi>touch it</hi>."</p>
<p>I said I was determined to find out who did it, whereupon she said she would do her best to
     help me; but she remembered the sweep lighting the fire with a bit of the <title>Echo</title>.
     I requested the sweep to be sent to me to-morrow. I wish Carrie had not given Lupin a
     latch-key; we never seem to see anything of him. I sat up till past one for him, and then
     retired tired.</p>
<p><label>November 1.</label>—My entry yesterday about "retired tired," which I did not notice
     at the time, is rather funny. If I were not so worried just now, I might have had a little joke
     about it. The sweep called, but had the audacity to come up to the hall-door and lean his dirty
     bag of soot on the door-step. He, however, was so polite, I could not rebuke him. He said Sarah
     lighted the fire. Unfortunately, Sarah heard this, for she was dusting the banisters, and she
     ran down, and flew into a temper with the sweep, causing a row on the front door-steps, which I
     would not have had happen for anything. I ordered her about her business, and told the sweep I
     was
     <pb n="106"/> sorry to have troubled him; and so I was, for the door-steps were covered with
     soot in consequence of his visit. I would willingly give ten shillings to find out who tore my
     diary.</p>
<p><label>November 2.</label>—I spent the evening quietly with Carrie, of whose company I never
     tire. We had a most pleasant chat about the letters on "Is Marriage a Failure?" It has been no
     failure in our case. In talking over our own happy experiences, we never noticed that it was
     past midnight. We were startled by hearing the door slam violently. Lupin had come in. He made
     no attempt to turn down the gas in the passage, or even to look into the room where we were,
     but went straight up to bed, making a terrible noise. I asked him to come down for a moment,
     and he begged to be excused, as he was "dead beat," an observation that was scarcely consistent
     with the fact that, for a quarter of an hour afterwards, he was positively dancing in his room,
     and shouting out, "See me dance the polka!" or some such nonsense.</p>
<gap n="" unit="graphic"/>
<p><label>November 3.</label>—Good news at last. Mr. Perkupp has got an appointment for Lupin,
     and he is to go and see about it on Monday. Oh, how
     <pb n="107"/> my mind is relieved! I went to Lupin's room to take the good news to him, but he
     was in bed, very seedy, so I resolved to keep it over till the evening.</p>
<p>He said he had last night been elected a member of an Amateur Dramatic Club, called the
     "Holloway Comedians"; and, though it was a pleasant evening, he had sat in a draught, and got
     neuralgia in the head. He declined have any breakfast, so I left him.</p>
<p>In the evening I had up a special bottle of port, and, Lupin being in for a wonder, we filled
     our glasses, and I said: "Lupin my boy, I have some good and unexpected news for you. Mr.
     Perkupp has procured you an appointment!"
     <pb n="108"/> Lupin said: "Good biz!" and we drained our glasses.</p>
<p>Lupin then said: "Fill up the glasses again, for I have some good and unexpected news for
     you."</p>
<p>I had some slight misgivings, and so evidently had Carrie, for she said: "I hope we shall
     think it good news."</p>
<p>Lupin said: "Oh, it's all right! <hi>I'm engaged to be married!</hi>"</p>
