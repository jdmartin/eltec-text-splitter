<head>CHAPTER NINETEEN</head>
<p>Dodo slept long and dreamlessly that night; the deep, dreamless sleep which an
      evenly-balanced fatigue of body and mind so often produces, though we get into bed feeling
      that our brain is too deep in some tangle of unsolved thought to be able to extricate itself,
      and fall into the dim immensity of sleep. The waking from such a sleep is not so pleasant. The
      first moment of conscious thought sometimes throws the whole burden again on to our brain with
      a sudden start of pain that is almost physical. There is no transition. We were asleep and we
      are awake, and we find that sleep has brought us only a doubtful gift, for with our renewed
      strength of body has come the capability of keener suffering. When we are tired, mental
      distress is only a dull ache, but in the hard, convincing morning it strikes a deadlier and
      deeper pain. But sometimes Nature is more merciful. She opens the sluices of our brain
      quietly, and, though the water still rushes in turbidly and roughly, yet the fact that our
      brain fills by degrees makes us more able to bear the full weight, than when it comes suddenly
      with a wrenching and, perhaps, a rending of our mental machinery.</p>
<p>It was in this way that Dodo woke. The trouble of the day came to her gradually during the
      moments of waking. She dreamed she was waiting for Jack in the garden where she had been
      sitting the night before. It was perfectly dark, and she could not see him coming, but she
      heard a step along the gravel path, and started up with a vague alarm, for it did not sound
      like his. Then a greyness, as of dawn, began to steal over the night, and she saw the outline
      of the trees against the sky, and the outline of a man's figure near her, and it was a figure
      she knew well, but it was not Jack. On this dream the sense of waking was pure relief; it was
      broad day, and her maid was standing by her and saying that it was a quarter past nine.</p>
<p>Dodo lay still a few moments longer, feeling a vague joy that her dream was not true, that
      the helplessness of that grey moment, when she saw that it was not Jack, was passed, that she
      was awake again, and unfettered, save by thoughts which could be consciously checked and
      stifled. It was with a vast sense of satisfaction that she remembered her last act on the
      evening before, of which the scattered fragments in the grate afforded ocular proof. She felt
      as if she had broken a visible, tangible fetter—one strand, at any rate, of the cord that
      hound her was lying broken before her eyes. If she had been quite securely tied she could not
      have done that..—</p>
<p>The sense of successful effort, with a visible result, gave her a sudden feeling of power to
      do more; the absence of bodily fatigue, and the presence of superfluous physical health, all
      seemed part of a different order of things to that of the night before. She got up and dressed
      quickly, feeling more like her own self than she had done for several days. The destruction of
      his photograph was really a great achievement. She had no idea how far things had gone till
      she felt the full effect of conscious effort and its result. She could see now exactly where
      she had stood on the evening before, very unpleasantly close to the edge of a nasty place,
      slippery and steep. Anyhow, she was one step nearer that pleasant, green-looking spot at the
      top of the slope—a quiet, pretty place, not particularly extensive, but very pleasing, and
      very safe.</p>
<p>The three others were half-way through breakfast when Dodo came down. Lady Grantham was
      feeling a little bored. Dodo flung open the door and came marching in, whistling "See the
      Conquering Hero comes."</p>
<p>"That's by Handel, you know, Edith," she said. "Handel is very healthy, and he never bothers
      you with abstruse questions in the scandalous way that Wagner does. I'm going to have a
      barrel-organ made with twelve tunes by Handel, you only have to turn the handle and out he
      comes. I don't mean that for a pun. Your blood be on your own head if you notice it. I shall
      have my barrel-organ put on the box of my victoria, and the footman shall play tunes all the
      time I'm driving, and I shall hold out my hat and ask for pennies. Some of Jack's tenants in
      Ireland have refused to pay their rents this year, and he says we'll have to cut off coffee
      after dinner if it goes on. But we shall be able to have coffee after all with the pennies I
      collect. I talked so much sense last night that I don't mean to make another coherent remark
      this week."</p>
<p>Dodo went to the sideboard and cut a large slice of ham, which she carried back to her place
      on the end of her fork.</p>
<p>"I'm going for a ride this morning, Edith, if you've got a horse for me," she said. "I
      haven't ridden for weeks. I suppose you can give me something with four legs. Oh, I want to
      take a big fence again."</p>
<p>Dodo waved her fork triumphantly, and the slice of ham flew into the milk-jug. She became
      suddenly serious, and fished for it with the empty fork.</p>
<p>"The deep waters have drowned it," she remarked, "and it will be totally uneatable for
      evermore. Make it into ham-sandwiches and send it to the workhouse, Edith. <hi>Jambon au
       lait</hi>. I'm sure it would be very supporting."</p>
<p>"It's unlucky to spill things, isn't it?" Dodo went on. "I suppose it means I shall die, and
      shall go, we hope, to heaven, at the age of twenty-seven. I'm twenty-nine really. I don't look
      it, do I, Lady Grantham? How old are you, Edith? You're twenty-nine too, aren't you? We're two
      twin dewdrops, you and I; you can be the dewdrops, and I'll be the twin. I suppose if two
      babies are twins, each of them is a twin. Twin sounds like a sort of calico. Two yards of
      twin, please, miss. There was a horrid fat man in the carriage across France, who called me
      miss. Jack behaved abominably. He called me miss, too, and wore the broadest grin on his silly
      face all the time. He really is a perfect baby, and I'm another, and how we shall keep house
      together I can't think. It'll be like a sort of game."</p>
<p>Dodo was eating her breakfast with an immense appetite and alarming rapidity, and she had
      finished as soon as the others.</p>
<p>"I want to smoke this instant minute," she said, going to the door as soon as she had eaten
      all she wanted. "Where do you keep your cigarettes, Edith? Oh, how you startled me!"</p>
<p>As she opened the door two large collies came bouncing in, panting from sheer
      excitement.</p>
<p>"Oh, you sweet animals," said Dodo, sitting down on the floor and going off at another
      tangent. "Come here and talk at once. Edith, may I give them the milky ham? Here you are;
      drink the milk first, and then eat the ham, and then say grace, and then you may get
      down."</p>
<p>Dodo poured the milk into two clean saucers, and set them on the floor. There were a few
      drops left at the bottom of the jug, and she made a neat little pool on the head of each of
      the dogs.</p>
<p>"What are their names?" she asked. "They ought to be Tweedledum and Tweedledee, or Huz and
      Buz, or Ananias and Sapphira, or Darby and Joan, or Harris and Ainsworth. It ought to be
      Harris and Ainsworth. I'm sure, no one man could have written all that rot himself. Little
      Spencer is very fond of Harrison Ainsworth; he said it was instructive as well as palatable. I
      don't want to be instructed, and it isn't palatable. I hate having little bits of information
      wrapped up and given to me to swallow, like a powder in jam. Did you have to take powders when
      you were little, Lady Grantham?"</p>
<p>Dodo's questions were purely rhetorical; they required no answer, and she did not expect
      one.</p>
<p>"It is much nicer being completely ignorant and foolish like me," she said. "Nobody ever
      expects me to know anything, or to be instructive on any subject under the sun. Jack and I are
      going to be a simple little couple, who are very nice and not at all wise. Nobody dislikes one
      if one never pretends to be wise. But I like people to have a large number of theories on
      every subject. Everyone is bound to form conclusions, but what I dislike are people who have
      got good grounds for their conclusions, who knock you slap down with statistics, if you try to
      argue with them. It's impossible to argue with anyone who has reasons for what he says,
      because you get to know sooner or later, and then the argument is over. Arguments ought to be
      like Epic poems, they leave off, they don't come to an end."</p>
<p>Dodo delivered herself of these surprising statements with great rapidity, and left the room
      to get her cigarettes. She left the door wide open, and in a minute or two her voice was heard
      from the drawing-room, screaming to Edith.</p>
<p>"Edith, here's the 'Dodo Symphony'; come and play it to me this moment."</p>
<p>"There's not much wrong with her this morning," thought Edith, as she went to the
      drawing-room, where Dodo was playing snatches of dance music.</p>
<p>"Play the scherzo, Edith," commanded Dodo. "Here you are. Now, quicker, quicker, rattle it
      out; make it buzz."</p>
<p>"Oh, I remember your playing that so well," said Dodo, as Edith finished. "It was that
      morning at Winston when you insisted on going shooting. You shot rather well, too, if I
      remember right."</p>
<p>Lady Grantham had followed Edith, and sat down, with her atmosphere of impenetrable leisure,
      near the piano.</p>
<p>Dodo made her feel uncomfortably old. She felt Dodo's extravagantly high spirits were a sort
      of milestone to show, how far she herself had travelled from youth. It was impossible to
      conceive of Dodo ever getting middle-aged or elderly. She had racked her brains in vain to try
      to think of any woman of her own age who could possibly ever have been as insolently young as
      Dodo. She had the habit, as I have mentioned before, of making strangely direct remarks, and
      she turned to Dodo and said:—</p>
<p>"I should so like to see you ten years hence. I wonder if people like you ever grow
      old."</p>
<p>"I shall never grow old," declared Dodo confidently. "Something, I feel sure, will happen to
      prevent that. I shall stop young till I go out like a candle, or am carried off in a whirlwind
      or something. I couldn't be old; it isn't in me. I shall go on talking nonsense till the end
      of my life, and I can't talk nonsense if I have to sit by the fire and keep a shawl over my
      mouth, which I shall have to do if I get old. Wherefore I never shall. It's a great relief to
      be certain of that. I used to bother my head about it at one time! and it suddenly flashed
      upon me, about ten days ago, that I needn't bother about it any more, as I never should be
      old."</p>
<p>"Would you dislike having to be serious very much?" asked Edith.</p>
<p>"It isn't that I should dislike it," said Dodo; "I simply am incapable of it. I was serious
      last night for at least an hour, and a feverish reaction has set in. I couldn't be serious for
      a week together, if I was going to be beheaded the next moment, all the time. I daresay it
      would be very nice to be serious, just as I'm sure it would be very nice to live at the bottom
      of the sea and pull the fishes' tails, but it isn't possible."</p>
<p>Dodo had quite forgotten that she had intended to go for a ride, and she went into the
      garden with Nora, and played ducks and drakes on the pond, and punted herself about, and
      gathered water-lilies. Then she was seized with an irresistible desire to fish, and caught a
      large pike, which refused to be killed, and Dodo had to fetch the gardener to slay it. She
      then talked an astonishing amount of perfect nonsense, and thought that it must be lunch-time.
      Accordingly, she went back to the house, and was found by Edith, a quarter of an hour later,
      playing hide-and-seek with the coachman's children, whom she had lured in from the stable-yard
      as she went by. The rules were that the searchers were to catch the hiders, and Dodo had
      entrenched herself behind the piano, and erected an impregnable barricade, consisting of a
      revolving bookcase and the music-stool. The two seekers entirely declined to consider that she
      had won, and Dodo, with a show of reason, was telling them that they hadn't caught her yet at
      any rate. The situation seemed to admit of no compromise and no solution, unless, as Dodo
      suggested, they got a pound or two of blasting powder and destroyed her defences. However, a
       <hi>deus ex machina</hi> appeared in the person of the coachman himself, who had come in for
      orders, and hinted darkly that maternal vengeance was brewing if certain persons did not wash
      their hands in time for dinner, which was imminent.</p>
<p>"There's a telegram for you somewhere," said Edith to Dodo, as she emerged hot and
      victorious. "I sent a man out into the garden with it. The messenger is waiting for an
      answer."</p>
<p>Dodo became suddenly grave.</p>
<p>"I suppose he's gone to the pond," she said; "that's where I was seen last. I'll go and get
      it."</p>
<p>She met the man walking back to the house, having looked for her in vain. She took the
      telegram and opened it. It had been forwarded from her London house. It was very short.</p>
<quote>
<l>"I arrive in London to-day. May I call?</l>
<l> —"WALDENECH." </l></quote>
<p>Dodo experienced, in epitome at that moment, all she had gone through the night before. She
      went to a garden-seat, and remained there in silence so long that the footman asked her: "Will
      there be an answer, my lady? The messenger is waiting."</p>
<p>Dodo held out her hand for the telegraph form. She addressed it to the caretaker at her
      London house. It also was very short:</p>
<p>"Address uncertain; I leave here to-day. Forward nothing."</p>
<p>She handed it to the man, and gave orders that it should go at once.</p>
<p>Dodo did not move. She sat still with her hands clasped in front of her, unconscious of
      active thought, only knowing that a stream of pictures seemed to pass before her eyes. She saw
      the Prince standing on her doorstep, learning with surprise that Lady Chesterford was not at
      home, and that her address was not known. She saw him turn away, baffled but not beaten; she
      saw him remaining in London day after day, waiting for the house in Eaton Square to show some
      signs of life. She saw—ah, she dismissed that picture quickly.</p>
<p>She had one sudden impulse to call back the footman and ask for another telegraph form; but
      she felt if she could only keep a firm hand on herself for a few moments, the worst would be
      passed; and it was with a sense of overwhelming relief that she saw the telegraph boy walk off
      down the drive with the reply in his hand.</p>
<p>Then it suddenly struck her that the Prince was waiting for the answer at Dover Station.</p>
<p>"How savage he will be," thought Dodo. "There will be murder at the telegraph office if he
      waits for his answer there. Well, somebody must suffer, and it will be the telegraph
      boys."</p>
<p>The idea of the Prince waiting at Dover was distinctly amusing, and Dodo found a broad smile
      to bestow on the thought before she continued examining the state of her feelings and
      position. The Prince's influence over her she felt was local and personal, so to speak, and
      now she had made her decision, she was surprised at the ease with which it had been made. Had
      he been there in person, with his courtly presence and his serene remoteness from anything
      ordinary, and had said, in that smooth, well-modulated, voice, "May I hope to find you in
      to-morrow?" Dodo felt that she would have said "Come." Her pride was in frantic rebellion at
      these admissions; even the telegram she had sent was a confession of weakness. She would not
      see him, because she was afraid. Was there any other reason? she asked herself. Yes; she could
      not see him because she longed to see him.</p>
<p>"Has it come to that?" she thought, as she crumpled up the telegram which had fluttered down
      from her lap on to the grass. Dodo felt she was quite unnecessarily honest with herself in
      making this admission. But what followed? Nothing followed. She was going to marry Jack, and
      be remarkably happy, and Prince Waldenech should come and stay with them because she liked him
      very much, and she would be delightfully kind to him, and Jack should like him too. Dear old
      Jack, she would write him a line this minute, saying when she would be back in London.</p>
<p>Dodo felt a sudden spasm of anger against the Prince. What right had he to behave like this?
      He was making it very hard for her, and he would get nothing by it. Her decision was
      irrevocable; she would not see him again, for some time at any rate. She would get over this
      ridiculous fear of him. What was he that other men were not? What was the position, after all?
      He had wanted to marry her; she had refused him because she was engaged to Jack. If there had
      been no Jack—well, there was a Jack, so it was unnecessary to pursue that any further. He had
      given her his photograph, and had said several things that he should not have said. Dodo
      thought of that scene with regret. She had had an opportunity which she had missed; she might
      easily have made it plain to him that his murmured speeches went beyond mere courtesy. Instead
      of that she had said she would always regard him as a great friend, and hoped he would see her
      often. She tapped the ground impatiently as she thought of missed opportunities. It was
      stupid, inconceivably stupid of her. Then he had followed her to England, and sent this
      telegram. She did not feel safe. She longed, and dreaded to see him again. It was too absurd
      that she should have to play this gigantic game of hide-and-seek. "I shall have to put on a
      blue veil and green goggles when I go back to London," thought Dodo. "Well, the seekers have
      to catch the hiders, and he hasn't caught me yet."</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Prince was smoking a cigar at Dover Station. The telegram had not come, though
      he had waited an hour, and he had settled to give it another half-hour and then go on to
      London. He was not at all angry; it was as good as a game of chess. The Prince was very fond
      of chess. He enjoyed exercising a calculating long-sightedness, and he felt that the
      Marchioness of Chesterford elect was a problem that enabled him to exercise this faculty, of
      which he had plenty, to the full.</p>
<p>He had a sublime sense of certainty as to what he was going to do. He fully intended to
      marry Dodo, and he admitted no obstacles. She was engaged to Jack, was she? So much the worse
      for Jack. She wished to marry Jack, did she? So much the worse for her, and none the worse,
      possibly the better, for him. As it was quite certain that he himself was going to marry Dodo,
      these little hitches were entertaining than otherwise. It is more fun to catch your salmon
      after a quarter of an hour's rather exciting fight with him than to net him. Half the joy of a
      possession lies in the act of acquisition, and the pleasure of acquisition consists, at least
      in half of the excitement attendant on it. To say that the Prince ever regarded anyone's
      feelings would be understating the truth. The fact that his will worked its way in opposition
      to, and at the expense of others, afforded him a distinct and appreciable pleasure. If he
      wanted anything he went straight for it, and regarded neither man, nor devil, nor angel; and
      he wanted Dodo.</p>
<p>His mind, then, was thoroughly made up. She seemed to him immensely original and very
      complete. He read her, he thought, like a book, and the book was very interesting reading. His
      sending of the telegram with "Reply paid," was a positive stroke of genius. Dodo had told him
      that she was going straight to London, but, as we have seen, she did not stop the night there,
      but went straight on to Edith's home in Berkshire. There were two courses open to her; either
      to reply "Yes" or "No" to the telegram, or to leave it unanswered. If she left it "unanswered"
      it would delight him above measure, and it seemed that his wishes were to be realised. Not
      answering the telegram would imply that she did not think good to see him, and he judged that
      this decision was probably prompted by something deeper than mere indifference to his company.
      It must be dictated by a strong motive. His calculations were a little at fault, because Dodo
      had not stopped in London, but this made no difference, as events had turned out, to the
      correctness of his deductions.</p>
<p>He very much wished Dodo to be influenced by strong motives in her dealings with him. He
      would not have accepted, even as a gift, the real, quiet liking she had for Jack. Real, quiet
      likings seemed to him to be as dull as total indifference. He would not have objected to her
      regarding him with violent loathing, that would be something to correct; and his experience in
      such affairs was that strong sympathies and antipathies were more akin to each other than
      quiet affection or an apathetic indifference were to either. He walked up and down the
      platform with the smile of a man who is waiting for an interesting situation in a theatrical
      representation to develop itself. He had no wish to hurry it. The by-play seemed to him to be
      very suitable, and he bought a morning paper. He glanced through the leaders, and turned to
      the small society paragraphs. The first that struck his eye was this: "The Marchioness of
      Chesterford arrived in London yesterday afternoon from the Continent."</p>
<p>He felt it was the most orthodox way of bringing the scene to its climax. Enter a newsboy,
      who hands paper to Prince, and exit. Prince unfolds paper and reads the news of—well, of what
      he is expecting.</p>
<p>He snipped the paragraph neatly out from the paper, and put it in his card-case. His valet
      was standing by the telegraph office, waiting for the message. The Prince beckoned to him.</p>
<p>"There will be no telegram," he said. "We leave by the next train."</p>
<p>The Prince had a carriage reserved for him, and he stepped in with a sense of great
      satisfaction. He even went so far as to touch his hat in response to the obeisances of the
      obsequious guard, and told his valet to see that the man got something. He soon determined on
      his next move—a decided "check," and rather an awkward one; and for the rest of his journey he
      amused himself by looking out of the window, and admiring the efficient English farming. All
      the arrangements seemed to him to be very solid and adequate. The hedges were charming. The
      cart horses were models of sturdy strength, and the hop harvest promised to be very fine. He
      was surprised when they drew near London. The journey had been shorter than he expected.</p>
<p>He gave a few directions to his valet about luggage, and drove off to Eaton Square.</p>
<p>The door was opened by an impenetrable caretaker.</p>
<p>"Is Lady Chesterford in?" asked the Prince.</p>
<p>"Her ladyship is not in London, sir," replied the man.</p>
<p>The Prince smiled. Dodo was evidently acting up to her refusal to answer his telegram.</p>
<p>"Ah, just so," he remarked. "Please take this to her, and say I am waiting."</p>
<p>He drew from his pocket a card, and the cutting from the <hi>Morning Post</hi>.</p>
<p>"Her ladyship is not in London," the man repeated.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you would let me have her address," said the Prince, feeling in his pockets.</p>
<p>"A telegram has come to-day, saying that her ladyship's address is uncertain," replied the
      caretaker.</p>
<p>"Would you be so good as to let me see the telegram?"</p>
<p>Certainly, he would fetch it.</p>
<p>The Prince waited serenely. Everything was going admirably.</p>
<p>The telegram was fetched. It had been handed in at Wokingham station at a quarter to one.
      "After she had received my telegram," reflected the Prince.</p>
<p>"Do you know with whom she has been staying?" he asked blandly.</p>
<p>"With Miss Staines."</p>
<p>The Prince was very much obliged. He left a large gratuity in the man's hand, and wished him
      good afternoon.</p>
<p>He drove straight to his house, and sent for his valet, whom he could trust implicitly, and
      who had often been employed on somewhat delicate affairs.</p>
<p>"Take the first train for Wokingham to-morrow morning," he said. "Find out where a Miss
      Staines lives. Inquire whether Lady Chesterford left the house to-day."</p>
<p>"Yes, your Highness."</p>
<p>"And hold your tongue about the whole business," said the Prince negligently, turning away
      and lighting a cigar. "And send me a telegram from Wokingham: 'Left yesterday,' or 'Still
      here.'"</p>
<p>The Prince was sitting over a late breakfast on the following morning, when a telegram was
      brought in. He read it, and his eyes twinkled with genuine amusement.</p>
<p>"I think," he said to himself, "I think that's rather neat."</p>
