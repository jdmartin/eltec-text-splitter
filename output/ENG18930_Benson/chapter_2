<head>CHAPTER TWO</head>
<p>Jack went home meditating rather bitterly on things in general. He had a sense that Fate was
      not behaving very prettily to him. She had dealt him rather a severe blow in April last, which
      had knocked him down, and, having knocked him down, she now proceeded in a most
      unsportsmanlike way to kick him. Jack had a great idea of fair play, and Fate certainly was
      not playing fair. He would have liked to have a few words with her on the subject. The world
      had been very kind on the whole to him. He had always been popular, and his life, though
      perhaps rather aimless, was at least enjoyable. And since the world had been kind to him, he
      was generous to the world in general, and to his friends in particular. It had always held a
      high opinion of him, as a thoroughly healthy-minded and pleasant companion, and he was
      disposed to hold a similar opinion of it. Consequently, when Dodo had refused him that spring,
      he had not thought badly of her. He did not blame her, or get bitter about it; but though he
      had flattered himself that he was used to Dodo's ways, and had always recognised her
      capabilities in the way of surprising her friends, he had not been quite prepared for the news
      of her engagement. In fact, he was surprised, and also rather resentful, chiefly against the
      general management of mundane affairs, but partly also against Dodo herself. Dodo had not told
      him of her engagement; he had been left to find it out for himself. Then, again, she was
      engaged to a man who was hopelessly and entirely in love with her, and for whom, apart from a
      quiet, unemotional liking, she did not care two straws, except in so far as he was immensely
      rich and had a title, two golden keys which unlocked the most secret doors of that
      well-furnished apartment known as Society, which constituted Dodo's world. Hitherto her
      position had been precarious: she had felt that she was on trial. Her personality, her great
      attractiveness and talents, had secured for herself a certain footing on the very daïs of that
      room; but she had always known that unless she married brilliantly she would not be sure of
      her position. If she married a man who would not be always certain of commanding whatever
      money and position—for she would never have married a wealthy brewer—could command, or, worst
      of all, if in her unwillingness to accept anything but the best she could get, she did not
      marry at all, Dodo knew that she never would have that unquestioned position that she felt was
      indispensable to her. Jack knew all this perfectly well—in fact Dodo had referred to it that
      morning—and he accepted it philosophically as being inevitable. But what he did not like was
      being told that he would not have done on general grounds, that he was too fond of his own
      way, that he would not have given Dodo rein enough. He had known Dodo too long and too well,
      when he proposed to her, to have any of a lover's traditional blindness to the faults of his
      love. He knew that she was, above all things, strongly dramatic, that she moved with a view to
      effect, that she was unscrupulous in what she did, that her behaviour was sometimes in
      questionable taste; but this he swallowed whole, so to speak. He was genuinely attached to
      her, and felt that she possessed the qualities that he would most like to have in his wife.
      Bertie had said to him that morning that she was stimulating, and would not wear well.
      Stimulating she certainly was—what lovable woman is not?—and personally he had known her long,
      and she did wear well. The hidden depths and unsuspected shallows were exactly what he loved
      her for; no one ever fell in love with a canal; and though the shallows were commoner than the
      depths, and their presence was sometimes indicated by a rather harsh jarring of the keel, yet
      he believed, fully and sincerely, in the dark, mysterious depths for love to lose itself in.
      Besides, a wife, whose actions and thoughts were as perfectly calculable and as accurately
      calculated as the trains in a Bradshaw, was possessed of sterling qualities which, however
      estimable, were more suited to a housekeeper than a mistress.</p>
<p>These reflections were the outcome of an intimate knowledge of Dodo in the mind of a man who
      was in the habit of being honest with himself and the object of his love, a quality rare
      enough whether the lover is rejected or accepted.</p>
<p>He had had time to think over the matter quietly to himself. He knew, and had known for many
      weeks, that Dodo was out of his reach, and he sat down and thought about the inaccessible
      fruit, not with the keen feelings of one who still hoped to get it, but with a resignation
      which recognised that the fruit was desirable, but that it must be regarded from a purely
      speculative point of view.</p>
<p>And to do him justice, though he was very sorry for himself, he was much more sorry for
      Chesterford. Chesterford was his cousin, they had been brought up together at Eton and Oxford,
      and he knew him with that intimacy which is the result of years alone.</p>
<p>Chesterford's old friends had all a great respect and liking for him. As Dodo had said, "He
      was an honest man if you like." Slight acquaintances called him slow and rather stupid, which
      was true on purely intellectual grounds. He was very loyal, and very much devoted to what he
      considered his duty, which consisted in being an excellent landlord and J.P. of his county, in
      voting steadily for the Conservative party in the House of Lords, in giving largely and
      anonymously to good objects, in going to Church on Sunday morning, where he sang hymns with
      fervour, and read lessons with respect, in managing a hunt in a liberal and satisfactory
      manner, and in avoiding any introspection or speculation about problems of life and being. He
      walked through the world with an upright gait, without turning his eyes or his steps to the
      right hand or the left, without ever concerning himself with what was not his business, but
      directing all his undoubtedly sterling qualities to that. He had a perfect genius for doing
      his duty. Nobody had ever called him shallow or foolish, but nobody on the other hand had
      ever, called him either deep or clever. He had probably only made one real mistake in his
      life, and that was when he asked Dodo to marry him; and we have seen that Jack, who knew Dodo
      well, and whose opinion might be considered to be based on good grounds, thought that Dodo had
      committed her first grand error in accepting him. The worst of the business certainly was that
      he was in love with Dodo. If he had been a different sort of man, if he had proposed to Dodo
      with the same idea that Dodo had, when she accepted him, if he had wanted a brilliant and
      fascinating woman to walk through life with, who could not fail to be popular, end who would
      do the duties of a mistress of a great house in a regal fashion, he could not have chosen
      better. But what he wanted in a wife was someone to love. He loved Dodo, and apparently it had
      not entered his calculations that she, in accepting him, might be doing it from a different
      standpoint from his own in proposing to her. Dodo had smiled on him with the air of a
      benignant goddess who marries a mortal, when he offered her his hand and heart, and he had
      taken that smile as a fulfilment of his own thought. Decidedly Jack might have justification
      for feeling apprehensive.</p>
<p>Jack's only hope lay in that vein which did exist in Dodo, and which she had manifested in
      that outburst of tears the night before. He put it down to her dramatic instincts to a large
      extent, but he knew there was something besides, for Dodo did not care to play to an empty
      house, and the presence of her future husband alone constituted anything but a satisfactory
      audience. Jack had always had a considerable belief in Dodo: her attractiveness and cleverness
      were, of course, beyond dispute, and required proof no more than the fact that the sun rose in
      the morning; but he believed in something deeper than this, which prompted such actions as
      these. He felt that there was some emotion that she experienced at that moment, of which her
      tears were the legitimate outcome, and, as he thought of this, there occurred to him the
      remark that Dodo had made that morning, when she expressed her regret at never having felt the
      sort of love that she knew Chesterford felt for her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vane was perhaps perfectly happy that night. Was not her daughter engaged to a marquis
      and a millionaire? Was not her house going to be filled with the brightest and best of our
      land? She had often felt rather resentful against Dodo, who alternately liked and despised
      people whom Mrs. Vane would have given her right hand to be in a position to like, and both
      hands to be in a position to despise. Dodo was excellent friends with "London," only "London"
      did not come and seek her at her own house, but preferred asking her to theirs. Consequently,
      on Mrs. Vane and Maud devolved the comparatively menial duty of leaving their cards and those
      of Dodo, and attending her in the capacity of the necessary adjunct. They would be asked to
      the same houses as Dodo, but that was all; when they got there they had the privilege of
      seeing Dodo performing her brilliant evolutions, but somehow none of Dodo's glory got
      reflected on to them. To be the mirror of Dodo was one of Mrs. Vane's most cherished ideas,
      and she did not recollect that there are many substances whose nature forbids their acting as
      such to the most brilliant of illuminations. Mr. Vane was kept still more in the background.
      It was generally supposed that he was looking after his affairs in the country, whilst the
      rest of the family were amusing themselves in London. It was well known that he was the
      proprietor of a flourishing iron foundry somewhere in Lancashire, and apparently the iron
      needed special care during the months of May, June and July. In any case he was a shadow in
      the background, rather than a skeleton at the banquet, whom it was not necessary to ignore,
      because he never appeared in a position in which he could be ignored. Mrs. Vane had two
      principal objects in life, the first of which was to live up to Dodo, and the second to
      obtain, in course of time, a suitable brilliant son-in-law. The latter of these objects had
      been practically obtained by Dodo herself, and the first of them was in a measure realised by
      the large and brilliant company who assembled in her rooms that night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vane was a large, high-coloured woman of about middle age, whose dress seemed to
      indicate that she would rather not, but that, of course, may only have been the fault of the
      dressmaker. She had an effusive manner, which sometimes made her guests wonder what they could
      have done to have made her so particularly glad to see them. She constantly lamented Mr.
      Vane's absence from London, and remarked, with a brilliant smile, that she felt quite
      deserted. Mrs. Vane's smile always suggested a reformed vampire, who had permanently renounced
      her bloodthirsty habits, but had not quite got out of the way of gloating on what would have
      been her victims in the unregenerate days. It is only fair to say that this impression was due
      to the immensity of her smile, which could hardly be honestly accounted for by this
      uncharitable world. She was busily employed in receiving her guests when Jack came, and was,
      perhaps, more stupendously cordial than ever.</p>
<p>"So kind of you to come," she was just saying to a previous arrival when Jack came in. "I
      know Dodo was dying to see you and be congratulated. Darling," she said, turning to Maud, "run
      and tell Dodo that Lord Burwell has arrived. So good of you to come. And how do you do, dear
      Mr. Broxton? Of course Dodo has told you of our happiness. Thanks, yes—we are all charmed with
      her engagement. And the Marquis is your cousin, is he not? How nice! May I tell Maud she may
      call you Cousin Jack? <hi>Such</hi> pleasure to have you. Dodo is simply expiring to see you.
      Did she see you this morning? Really! she never told me of it, and my sweet child usually
      tells me everything."</p>
<p>Dodo was playing the amiable white elephant to some purpose. She was standing under a large
      chandelier in the centre of the room, with Chesterford beside her, receiving congratulations
      with the utmost grace, and talking nonsense at the highest possible speed. Jack thought to
      himself that he had never seen anyone so thoroughly charming and brilliant, and almost
      wondered whether he had not been doing her an injustice all day. He saw it was impossible to
      get near her for the present, so he wandered off among other groups, exchanging greetings and
      salutations. He had made the circuit of the room, and was standing about near the door,
      feeling a little lonely, when Dodo came quickly towards him. She was looking rather white and
      impatient.</p>
<p>"Come away out of this, Jack," she said; "this is horrible. We've done our duty, and now I
      want to talk. I've been smiling and grinning till my cheeks are nearly cracked, and everyone
      says exactly the same thing. Come to my room—come." She turned round, beckoning to him, and
      found herself face to face with Chesterford. "Dear old boy," she said to him, "I'm not going
      to bore you any more to-night. I shall bore you enough after we are married. Jack and I are
      going away to talk, and he's going to tell me to be a good girl, and do as his cousin bids me.
      Good-night; come again to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>"I came here on purpose to congratulate you," said Jack, grasping Chesterford's hand, "and I
      wish you all joy and prosperity."</p>
<p>"Come, Jack," said Dodo. "Oh, by the way, Chesterford, ask Jack to be your best man. You
      couldn't have a better, and you haven't got any brother, you know."</p>
<p>"I was just going to," said Chesterford. "Jack, you will be, won't you? You must."</p>
<p>"Of course I will," said Jack. "All the same we're all awfully jealous of you, you know, for
      carrying Dodo off."</p>
<p>"So you ought to be," said he, enthusiastically. "Why, I'm almost jealous of myself. But now
      go and talk to Dodo, if she wants you."</p>
<p>The sight of Chesterford with Dodo made Jack groan in spirit. He had accepted Dodo's
      rejection of him as quite final, and he never intended to open that closed book again. But
      this was too horrible. He felt a genuine impulse of pure compassion for Chesterford, and an
      irritated disgust for Dodo. Dodo was an admirable comrade, and, for some, he thought, an
      admirable wife. But the idea of her in comradeship with Chesterford was too absurd, and if she
      could never be his comrade, by what perversity of fate was it that she was going to become his
      wife? Jack's serenity was quite gone, and he wondered what had become of it. All he was
      conscious of was a chafing refusal to acquiesce just yet, and the anticipation of a somewhat
      intimate talk with Dodo. He felt half inclined to run away from the house, and not see her
      again, and as he followed her up to her room, he began to think that his wisdom had followed
      his serenity. After all, if he asked her again about her resolution to marry Chesterford, what
      was he doing but continuing the conversation they had in the Park that morning, in which Dodo
      herself had taken the initiative. "These things are on the knees of the gods," thought Jack to
      himself piously, as the door of Dodo's room closed behind him. Dodo threw herself down in a
      low arm-chair with an air of weariness.</p>
<p>"Go on talking to me, Jack," she said. "Interest me, soothe me, make me angry if you like.
      Chesterford's very nice. Don't you like him immensely? I do."</p>
<p>Jack fidgeted, lit a match and blew it out again. Really it was not his fault that the
      conversation was going to be on this subject. He again laid the responsibility on the knees of
      the gods. Then he said,—</p>
<p>"Dodo, is this irrevocable? Are you determined to marry this man? I swear I don't ask you
      for any selfish reasons, but only because I am sincerely anxious for your happiness and his.
      It is a confounded liberty I am taking, but I sha'n't apologise for it. I know that it isn't
      any business of mine, but I risk your displeasure."</p>
<p>Dodo was looking at him steadily. Her breath came rather quickly, and the look of weariness
      had left her face.</p>
<p>"Jack," she said, "don't say this sort of thing to me again. You are quite right, it is a
      confounded liberty, as you say. I shall do as I please in this matter. Ah, Jack, don't be
      angry with me," she went on as he shrugged his shoulders, and half turned away. "I know you
      are sincere, but I must do it. I want to be safe. I want to be married. Chesterford is very
      safe. Jack, old boy, don't make me quarrel with you. You are the best friend I have, but I'm
      sure you're wrong about this."</p>
<p>She rose and stood by him, and laid one hand on his as it lay on the mantelpiece. He did not
      answer her. He was disappointed and baffled. Then she turned away from him, and suddenly threw
      up her arms.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God," she said, "I don't know what to do. It isn't my fault that I am made like
      this. I want to know what love is, but I can't—I can't. You say I shall make him unhappy, and
      I don't want to do that. I don't believe I shall. Jack, why did you come here suggesting these
      horrible things?"</p>
<p>There was a great anger in her voice, and she stood trembling before him.</p>
<p>Just then the door opened, and a middle-aged lady walked in. She did not seem at all
      surprised. Nobody who had known Dodo long was often surprised.</p>
<p>She walked up to Dodo and kissed her.</p>
<p>"I came late," she said, "and your mother said you were in your room, so I came up to
      congratulate you with all my heart."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much," said Dodo, returning the kiss. "Jack, do you know Mrs. Vivian?—Mr.
      Broxton."</p>
<p>Mrs. Vivian bowed, and Jack bowed, and then nobody seemed quite to know what to say next.
      Mrs. Vivian recovered herself first.</p>
<p>"I wish you would show me the necklace Lord Chesterford has given you," she said to Dodo.
      "Mrs. Vane said the diamonds were magnificent."</p>
<p>"Certainly, I will fetch it," said Dodo, with unusual docility. "Don't go away, Jack."</p>
<p>Dodo left the room, and Mrs. Vivian turned to Jack.</p>
<p>"My dear young man," she said, "I am old enough to be your mother, and you mustn't mind what
      I am going to say. This sort of thing won't do at all. I know who you are perfectly well, and
      I warn you that you are playing with fire. You were at liberty to do so before Dodo was
      engaged, and I daresay you have burned your fingers already. Several young men have—but now it
      won't do. Besides that, it isn't fair on either Chesterford or Dodo herself."</p>
<p>Jack wanted to think "what an impertinent old woman," but there was something in her manner
      that forbade it.</p>
<p>"I believe you are right," he said simply; "but it wasn't wholly my fault."</p>
<p>Then he felt angry with himself for having shifted any of the blame on to Dodo.</p>
<p>"<hi>Honi soit</hi>," said the other ambiguously. "I don't mean that—Ah, here is Dodo."</p>
<p>The diamonds were duly shown and admired, and the three went downstairs again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vivian took her leave shortly. She was very gracious to Jack, and as they parted she
      said,—</p>
<p>"Come and see me at any time; I should like to talk to you. Here is my address."</p>
<p>Jack sought Mrs. Vane to inquire who Mrs. Vivian was. Mrs. Vane was even more effusive than
      usual.</p>
<p>"Oh, she is quite one of our leading people," she said.—"She has not been in London, or, in
      fact, in England for two years. She was unhappily married. Her husband was a scamp, and after
      his death she suddenly left London, and has only just returned. She is quite an extraordinary
      woman—everyone used to rave about her. She never gave herself airs, but somehow she was more
      looked up to than anyone else. Quite royal in fact. I feel immensely honoured by her presence
      here. I hardly dared to ask her—so fascinating, and so clever."</p>
<p>Dodo came up to Jack before he left.</p>
<p>"Jack," she said, "I was angry with you, and I am sorry. Don't bear me malice. If Mrs.
      Vivian had not come in, I should have said something abominable. I am afraid of her. I don't
      quite know why. She always seems to be taking stock of one, and noticing how very small one
      is. Don't forget to-morrow. We're all going on a water-party at Richmond. Mind you come."</p>
<p>"I think I had better not," said Jack bluntly.</p>
<p>Dodo lifted her eyebrows in surprise that may have been genuine.</p>
<p>"Why not?" she asked.</p>
<p>Jack had no reasonable answer to give her.</p>
<p>"What did Mrs. Vivian say to you?" asked Dodo suddenly.</p>
<p>Jack paused.</p>
<p>"A few polite nothings," he said; "and half the royal motto. Mrs. Vane said she was quite
      royal, which, of course, explains it."</p>
<p>"I can't conceive what you're talking about," remarked Dodo. "It seems to me to be sheer
      nonsense."</p>
<p>Jack smiled.</p>
<p>"On the whole, I think it is sheer nonsense," he said. "Yes, I'll come."</p>
<p>Dodo swept him the prettiest little curtsey.</p>
<p>"How good of you," she said. "Good-night, Jack. Don't be cross, it really isn't worth while,
      and you can behave so prettily if you like. Oh, such a nice gentleman!"</p>
<p>"No, I expect it isn't worth while," said Jack.</p>
