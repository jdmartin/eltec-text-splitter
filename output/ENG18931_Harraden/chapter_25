<t:head>THE BUILDING OF THE BRIDGE.</t:head>
<t:p>ROBERT ALLITSEN came to the old book-shop to see Zerviah Holme before returning to the
      mountains. He found him reading Gibbon. These two men had stood by Bernardine's grave.</t:p>
<t:p>"I was beginning to know her," the old man said.</t:p>
<t:p>"I have always known her," the young man said. "I cannot remember a time when she has not
      been part of my life."</t:p>
<t:p>"She loved you," Zerviah said. "She was telling me so the very morning when you came."</t:p>
<t:p>Then, with a tenderness which was almost foreign to him, Zerviah told Robert Allitsen how
      Bernardine had opened her heart to him. She had never loved any one before: but she had loved
      the Disagreeable Man.</t:p>
<t:p>"I did not love him because I was sorry for him," she had said. "I loved him for
      himself."</t:p>
<t:p>Those were her very words.</t:p>
<t:p>"Thank you," said the Disagreeable Man. "And God bless you for telling me."</t:p>
<t:p>Then he added:</t:p>
<t:p>"There were some few loose sheets of paper on the counter. She had begun her book. May I
      have them?"</t:p>
<t:p>Zerviah placed them in his hand.</t:p>
<t:p>"And this photograph," the old man said kindly. "I will spare it for you."</t:p>
<t:p>The picture of the little thin eager face was folded up with the papers.</t:p>
<t:p>The two men parted.</t:p>
<t:p>Zerviah Holme went back to his Roman History. The Disagreeable Man went back to the
      mountains: to live his life out there, and to build his bridge, as we all do, whether
      consciously or unconsciously. If it breaks down, we build it again.</t:p>
<t:p>"We will build it stronger this time," we say to ourselves.</t:p>
<t:p>So we begin once more.</t:p>
<t:p>We are very patient.</t:p>
<t:p>And meanwhile the years pass.</t:p>
