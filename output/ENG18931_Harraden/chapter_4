<t:head>CHAPTER IV.</t:head>
<t:head>CONCERNING WÄLI AND MARIE.</t:head>
<t:p>WÄLI, the little hunchback postman, a cheery soul, came whistling up the Kurhaus stairs,
      carrying with him that precious parcel of registered letters, which gave him the position of
      being the most important person in Petershof. He was a linguist, too, was Wäli, and could
      speak broken English in a most fascinating way, agreeable to every one, but intelligible only
      to himself. Well, he came whistling up the stairs when he heard Marie's blithe voice humming
      her favourite spinning-song.</t:p>
<t:p>"Ei, Ei!" he said to himself; "Marie is in a good temper to-day. I will give her a call as I
      pass."</t:p>
<t:p>He arranged his neckerchief and smoothed his curls; and when he reached the end of the
      landing, he paused outside a little glass-door, and, all unobserved, watched Marie in her
      pantry cleaning the candlesticks and lamps.</t:p>
<t:p>Marie heard a knock, and, looking up from her work, saw Wäli.</t:p>
<t:p>"Good day, Wäli," she said, glancing hurriedly at a tiny broken mirror suspended on the
      wall. "I suppose you have a letter for me. How delightful!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Never mind about the letter just now," he said, waving his hand as though wishing to
      dismiss the subject. "How nice to hear you singing so sweetly, Marie! Dear me, in the old days
      at Grüsch, how often I have heard that song of the spinning-wheels. You have forgotten the old
      days, Marie, though you remember the song."</t:p>
<t:p>"Give me my letter, Wäli, and go about your work," said Marie, pretending to be impatient.
      But all the same her eyes looked extremely friendly. There was something very winning about
      the hunchback's face.</t:p>
<t:p>"Ah, ah! Marie," he said, shaking his curly head; "I know how it is with you: you only like
      people in fine binding. They have not always fine hearts."</t:p>
<t:p>"What nonsense you talk Wäli!" said Marie "There, just hand me the oil-can. You can fill
      this lamp for me. Not too full, you goose! And this one also, ah, you're letting the oil
      trickle down! Why, you're not fit for anything except carrying letters! Here, give me my
      letter."</t:p>
<t:p>"What pretty flowers," said Wäli. "Now if there is one thing I do like, it is a flower. Can
      you spare me one, Marie? Put one in my button-hole, do!"</t:p>
<t:p>"You are a nuisance this afternoon," said Marie, smiling and pinning a flower on Wäli's blue
      coat. Just then a bell rang violently.</t:p>
<t:p>"Those Portuguese ladies will drive me quite mad," said Marie. "They always ring just when I
      am enjoying myself?"</t:p>
<t:p>"When you are enjoying yourself!" said Wäli triumphantly.</t:p>
<t:p>"Of course," returned Marie; "I always do enjoy cleaning the oil-lamps; I always did!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Ah, I'd forgotten the oil-lamps!" said Wäli.</t:p>
<t:p>"And so had I!" laughed Marie. "Na, na, there goes that bell again! Won't they be angry!
      Won't they scold at me! Here, Wäli, give me my letter, and I'll be off."</t:p>
<t:p>"I never told you I had any letter for you," remarked Wäli. "It was entirely your own idea.
      Good afternoon, Fräulein Marie."</t:p>
<t:p>The Portuguese ladies' bell rang again, still more passionately this time; but Marie did not
      seem to hear nor care. She wished to be revenged on that impudent postman. She went to the top
      of the stairs and called after Wäli in her most coaxing tones:</t:p>
<t:p>"Do step down one moment; I want to show you something!"</t:p>
<t:p>"I must deliver the registered letters," said Wäli, with official haughtiness. "I have
      already wasted too much of my time."</t:p>
<t:p>"Won't you waste a few more minutes on me?" pleaded Marie pathetically. "It is not often I
      see you now."</t:p>
<t:p>Wäli came down again, looking very happy.</t:p>
<t:p>"I want to show you such a beautiful photograph I've had taken," said Marie. "Ach, it is
      beautiful!"</t:p>
<t:p>"You must give one to me," said Wäli eagerly.</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, I can't do that," replied Marie, as she opened the drawer and took out a small packet.
      "It was a present to me from the Polish gentleman himself. He saw me the other day here in the
      pantry. I was so tired, and I had fallen asleep with my broom, just as you see me here. So he
      made a photograph of me. He admires me very much. Isn't it nice? and isn't the Polish
      gentleman clever? and isn't it nice to have so much attention paid to one? Oh, there's that
      horrid bell again! Good afternoon, Herr Wäli. That is all I have to say to you, thank
      you."</t:p>
<t:p>Wäli's feelings towards the Polish gentleman were not of the friendliest that day.</t:p>
