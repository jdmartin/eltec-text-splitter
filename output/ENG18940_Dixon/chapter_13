<head>CHAPTER XIII</head>
<head type="sub">THE APOTHEOSIS OF PERRY JACKSON</head>
<p>IT was a bright October morning, and the light of mid-day fell searchingly on the
     pictures in their garish new frames. Scotch mountain streams, eastern bazaars, young ladies
     reading love-letters, fishermen mending nets, ran promiscuously up the walls to the very
     cornice, or modestly hung on a level with the boots of the spectator. Everywhere was the
     obvious, the threadbare, the <emph>banal</emph>; everywhere there was a frank appeal to the
     Philistinism of the picture-buying public. It was press day at the galleries of the Society of
     United Artists—the Benighted Artists, as they were called at a certain club consecrated to the
     fine arts—so that, for once, there was a sprinkling of people moving about the polished parquet
     floor. Indeed, in a distant room there was even a small crowd; but that, it appeared, was due
     to the fact that a buffet, spread with a York ham, a magnificent display of bath buns, and
     several decanters of fiery-looking sherry, presided over
     <pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7169-142"/> by a young lady with arch manners and pendant ear-rings, had
     been provided to seduce the austere journalist. Sounds of hilarity, as well as whiffs of
     tobacco smoke, frequently penetrated to the large room where Mary Erle was taking notes.
     Shaggy-looking men, with wide-awake hats and Inverness capes of dubious freshness, strolled in
     twos out of the luncheon room, lit a cigar, took a seat on the red velvet divan in the middle
     of the room, making incongruous figures enough as they rested under the fronds of a giant palm,
     and fell to talking Fleet Street, until one or the other, producing a watch, hastily rose and
     shuffled downstairs. These curious proceedings on the part of a certain portion of the press
     aroused some astonishment in Mary. The scene was as new to her as the work; for she had only
     taken the art critic's place on the <title>Comet</title> during the temporary illness of that
     functionary.</p>
<p>So she walked slowly, conscientiously round the room, stopping at every picture that she
     could possibly mention in her article, and stopping, too, before pictures which an editorial
     hint had advised her she would have to mention whether she liked them or no. Yonder was a
     yellow and blue ‘Rome from the Pincian Hill,’ by a man with whom, she remembered, her editor
     constantly dined; while close
     <pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7169-143"/> beside it was a portrait of Mr. Bosanquet-Barry himself, by
     a lady more celebrated for her charms than her talent. She must find, of course, some phrase
     which might encourage the fair artist to go on painting editors' portraits. Marking with a
     pencil the titles of these works of art, she absolved her conscience by making some elaborate
     notes about a clever little picture by an unknown man, which was hanging near the floor, an
     effect of the Strand on a rainy day. Mary had to kneel on the floor to see it, and as she rose,
     her eyes were on a level with a tolerably large canvas, hung in the place of honour. The scene
     represented Trafalgar Square by moonlight, with a young woman of superhuman beauty wrapped in a
     threadbare shawl, huddled in the shadow of one of the lions. In a passing brougham was seen the
     profile of another girl, painted, bedizened, supercilious.</p>
<p>‘<title>Two Sisters</title>, by Perry Jackson, A.R.A.,’ said Mary, consulting the catalogue.
     ‘I thought so.’</p>
<p>‘How do you do, Miss Erle?’ said a voice—a voice which she had not heard for many months,
     and, turning, she saw that the painter of the picture was taking off his hat, and blushing a
     bright pink as he advanced to meet her. She noticed, with amused surprise, that he was dressed
     in the height of the fashion, and wore a pink carnation in his button-hole. His shock
     <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7169-144"/> head, too, was closely cropped now, but as there was still
     no trace of hair on his face, he had, as of old, the look of a grown-up London street-boy.</p>
<p>‘If this isn't a sight for sore eyes!’ declared Perry gallantly. ‘Why I haven't seen you to
     speak to for ages—not since the old days at the Central London.’</p>
<p>‘No,’ said Mary, ‘and you have become famous since then! I must congratulate you on your
     election to the Royal Academy.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, it don't mean much—except in the £s.d. line, you know,’ said Perry, modestly. ‘But I
     told you I'd do it, didn't I? You remember <title>The Time of Roses</title>? That was what did
     the trick, the girls and the roses. Agnew bought it, sold thousands of engravings— especially
     in Australia. Australia, you know, is like England—only more so. And in America, too. I'm told
     that in America they give away an autogravure of that picture with every pound of Scourer's
     Soap and every bottle of Parkins' Pain-killer.’</p>
<p>‘America is a wonderful country,’ said Mary gravely.</p>
<p>‘Of course,’ continued Perry, ‘you saw the picture in the Academy. Sold for two thousand
     pounds at the private view. What fetches the public is a long price. ‘I hope,’ he added
     wistfully, ‘that you'll come and see my studio.
     <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7169-145"/> I'm down Kensington way now—all among the Royal
     Academicians.’</p>
<p>‘I shall certainly come,’ said Mary.</p>
<p>‘Oh, when?’ demanded Mr. Jackson with an unmistakable show of eagerness. ‘I'm in old Madder's
     house, the big red one with the white balconies. He couldn't keep it up, poor old chap. Would
     go on doing historical pictures: ‘After Naseby,’ ‘Charles II. hiding in the oak’ and all that
     sort of thing, and the public won't have him at any price.’</p>
<p>‘Those things were in fashion,’ replied Mary, ‘when he was young. There is something pathetic
     in his clinging to them, like one or two old ladies in society, who still wear the ringlets and
     berthas of 1850.’</p>
<p>‘Well, it may be pathetic,’ said Perry, staring in a somewhat bewildered way, ‘but, anyhow,
     it don't pay. Poor old Madder was glad to get rid of the house as it stands; so I took it just
     as it was: tapestries, Venetian mantelpieces, suits of armour, and all the rest of it.’</p>
<p>‘And do your—your people live with you?’ said Mary vaguely, remembering the old couple in the
     Hampstead Road upholsterer's shop.</p>
<p>‘Oh! no. They wouldn't care about it, you know. The old people like to come and walk round
     the house. There's the Venetian drawing-room now, that rather takes their fancy.’</p>
<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7169-146"/>
<p>‘It's rather a responsibility, isn't it, setting up such a big establishment?’</p>
<p>‘Bless you,’ whispered the new Associate confidentially, ‘its all for show! I live in a
     little room at the back; couldn't be bothered to sit down and eat my mutton-chop in that great
     big gold and amber dining-room. Oh! no. Not for this infant. But it fetches the public, no end.
     Why, I've had any amount of tip-top swells there already. They come in and say, ‘What a
      <emph>perfectly</emph> beautiful house, Mr. Jackson. What <emph>exquisite</emph> taste! Where
      <emph>did</emph> you get that cabinet? I wonder now, if I were to ask <emph>very</emph>
     prettily, if you could find time to paint my portrait?’</p>
<p>‘I see,’ said Mary thoughtfully, ‘that you thoroughly understand your public.’</p>
<p>A loud gaffaw of laughter burst from the inner room. One of the United Artists, emboldened by
     several glasses of the dubious-looking sherry, was playfully disengaging the arch young lady's
     ear-ring from a stray lock of hair. A female journalist, who wore a waterproof and a pince-nez,
     emerged hastily, with a superior expression, through the doorway, and in the general hilarity
     which followed this little scene several more glasses of sherry were hastily poured out and a
     quantity of fresh cigars were lit. Artists and critics were seen exchanging
     <pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7169-147"/> cards, and an atmosphere of extreme sociability hung about
     the galleries. An old man with a white beard, who had painted the interior of Cologne cathedral
     for forty years, was leading affectionately by the arm the young gentleman who did the
     galleries for <title>The Easel</title>, towards the room where his latest contribution to the
     fine arts hung. A little group of critics had collected round Perry <corr>Jackson's</corr>
     canvas. It was easy to see that they considered it the picture of the exhibition. A vague
     official crossed the room and bending down, whispered confidentially:</p>
<p>‘May I suggest your taking some slight refreshment? It is all in the next room.’</p>
<p>‘Thank you,’ said Mary, in her stiffest manner. ‘I lunched before I came out.’</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause, which Perry Jackson hastened to break.</p>
<p>‘And you—what are you doing now, Miss Erle? I've seen your stories in
      <title>Illustrations</title>—though I haven't much time for reading myself. Why, you must be
     making “a pile.”’</p>
<p>‘My income varies,’ said Mary, smiling a little pathetically. ‘It sometimes exceeds
     thirty-six pounds a year.’</p>
<p>‘Great Scott!’ ejaculated Perry, ‘I'm glad I don't write.’</p>
<p>‘One writes for the fun of it, I suppose,’ said
     <pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7169-148"/> Mary. ‘Why—I 've even thought of writing a realistic
     novel!’</p>
<p>‘Oh! When will it be published?’ asked the young man.</p>
<p>‘It won't ever be published,’ answered the girl. ‘It would be a bit of real life; it would
     have twenty-seven years of actual experience in it.’</p>
<p>‘And so you haven't written it?’ he asked quickly.</p>
<p>‘No. My idea was too sad—too painful, all the publishers said. It wouldn't have pleased the
     British public. But I have been given a commission to do a three-volume novel on the old
     lines—a ball in the first volume; a picnic and a parting in the second; and an elopement, which
     must, of course, be prevented at the last moment by the opportune death (in a hospital) of the
     wife, or the husband—I forget which it is to be—in the last.’</p>
<p>‘I dare say it will be ripping good,’ said Perry, optimistically.</p>
<p>‘I am quite sure it will be dreadful,’ said Mary; ‘but then I can't afford to say no. I've
     got a big boy at Winchester, you know. Brothers are so expensive—they want such a lot of
     neckties. And I dare say it doesn't matter much what one writes. It will all be forgotten soon
     enough. I used to have my little
     <pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7169-149"/> ideas about what was artistic and so on; but then, as you
     say, one <emph>must</emph> think of the public,’ she added, rather dismally, as her eye ran
     along the walls covered with smooth views of Rome, of the Thames at Wargrave, impossible
     fisher-girls, and treacly sunsets. She was surprised at herself for talking so openly to this
     young man whom she had not seen for so long; but there was a fund of frankness and kindliness
     under Mr. Perry Jackson's somewhat unattractive manners which was difficult to resist. He was
     so perfectly candid himself that few people were ever anything but frank in return.</p>
<p>‘Why, of course you must,’ replied the new Associate, resting a complacent eye on his own
     canvas, which stood out in all its meretricious cleverness from the ruck of commonplaces
     around. After all, Mary thought, there was merit in the picture— the moonlight was broadly
     painted, there was real movement in the passing <foreign xml:lang="fre">coupé</foreign>, and
     the girl's face inside, lit up by the carriage lamps, was cleverly indicated.</p>
<p>‘By the by,’ said Mary, as she put up her note-book, ‘I suppose you've heard from
      <title>Illustrations</title>? They're going to have an article on you and your work, on your
     election to the Academy, you know. And I think they rather want me to do it.’</p>
<p>‘I wish you would, Miss Erle,’ said Perry,
     <pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7169-150"/> blushing. ‘You know pretty well all about me, don't you? And
     I 'll show you all the work I've got now at my place, and—and will——’</p>
<p>‘In that case,’ said Mary, ‘I shall pay a state visit to your studio, and I shall be highly
     critical, so don't attempt to disarm me with sherry and bath buns.’</p>
<p>‘You looked then,’ cried Perry, ‘just like you used to when you first came to the Central
     London, with a funny little twinkle in the tail of your eye.’</p>
<p>‘Did I?’ laughed Mary. ‘I don't feel like it. I believe I am about a hundred,’ she added,
     gathering up her note-book and parasol.</p>
<p>‘May I—I should like to see you home?’ said Perry gallantly, as they descended the stairs
     together. ‘Where did you say you lived?’</p>
<p>‘In the same place, in Bulstrode Street. But I hope I shall not have to stay there long. What
     I should like would be a little house somewhere in a suburb. A little house with a garden,’ she
     added, as they passed out into the street, and her thoughts flew back to Vincent Hemming,—to
     Vincent, whose letters during the last few weeks had somehow grown rarer and rarer.</p>
<p>And in the empty galleries the rays of an autumn sunset touched the threadbare ‘Romes’ and
     ‘Wargraves’ and ‘Cornish Fisher-scenes’
     <pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7169-151"/> with its delicate golden fingers. One by one the pressmen
     and the lady journalists had slipped away. The odour of tobacco was evaporating. Even the
     buffet was deserted, save for one elderly gentleman, who, as he stood talking to the presiding
     nymph as she washed up the glasses, leaned heavily with one elbow on the table and regarded the
     empty decanters with a fixed smile.</p>
