<head>CHAPTER VII</head>
<head type="sub">A KETTLEDRUM AT LADY JANE'S</head>
<p>LADY JANE IVES was always to be found in Portman Square at five, but to-day she had
     sent out cards, so that an hour later the lofty, gaunt rooms, with their faded crimson carpets,
     their flowery chintzes and their many mirrors, were dotted with little groups. Lady Jane
     disliked new fashions in her house, and the general effect, in an over-luxurious age, was
     somewhat cheerless. The stiff, hard Guardis on the walls, in which tin gondoliers were
     propelling iron gondolas on a leaden lagoon, with a background of grey zinc palaces, were but
     faintly visible by the tentative light of the circle of candles in the quivering lustre
     chandelier. Between the starched lace curtains stood monster Chinese vases, swollen like vases
     seen in an uneasy dream. The buhl cabinets had chilly marble tops; the rosewood tables held
     vast photograph albums. Lady Jane had arranged the rooms on her marriage some forty years ago,
     and it had not occurred to her to change them.</p>
<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7169-072"/>
<p>Parliament had just opened; so that people were back in town. Here and there a man's black
     coat was visible. There was a subdued murmur of talk. People were slipping out quietly under
     cover of someone else's arrival, dropping the perfunctory smile which they had exhibited for
     ten minutes under the lustre chandelier, as they made their way quickly out into the portico,
     where a small army of grooms, with faces as drab and unemotional as their overcoats, hung about
     the steps.</p>
<p>‘I've just come from the Ambassador of all the Russias,’ drawled a pretty woman to Lady Jane,
     as she stood, in the swaggering attitude which she affected on entering a drawing-room, just at
     the door.</p>
<p>‘My dear, you shouldn't encourage those barbarians,’ declared her hostess; ‘it's so
     shockingly radical to approve of foreign tyrannies.’</p>
<p>Alison, assisted by Mary, was pouring out tea in the gaunt back drawing-room. It was
     noticeable that most of the men had collected round the table. ‘I won't have my friends fed at
     a sort of sublimated coffee-stall in the dining-room,’ announced Lady Jane. ‘It's a young
     woman's mission to make tea for her friends. Alison, remember Lady Blaythewaite doesn't like
     sugar.’ ‘Vous versez le thé avec une grâce parfaite,’
     <pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7169-073"/> sighed a sentimental <foreign xml:lang="fre">attaché</foreign> of vague Slav nationality, who was famous for turning compliments out of
     the most unlikely materials.</p>
<p>And Mary Erle, in her black clothes, sat on one side and looked at the little comedy with
     impartial eyes. It seemed so long since she had been in society; she supposed she was out of
     touch with the world. Vanity Fair, since she had left it for so many months, seemed curiously
     foolish.</p>
<p>Close to her, the pretty woman, who stood sipping her tea amid an admiring circle of black
     coats, had already got on one of her favourite topics.</p>
<p>‘I don't mean to be done out of Monte Carlo, this year,’ she announced in a penetrating
     voice, and with the air of one who is accustomed to have her least brilliant observations
     received with attention; ‘so I've told Sir Horace he can have as many shooting parties as he
     likes, but I'm off on the 31st.’</p>
<p>The eyes of the complimentary Slav waxed brilliant as he gazed admiringly at Lady
     Blaythewaite.</p>
<p>‘All very well,’ objected a perfectly-dressed and perfectly self-satisfied young man, who
     gave the casual spectator the impression, from the parting of his beautifully cared-for hair to
     the pointed toes of his shiny boots, he was elabor-
     <pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7169-074"/> ately, exquisitely new and clean: ‘all very well for ladies,’
     he said deliberately, ‘but how on earth is a feller to go away in December if he wants to get
     any huntin'—what? Why, the Duchess said the other night when I told her I wasn't goin'——’</p>
<p>But to make room for two new arrivals, the exquisitely clean young man was obliged to step
     into the background, and the rest of his story was lost to every one but the pretty woman.
     After these two had thrashed out the engrossing subject of Monte Carlo, the word ‘Plumpton’ was
     bandied about, and afterwards the name of the latest three-act farce. The exquisitely clean
     young man, it appeared, was a great theatre-goer; in fact, he admitted that he went so often
     that it was impossible to recollect the names of the house, the play, or the actors.</p>
<p>‘I don't remember the name of the piece, don't you know,’ he confided, ‘but we saw it the
     night before last at the Criterion—I think it must have been the Criterion, because we dined in
     the restaurant first—and the feller I liked awfully, don't you know, was the one who played the
     feller who kicks out the Johnnie in the third act. Awfully good, what?’</p>
<p>‘Oh, yes. Awfully good—wasn't he? We all thought him a dear,’ said the pretty woman
     <pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7169-075"/> in a bored tone. She had had enough of what she called
     ‘intellectual conversation.’</p>
<p>‘What have you done with that charming Mr. Hemming, my dear?’ demanded Lady Jane in a stage
     whisper, descending on Mary and leading her out of her corner by the arm. And, not waiting for
     an answer, she went on, ‘You've sent him off to India, you naughty child, and he may die of the
     cholera or heat-apoplexy, and then you'll be sorry. Poor fellow, he looked so terribly cut-up.
     He came to see me just before he went. His father was an old flame of mine. But the men were
     more enterprising when I was young. They didn't take “no” for an answer.’</p>
<p>‘But, dear Lady Jane,’ whispered Mary, ‘I didn't give “no” for an answer.’ All this was said
     while a lady with sloping shoulders and dyed black hair was performing a rather deliberate solo
     on the harp.</p>
<p>But her hostess, whose eyes were turned towards the door, did not apparently grasp the import
     of Mary's words. Lady Jane was very fond of Professor Erle's daughter—the professor had always
     been one of the familiar faces at her Sunday dinners—but she was a somewhat indifferent
     listener, and just now she had not only to thank the fair harpist—but a new arrival was
     claiming her attention.</p>
<p>‘Ah! there is my dear doctor,’ exclaimed
     <pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7169-076"/> Lady Jane with much vivacity. ‘How good of you,’ she said,
     with more enthusiasm than she had yet exhibited, ‘to find time to come and see an old
     woman.’</p>
<p>The man addressed was a striking figure enough; he had, moreover, that imposing air which
     endears itself to the feminine imagination. Dr. Dunlop Strange was a favourite with women in
     society. His speciality was nervous disease. He had done a great deal of useful work, had made
     one important discovery which had brought him prominently before the public, and was understood
     to be about to receive a baronetcy. Mary remembered his face. She had met him out often in the
     old days: at <foreign xml:lang="fre">soirées</foreign> at learned societies, at the
     dinner-tables of the celebrated or the merely smart. He was a man of forty-five, a little under
     the medium size, with a perpetual upright pucker just between his eyes. Those eyes, the girl
     noticed, spoilt his face; they were small and somewhat shifty; but as he usually wore a
     pince-nez this peculiarity was not noticeable. He looked tired, but not at all bored.</p>
<p>The doctor was understood to be devoted to Alison, and, for once, Alison seemed pleased.
     Though she was good-looking and moved in a somewhat go-ahead set, she had never been known to
     have an ordinary flirtation. She used to say
     <pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7169-077"/> that she supposed she should have to marry some day—the later
     the better—because it was absurd to suppose that old maids had any influence on people's lives;
     and Power, to put it plainly, was what the modern woman craved. She supposed, in that respect,
     that she wasn't any better than the rest of her sex. Lady Jane was delighted; asked the doctor
     constantly to dinner, and insisted on his assisting at one of her Happy Afternoons for Pauper
     Lunatics. And Dr. Strange went; as indeed he would have gone anywhere just now to meet
     Alison.</p>
<p>‘By the by,’ she said, giving him a cup of tea, and pretending not to notice that his eyes
     were devouring every detail of her handsome personality, ‘I want you particularly to know Mary
     Erle—Professor Erle's daughter. Of course you've met her, but I want you to know her. She's one
     of my few friends.’</p>
<p>Alison seemed in high spirits since Dr. Dunlop Strange's arrival.</p>
<p>‘Here's Mr. Bosanquet-Barry,’ she whispered, as a beautiful young man with Parma violets in
     his coat appeared in the doorway; ‘one of mother's young friends. He's the new editor of the
      <title>Comet</title>.’</p>
<p>‘The editor,’ repeated Mary incredulously, emerging from a conversation with Dr. Strange,
     which she had carried on with difficulty, seeing
     <pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7169-078"/> that his eyes were fixed on Alison all the time. ‘The editor
     of the <title>Comet</title>? Why, he looks a mere boy.’</p>
<p>?’My dear, he's seven-and-twenty. Besides, that's the new idea in journalism. You pluck your
     editor nice and hot from Oxford—someone who has none of the old hackneyed Fleet Street
     ideas.’</p>
<p>‘This one,’ observed Mary thoughtfully, ‘doesn't look as if he had any ideas at all.’</p>
<p>‘Oh I but then he's devoted to the Primrose League—and mother. He goes to her Happy
     Afternoons. I hear that all the smart set are in love with him—if that's any recommendation.
     Mary, you must be introduced. You'll have to know these people if you're going to be an
     artist.’</p>
<p>On closer inspection Mr. Bosanquet-Barry turned out to have a somewhat spurious air of youth.
     The effect of extreme juvenility was produced by his fair skin, his dazzlingly white teeth, and
     his piercingly blue eyes. He entertained Mary, as he got her a cup of tea, with a spirited
     account of a visit to a minor music-hall, which he and a pale-faced boy with tired eyelids and
     an exaggerated button-hole had arranged the night before for Lady Blaythewaite.</p>
<p>‘It all went all right,’ said Mr. Bosanquet-Barry confidentially, ‘until the last. Lady
     <pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7169-079"/> Blaythewaite swore she'd never enjoyed anything so much in
     her life. Can't say I did, as I had to talk to the girl she brought with her, who was ugly as
     sin. However, I had to leave 'em a minute at the door, to see after the carriage, and then some
     beastly cad spoke to her.’</p>
<p>‘How very unpleasant,’ said Mary, who felt she was expected to sympathise with this lady's
     adventures in a London music-hall.</p>
<p>‘Oh,’ chuckled Mr. Bosanquet-Barry, with a laugh which was not quite pretty. ‘I don't believe
     she minded—I shouldn't wonder if she rather liked it. At any rate, she shouldn't wear such
     outrageous clothes. I wonder Sir Horace——’</p>
<p>‘Oh, Sir Horace doesn't care,’ interrupted the pale-faced boy, whose name, it appeared, was
     Beaufort Flower, though he was usually briefly addressed as ‘Beaufy’; ‘Sir Horace doesn't care,
     he don't pay for them, you know.’</p>
<p>And with a display of all his white teeth at once, the editor of the <title>Comet</title>,
     who with all his boyishness had picked up the editor's air of not meaning to allow anyone to
     detain him, bowed abruptly and was now seen pressing the hands of several ladies of quality as
     he steered his way towards the door.</p>
<p>‘He is an odious youth,’ said Alison calmly.
     <pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7169-080"/> ‘I'm not responsible, you know, for all mother's “boys.”
     Sometimes he comes and stops for hours. They talk scandal all the time, and, Heaven preserve
     us! the scandal of the fifties—about women who are grandmothers, or in their graves. Don't you
     think it a depraved taste, Dr. Strange?’ continued the girl.</p>
<p>‘Perhaps,’ he answered with a smile, ‘he's going to write a book of reminiscences. You begin
     collecting at about twenty, and you keep your scandal, well-corked and in a dry place, till you
     are about eighty. Then you publish with additions.’</p>
<p>‘I dare say,’ laughed Alison, ‘that scandal doesn't “keep” any better than other things. A
     little venom has to be added.’</p>
<p>‘Scandal,’ put in the pretty woman, emerging suddenly from a flirtation with the sentimental
     Slav, ‘is only interesting about one's contemporaries.’</p>
<p>‘Dear me, what an interesting woman Lady Blaythewaite must be,’ whispered Mr. Beaufort Flower
     into the ear of a solemn man with a heavy jaw, who was well-connected, and who was understood
     to write essays in Addisonian English.</p>
<p>‘Ah!’ ejaculated the solemn man, with a thoughtful glance at the pretty woman.</p>
<p>‘My only objection to immoral people,’ chat-
     <pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7169-081"/> tered the other, gazing at her with weary, half-closed eyes,
     ‘is that they're generally so shockingly censorious.</p>
<p>‘No one else's conduct, I suppose,’ rejoined the solemn man deliberately, ‘comes up to their
     high ethical standard.’</p>
<p>‘My heavens!’ exclaimed the pretty woman, who had heard part of the answer, ‘they've begun to
     talk of ethical standards! I mustn't keep the roans any longer. Good-bye, all you people,
     good-bye.’</p>
<p>And sweeping away among her rustling silk petticoats the complimentary Slav, Lady
     Blaythewaite's tiny head and wide shoulders were seen descending the staircase.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Most of the people were leaving. From the open hall door came the click of
     closing carriage-doors, the word ‘Home’ pronounced in the official voice of the unemotional
     grooms, and the sound of departing wheels. Dr. Dunlop Strange was bending towards Alison,
     talking earnestly.</p>
<p>‘Charmin' rooms,’ said Mr. Beaufy Flower vaguely, terrified at finding himself alone with
     Mary, whom he took for his especial aversion, a <foreign xml:lang="fre">débutante</foreign>.
     His eye ran round the rather bare walls, the fluted steel fenders, the marble mantelpieces
     topped by their huge mirrors. ‘So nice and old-fashioned, aren't they? Should
     <pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7169-082"/> you say early Victorian now, or late William the Fourth?’</p>
<p>But the favourite modern amusement of whispering malicious things of one's host or hostess
     behind their backs had never appealed to her, and much to his surprise the fair girl in
     mourning evinced no further desire for his society, but with one of those little manoeuvres
     which only women of the world know how to execute without offence, she had joined Alison and
     the doctor.</p>
<p>‘Good gracious!’ he said to himself as he tripped downstairs to his brougham. ‘How pert! I
     don't believe she's a <foreign xml:lang="fre">débutante</foreign> after all.’</p>
