<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p>HADRIA had determined upon making a strong and patient effort to pursue her work
       during the winter, while doing her best, at the same time, to please her mother, and to make
       up to her, as well as she could, for Algitha's departure. She would not be dismayed by
       difficulties: as the Professor said, only cowards and weaklings escaped these. She treated
       herself austerely, and found her power of concentration increasing, and her hold on herself
       greater. But, as usual, her greatest effort had to be given, not to the work itself, but to
       win opportunity to pursue it. Mrs. Fullerton opposed her daughter's endeavours as firmly as
       ever. It was not good for a girl to be selfishly pre-occupied. She ought to think of
       others.</p>
<p>If Hadria yielded the point on any particular occasion, her mood and her work were
       destroyed: if she resisted, they were equally destroyed, through the nervous disturbance and
       the intense depression which followed the winning of a liberty too dearly bought. The
       incessant rising and quelling of her impulse and her courage—like the ebb and flow of
       tides—represented a vast amount of force not merely wasted, but expended in producing a
       dangerous wear and tear upon the system. The process told upon her health, and was the
       beginning of the weakening and unbalancing of the splendid constitution which Hadria, in
       common with every member of the family, enjoyed as a birthright. The injury was insidious but
       serious. Hadria, unable to command any certain part of the day, began to sit up at night.
       This led to a direct clash of wills. Mr. Fullerton said that the girl was doing
       <pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7047-106"/> her best to ruin her health for life; Mrs. Fullerton
       wished to know why Hadria, who had all the day at her disposal, could not spend the night
       rationally.</p>
<p>“But I haven't all the day, or any part of it, for certain,” said Hadria.</p>
<p>“If you grudge the little services you do for me, pray abandon them,” said the mother,
       genuinely hurt.</p>
<p>Hadria entered her room, one evening, tired out and profoundly depressed. A table, covered
       with books, stood beside the fire. She gave the top-heavy pile an impatient thrust and the
       mass fell, with a great crash, to the floor. A heap of manuscript—her musical achievement for
       the past year—was involved in the fall. She contemplated the wreck gravely.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is I who am weak, not circumstance that is strong. If I could keep my mind unmoved
       by the irritations; if I could quarrel with mother, and displease father, and offend all the
       world without a qualm, or without losing the delicate balance of thought and mood necessary
       for composition, then I should, to some extent, triumph over my circumstances; I should not
       lose so much time in this wretched unstringing. Only were I so immovably constituted, is it
       probable that I should be able to compose at all?”</p>
<p>She drew the score towards her. “People are surprised that women have never done anything
       noteworthy in music. People are so intelligent!” She turned over the pages critically. If
       only this instinct were not so overwhelmingly strong! Hadria wondered how many other women,
       from the beginning of history, had cursed the impulse to create! Fortunately, it was
       sometimes extinguished altogether, as to-night, for instance, when every impression, every
       desire was swept clean out of her, and her mind presented a creditable blank, such as really
       ought to satisfy the most exacting social mentor. In such a state, a woman might be induced
       to accept anything!</p>
<p>Hadria brought out two letters from her pocket; one from the Professor, the other from Miss
       Du Prel. The latter had
       <pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7047-107"/> been writing frequently of late, pointing out the danger
       of Hadria's exaggerated ideas, and the probability of their ruining her happiness in life.
       Valeria had suffered herself from “ideas,” and knew how fatal they were. Life
        <emph>could</emph> not be exactly as one would have it, and it was absolutely necessary, in
       order to avoid misery for oneself and others, to consent to take things more or less as they
       were; to make up one's mind to bend a little, rather than have to break, in the end. Things
       were never quite so shocking as they seemed to one's youthful imagination. The world was made
       up of compromises. Good was mixed with evil everywhere. The domestic idea, as Hadria called
       it, might be, in its present phase, somewhat offensive, but it could be redeemed in its
       application, in the details and “extenuating circumstances.” Valeria could not warn Hadria
       too earnestly against falling into the mistake that Valeria herself had made. She had
       repudiated the notion of anything short of an ideal union; a perfect comradeship, without the
       shadow of restraint or bondage in the relationship; and not having found it, she had refused
       the tie altogether. She could not bring herself to accept the lesser thing, having conceived
       the possibility of the greater. She now saw her error, and repented it. She was reaping the
       penalty in a lonely and unsatisfied life. For a long time her work had seemed to suffice, but
       she felt now that she had been trusting to a broken reed. She was terrified at her solitude.
       She could not face the thought of old age, without a single close tie, without a home,
       without a hold upon her race.</p>
<p>She ended by entreating Hadria not to refuse marriage merely because she could not find a
       man to agree with her in everything, or capable of entering into the spirit of the
       relationship that perhaps would unite the men and women of the future. It was a pity that
       Hadria had not been born a generation later, but since she had come into the world at this
       time of transition, she must try to avoid the tragedy that threatens all spirits who are
       pointing towards the
       <pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7047-108"/> new order, while the old is still working out its
       unexhausted impetus.</p>
<p>This reiterated advice had begun to trouble Hadria. It did not convince her, but Valeria's
       words were incessantly repeating themselves in her mind working as a ferment among her
       thoughts.</p>
<p>The letters from Miss Du Prel and the Professor were to her, a source of great pleasure and
       of great pain. In her depressed moods, they would often rather increase her despondency,
       because the writers used to take for granted so many achievements that she had not been able
       to accomplish.</p>
<p>“They think I am living and progressing as they are; they do not know that the riot and
       stir of intellectual life has ceased. I am like a creature struggling in a quicksand.”</p>
<p>On the Professor's letter, the comments were of a different character.</p>
<p>He had recommended her to read certain books, and reminded her that no possessor of good
       books could lack the privilege of spiritual sanctuary.</p>
<p>“Ah! yes, I know few pleasures so great as that of finding one's own idea, or hope, or
       longing, finely expressed, half-born thoughts alive and of stately stature; and then the
       exquisite touches of art upon quick nerves, the enlarging of the realms of imagination,
       knowledge, the heightening of perceptions, intuitions; finally the blessed power of escaping
       from oneself, with the paradoxical reward of greater self-realization! But, ah, Professor, to
       me there is a ‘but’ even here. I am oppressed by a sense of the discrepancy between the world
       that books disclose to me, and the world that I myself inhabit. In books, the
        <emph>impossibilities</emph> are all left out. They give you no sense of the sordid
       Inevitable that looms so large on the grey horizon. Another more personal quarrel that I have
       with books is on account of their attacking all my pet prejudices, and sneering at the type
       of woman that I have the misfortune to belong to. I am always exhorted to cure myself of
       being myself. Nothing less would suffice. Now this is wounding. All my
       <pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7047-109"/> particular feelings, my strongest beliefs, are condemned,
       directly or by inference. I could almost believe that there is a literary conspiracy to
       reform me. The “true women” of literature infallibly think and feel precisely as I do
        <emph>not</emph> think and feel, while the sentiments that I detest—woe is me—are lauded to
       the skies. Truly, if we women don't know exactly what we ought to think and feel, it is not
       for want of telling. Yet you say, Professor, in this very letter, that the sense of having a
       peculiar experience is always an illusion, that every feeling of ours has been felt before,
       if not in our own day, then in the crowded past, with its throngs of forgotten lives and
       unrecorded experiences. I wish to heaven I could meet those who have had exactly mine!”</p>
<p>Hadria did not keep up an active correspondence with Miss Du Prel or with the Professor.
       She had no idea of adding to the burden of their busy lives, by wails for sympathy. It seemed
       to her feeble, and contemptible, to ask to be dragged up by their strength, instead of
       exerting her own. If that were insufficient, why then let her go down, as thousands had gone
       down before her. As a miser telling his gold, she would read and re-read those occasional
       letters, written amidst the stress of life at high pressure, and bearing evidence of that
       life of thought and work, in their tense, full-packed phrases. With what a throb of longing
       and envy Hadria used to feel the vibration through her own nerves! It was only when
       completely exhausted and harassed that the response was lacking. To-night everything seemed
       to be obliterated. Her hope, her interest were, for the moment, tired out. Her friends would
       be disappointed in her, but there was no help for it.</p>
<p>She picked up the score of her music, and stood, with a handful of the once precious
       offspring of her brain held out towards the flames. Then she drew it back, and half closed
       her eyes in self-scrutinizing thought. “Come now,” she said to herself, “are you sincere in
       your intention of giving up? Are you pot doing this in a fit of spite against destiny? as if
       destiny cared two straws. Heavens! what a poor little
       <pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7047-110"/> piece of melodrama. And to think that you should have
       actually taken yourself in it by it. One acts so badly with only oneself for audience. You
       know perfectly well that you are <emph>not</emph> going to give in, you are <emph>not</emph>
       going to attempt to stifle that which is the centre of your life: you have not courage for
       such slow suicide. Don't add insincerity to the other faults that are laid to your account—”
       She mused over the little self-administered lecture. And probing down into her consciousness,
       she realized that she could not face the thought of surrender. She meant to fight on. The
       notion of giving in had been seized instinctively, for a moment of rest. Nothing should
       really make her cease the struggle, until the power itself had been destroyed. She was sure
       of it, in her heart, in spite of failures and miserably inadequate expressions of it.
       Suddenly, as a shaft of light through parting clouds, came bursting forth, radiant,
       rejoicing, that sense of power, large, resistless, genial as morning sunshine. Yes, yes, let
       them say what they might, discourage, smile, or frown as they would, the faculty was given to
       her, and she would fight for opportunity to use it while she had breath.</p>
