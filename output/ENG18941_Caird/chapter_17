<p>“<hi>IF</hi> you please, ma'am, the cook says as the meat hasn't come for lunch, and what
       is she to do?”</p>
<p>“Without,” replied Mrs. Temperley automatically.</p>
<p>The maid waited for more discreet directions. She had given a month's notice that very
       morning, because she found Craddock Dene too dull.</p>
<p>“Thank goodness, that barbarian is going!” Hubert had exclaimed.</p>
<p>“We shall but exchange a Goth for a Vandal,” his wife replied.</p>
<p>Mrs. Temperley gazed intently at her maid, the light of intelligence gradually dawning in
       her countenance. “Is there anything else in the house, Sapph—Sophia?”</p>
<p>“No, ma'am,” replied Sophia.</p>
<p>“Oh, tell the cook to make it into a fricassee, and be sure it is well flavoured.” The maid
       hesitated, but seeing from the wandering expression of her employer's eye that her intellect
       was again clouded over, she retired to give the message to the cook—with comments.</p>
<p>The library at the Red House was the only room that had been radically altered since the
       days of the former tenants, whose taste had leant towards the florid rather than the classic.
       The general effect had been toned down, but it was impossible to disguise the leading motive;
       or what Mrs. Temperley passionately described as its brutal vulgarity. The library alone had
       been subjected to <foreign xml:lang="fre">peine forte et dure</foreign>. Mrs. Temperley said
       that it had been purified by suffering. By dint of tearing down and dragging out offending
       objects (“such a pity!” cried the neighbours) its prosperous and complacent
       <pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7047-151"/> absurdity had been humbled. Mrs. Temperley retired to this
       refuge after her encounter with Sophia. That perennially aggrieved young person entered
       almost immediately afterwards and announced a visitor, with an air that implied—“She'll stay
       to lunch; see if she don't, and what'll you do then? Yah!”</p>
<p>The pronunciation of the visitor's name was such, that, for the moment, Mrs. Temperley did
       not recognize it as that of Miss Valeria Du Prel.</p>
<p>She jumped up joyfully. “Ah, Valeria, this <emph>is</emph> delightful!”</p>
<p>The visit was explained after a characteristic fashion. Miss Du Prel realized that over two
       years had passed since she had seen Hadria, and moreover she had been seized with an
       overwhelming longing for a sight of country fields and a whiff of country air, so she had put
       a few things together in a handbag, which she had left at Craddock station by accident, and
       come down. Was there anyone who could go and fetch her handbag? It was such a nuisance; she
       laid it down for a moment to get at her ticket—she never could find her pocket, dressmakers
       always hid them in such an absurd way; could Hadria recommend any dressmaker who did not hide
       pockets? Wasn't it tiresome? She had no time-table, and so she had gone to the station that
       morning and waited till a Craddock train started, and by this arrangement it had come to pass
       that she had spent an hour and a half on the platform: she did not think she ever had such an
       unpleasant time; why didn't they have trains oftener? They did to Putney.</p>
<p>Mrs. Temperley sat down and laughed. Whereupon the other's face lightened and she joined in
       the laugh at her own expense, settling into the easy chair that her hostess had prepared for
       her, with a gesture of helplessness and comfort.</p>
<p>“Well, in spite of that time at the station, I'm glad I came. It seems so long since I have
       seen you, dear Hadria, and the last time you know you were very unhappy, almost mad—”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes; never mind about that,” interposed Mrs. Temperley hastily, setting her teeth
       together.</p>
<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7047-152"/>
<p>“You take things too hard, too hard,” said Miss Du Prel. “I used to think <emph>I</emph>
       was bad in that way, but I am phlegmatic compared with you. One would suppose that—”</p>
<p>“Valeria, don't, don't, don't,” cried Mrs. Temperley. “I can't stand it.” Her teeth were
       still set tight and hard, her hands were clenched.</p>
<p>“Very well, very well. Tell me what you have been making of this ridiculous old world,
       where everything goes wrong and everybody is stupid or wicked, or both.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Temperley's face relaxed a little, though the signs of some strong emotion were still
       visible.</p>
<p>“Well, to answer the general by the particular, I have spent the morning, accompanied by a
       nice young brood of Cochin-China fowls, in Craddock churchyard.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I hate a churchyard,” exclaimed Miss Du Prel, with a shudder. “It makes one think of
       the hideous mockery of life, and the more one would like to die, the worse seems the
       brutality of death and his hideous accompaniments. It is such a savage denial of all human
       aspirations and affections and hopes. Ah, it is horrible!” The sharply-outlined face grew
       haggard and white, as its owner crouched over the fire.</p>
<p>“Heaven knows! but it was very serene and very lovely up there this morning.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Valeria with a burst of strange enthusiasm and sadness, that revealed all
       the fire and yearning and power that had raised her above her fellows in the scale of
       consciousness, with the penalty of a life of solitude and of sorrow.</p>
<p>“Surely it is not without meaning that the places of the dead are the serenest spots on
       earth,” said Mrs. Temperley. “If I could keep myself in the mood that the place induces, I
       think I should not mind anything very much any more. The sunshine seems to rest more tenderly
       there than elsewhere, and the winds have a reverence for the graves, as if they felt it time
       that the dead were left in peace—the ‘happier dead,’ as poor immortal Tithonius calls them,
       who has not the gift of death. And the grey old tower and the weather stains on
       <pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7047-153"/> the stones; there is a conspiracy of beauty in the place,
       that holds one as one is held by music.”</p>
<p>“Ah! I know the magic of these things; it tempts one to believe at times that Nature is
        <emph>not</emph> all blind and unpitying. But that is a delusion: if there were any pity in
       Nature, the human spirit would not be dowered with such infinite and terrible longings and
       such capacities and dreams and prayers and then—then insulted with the mockery of death and
       annihilation.”</p>
<p>“If there should be no Beyond,” muttered Mrs. Temperley.</p>
<p>“That to me is inconceivable. When we die we fall into an eternal sleep. Moreover, I can
       see no creed that does not add the fear of future torments to the certainties of these.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Temperley was seized with a bitter mood. “You should cultivate faith,” she said; “it
       acts the part of the heading ‘Sundries omitted’ in one's weekly accounts; one can put down
       under it everything that can't be understood—but you don't keep weekly accounts, so it's no
       use pointing out to you the peace that comes of that device.”</p>
<p>The entrance of Sophia with firewood turned the current of conversation. “Good heavens! I
       don't think we have anything for lunch!” Mrs. Temperley exclaimed. “Are you very hungry? What
       is to be done? It was the faithlessness of our butcher that disturbed the serenity of my mood
       this morning. Perhaps the poor beast whose carcase we were intending to devour will feel
       serene instead of me: but, alas! I fear he has been slaughtered <foreign xml:lang="fre">quand
        même</foreign>. That is one of the unsatisfactory things about life: that all its worst
       miseries bring good to no one. One may deny oneself, but not a living thing is necessarily
       the better for it—generally many are the worse. The wheels of pain go turning day by day, and
       the gods stand aloof—they will not help us, nor will they stay the ‘wild world’ in its
       course. No, no,” added Mrs. Temperley with a laugh, “I am not tired of life, but I am tired
        <emph>with</emph> it; it won't give me what I want. That is perhaps because I want so
       much.”</p>
<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7047-154"/>
<p>The sound of male footsteps in the hall broke up the colloquy.</p>
<p>“Good heavens! Hubert has brought home a crowd of people to lunch,” exclaimed Hadria, “a
       thing he scarcely ever does. What fatality can have induced him to choose to-day of all
       others for this orgy of hospitality?”</p>
<p>“Does the day matter?” enquired Valeria, astonished at so much emotion.</p>
<p>“<emph>Does the day matter!</emph> Oh irresponsible question of the unwedded! When I tell
       you the butcher has not sent the meat.”</p>
<p>“Oh ... can't one eat fish?” suggested Miss Du Prel.</p>
<p>Hadria laughed and opened the door.</p>
<p>“My dear, I have brought Fleming home to lunch.”</p>
<p>“Thank heaven, <emph>only one!</emph>”</p>
<p>Temperley stared.</p>
<p>“I could not conveniently have brought home several,” he said.</p>
<p>“I thought you would be at least seven,” cried the mistress of the house, “and with all the
       pertinacity of Wordsworth's little girl.”</p>
<p>“What <emph>do</emph> you mean, if one may ask for simple English?”</p>
<p>“Merely that that intolerable Sanders has broken his word—<foreign xml:lang="lat">hinc illæ
        lacrimæ</foreign>.”</p>
<p>Hubert Temperley turned away in annoyance. He used to be amused by his wife's flippancy
       before her marriage, but he had long since grown to dislike it. He retired to get out some
       wine, while Hadria went forward to welcome the guest, who now came in from the garden, where
       he had lingered to talk to the children.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to see you, Mr. Fleming; but I am grieved to say that we have unluckily
       only a wretched luncheon to give you, and after your long walk over the fields too! I am
        <emph>so</emph> sorry. The fact is we are left, this morning, with a gaping larder, at the
       mercy of a haughty and inconstant butcher, who grinds down his helpless dependents without
       mercy, over-
       <pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7047-155"/> bearing creature that he is. We must ask you to be very
       tolerant.”</p>
<p>“Oh! please don't trouble about that; it doesn't matter in the least,” cried Mr. Fleming,
       pulling at his yellowish whiskers. He was a man of about five-and-thirty, of medium height,
       dressed in knickerbockers and Norfolk jacket that had seen some service.</p>
<p>“What is the difficulty?” asked Hubert.</p>
<p>“I was explaining to Mr. Fleming how inhospitably we are forced to treat him, on account of
       that traitor Sanders.”</p>
<p>Hubert gave a gesture of annoyance.</p>
<p>“I suppose there is something cold in the house.”</p>
<p>“Pudding, perhaps,” said his wife hopelessly. “It is most unlucky.”</p>
<p>“My dear, surely there must be something cold that isn't pudding.”</p>
<p>“I fear, very little; but I will go and see the cook, though, alas! she is not easy to
       inspire as regards her particular business. She is extremely entertaining as a
       conversationalist, but I think she was meant for society rather than the kitchen. I am sure
       society would be more diverting if she were in it.”</p>
<p>Hadria was just turning to seek this misplaced genius, when she paused in the doorway.</p>
<p>“By the way, I suppose Sapphira has—”</p>
<p>“Do try and cure yourself of the habit of calling the girl by that absurd name,
       Hadria.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes; but the name is so descriptive. She has told you of Miss Du Prel's arrival?”</p>
<p>“She has told me nothing of the sort.”</p>
<p>Temperley did not look overjoyed. There had never been much cordiality between him and
       Valeria since the afternoon when they had met at Dunaghee, and found their sentiments in
       hopeless opposition.</p>
<p>Miss Du Prel took no interest in Hubert, though she admired his character. She had every
       wish to make herself agreeable to him, but her efforts in that direction were somewhat
       <pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7047-156"/> what neutralized by an incurable absence of mind. If she
       was not interested, as Hadria said, she was seldom affable.</p>
<p>Possibly Hubert's request to her, years ago at Dunaghee, to “think for a moment” had not
       been forgiven.</p>
<p>“Where is she? Oh!—”</p>
<p>The exclamation was in consequence of Miss Du Prel's appearing at the door of the library,
       whence she surveyed the group with absent-minded intentness.</p>
<p>Valeria woke up with a start, and responded to Hubert's greeting in an erratic fashion,
       replying tragically, to a casual enquiry as to her health, that she had been
        <emph>frightfully</emph> ill.</p>
<p>“I thought I was dying. But one never dies,” she added in a disgusted tone, whereat Hadria
       heartlessly laughed, and hurried the visitor upstairs to help her to unpack.</p>
<p>“Valeria,” said Mrs. Temperley, while that lady was confusedly trying to disentangle hat
       and hair, hat-pin and head, without involving the entire system in a common ruin—“Valeria, we
       are not a remarkable people at Craddock Dene. We may be worthy, we may have our good points,
       but we are not brilliant (except the cook). Should Mr. Fleming fail to impress you as a
       person of striking personality, I ask you, as a favour, <emph>not</emph> to emblazon that
       impression on every feature: should he address to you a remark that you do not find
       interesting, and it is quite conceivable that he may—do not glare at him scornfully for a
       moment, and—”</p>
<p>Hadria was not allowed to finish the sentence.</p>
<p>“As if I ever did any such thing—and people are <emph>so</emph> dull,” said Miss Du
       Prel.</p>
<p>A few “curried details,” as the hostess dejectedly described the fare, had been
       supplemented with vegetables, fruit, and impromptu preparations of eggs, and the luncheon was
       pronounced excellent and ample.</p>
<p>Miss Du Prel said that she hoped the butcher would always forget to send the meat. She
       liked these imaginative meals.</p>
<p>Temperley purposely misunderstood her to say “imaginary
       <pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7047-157"/> meals,” and hoped that next time she came, Hadria would
       not have an oratorio in course of composition. Miss Du Prel expressed a fiery interest in the
       oratorio.</p>
<p>“I judge the presence of oratorio by the absence of food,” Temperley explained suavely.</p>
<p>Hadria watched the encounter with a mingled sense of amusement and discomfort.</p>
<p>Valeria was in no danger. To be morally crushed by an adversary, it is necessary that one
       should be at least aware that the adversary is engaged in crushing one: a consciousness that
       was plainly denied to Miss Du Prel. Many a man far less able than Hubert had power to
       interest her, while he could not even hold her attention. She used to complain to Professor
       Fortescue that Temperley's ideas never seemed to have originated in his own brain: they had
       been imported ready-made. Hubert was among the many who shrink and harden into mental furrows
       as time passes. What he had thought at twenty, at thirty-five had acquired sanctity and
       certainty, from having been the opinion of Hubert Temperley for all those favoured years. He
       had no suspicion that the views which he cherished in so dainty and scholarly a fashion were
       simply an <foreign xml:lang="fre">edition de luxe</foreign> of the views of everybody else.
       But his wife had made that discovery long ago. He smiled at the views of everybody else: his
       own were put forth as something choice and superior. He had the happy knack of being <foreign xml:lang="fre">bourgeois</foreign> with the air of an artist. If one could picture one's
       grocer weighing out sugar in a Spanish cloak and brigand's hat, it would afford an excellent
       symbol of his spiritual estate. To be perfectly commonplace in a brilliantly original way, is
       to be notable after all.</p>
<p>Mr. Fleming seemed puzzled by Miss Du Prel, at whom he glanced uneasily from time to time,
       wondering what she would say next. At Craddock Dene, ladies usually listened with a more or
       less breathless deference when Temperley spoke. This new-comer seemed recklessly
       independent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Temperley endeavoured to lead the conversation in
       <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7047-158"/> ways of peace, but Valeria was evidently on the war-path.
       Temperley was polite and ironical, with undermeanings for Hadria's benefit.</p>
<p>“If one asks impossible things of life, one is apt to be disappointed, I fear,” he said
       serenely. “Ask for the possible and natural harvest of a woman's career, and see if you don't
       get it.”</p>
<p>“Let a canary plead for its cage, in short, and its commendable prayer will be
       answered!”</p>
<p>“If you like to put it thus ungraciously. I should say that one who makes the most of his
       opportunities, as they stand, fares better than he who sighs for other worlds to
       conquer.”</p>
<p>“I suppose that is what his relatives said to Columbus,” observed Miss Du Prel.</p>
<p>“And how do you know they were not right?” he retorted.</p>
<p>Mrs. Temperley gave the signal to rise. “Let's go for a walk,” she suggested, “the
       afternoon invites us. Look at it.”</p>
<p>The brilliant sunshine and the exercise brought about a more genial mood. Only once was
       there anything approaching friction, and then it was Hadria herself who caused it.</p>
<p>“Yes, we all flatter ourselves that we are observing life, when we are merely noting the
       occasions when some musty old notion of ours happens, by chance, to get fulfilled.”</p>
<p>Hubert Temperley at once roused Miss Du Prel's interest by the large stores of information
       that he had to pour forth on the history of the district, from its earliest times to the
       present. He recalled the days when these lands that looked so smooth and tended had been mere
       wastes of marsh and forest.</p>
<p>How quickly these great changes were accomplished! Valeria stood on the brow of a wide
       corn-field, looking out over the sleeping country. A century, after all, was not much more
       than one person's lifetime, yet in scarcely nine of these—nine little troubled lifetimes—what
       incredible things had occurred in this island of ours! How did it all come about? “Not
       assuredly,” Valeria remarked with sudden malice,
       <pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7047-159"/> “by taking things as they stood, and making the best of
       them with imbecile impatience. If everyone had done that, what sort of an England should I
       have had stretching before my eyes at this moment?”</p>
<p>“You would not have been here to see,” said Hadria, lazily rolling stones down the hill
       with her foot. “We should all of us have been dancing round some huge log-fire on the borders
       of a primeval forest, and instead of browsing on salads, as we did to-day, we should be
       sustaining ourselves on the unholy nourishment of boiled parent or grilled aunt.”</p>
<p>Mr. Temperley's refined appearance and manner seemed to raise an incarnate protest against
       this revolting picture. For some occult reason, the imagination of all was at work especially
       and exclusively on the figure of that polished gentleman in war-paint and feathers, sporting
       round the cauldron that contained the boiled earthly remains of his relations.</p>
<p>Mr. Fleming betrayed the common thought by remarking that it would be very becoming to
       him.</p>
<p>“Ah! I wish we <emph>were</emph> all savages in feathers and war-paint, dancing on the edge
       of some wild forest, with nothing but the sea and the sky for limits!”</p>
<p>Miss Du Prel surprised her audience by this earnest aspiration.</p>
<p>“Do you feel inclined to revert?” Hadria enquired. “Because if so, I shall be glad to join
       you.”</p>
<p>“I think there <emph>is</emph> a slight touch of the savage about Mrs. Temperley,” observed
       Fleming pensively. “I mean, don't you know—of course—.”</p>
<p>“You are quite right!” cried Valeria. “I have often noticed a sort of wildness that crops
       up now and then through a very smooth surface. Hadria may sigh for the woodlands, yet—!”</p>
