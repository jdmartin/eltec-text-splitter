<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<p>THE first break in the unity of the Fullerton family had occurred on the occasion
       of Hadria's marriage. The short period that elapsed between that memorable New-Year's-Eve and
       the wedding had been a painful experience for Dunaghee. Hadria's conduct had shaken her
       brothers' faith in her and in all womankind. Ernest especially had suffered disillusion. He
       had supposed her above the ordinary, pettier weaknesses of humanity. Other fellows' sisters
       had seemed to him miserable travesties of their sex compared with her. (There was one
       exception only, to this rule.) But now, what was he to think? She had shattered his faith. If
       she hadn't been “so cocksure of herself,” he wouldn't have minded so much; but after all she
       had professed, to go and marry, and marry a starched specimen like that!</p>
<p>Fred was equally emphatic. For a long time he had regarded it all as a joke. He shook his
       head knowingly, and said that sort of thing wouldn't go down. When he was at length
       convinced, he danced with rage. He became cynical. He had no patience with girls. They talked
       for talking's sake. It meant nothing.</p>
<p>Algitha understood, better than her brothers could understand, how Hadria's emotional
       nature had been caught in some strange mood, how the eloquent assurances of her lover might
       have half convinced her. Algitha's own experience of proposals set her on the track of the
       mystery.</p>
<p>“It is most misleading,” she pointed out, to her scoffing brothers. “One would suppose that
       marrying was the simplest thing in the world—nothing perilous, nothing to object to
       <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7047-161"/> about it. A man proposes to you as if he were asking you
       for the sixth waltz, only his manner is perfervid. And my belief is that half the girls who
       accept don't realize that they are agreeing to anything much more serious.”</p>
<p>“The more fools they!”</p>
<p>“True; but it really is most bewildering. Claims, obligations, all the ugly sides of the
       affair are hidden away; the man is at his best, full of refinement and courtesy and
       unselfishness. And if he persuades the girl that he really does care for her, how can she
       suppose that she cannot trust her future to him—if he loves her? And yet she can't!”</p>
<p>“How can a man suppose that one girl is going to be different from every other girl?” asked
       Fred.</p>
<p>“Different, you mean, from what he <emph>supposes</emph> every other girl to be,” Algitha
       corrected. “It's his own look-out if he's such a fool.”</p>
<p>“I believe Hadria married because she was sick of being the family consolation,” said
       Ernest.</p>
<p>“Well, of course, the hope of escape was very tempting. You boys don't know what she went
       through. We all regret her marriage to Hubert Temperley—though between ourselves, not more
       than <emph>he</emph> regrets it, if I am not much mistaken—but it is very certain that she
       could not have gone on living at home much longer, as things were.”</p>
<p>Fred said that she ought to have broken out after Algitha's fashion, if it was so bad as
       all that.</p>
<p>“I think mother would have died if she had,” said the sister.</p>
<p>“Hadria <emph>was</emph> awkwardly placed,” Fred admitted.</p>
<p>“Do you remember that evening in the garret when we all told her what we thought?” asked
       Ernest.</p>
<p>Nobody had forgotten that painful occasion.</p>
<p>“She said then that if the worst came to the worst, she would simply run away. What could
       prevent her?”</p>
<p>“That wretched sister of his!” cried Algitha. “If it hadn't been for her, the marriage
       would never have taken
       <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7047-162"/> place. She got the ear of mother after the engagement, and
       I am certain it was through her influence that mother hurried the wedding on so. If only
       there had been a little more time, it could have been prevented. And Henriette knew that. She
       is as <emph>knowing</emph>—”</p>
<p>“I wish we had strangled her.”</p>
<p>“I shall never forget,” Algitha went on, “that night when Hadria was taken with a fit of
       terror—it was nothing less—and wrote to break off the engagement, and that woman undertook to
       deliver the letter and lost it, <emph>on purpose</emph> I am always convinced, and then the
       favourable moment was over.”</p>
<p>“What made her so anxious for the marriage beats me,” cried Ernest. “It was not a
       particularly good match from a mercenary point of view.”</p>
<p>“She thought us an interesting family to marry into,” suggested Fred, “which is
       undeniable.”</p>
<p>“Then she must be greatly disappointed at seeing so little of us!” cried Ernest.</p>
<p>In the early days, Miss Temperley had stayed frequently at the Red House, and Hadria had
       been cut off from her own family, who detested Henriette.</p>
<p>For a year or more, there had been a fair promise of a successful adjustment of the two
       incongruous natures in the new conditions. They both tried to keep off dangerous ground and
       to avoid collisions of will. They made the most of their one common interest, although even
       here they soon found themselves out of sympathy. Hubert's instincts were scholastic and
       lawful, Hadria was disposed to daring innovation. Her bizarre compositions shocked him
       painfully. The two jarred on one another, in great things and in small. The halcyon period
       was short-lived. The dream, such as it was, came to an end. Hubert turned to his sister, in
       his bewilderment and disappointment. They had both counted so securely on the effect of
       experience and the pressure of events to teach Hadria the desirable lesson, and they were
       dismayed
       <pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7047-163"/> to find that, unlike other women, she had failed to learn
       it. Henriette was in despair. It was she who had brought about the ill-starred union. How
       could she ever forgive herself? How repair the error she had made? Only by devoting herself
       to her brother, and trying patiently to bring his wife to a wiser frame of mind.</p>
<p>A considerable time had elapsed, during which Hadria saw her brothers and sister only at
       long intervals. Ernest had become estranged from her, to her great grief. He was as courteous
       and tender in his manner to her as of yore, but there was a change, not to be mistaken. She
       had lost the brother of her girlhood for ever. While it bitterly grieved, it did not surprise
       her. She acknowledged in dismay the inconsistency of her conduct. She must have been mad! The
       universal similarity in the behaviour of girls, herself included, alarmed her. Was there some
       external will that drove them all, in hordes, to their fate? Were all the intricacies of
       event and circumstance, of their very emotion, merely the workings of that ruthless cosmic
       will by which the individual was hypnotised and ruled?</p>
<p>As usual at critical moments, Hadria had been solitary in her encounter with the elements
       of Fate. There were conflicts that even her sister knew nothing about, the bewilderments and
       temptations of a nature hampered in its action by its own voluminous qualities and its
       caprice.</p>
<p>Her brothers supposed that in a short time Hadria would be “wearing bonnets and a
       card-case, and going the rounds with an elegant expression like the rest of them.”</p>
<p>How different were the little local facts of life—the little chopped-up life that
       accumulates in odds and ends from moment to moment—from the sun-and-smoke vision of early
       irresponsible days!</p>
<p>Mrs. Fullerton was pleased with the marriage, not merely because Hubert's father, Judge
       Temperley, could secure for his son a prosperous career, but because she was so thankful to
       see a strange, unaccountable girl like Hadria settling
       <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7047-164"/> quietly down, with a couple of children to keep her out of
       mischief.</p>
<p>That was what it had come to! Perhaps they calculated a little too surely. Possibly even
       two children might not keep her entirely out of mischief. Out of what impulse of malice had
       Fate pitched upon the most essentially mutinous and erratic of the whole brood, for the
       sedatest <foreign xml:lang="fre">rôle</foreign>? But perhaps Fate, too, had calculated
       unscientifically. Mischief was always possible, if one gave one's mind to it. Or was she
       growing too old to have the spirit for thorough-going devilry? Youth seemed rather an affair
       of mental outlook than of years. She felt twenty years older since her marriage. She wondered
       why it was that marriage did not make all women wicked,—openly and actively so. If ever there
       was an arrangement by which every evil instinct and every spark of the devil was likely to be
       aroused and infuriated, surely the customs and traditions that clustered round this estate
       constituted that dangerous combination! Hardship, difficulty, tragedy could be faced, but not
       the humiliating, the degrading, the contemptible. Hadria had her own particular ideas as to
       what ought to be set down under these headings. Most women, she found, ranked certain
       elements very differently, with lavish use of halos and gilding in their honour, feeling
       perhaps, she hinted, the dire need of such external decoration.</p>
<p>Good heavens! Did no other woman realize the insult of it all? Hadria knew so few women
       intimately; none intimately enough to be convinced that no such revolt lay smouldering
       beneath their smiles. She had a lonely assurance that she had never met the sister-soul (for
       such there must be by the score, as silent as she), who shared her rage and her detestations.
       Valeria, with all her native pride, regarded these as proof of a big flaw in an otherwise
       sound nature. Yet how deep, how passionately strong, these feelings were, how gigantic the
       flaw!</p>
<p>What possessed people that they did not see what was so
       <pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7047-165"/> brutally clear? As young girls led forth unconscious into
       the battle, with a bandage over their eyes, and cotton-wool in their ears—yes, then it was
       inevitable that the! should see and hear nothing. Had they been newly imported from the moon
       they could scarcely have less acquaintance with terrestrial conditions; but afterwards, when
       ruthlessly, with the grinning assistance of the onlookers, the facts of the social scheme
       were cynically revealed, and the <foreign xml:lang="fre">rôle</foreign> imperiously
       allotted—with much admonition and moving appeals to conscience and religion, and all the
       other aides-de-camp at command—after all that, how in the name of heaven could they continue
       to “babble of green fields”? Was it conceivable that among the thousands of women to whom
       year after year the facts were disclosed, not one understood and not
       one—<emph>hated</emph>?</p>
<p>A flame sprang up in Hadria's eyes. There must be other women somewhere at this very
       moment, whose whole being was burning up with this bitter, this sickening and futile hatred!
       But how few, how few! How vast was the meek majority, fattening on indignity, proud of their
       humiliation! Yet how wise they were after all. It hurt so to hate—to hate like this.
       Submission was an affair of temperament, a gift of birth. Nature endowed with a serviceable
       meekness those whom she designed for insult. Yet it might not be meekness so much as mere
       brutal necessity that held them all in thrall—the inexorable logic of conditions. Fate knew
       better than to assail the victim point blank, and so put her on her guard. No; she lured her
       on gently, cunningly, closing behind her, one by one, the doors of escape, persuading her,
       forcing her to fasten on her own tethers, appealing to a thousand qualities, good and bad;
       now to a moment's weakness or pity, now to her eternal fear of grieving others
        (<emph>that</emph> was a well-worked vein!), now to her instinct of self-sacrifice, now to
       grim necessity itself, profiting too by the increasing discouragements, the vain efforts, the
       physical pain and horrible weariness, the crowding of little difficulties, harassments, the
       troubles of others—ah! how infinite were these! so that there was no
       <pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7047-166"/> interval for breathing, and scarcely time or space to cope
       with the legions of the moment; the horizon was black with their advancing hosts!</p>
<p>And this assuredly was no unique experience. Hadria remembered how she had once said that
       if the worst came to the worst, it would be easy to run away. To her inexperience desperate
       remedies had seemed so simple, so feasible—the factors of life so few and unentwined. She had
       not understood how prolific are our deeds, how an act brings with it a large and unexpected
       progeny, which surround us with new influences and force upon us unforeseen conditions. Yet
       frequent had been the impulse to adopt that girlish solution of the difficulty. She had no
       picturesque grievances of the kind that would excite sympathy. On the contrary, popular
       feeling would set dead against her; she would be acting on an idea that nobody shared, not
       even her most intimate friend.</p>
<p>Miss Du Prel had arrived at the conclusion that she did not understand Hadria. She had
       attributed many of her peculiarities to her unique education and her inexperience. Hadria had
       indeed changed greatly since her marriage, but not in the manner that might have been
       expected. On the contrary, a closer intimacy with popular social ideals had fired her with a
       more angry spirit of rebellion. Miss Du Prel had met examples of every kind of eccentricity,
       but she had never before come upon so marked an instance of this particular type. Hadria's
       attitude towards life had suggested to Miss Du Prel the idea of her heroine,
        <title>Caterina</title>. She remonstrated with Hadria, assuring her that no insult towards
       women was intended in the general scheme of society, and that it was a mistake to regard it
       in so resentful a spirit.</p>
<p>“But that is just the most insulting thing about it,” Hadria exclaimed. “Insult is so much
       a matter of course that people are surprised if one takes umbrage at it. Read this passage
       from Aristotle that I came upon the other day. He is perfectly calm and amiable, entirely
       unconscious of offence, when he says that ‘a wife ought to shew herself even more
       <pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7047-167"/> obedient to the rein than if she entered the house as a
       purchased slave. For she has been bought at a high price, for the sake of sharing life and
       bearing children, than which no higher or holier tie can possibly exist.’ (Henriette to the
       very life!)”</p>
<p>Miss Du Prel laughed, and re-read the passage from the <title>Politics</title>, in some
       surprise.</p>
<p>“Do you suppose insult is deliberately intended in that graceful sentiment?” asked Hadria.
       “Obviously not. If any woman of that time had blazed up in anger at the well-meant speech,
       she would have astonished and grieved her contemporaries. Aristotle doubtless professed a
       high respect for women who followed his precepts—as men do now when we are obedient.”</p>
<p>“Of course, our society in this particular has not wandered far from the Greek idea,” Miss
       Du Prel observed pensively.</p>
<p>Hadria pronounced the paradox, “The sharpness of the insult lies in its not being
       intended.”</p>
<p>Miss Du Prel could not prevail upon her to modify the assertion. Hadria pointed out that
       the Greeks also meant no offence in regarding their respectable women as simple reproductive
       agents of inferior human quality.</p>
<p>“And though our well-brought-up girls shrink from the frank speech, they do not appear to
       shrink from the ideas of the old Greeks. They don't mind playing the part of cows so long as
       one doesn't mention it.”</p>
<p>About eighteen months ago, the village had been full of talk and excitement in consequence
       of the birth of an heir to the house of Engleton, Lady Engleton's mission in life being
       frankly regarded as unfulfilled during the previous three or four years, when she had
       disappointed the hopes of the family. Hadria listened scornfully. In her eyes, the crowning
       indignity of the whole affair was Lady Engleton's own smiling acceptance of the position, and
       her complacent eagerness to produce the tardy inheritor of the property and honours. This
       expression of sentiment had, by some means, reached the Vicarage and created much
       consternation.</p>
<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7047-168"/>
<p>Mrs. Walker asserted that it was right and Christian of the lady to desire that which gave
       every one so much pleasure. “A climax of feminine abjectness!” Hadria had exclaimed in
       Henriette's presence.</p>
<p>Miss Temperley, after endeavouring to goad her sister-in-law into the expression of
       jubilant congratulations, was met by the passionate declaration that she felt more disposed
       to weep than to rejoice, and more disposed to curse than to weep.</p>
<p>Obviously, Miss Temperley had reason to be uneasy about her part in bringing about her
       brother's marriage.</p>
<p>These sudden overflows of exasperated feeling had become less frequent as time went on, but
       the neighbours looked askance at Mrs. Temperley. Though a powder-magazine may not always blow
       up, one passes it with a grave consciousness of vast stores of inflammable material lying
       somewhere within, and who knows what spark might set the thing spouting to the skies?</p>
<p>When the occasional visitors had left, life in the village settled down to its normal
       level, or more accurately, to its normal flatness as regarded general contours, and its petty
       inequalities in respect to local detail. It reminded Hadria of the landscape which stretched
       in quiet long lines to the low horizon, while close at hand, the ground fussed and fretted
       itself into minor ups and downs of no character, but with all the trouble of a mountain
       district in its complexities of slope and hollow. Hadria suffered from a gnawing
       home-sickness; a longing for the rougher, bleaker scenery of the North.</p>
<p>The tired spirit translated the homely English country, so deeply reposeful in its spirit,
       into an image of dull unrest. If only those broken, stupid lines could have been smoothed out
       into the grandeur of a plain, Hadria thought that it would have comforted her, as if a song
       had moved across it with the long-stretching winds. As it was, to look from her window only
       meant to find repeated the trivialities of life, more picturesque indeed, but still
       trivialities. It was the estimable and domestic qualities of Nature that presented
       themselves:
       <pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7047-169"/> Nature in her most maternal and uninspired mood—Mother
       earth submissive to the dictatorship of man, permitting herself to be torn, and wounded, and
       furrowed, and harrowed at his pleasure, yielding her substance and her life to sustain the
       produce of his choosing, her body and her soul abandoned supine to his caprice. The sight had
       an exasperating effect upon Hadria. Its symbolism haunted her. The calm, sweet English
       landscape affected her at times with a sort of disgust. It was, perhaps, the same in kind as
       the far stronger sensation of disgust that she felt when she first saw Lady Engleton with her
       new-born child, full of pride and exultation. It was as much as she could do to shake hands
       with the happy mother.</p>
<p>When Valeria expressed dismay at so strange a feeling Hadria had refused to be treated as a
       solitary sinner. There were plenty of fellow-culprits, she said, only they did not dare to
       speak out. Let Valeria study girls and judge for herself.</p>
<p>Hadria was challenged to name a girl.</p>
<p>Well, Algitha for one. Hadria also suspected Marion Jordan, well-drilled though she was by
       her dragoon of a mother.</p>
<p>Valeria would not hear of it. Marion Jordan! the gentlest, timidest, most typical of young
       English girls! Impossible!</p>
<p>“I am almost sure of it, nevertheless,” said Hadria. “Oh, believe me, it is common enough!
       Few grasp it intellectually perhaps, but thousands feel the insult; of that I am morally
       certain.”</p>
<p>“What leads you to think so in Marion's case?”</p>
<p>“Some look, or tone, or word; something slight, but to my mind conclusive. Fellow-sinners
       detect one another, you know.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don't understand what the world is coming to!” exclaimed Miss Du Prel. “Where are
       the natural instincts?”</p>
<p>“Sprouting up for the first time perhaps,” Hadria suggested.</p>
<p>“They seem to be disappearing, if what you say has the slightest foundation.”</p>
<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7047-170"/>
<p>“Oh, you are speaking of only <emph>one</emph> kind of instinct. The others have all been
       suppressed. Perhaps women are not altogether animals after all. The thought is startling, I
       know. Try to face it.”</p>
<p>“I never supposed they were,” cried Valeria, a little annoyed.</p>
<p>“But you never made allowance for the suppressed instincts,” said Hadria.</p>
<p>“I don't believe they <emph>can</emph> be suppressed.”</p>
<p>“I believe they can be not merely suppressed, but killed past hope of recovery. And I also
       believe that there may be, that there <emph>must</emph> be, ideas and emotions fermenting in
       people's brains, quite different from those that they are supposed and ordered to cherish,
       and that these heresies go on working in secret for years before they become even suspected,
       and then suddenly the population exchange confessions.”</p>
<p>“After that the Deluge!” exclaimed Miss Du Prel. “You describe the features of a great
       revolution.”</p>
<p>“So much the better,” said Hadria; “and when the waters sink again, a nice fresh clean
       world!”</p>
