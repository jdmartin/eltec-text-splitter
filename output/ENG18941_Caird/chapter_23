<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<p>“<hi>PROFESSOR THEOBALD</hi>, if you are able to resist the fascinations of this old house
       you are made of sterner stuff than I thought.”</p>
<p>“I can never resist fascinations, Lady Engleton.”</p>
<p>“Do you ever try?”</p>
<p>“My life is spent in the endeavour.”</p>
<p>“How foolish!” Whether this applied to the endeavour or to the remark, did not quite
       appear. Lady Engleton's graceful figure leant over the parapet.</p>
<p>“Do you know, Mrs. Temperley,” she said in her incessantly vivacious manner, “I have
       scarcely heard a serious word since our two Professors came to us. Isn't it disgraceful? I
       naturally expected to be improved and enlightened, but they are both so frivolous, I can't
       keep them for a moment to any important subject. They refuse to be profound. It is
        <emph>I</emph> who have to be profound.”</p>
<p>“While <emph>we</emph> endeavour to be charming,” said Professor Theobald.</p>
<p>“You may think that flattering, but I confess it seems to me a beggarly compliment (as
       men's to women usually are).”</p>
<p>“You expect too much of finite intelligence, Lady Engleton.”</p>
<p>“This is how I am always put off! If it were not that you are both such old friends—you are
       a sort of cousin I think, Professor Fortescue—I should really feel aggrieved. One has to
       endure so much more from relations. No, but really; I appeal to Mrs. Temperley. When one is
       hungering for erudition, to be offered compliments! Not that I can
       <pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7047-210"/> accuse Professor Fortescue of compliments,” she added with
       a laugh; “wild horses would not drag one from him. I angle vainly. But he is so ridiculously
       young. He enjoys things as if he were a schoolboy. Does one look for that in one's
       Professors? He talks of the country as if it were <title>Paradise Regained</title>.”</p>
<p>“So it is to me,” he said with a smile.</p>
<p>“But that is not your <foreign xml:lang="fre">rôle</foreign>. You have to think, not to
       enjoy.”</p>
<p>“Then you must not invite us to Craddock Place,” Professor Theobald stipulated.</p>
<p>“As usual, a halting compliment.”</p>
<p>“To take you seriously, Lady Engleton,” said Professor Fortescue, “(though I know it is a
       dangerous practice) one of the great advantages of an occasional think is to enable one to
       relish the joys of mental vacuity, just as the pleasure of idleness is never fully known till
       one has worked.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” sighed Lady Engleton, “I know I don't extract the full flavour out of
        <emph>that</emph>!”</p>
<p>“It is a neglected art,” said the Professor. “After worrying himself with the problems of
       existence, as the human being is prone to do, as soon as existence is more or less secure and
       peaceful, a man can experience few things more enjoyable than to leave aside all problems and
       go out into the fields, into the sun, to feel the life in his veins, the world at the
       threshold of his five senses.”</p>
<p>“All, now you really are profound at last, Professor!”</p>
<p>“I thought it was risky to take you seriously.”</p>
<p>“No, no, I am delighted. The world at the threshold of one's five senses. One has but to
       look and to listen and the beauty of things displays itself for our benefit. Yes, but that is
       what the artists say, not the Professors.”</p>
<p>“Even a Professor is human,” pleaded Theobald.</p>
<p>Valeria quoted some lines that she said expressed Professor Fortescue's idea.</p>

<l>“Carry me out into the wind and the sunshine,</l>
<l rend="ti-1">Into the beautiful world!”</l>

<p>Lady Engleton's artistic instinct seemed to occupy itself less with the interpretation of
       Nature than with the appreciation of the handiwork of man. The lines did not stir her.
       Professor Theobald shared her indifference for the poetic expression, but not for the reality
       expressed.</p>
<p>“I quarrel with you about art,” said Lady Engleton. “Art is art, and nature is nature, both
       charming in their way, though I prefer art.”</p>
<p>“Our old quarrel!” said the Professor.</p>
<p>“Because a wild glade is beautiful in its quality of wild glade, you can't see the beauty
       in a trim bit of garden, with its delightful suggestion of human thought and care.”</p>
<p>“I object to stiffness,” said Professor Theobald.</p>
<p>His proposals to improve the stately old gardens at the Priory by adding what Lady Engleton
       called “fatuous wriggles to all the walks, for mere wrigglings' sake,” had led to hot
       discussions on the principles of art and the relation of symmetry to the sensibilities of
       mankind. Lady Engleton thought the Professor crude in taste, and shallow in knowledge, on
       this point.</p>
<p>“And yet you appreciate so keenly my old enamels, and your eye seeks out, in a minute, a
       picturesque roof or gable.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps Theobald leans to the picturesque and does not care for the classic,” suggested
       his colleague; “a fundamental distinction in mental bias.”</p>
<p>“Then why does he enjoy so much of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">Renaissance</foreign> work
       on caskets and goblets? He was raving about them last night in the choicest English.”</p>
<p>Lady Engleton crossed over to speak to Miss Du Prel. Professor Theobald approached Mrs.
       Temperley and Joseph Fleming. Hadria knew by some instinct that the Professor had been
       waiting for an opportunity to speak to her. As he drew near, a feeling of intense enmity
       arose within her, which reached its highest pitch when he addressed her in a fine, low-toned
       voice of peculiarly fascinating quality. Every instinct rose up as if in warning. He sat down
       beside her, and began
       <pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7047-212"/> to talk about the Priory and its history. His ability was
       obvious, even in his choice of words and his selection of incidents. He had the power of
       making dry archæological facts almost dramatic. His speech differed from that of most men, in
       the indefinable manner wherein excellence differs from mediocrity. Yet Hadria was glad to
       notice some equally indefinable lack, corresponding perhaps to the gap in his consciousness
       that Lady Engleton had come upon in their discussions on the general principles of art. What
       was it? A certain stilted, unreal quality? Scarcely. Words refused to fit themselves to the
       evasive form. Something that suggested the term “second class,” though whether it were the
       manner or the substance that was responsible for the impression, was difficult to say.</p>
<p>Sometimes his words allowed two possible interpretations to be put upon a sentence. He was
       a master of the ambiguous. Obviously it was not lack of skill that produced the double-faced
       phrases.</p>
<p>He did not leave his listeners long in doubt as to his personal history. He enjoyed talking
       about himself. He was a Professor of archæology, and had written various learned books on the
       subject. But his studies had by no means been confined to the one theme. History had also
       interested him profoundly. He had published a work on the old houses of England. The Priory
       figured among them. It was not difficult to discover from the conversation of this singular
       man, whose subtle and secretive instincts were contradicted, at times, by a strange
       inconsequent frankness, that his genuine feeling for the picturesque was accompanied by an
       equally strong predilection for the appurtenances of wealth and splendour; his love of great
       names and estates being almost of the calibre of the housemaid's passion for lofty personages
       in her penny periodical. He seemed to be a man of keen and cunning ability, who studied and
       played upon the passions and weaknesses of his fellows, possibly for their good, but always
       as a magician might deal with the beings subject to his power.
       <pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7047-213"/> By what strange lapse did he thus naïvely lay himself open
       to their smiles?</p>
<p>Hadria was amused at his occasional impulse of egotistic frankness (or what appeared to be
       such), when he would solemnly analyse his own character, admitting his instinct to deceive
       with an engaging and scholarly candour.</p>
<p>His penetrating eyes kept a watch upon his audience. His very simplicity seemed to be
       guarded by his keenness.</p>
<p>Hadria chafed under his persistent effort to attract and interest her. She gave a little
       inward shiver on finding that there was a vague, unaccountable, and unpleasant fascination in
       the personality of the man.</p>
<p>It was not charm, it was nothing that inspired admiration; it rather inspired curiosity and
       stirred the spirit of research, a spirit which evidently animated himself. She felt that, in
       order to investigate the workings of her mind and her heart, the Professor would have coolly
       pursued the most ruthless psychical experiments, no matter at what cost of anguish to
       herself. In the interests of science and humanity, the learned Professor would certainly not
       hesitate to make one wretched individual agonize.</p>
<p>His appeal to the intellect was stimulatingly strong; it was like a stinging wind, that
       made one walk at a reckless pace, and brought the blood tingling through every vein. That
       intellectual force could alone explain the fact of his being counted by Professor Fortescue
       as a friend. Even then it was a puzzling friendship. Could it be that to Professor Fortescue,
       he shewed only his best side? His manner was more respectful towards his colleague than
       towards other men, but even with him he was irreverent in his heart, as towards mankind in
       general.</p>
<p>To Hadria he spoke of Professor Fortescue with enthusiasm—praising his great power, his
       generosity, his genial qualities, and his uprightness; then he laughed at him as a modern Don
       Quixote, and sneered at his efforts to save animal suffering when he might have made a name
       that would
       <pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7047-214"/> never be forgotten, if he pursued a more fruitful branch
       of research.</p>
<p>Hadria remarked that Professor Theobald's last sentence had added the crowning dignity to
       his eulogium.</p>
<p>He glanced at her, as if taking her measure.</p>
<p>“Fortescue,” he called out, “I envy you your champion. You point, Mrs. Temperley, to lofty
       altitudes. I, as a mere man, cannot pretend to scale them.”</p>
<p>Then he proceeded to bring down feminine loftiness with virile reason.</p>
<p>“In this world, where there are so many other evils to combat, one feels that it is more
       rational to attack the more important first.”</p>
<p>“Ah! there is nothing like an evil to bolster up an evil,” cried Professor Fortescue; “the
       argument never fails. Every abuse may find shelter behind it. The slave trade, for instance;
       have we not white slavery in our midst? How inconsistent to trouble about negroes till our
       own people are truly free! Wife-beating? Sad; but then children are often shamefully
       ill-used. Wait till <emph>they</emph> are fully protected before fussing about wives. Protect
       children? Foolish knight-errant, when you ought to know that drunkenness is at the root of
       these crimes! Sweep away <emph>this</emph> curse, before thinking of the children. As for
       animals, how can any rational person consider <emph>their</emph> sufferings, when there are
       men, women, and children with wrongs to be redressed?”</p>
<p>Professor Theobald laughed.</p>
<p>“My dear Fortescue, I knew you would have some ingenious excuse for your amiable
       weaknesses.”</p>
<p>“It is easier to find epithets than answers, Theobald,” said the Professor with a smile. “I
       confess I wonder at a man of your logical power being taken in with this cheap argument, if
       argument it can be called.”</p>
<p>“It is my attachment to logic that makes me crave for consistency,” said Theobald, not over
       pleased at his friend's attack.</p>
<p>Professor Fortescue stared in surprise.</p>
<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7047-215"/>
<p>“But do you really mean to tell me that you think it logical to excuse one abuse by
       pointing to another?”</p>
<p>“I think that while there are ill-used women and children, it is certainly inconsistent to
       consider animals,” said Theobald.</p>
<p>“It does not occur to you that the spirit in man that permits abuse of power over animals
       is precisely the same devil-inspired spirit that expresses itself in cruelty towards
       children. Ah,” continued Professor Fortescue, shaking his head, “then you really are one of
       the many who help wrong to breed wrong, and suffering to foster suffering, all the world
       over. It is you and those who reason as you reason, who give to our miseries their terrible
       vitality. What arguments has evil ever given to evil! What shelter and succour cruelty offers
       eternally to cruelty!”</p>
<p> I can't attempt to combat this hobby of yours, Fortescue.”</p>
<p>“Again a be-littling epithet in place of an argument! But I know of old that on this
       subject your intellectual acumen deserts you, as it deserts nearly all men. You sink suddenly
       to lower spiritual rank, and employ reasoning that you would laugh to scorn in connection
       with every other topic.”</p>
<p>“You seem bent on crushing me,” exclaimed Theobald. “And Mrs. Temperley enjoys seeing me
       mangled. Talk about cruelty to animals! I call this cold-blooded devilry! Mrs. Temperley,
       come to my rescue!”</p>
<p>“So long as other forms of cruelty can be instanced, Professor Theobald, I don't see how,
       on your own shewing, you can expect any consistent person to raise a finger to help you,”
       Hadria returned. Theobald laughed.</p>
<p>“But I consider myself too important and valuable to be made the subject of this harsh
       treatment.”</p>
<p>“That is for others to decide. If it affords us amusement to torment you, and amusement
       benefits our nerves and digestion, how can you justly object? We must consider the greatest
       good of the greatest number; and we are twice as numerous as you.”</p>
<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7047-216"/>
<p>“You are delicious!” he exclaimed. Mrs. Temperley's manner stiffened.</p>
<p>Acute as the Professor was in many directions, he did not appear to notice the change.</p>
<p>His own manner was not above criticism.</p>
<p>“It is strange,” said Lady Engleton, in speaking of him afterwards to Hadria, “it is
       strange that his cleverness does not come to the rescue; but so far from that, I think it
       leads him a wild dance over boggy ground, like some will-o'-the-wisp, but for whose freakish
       allurements the good man might have trodden a quiet and inoffensive way.”</p>
<p>The only means of procuring the indispensable afternoon tea was to go on to the Red House,
       which Mrs. Temperley proposed that they should all do.</p>
<p>“And is there no shaking your decision about the Priory, Professor Theobald?” Lady Engleton
       asked as they descended the steps.</p>
<p>The Professor's quick glance sought Mrs. Temperley's before he answered. “I confess to
       feeling less heroic this afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Oh, good! We may perhaps have you for a neighbour after all.”</p>
