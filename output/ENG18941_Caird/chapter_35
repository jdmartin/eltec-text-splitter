<head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
<p>STUBBORNLY Hadria sent her packets to the publishers; the publishers as firmly
       returned them. She had two sets flying now, like tennis balls, she wrote to Miss Du Prel: one
       set across the Channel. The publishers, she feared, played the best game, but she had the
       English quality of not knowing when she was beaten. Valeria had succeeded in finding a place
       for two of the articles. This was encouraging, but funds were running alarmingly low.</p>
<p>The <foreign xml:lang="fre">apartement</foreign> would have either to be given up, or to be
       taken on for another term, at the end of the week. A decision must be made. Hadria was
       dismayed to find her strength beginning to fail. That made the thought of the future
       alarming. With health and vigour nothing seemed impossible, but without that—</p>
<p>It seemed absurd that there should be so much difficulty about earning a living. Other
       women had done it. Valeria had always made light of the matter—when she had the theory of the
       sovereignty of the will to support.</p>
<p>Another couple of articles which seemed to their creator to possess popular qualities were
       sent off.</p>
<p>But after a weary delay, they shared the fate of their predecessors. Hadria now moved into
       a smaller suite of rooms, parting regretfully with <corr>Therèse</corr>, and flinging herself
       once more on the mercy of a landlady. This time M. Thillard had discovered the lodging for
       her; a shabby, but sunny little house, kept by a motherly woman with a reputation for perfect
       honesty. Expenses were thus kept down, but unhappily very little was coming in to meet them.
       It was
       <pb n="326" xml:id="VAB7047-322"/> impossible to pull through the year at this rate. But, of
       course, there was daily hope of something turning up. The arrival of the post was always an
       exciting moment. At last Hadria wrote to ask Algitha to try and sell for her a spray of
       diamonds, worth about eighty pounds.</p>
<p>Time must be gained, at all hazards. Algitha tried everywhere, and enquired in all
       directions, but could not get more than five-and-twenty pounds for it. She felt anxious about
       her sister, and thought of coming over to Paris to see her, in order to talk over some
       matters that could no longer be kept out of sight.</p>
<p>Algitha had wished to give Hadria an opportunity for work and rest, and to avoid recurrence
       of worry; but it was no longer possible or fair to conceal the fact that there were troubles
       looming ahead, at Dunaghee. Their father had suffered several severe losses through some bank
       failures; and now that wretched company in which he had always had such faith appeared to be
       shaky, and if that were also to smash, the state of affairs would be desperate. Their father,
       in his optimistic fashion, still believed that the company would pull through. Of course all
       this anxiety was telling seriously on their mother. And, alas she had been fretting very much
       about Hadria. After Algitha's misdeed, this second blow struck hard.</p>
<p>One must act on one's own convictions and not on those of somebody else, however beloved
       that other person might be, but truly the penalty of daring to take an independent line of
       action was almost unbearably severe. It really seemed, at times, as if there were nothing for
       it but to fold one's hands and do exactly as one was bid. Algitha was beginning to wonder
       whether her own revolt was about to be expiated by a life-long remorse!</p>
<p>“Ah, if mother had only not sacrificed herself for us, how infinitely grateful I should
       feel to her now! What sympathy there might have been between us all! If she had but given
       herself a chance, how she might have helped us, and what
       <pb n="327" xml:id="VAB7047-323"/> a friend she might have been to us, and we to her! But she
       would not.”</p>
<p>Algitha said that her mother evidently felt Hadria's departure as a disgrace to the family.
       It was pathetic to hear her trying to answer people's casual questions about her, so as to
       conceal the facts without telling an untruth. Hadria was overwhelmed by this letter. Her
       first impulse was to pack up and go straight to Dunaghee. But as Algitha was there now, this
       seemed useless, at any rate for the present. And ought she after all to abandon her project,
       for which so much had been risked, so much pain inflicted? The question that she and Algitha
       thought they had decided long ago, began to beat again at the door of her conscience and her
       pity. Her reason still asserted that the suffering which people entail upon themselves,
       through a frustrated desire to force their own law of conduct on others, must be borne by
       themselves, as the penalty of their own tyrannous instinct and of their own narrow thought.
       It was utterly unfair to thrust that natural penalty of prejudice and of self-neglect on to
       the shoulders of others. Why should they be protected from the appointed punishment, by the
       offering of another life on the altar of their prejudice? Why should such a sacrifice be made
       in order to gratify their tyrannical desire to dictate? It was not fair, it was not
       reasonable.</p>
<p>Yet this conclusion of the intellect did not prevent the pain of pity and compunction, nor
       an inconsequent sense of guilt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it would be best, perhaps, to await Algitha's arrival, when affairs might be in a
       less uncertain state. All decision must be postponed till then. “Try and come soon,” she
       wrote to her sister.</p>
<p>To add to the anxieties of the moment, little Martha seemed to lose in energy since coming
       to the new abode, and Hadria began to fear that the house was not quite healthy. It was very
       cheap, and the landlady was honest, but if it had this serious drawback, another move, with
       probably another drawback, seemed to threaten. This was particularly troublesome, for who
       could tell how long it would
       <pb n="328" xml:id="VAB7047-324"/> be possible to remain in Paris? Hadria thought of the
       doctrine of the sovereignty of the will, and of all the grand and noble things that the
       Preposterous Society had said about it, not to mention Emerson and others—and she smiled.</p>
<p>However, she worked on, putting aside her anxieties, as far as was possible. She would not
       fail for lack of will, at any rate. But it was a hard struggle. Martha had to be very
       carefully watched just now.</p>
<p>Happily, after a few anxious days, she began to recover her fresh colour and her high
       spirits. The move would not be necessary, after all. Hadria had become more and more attached
       to the child, whose lovable qualities developed with her growth. She was becoming singularly
       like her unhappy mother, in feature and in colouring. Her eyes were large and blue and sweet,
       with a little touch of pathos in them that Hadria could not bear to see. It seemed almost
       like the after-glow of the mother's suffering.</p>
<p>Although adding to Hadria's anxieties, the child gave a sense of freshness and youth to the
       little <foreign xml:lang="fre">ménage</foreign>. She made the anxieties easier to bear.</p>
<p>Hadria came in, one morning, from her work, tired and full of foreboding. Hat and cloak
       were laid aside, and she sank into an arm-chair, lying back to lazily watch the efforts of
       the child to overturn the obstinate blue man, who was still the favourite plaything, perhaps
       because he was less amenable than the rest.</p>
<p>Martha looked up for sympathy. She wished to be helped in her persistent efforts to get the
       better of this upstart blue man with the red cap, who serenely resumed his erect position
       just as often as he was forced to the ground. He was a stout, healthy-looking person,
       inclining to <foreign xml:lang="fre">embonpoint</foreign>; bound to succeed, if only from
       sheer solidity of person. Hadria was drawn into the game, and the two spent a good half hour
       on the rug together, playing with that and other toys which Martha toddled off to the
       cupboard to collect. The child was in great delight. Hadria was playing with her; she liked
       that
       <pb n="329" xml:id="VAB7047-325"/> better than having Jean Paul Auguste to play with. He took
       her toys away and always wanted to play a different game.</p>
<p>The clock struck two. Hadria felt that she ought to go and see Madame Vauchelet; it was
       more than a week since she had called, and the kind old friend was always gently pained at an
       absence of that length.</p>
<p>Then there was an article to finish, and she ought really to write to Dunaghee and
       Henriette and—well the rest must wait. Several other calls were also more than due, but it
       was useless even to consider those to-day. In spite of an oppressive sense of having much to
       do—perhaps <emph>because</emph> of it—Hadria felt as if it were a sheer impossibility to rise
       from that hearthrug. Besides, Martha would not hear of it. A desire to rest, to idle, to
       float down the stream, instead of trying always to swim against it, became overpowering. The
       minutes passed away.</p>
<p>“The question is, Martha,” Hadria said gravely, as she proceeded to pile up a towering
       edifice of bricks, at the child's command, “the question is: Are we going to stick to our
       plan, or are we going to be beaten? Oh, take care, don't pull down the fairy palace! That is
       a bad trick that little fingers have. No, no, I must have my fairy palace; I won't have it
       pulled down. It is getting so fine, too; minarets and towers, and domes and pinnacles, all
       mixed beautifully. Such an architecture as you never saw! But some day perhaps you will see
       it. Those blue eyes look as if they were made for seeing it, in the time to come.”</p>
<p>“Pretty eyes!” said Martha with frank vanity, and then: “Pretty house!”</p>
<p>“It is indeed a pretty house; they all are. But they are so horribly shaky. The minarets
       are top-heavy, I fear. That's the fault of the makers of these bricks. They ought to make the
       solid ones in proper proportion. But they can't be persuaded.”</p>
<p>“Knock it down,” said Martha, thrusting forth a mischievous hand, which was caught in time
       to prevent entire destruction of the precious edifice. Half the minarets had fallen.</p>
<pb n="330" xml:id="VAB7047-326"/>
<p>“They must go up again,” said Hadria. “How cruel to spoil all the work and all the beauty.”
       But Martha laughed with the delight of easy conquest.</p>
<p>She watched with great interest the reconstruction, and seemed anxious that every detail
       should be finished and worthy her iconoclasm. Having satisfied herself that her strength
       would not be wasted on an incomplete object, she made a second attempt to lay the palace low.
       Again she was frustrated. The building had soared, by this time, to an ambitious height, and
       its splendour had reached the limits of the materials at command. The final pinnacle which
       was required to cope the structure had been mislaid. Hadria was searching for it, when
       Martha, seizing her chance, struck the palace a blow in its very heart, and in an instant,
       the whole was a wreck.</p>
<p>“Oh, if that is to be the way of it, why should I build? asked Hadria.</p>
<p>Martha gave the command for another ornamental object which she might destroy.</p>
<p>“One would suppose you were a County-Council,” Hadria exclaimed, “or the practical man. No,
       you shall have no more beauty to annihilate, little Vandal.”</p>
<p>Martha, however, was now engaged in dissecting a doll, and presently a stream of sawdust
       from its chest announced that she had accomplished her dearest desire. She had found out what
       was inside that human effigy.</p>
<p>“I wish I could get at the sawdust that <emph>I</emph> am stuffed with,” Hadria thought
       dreamily, as she watched the doll grow flabbier. “It is wonderful how little one does know
       one's own sawdust. It would be convenient to feel a little surer just now, for evidently I
       shall need it all very soon. And I feel somewhat like that doll, with the stream pouring out
       and the body getting limp.”</p>
<p>She rose at last, and went to the window. The radiance of sun and green trees and the stir
       of human life; the rumble of omnibuses and the sound of wheels; the suggestion to the
       <pb n="331" xml:id="VAB7047-327"/> imagination of the river just a little way off, and the
       merry little <foreign xml:lang="fre">bateaux-mouches</foreign>—it was too much. Hadria rang
       for Hannah; asked her to take the child for a walk in the Bois, stooped down to kiss the
       little upturned face, and went off.</p>
<p>In another ten minutes she was on board one of the steam-boats, on her way up the
       river.</p>
<p>She had no idea whither she was going; she would leave that to chance. She only desired to
       feel the air and the sun and have an opportunity to think. She soothed her uneasiness at the
       thought of Madame Vauchelet's disappointment by promising herself to call to-morrow. She sat
       watching the boats and the water and the gay banks of the river with a sense of relief, and a
       curious sort of fatalism, partly suggested perhaps, by the persistent movement of the boat,
       and the interminable succession of new scenes, all bubbling with human life, full of the
       traces of past events. One layer of consciousness was busily engaged in thinking out the
       practical considerations of the moment, another was equally busy with the objective and
       picturesque world of the river side. If the two or more threads of thought were not actually
       followed at the same instant, the alternation was so rapid as not to be perceived. What was
       to be done? How was the situation to be met, if the worst came to the worst? Ah! what far
       harder contests had gone on in these dwellings that one passed by the hundred. What lives of
       sordid toil had been struggled through, in the effort to earn the privilege of continuing to
       toil!</p>
<p>Hadria was inspired by keen curiosity concerning these homes and gardens, and the whole
       panorama that opened before her, as the little steamer puffed up the river. She longed to
       penetrate below the surface and decipher the strange palimpsest of human life. What scenes,
       what tragedies, what comedies, those bright houses and demure little villas concealed. It was
       not exactly consoling to remember how small her own immediate difficulties were in comparison
       to those of others, but it seemed to help her to face them. She
       <pb n="332" xml:id="VAB7047-328"/> would not be discouraged. She had her liberty, and that
       had to be paid for. Surely patience would prevail in the end. She had learnt so much since
       she left home; among other things, the habit of facing practical difficulties without that
       dismay which carefully-nurtured women inevitably feel on their first movement out of shelter.
       Yes, she had learnt much, surprisingly much, in the short time. Her new knowledge contained
       perhaps rather dangerous elements, for she had begun to realize her own power, not only as an
       artist, but as a woman. In this direction, had she so chosen.... Her thoughts were arrested
       at this point, with a wrench. She felt the temptation assail her, as of late it had been
       assailing her faintly, to explore this territory.</p>
<p>But no, that was preposterous.</p>
<p>It was certainly not that she regarded herself as accountable, in this matter, to any one
       but herself; it was not that she acknowledged the suzerainty of her husband. A mere legal
       claim meant nothing to her, and he knew it. But there were moral perils of no light kind to
       be guarded against; the danger such as a gambler runs, of being drawn away from the real
       objects of life, of losing hold of one's main purpose, to say nothing of the probable moral
       degeneration that would result from such experiment. Yet there was no blinking the fact that
       the desire had been growing in Hadria to test her powers of attraction to the utmost, so as
       to discover exactly their range and calibre. She felt rather as a boy might feel who had come
       upon a cask of gunpowder, and longed to set a match to it, just to see exactly how high it
       would blow off the roof. She had kept the growing instincts at bay, being determined that
       nothing avoidable should come between her and her purpose. And then—well considering in what
       light most men, in their hearts, regarded women—if one might judge from their laws and their
       conduct and their literature, and the society that they had organized—admiration from this
       sex was a thing scarcely to be endured. Yet superficially, it was gratifying.</p>
<p>Why it should be so, was difficult to say, since it scarcely
       <pb n="333" xml:id="VAB7047-329"/> imposed upon one's very vanity. Yet it was easy enough to
       understand how women who had no very dominant interest in life, might come to have a thirst
       for masculine homage and for power over men till it became like the gambler's passion for
       play; and surely it had something in it of the same character.</p>
<p>The steamer was stopping now at St. Cloud. Yielding to an impulse, Hadria alighted at the
       landing-stage and walked on through the little town towards the palace.</p>
<p>The sun was deliciously hot; its rays struck through to the skin, and seemed to pour in
       life and well-being. The wayfarer stood looking up the steep green avenue, resting for a
       moment, before she began the ascent. At the top of the hill she paused again to look out over
       Paris, which lay spread far and wide beneath her, glittering and brilliant; the Eiffel Tower
       rising above domes and spires, in solitary inconsequence. It seemed to her as if she were
       looking upon the world and upon life, for the last time. A few weeks hence, would she be able
       to stand there and see the gay city at her feet? She plunged back along one of the converging
       avenues, yielding to the fascination of green alleys leading one knows not whither. Wandering
       on for some time, she finally drifted down hill again, towards the stately little garden near
       the palace. She was surprised by a hurrying step behind her, and Jouffroy's voice in her ear.
       She was about to greet him in her usual fashion, when he stopped her by plunging head
       foremost into a startling tirade—about her art, and her country, and her genius, and his
       despair; and finally his resolve that she should not belong to the accursed list of women who
       gave up their art for “<foreign xml:lang="fre">la famille</foreign>.”</p>
<p>The more Hadria tried to discover what had happened and what he meant, the faster he spoke
       and the more wildly he gesticulated.</p>
<p>He had seen how she was drifting away from her work and becoming entangled in little
       affairs of no importance, and he would not permit it. He cared not what her circumstances
       might be; she had a great talent that she had no right to sacrifice to
       <pb n="334" xml:id="VAB7047-330"/> any circumstances whatever. He had come to save her. Not
       finding her at her <foreign xml:lang="fre">apartement</foreign>, he had concluded that she
       had taken refuge at her beloved St. Cloud. <foreign xml:lang="fre">Mon Dieu</foreign>! was he
       to allow her to be taken away from her work, dragged back to a narrow circle, crushed,
       broken, ruined—she who could give such a sublime gift to her century—but it was impossible!
       It would tear his heart. He would not permit it; she must promise him not to allow herself to
       be persuaded to abandon her purpose, no matter on what pretext they tried to lure her.
       Hadria, in vain, enquired the cause of this sudden excitement. Jouffroy only repeated his
       exhortations. Why did she not cut herself entirely adrift from her country, her ties?</p>
<p>“They are to you, Madame, an oppression, a weariness, a—”</p>
<p>“M. Jouffroy, I have never spoken to you about these things. I cannot see how you are in a
       position to judge.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but I know. Have I not heard <foreign xml:lang="fre">cette chère Madame
        Bertaux</foreign> describe the life of an English village? And have I not seen—?”</p>
<p>“Seen what?”</p>
<p>“<foreign xml:lang="fre">Cette dame</foreign>. I have seen her at your apartment this
       afternoon. Do not annihilate me, Madame; I mean not to offend you. The lady has come from
       England on purpose to entrap you; she came last night, and she stays at the Hotel du Louvre.
       She spoke to me of you.” Jouffroy raised his hands to heaven. “Ha! then I understood, and I
       fled hither to save you.”</p>
<p>“Tell me, tell me quickly, Monsieur, has she fair hair and large grey eyes. Is she
       tall?”</p>
<p>No, the lady was small, with dark hair, and brown, clever eyes.</p>
<p>“A lady, elegant, well-dressed, but, ah! a woman to destroy the soul of an artist merely by
       her presence. I told her that you had decided to remain in France, to adopt it as your
       country, for it was the country of your soul!”</p>
<p>“Good heavens!” exclaimed Hadria, unable to repress a
       <pb n="335" xml:id="VAB7047-331"/> little burst of laughter, in spite of her disappointment
       and foreboding.</p>
<p>“I told her that your friends would not let you go back to England, to the land of fogs,
       the land of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">bourgeois</foreign>. The lady seemed astonished, even
       indignant,” continued Jouffroy, waving his hands excitedly, “and she endeavoured to make me
       silent, but she did not have success, I promise you. I appealed to her. I pointed out to her
       your unique power. I reminded her that such power is a gift supreme to the world, which the
       world must not lose. For the making of little ones and the care of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">ménage</foreign>, there were other women, but you—you were a priestess in the
       temple of art, you were without prejudice, without the <foreign xml:lang="fre">bourgeois</foreign> conscience, <foreign xml:lang="fre">grâce au ciel</foreign>! you had
       the religion of the artist, and your worship was paid at the shrine of Apollo. <foreign xml:lang="fre">Enfin</foreign>, I counselled this elegant lady to return to England and to
       leave you in peace. Always with a perfect politeness,” added Jouffroy, panting from excess of
       emotion. Hadria tried in vain to gather the object of this sudden visit on the part of
       Henriette (for Henriette the elegant lady must certainly be).</p>
<p>“I must return at once,” she said. “I fear something must have gone wrong at home.”
       Jouffroy danced with fury.</p>
<p>“But I tell you, Madame, that she will drag you back to your fogs; she will tell you some
       foolish story, she will address herself to your pity. Your family has doubtless become ill.
       Families have that habit when they desire to achieve something. Bah, it is easy to become ill
       when one is angry, and so to make oneself pitied and obeyed. It is a common usage. Madame,
       beware; it is for you the critical moment. One must choose.”</p>
<p>“It is not always a matter of choice, M. Jouffroy.”</p>
<p>“Always,” he insisted. He endeavoured to induce her to linger, to make a decision on the
       spot. But Hadria hastened on towards the river. Jouffroy followed in despair. He ceased not
       to urge upon her the peril of the moment and the need for resolute action. He promised to
       help her by every
       <pb n="336" xml:id="VAB7047-332"/> means in his power, to watch over her career, to assist
       her in bringing her gift to maturity. Never before had he felt a faith so profound, or an
       interest so fervid in the genius of any woman. One had, after all, regarded them (“les
       femmes”) as accomplished animals.</p>
<p>“But of whom one demands the duties of human beings and the courage of heroes,” added
       Hadria.</p>
<p>“<foreign xml:lang="fre">Justement</foreign>,” cried Jouffroy. But Madame had taught him a
       superb truth. For her, he felt a sentiment of admiration and reverence the most profound. She
       had been to him a revelation. He entreated her to bestow upon him the privilege of watching
       over her career. Let her only make the wise decision now, everything would arrange itself. It
       needed only courage.</p>
<p>“This is the moment for decision. Remain now among us, and pursue your studies with a calm
       mind, and I promise you—I, Jouffroy, who have the right to speak on this matter—I promise you
       shall have a success beyond the wildest dreams of your ambition. Madame, you do not guess
       your own power. I know how your genius can be saved to the world; I know the artist's nature.
       Have I not had the experience of twenty years? I know what feeds and rouses it, and I know
       what kills it. And this I tell you, Madame, that if you stay here, you have a stupendous
       future before you; if you return to your fogs and your tea-parties—ah, then, Madame, your
       genius will die and your heart will be broken.”</p>
