<head>SCENE IV</head>
<p>JUST before dark on the following day, a man descended from a down train at the
     Clinton Magna station. The porters knew him and greeted him; so did one or two labourers
     outside, as he set off to walk to the village, which was about a mile distant.</p>
<p>“Well, John, so yer coom back,” said one of them, an old man, grasping the newcomer by the
     hand. “An' I can't say as yer looks is any credit to Frampton—no, that aa can't.”</p>
<p>John, indeed, wore a sallow and pinched air, and walked lamely, with a stick.</p>
<p>“Noa,” he said peevishly; “it's a beastly place is Frampton; a damp, nassty hole as iver I
     saw—gives yer the rheumaticks to look at it. I've 'ad
     <pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7023-073"/> a doose of a time, I 'ave, I can tell yer—iver sense I went.
     But I'll pull up now.”</p>
<p>“Aye, this air'll do yer,” said the other. “Where are yer stoppin'? Costrells'?”</p>
<p>John nodded.</p>
<p>“They don't know nothin' about my cousin, but I dessay they'll find me somethin' to sleep on.
     I'll 'ave my own place soon, and some one to look arter it.”</p>
<p>He drew himself up involuntarily, with the dignity that waits on property. A laugh, rather
     jeering than cordial, ran through the group of labourers.</p>
<p>“Aye, yer'll be livin' at your ease,” said the man who had spoken first. “When will yo' give
     us a drink, yer lardship?”</p>
<p>The others grinned.</p>
<p>“Where's your money, John?” said a younger man suddenly, staring hard at the returned
     wanderer.</p>
<p>John started.</p>
<p>“Don't you talk your nonsense!” he said fretfully; “an' I must be getting on, afore
     dark.”</p>
<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7023-074"/>
<p>He went his way, but as he turned a corner of the road, he saw them still standing where he
     had left them. They seemed to be watching his progress, which astonished him.</p>
<p>A light of windy sunset lay spread over the white valley, and the freshening gusts drove the
     powdery snow before them, and sent little stabs of pain through John's shrinking body. Yet how
     glad he was to find himself again between those familiar hedges, to see the church-tower in
     front of him, the long hill to his right! His heart swelled at once with longing and
     satisfaction. During his Frampton job, and in the infirmary, he had suffered much, physically
     and mentally. He had missed Eliza and the tendance of years more than he had ever imagined he
     could; and he had found himself too old for new faces and a new society. When he fell ill he
     had been sorely tempted to send for some of his money, and get himself nursed and cared for at
     the respectable lodging where he had put up. But no; in the end he set his teeth and went into
     <pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7023-075"/> the infirmary. He had planned not to touch his hoard till he
     had done with the Frampton job, and returned to Clinton for good. His peasant obstinacy could
     not endure to be beaten; nor, indeed, could he bring himself to part with his keys, to trust
     the opening of the hoard even to Isaac.</p>
<p>Since then he had passed through many weary weeks, sometimes of acute pain, sometimes of
     sinking weakness, during which he had been haunted by many secret torments, springing mainly
     from the fear of death. He had almost been driven to make his will. But in the end
     superstitious reluctance prevailed. He had not made his will; and to dwell on the fact gave him
     the sensation of having escaped a bond, if not a danger. He did not want to leave his money
     behind him; he wanted to spend it, as he had told Eliza and Mary Anne and Bessie scores of
     times. To have assigned it to any one else, even after his death, would have made it less his
     own.</p>
<p>Ah, well! those bad weeks were done, and here he was, at home again. Suddenly, as he tramped
     <pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7023-076"/> on, he caught sight against the hill of Bessie's cottage, the
     blue smoke from it blown across the rime-laden trees behind it. He drew in his breath with a
     deep, tremulous delight. That buoyant self-congratulation indeed which had stood between him
     and the pain of Eliza's death was gone. Rather there was in him a profound yearning for rest,
     for long dreaming by the fire or in the sun, with his pipe to smoke, and Jim's Louisa to look
     after him, and nothing to do but to draw a half-crown from his box when he wanted it. No more
     hard work in rain and cold; and no cringing, either, to the young and prosperous for the mere
     fault of age. The snowy valley with its circling woods opened to him like a mother's breast;
     the sight of it filled him with a hundred simple hopes and consolations; he hurried to bury
     himself in it, and be at peace.</p>
<p>He was within a hundred yards of the first house in the village, when he saw a tall figure in
     uniform approaching, and recognized Watson.</p>
<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7023-077"/>
<p>At sight of him the policeman stopped short, and John was conscious of a moment's vague
     impression of something strange in Watson's looks.</p>
<p>However, Watson shook hands with great friendliness.</p>
<p>“Well, I'm glad to see yer, John, I'm sure. An' now, I spose, you're back for good?”</p>
<p>“Aye. I'm not going away no more. I've done my share—I wants a bit o' rest.”</p>
<p>“Of coorse yer do. You've been ill, 'aven't yer? You look like it. An' yer puttin' up at
     Costrells'?”</p>
<p>“Yes, till I can turn round a bit. 'Ave yer seen anythin' ov 'em? 'Ow's Bessie?”</p>
<p>Watson faced back towards the village.</p>
<p>“I'll walk with yer a bit—I'm in no 'urry. Oh, she's all right. You 'eard of her bit o'
     money?”</p>
<p>John opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Noa, I don' know as I did.”</p>
<p>“It wor an aunt o' hers, soa I understan'—quite a good bit o' money.”</p>
<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7023-078"/>
<p>“Did yer iver hear the name?” said John, eagerly.</p>
<p>“Some one livin' at Bedford, I did 'ear say.”</p>
<p>John laughed, not without good-humoured relief. It would have touched his vanity had his
     niece been discovered to be richer than himself.</p>
<p>“Oh, that's old Sophy Clarke,” he said. “Her 'usband bought the lease o' two little 'ouses in
     Church Street, and they brȧȧt 'er in six shillins a week for years, an' she allus said she'd
     leave it to Bessie if she wor took afore the lease wor up. But the lease ull be up end o' next
     year, I know, for I saw the old lady myself last Michaelmas twelvemonth, an' she told me all
     about it, though I worn't to tell nobody meself. An' I didn't know Sophy wor gone. Ah, well!
     it's not much, but it's 'andy—it's 'andy.”</p>
<p>“Six shillins a week!” said Watson, raising his eyebrows. “It's a nice bit o' money while it
     lassts, but I'd ha' thought Mrs. Costrell 'ad come into a deal more nor that.”</p>
<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7023-079"/>
<p>“Oh, but she's sich a one to spend, is Bessie,” said John, anxiously. “It's surprisin' 'ow
     the money runs. It's sixpence 'ere, an' sixpence there, allus dribblin', an' dribblin', out ov
     'er. I've allus tole 'er as she'll end 'er days on the parish.”</p>
<p>“Sixpences!” said Watson, with a laugh. “It's not sixpences as Mrs. Costrell's 'ad the
     spendin' of this last month or two—it's <emph>suverins</emph>—an' plenty ov 'em. You may be
     sure you've got the wrong tale about the money, John; it wor a deal more nor you say.”</p>
<p>John stood stock still at the word “sovereigns,” his jaw dropping.</p>
<p>“<emph>Suverins</emph>,” he said trembling; “suverins? Bessie ain't got no suverins. Isaac
     arns sixteen shillin a week.”</p>
<p>The colour was ebbing fast from his cheek and lips. Watson threw him a quick professional
     glance, then rapidly consulted with himself. No; he decided to hold his tongue.</p>
<p>“Yo' <emph>are</emph> reg'lar used up,” he said, taking hold
     <pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7023-080"/> of the old fellow kindly by the arm. “Shall I walk yer up the
     hill?”</p>
<p>John withdrew himself.</p>
<p>“<emph>Suverins!</emph>” he repeated, in a low hoarse voice. “She ain't got 'em, I tell
     yer—she ain't got 'em!”</p>
<p>The last words rose to a sort of cry, and without another word to Watson the old man started
     at a feeble run, his head hanging.</p>
<p>Watson followed him, afraid lest he should drop in the road. Instead, John seemed to gather
     strength. He made straight for the hill, taking no heed whatever of two or three startled
     acquaintances who stopped and shouted to him. When the ground began to rise, he stumbled again
     and again, but by a marvel did not fall, and his pace hardly slackened. Watson had difficulty
     in keeping up with him.</p>
<p>But when the policeman reached his own cottage on the side of the road, he stopped, panting,
     and contented himself with looking after the mounting figure. As soon as it turned the corner
     of the
     <pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7023-081"/> Costrells' lane, he went into his own house, said a word to
     his wife, and sat himself down at his own back door to await events—to ponder, also, a few
     conversations he had held that morning, with Mrs. Moulsey at “the shop,” with Dawson, with Hall
     the butcher. Poor old John—poor old fellow!</p>
<p>When Bolderfield reached the paling in front of the Costrells' cottage, he paused a moment,
     holding for support to the half-open gate and struggling for breath. “I must keep my 'edd, I
     must,” he was saying to himself piteously; “don' yer be a fool, John Borroful, don' yer be a
     fool!”</p>
<p>As he stood there, a child's face pushed the window-blind of the cottage aside, and the lame
     boy's large eyes looked Bolderfield up and down. Immediately after, the door opened, and all
     four children stood huddling behind each other on the threshold. They all looked shyly at the
     newcomer. They knew him, but in six months they had grown strange to him.</p>
<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7023-082"/>
<p>“Arthur, where's your mother?” said John, at last able to walk firmly up to the door.</p>
<p>“Don' know.”</p>
<p>“When did yer see her lasst?”</p>
<p>“She wor 'ere gettin' us our tea,” said another child; “but she didn't eat nothin'.”</p>
<p>John impatiently pushed the children before him back into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“You 'old your tongues,” he said, “an' stay 'ere.”</p>
<p>And he made for the door in the kitchen wall. But Arthur caught hold of his coat tails and
     clung to them.</p>
<p>“Yer oughtn't to go up there—mother don't let any one go there.”</p>
<p>John wrenched himself violently away.</p>
<p>“Oh, don't she! yo' take your 'ands away, yer little varmint, or I'll brain yer.”</p>
<p>He raised his stick, threatening. The child, terrified, fell back, and John, opening the
     door, rushed up the stairs.</p>
<p>He was so terribly excited that his fumbling
     <pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7023-083"/> fingers could hardly find the ribbon round his neck. At last
     he drew it over his head, and made stupendous efforts to steady his hand sufficiently to put
     the key in the lock.</p>
<p>The children below heard a sharp cry directly the cupboard door was opened; then the frantic
     dragging of a box on to the stairs, the creak of hinges—a groan long and lingering—and then
     silence.</p>
<p>They clung together in terror, and the little girls began to cry. At last Arthur took courage
     and opened the door.</p>
<p>The old man was sitting on the top stair, supported sideways by the wall, his head hanging
     forward, and his hands dropping over his knees, in a dead faint.</p>
<p>At the sight all four children ran helter-skelter into the lane, shouting “Mammy! mammy!” in
     an anguish of fright. Their clamour was caught by the fierce north wind, which had begun to
     sweep the hill, and was borne along till it reached
     <pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7023-084"/> the ears of a woman who was sitting sewing in a cottage some
     fifty yards further up the lane. She stepped to her door, opened it and listened.</p>
<p>“It's at Bessie's,” she said; “whativer's wrong wi' the childer?”</p>
<p>By this time Arthur had begun to run towards her. Darkness was falling rapidly, but she could
     distinguish his small figure against the snow, and his halting gait.</p>
<p>“What is it, Arthur?—what is it, lammie?”</p>
<p>“O Cousin Mary Anne! Cousin Mary Anne! It's Uncle John, an' 'ee's dead!”</p>
<p>She ran like the wind at the words, catching at the child's hand in the dark, and dragging
     him along with her.</p>
<p>“Where is he, Arthur?—don't take on, honey!”</p>
<p>The child hurried on with her, sobbing, and she was soon on the stairs beside the unconscious
     John.</p>
<p>Mary Anne looked with amazement at the cupboard and the open box. Then she laid the old
     <pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7023-085"/> man on the floor, her gentle face working with the effort to
     remember what the doctor had once told her of the best way of dealing with persons in a faint.
     She got water, and she sent Arthur to a neighbour for brandy.</p>
<p>“Where's your mother, child?” she asked, as she despatched him.</p>
<p>“Don' know,” repeated the boy, stupidly.</p>
<p>“Oh, for goodness' sake, she's never at Dawson's again!” groaned Mary Anne to herself; “she
     wor there last night, an' the night afore that. And her mother's brother lyin' like this in 'er
     house!”</p>
<p>He was so long in coming round that her ignorance began to fear the worst. But just as she
     was telling the eldest girl to put on her hat and jacket and run for the doctor, poor John
     revived.</p>
<p>He struggled to a sitting posture, looked wildly at her and at the box. As his eye caught the
     two sovereigns still lying at the bottom, he gave a cry of rage, and got upon his feet with a
     mighty effort.</p>
<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7023-086"/>
<p>“Where's Bessie, I tell yer? Where's the huzzy gone? I'll have the law on 'er! I'll make 'er
     give it up—by the Lord I will!”</p>
<p>“John, what is it?—John, my dear!” cried Mary Anne, supporting him, and terrified lest he
     should pitch headlong down the stairs.</p>
<p>“Yo' 'elp me down,” he said violently. “We'll find 'er—we'll wring it out ov 'er—the mean,
     thievin' vagabond! Changin' suverins, 'as she? we'll soon know about that—yo' 'elp me down, I
     tell yer.”</p>
<p>And with her assistance he hobbled down the stairs, hardly able to stand. Mary Anne's eyes
     were starting out of her head with fear and agitation, and the children were staring at the old
     man as he came tottering into the kitchen, when a sound at the outer door made them all
     turn.</p>
<p>The door opened, and Bessie appeared on the threshold.</p>
<p>At sight of her John seemed to lose his senses. He rushed at her, threatening, imploring, reviling—
     <pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7023-087"/> while Mary Ann could only cling to his arms and coat, lest he
     should attempt some bodily mischief.</p>
<p>Bessie closed the door, leant against it, and folded her arms. She was white and haggard, but
     perfectly cool. In this moment of excitement it struck neither John nor Mary Anne—nor, indeed,
     herself—that her manner, with its brutality, and its poorly feigned surprise, was the most
     revealing element in the situation.</p>
<p>“What's all this about yer money?” she said, staring John in the face. “What do I know about
     yer money? 'Ow dare yer say such things? I 'aven't anythin' to do with it, an' never 'ad.”</p>
<p>He raved at her, in reply, about the position in which he had found the box—on the top of its
     fellow instead of underneath, where he had placed it—about the broken lock, the sovereigns she
     had been changing, and the things Watson had said of her—winding up with a peremptory demand
     for his money.</p>
<p>“Yo' gi' me my money back,” he said, holding
     <pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7023-088"/> out a shaking hand. “Yer can't 'ave spent it all—'tain't
     possible—an' yer ain't chucked it out o' winder. Yer've got it somewhere 'idden, an' I'll get
     it out o' you if I die for 't!”</p>
<p>Bessie surveyed him steadily. She had not even flinched at the mention of the sovereigns.</p>
<p>“What yer 'aven't got, yer can't give,” she said. “I don' know nothin' about it, an' I've
     tole yer. There's plenty o' bad people in the world—beside me. Somebody came in o' nights, I
     suppose, an' picked the lock—there's many as ud think nothin' of it. And it ud be easy done—we
     all sleeps 'ard.”</p>
<p>“Bessie!” cried Mary Anne, outraged by something in her tone, “aren't yer sorry for 'im?”</p>
<p>She pointed to the haggard and trembling man.</p>
<p>Bessie turned to her reluctantly. “Aye, I'm sorry,” she said sullenly. “But he shouldn't fly
     out at yer without 'earin' a word. 'Ow should I know anythin' about his money? 'Ee locked it up
     hisself, an' tuk the keys.”</p>
<p>“An' them suverins,” roared John, rattling his
     <pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7023-089"/> stick on the floor; “where did yer get them suverins?”</p>
<p>“I got 'em from old Sophy Clarke—leastways, from Sophy Clarke's lawyer. And it ain't no
     business o' yourn.<corr>”</corr></p>
<p>At this John fell into a frenzy, shouting at her in inarticulate passion, calling her liar
     and thief.</p>
<p>She fronted it with perfect composure. Her fine eyes blazed, but otherwise her face might
     have been a waxen mask. With her, in this scene, was all the tragic dignity; with him, the
     weakness and vulgarity.</p>
<p>At last the little widow caught her by the arm, and drew her from the door.</p>
<p>“Let me take 'im to my place,” she pleaded: “it's no good talkin' while 'ee's like 'ee is—not
     a bit o' good. John—John dear! you come along wi' me. Shall I get Saunders to come an' speak to
     yer?”</p>
<p>A gleam of sudden hope shot into the old man's face. He had not thought of Saunders; but
     <pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7023-090"/> Saunders had a head; he might unravel this accursed
     thing.</p>
<p>“Aye!” he said, lurching forward, “let's find Saunders—coom along—let's find Saunders.”</p>
<p>Mary Anne guided him through the door, Bessie standing aside. As the widow passed, she
     touched Bessie piteously.</p>
<p>“Oh, Bessie, yer <emph>didn't</emph> do it—say yer didn't!”</p>
<p>Bessie looked at her dry-eyed and contemptuous. Something in the speaker's emotion seemed to
     madden her.</p>
<p>“Don't yer be a fool, Mary Anne—that's all!” she said scornfully, and Mary Anne fled from
     her.</p>
<p>When the door had closed upon them, Bessie came up to the fire, her teeth chattering. She
     sank down in front of it, spreading out her hands. The children silently crowded up to her;
     first she pushed them away, then she caught at the child nearest to her, pressed its fair head
     against her, then again roughly put it aside. She was accustomed to chatter
     <pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7023-091"/> with them, scold them and slap them; but to-night they were
     uneasily dumb. They looked at her with round eyes; and at last their looks annoyed her. She
     told them to go to bed, and they slunk away, gaping at the open box on the stairs, and huddling
     together overhead, all on one bed, in the bitter cold, to whisper to each other. Isaac was a
     stern parent; Bessie a capricious one; and the children, though they could be riotous enough by
     themselves, were nervous and easily cowed at home.</p>
<p>Bessie, left alone, sat silently over the fire, her thin lips tight-set. She would deny
      everything—<emph>everything</emph>. Let them find out what they could. Who could prove what
     was in John's box when he left it? Who could prove she hadn't got those half-crowns in change
     somewhere?</p>
<p>The reflection of the day had only filled her with a passionate and fierce regret.
      <emph>Why</emph> had she not followed her first impulse, and thrown it all on Timothy?—told
     the story to Isaac, while she was still bleeding from his son's violence? It had been
     <pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7023-092"/> her only chance, and out of pure stupidness she had lost it.
     To have grasped it might at least have made him take <emph>her</emph> part, if it had forced
     him to give up Timothy. And who would have listened to Timothy's tales?</p>
<p>She sickened at the thought of her own folly, beating her knee with her clenched fist. For to
     tell the tale now would only be to make her doubly vile in Isaac's eyes. He would not believe
     her—no one would believe her. What motive could she plead for her twenty-four hours of silence,
     she knowing that John was coming back immediately? Isaac would only hate her for throwing it on
     Timothy.</p>
<p>Then again the memory of the half-crowns, and the village talk—and Watson—would close upon
     her, putting her in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>When would Isaac come? Who would tell him? As she looked forward to the effect upon him, all
     her muscles stiffened. If he drove her to it, aye, she <emph>would</emph> tell him—she didn't
     care a haporth, she vowed. If he must have it, let him. But as the
     <pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7023-093"/> name of Isaac, the thought of Isaac, hovered in her brain,
     she must needs brush away wild tears. That morning, for the first time for months, he had been
     so kind to her and the children, so chatty and cheerful.</p>
<p>Distant steps along the lane! She sprang to her feet, ran into the back kitchen, tied on her
     apron, hastily filled an earthenware bowl with water from the pump, and carrying it back to the
     front kitchen, began to wash up the tea-things, making a busy household clatter as she slid
     them into the bowl.</p>
<p>A confused sound of feet approached the house, and there was a knock.</p>
<p>“Come in,” said Bessie.</p>
<p>Three figures appeared, the huge form of Saunders the smith in front, John and Mary Anne
     Waller behind.</p>
<p>Saunders took off his cap politely. The sight of his bald head, his double chin, his mouth
     with its queer twitch, which made him seem as though perpetually about to laugh, if he had not perpetually
     <pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7023-094"/> thought better of it, filled Bessie with angry excitement.
     She barely nodded to him, in reply to his greeting.</p>
<p>“May we come in, Mrs. Costrell?” Saunders inquired, in his most deliberate voice.</p>
<p>“If yer want to,” said Bessie, shortly, taking out a cup and drying it.</p>
<p>Saunders drew in the other two and shut the door.</p>
<p>“Sit down, John. Sit down, Mrs. Waller.”</p>
<p>John did as he was told. Dishevelled and hopeless misery spoke in his stained face, his
     straggling hair, his shirt burst open at the neck and showing his wrinkled throat. But he fixed
     his eyes passionately on Saunders, thirsting for every word.</p>
<p>“Well, Mrs. Costrell,” said Saunders, settling himself comfortably, “you'll be free to
     confess, won't yer, this is an oogly business—a very oogly business? Now, will yer let us ask
     yer a question or two?”</p>
<p>“I dessay,” said Bessie, polishing her cup.</p>
<p>“Well, then—to begin reg'lar, Mrs. Costrell—yo'
     <pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7023-095"/> agree, don't yer, as Muster Bolderfield put his money in your
     upstairs cupboard?”</p>
<p>“I agree as he put his box there,” said Bessie, sharply.</p>
<p>John broke into inarticulate and abusive clamour. Bessie turned upon him.</p>
<p>“'Ow did any of us know what yer'd got in your box? Did yer ever show it to me, or Mary Anne
     there, or any livin soul in Clinton? Did yer?”</p>
<p>She waited, hawk-like, for the answer.</p>
<p>“Did yer, John?” repeated Saunders, judicially.</p>
<p>John groaned, rocking himself to and fro.</p>
<p>“Noa. I niver did—I niver did,” he said. “Nobbut to Eliza—an' she's gone—she's gone!”</p>
<p>“Keep your 'ead, John,” said Saunders, putting out a calming hand. “Let's get to the bottom
     o' this, quiet an' <emph>reg'lar</emph>. An' yer didn't tell any one 'ow much yer 'ad?”</p>
<p>“Nobbut Eliza—nobbut Eliza!” said the old man again.</p>
<p>“Yer didn't tell <emph>me</emph>, I know,” said Saunders, blandly.</p>
<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7023-096"/>
<p>John seemed to shrink together under the smith's glance. If only he had not been a jealous
     fool, and had left it with Saunders!</p>
<p>Saunders, however, refrained for the present from drawing this self-evident moral. He sat
     twirling his cap between his knees, and his shrewd eye travelled round the kitchen, coming back
     finally to Bessie, who was washing and drying diligently. As he watched her cool movements
     Saunders felt the presence of an enemy worthy of his steel, and his emulation rose.</p>
<p>“I understan', Mrs. Costrell,” he said, speaking with great civility, “as the cupboard where
     John put his money is a cupboard <emph>hon</emph> the stairs? Not in hany room, but
      <emph>hon</emph> the stairs? Yer'll kindly correck me if I say anythin' wrong.”</p>
<p>Bessie nodded.</p>
<p>“Aye—top o' the stairs—right-'and side,” groaned John.</p>
<p>“An' John locked it hisself, an' tuk the key?” Saunders proceeded.</p>
<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7023-097"/>
<p>John plucked at his neck again, and, dumbly, held out the key.</p>
<p>“An' there worn't nothin' wrong wi' the lock when yo' opened it, John?”</p>
<p>“Nothin', Muster Saunders—I'll take my davy.”</p>
<p>Saunders ruminated.</p>
<p>“Theer's a cupboard there,” he said suddenly, raising his hand and pointing to the cupboard
     beside the fireplace. “Is't anythin' like the cupboard on th' stairs, John?”</p>
<p>“Aye, 'tis!” said John, startled and staring. “Aye, 'tis, Muster Saunders!”</p>
<p>Saunders rose.</p>
<p>“Per'aps,” he said slowly, “Mrs. Costrell will do us the favour ov lettin' us hexamine that
     'ere cupboard?”</p>
<p>He walked across to it. Bessie's hand dropped; she turned sharply, supporting herself against
     the table, and watched him, her chest heaving.</p>
<p>“There's no key 'ere,” said Saunders, stooping to look at the lock. <corr>“</corr>Try yours,
     John.”</p>
<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7023-098"/>
<p>John rushed forward, but Bessie put herself in the way.</p>
<p>“What are yer meddlin' with my 'ouse for?” she said fiercely. “Just mek yourselves scarce,
     all the lot o' yer. I don't know nothin' about his money, an' I'll not have yer
      <emph>insultin'</emph> me in me own place! Get out o' my kitchen, if <emph>yo'</emph>
     please!”</p>
<p>Saunders buttoned his coat.</p>
<p>“Sartinly, Mrs. Costrell, sartinly,” he said with emphasis. “Come along, John. Yer must get
     Watson and put it in 'is hands. 'Ee's the law, is Watson. Maybe as Mrs. Costrell 'ull listen to
      <emph>'im</emph>.”</p>
<p>Mary Anne ran to Bessie in despair.</p>
<p>“Oh, Bessie, Bessie, my dear—don't let 'em get Watson; let 'em look into 't theirselves—it'll
     be better for yer, my dear, it <emph>will</emph>.”</p>
<p>Bessie looked from one to the other, panting. Then she turned back to the table.</p>
<p>“<emph>I</emph> don' care what they do,” she said, with sullen passion. “I'm not stannin' in
     any one's way, I tell yer. The more they finds out the better I'm pleased.”</p>
<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7023-099"/>
<p>The look of incipient laughter on Saunders's countenance became more pronounced—that is to
     say, the left-hand corner of his mouth twitched a little higher. But it was rare for him to
     complete the act, and he was not in the least minded to do so now. He beckoned to John, and
     John, trembling, took off his keys and gave them to him, pointing to that which belonged to the
     treasure cupboard.</p>
<p>Saunders slipped it into the lock before him. It moved with ease, backwards and forwards.</p>
<p>“H'm! that's strange,” he said, taking out the key and turning it over thoughtfully in his
     hand. “Yer didn't think as there were <emph>another</emph> key in this 'ouse that would open
     your cupboard, did yer, Bolderfield?”</p>
<p>The old man sank weeping on a chair. He was too broken, too exhausted, to revile Bessie any
     more.</p>
<p>“Yo' tell her, Muster Saunders,” he said, “to gie it me back! I'll not ast for all on it, but
     some on it, Muster Saunders—some on it. She <emph>can't</emph> 'a
     <pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7023-100"/> spent it. She must 'a got it somewhere. Yo' speak to her,
     Muster Saunders. It's a crule thing to rob an old man like me—an' her own mother's brother. Yo'
     speak to 'er—an' yo', too, Mary Anne.”</p>
<p>He looked piteously from one to the other. But his misery only seemed to goad Bessie to fresh
     fury. She turned upon him, arms akimbo.</p>
<p>“Oh! an' of course it must be <emph>me</emph> as robs yer! It couldn't be nobody else, could
     it? There isn't tramps, an' thieves, an' rogues—'undreds of 'em—going about o' nights? Nary
     one, I believe yer! There isn't another thief in Clinton Magna, nobbut Bessie Costrell, is
     ther? But yer'll not blackguard me for nothin', I can tell yer. Now will yer jest oblige me by
     takin' yourselves off? I shall 'ave to clean up after yer”—she pointed scornfully to the marks
     of their muddy boots on the floor—“an' it's gettin' late.”</p>
<p>“One moment, Mrs. Costrell,” said Saunders, gently rubbing his hands. “With your leave, John
     and I 'ull just inspeck the cupboard <emph>hup</emph>stairs before
     <pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7023-101"/> leavin'—an' then we'll clear out double quick. But we'll
     'ave one try if we can't 'it on somethin' as 'ull show 'ow the thief got in—with your leave, of
      <emph>coorse</emph>.”</p>
<p>Bessie hesitated; then she threw some spoons she held into the water beside her with a
     violent gesture.</p>
<p>“Go where yer wants,” she said, and returned to her washing.</p>
<p>Saunders began to climb the narrow stairs, with John behind him. But the smith's small eyes
     had a puzzled look.</p>
<p>“There's <emph>somethin'</emph> rum,” he said to himself. “'Ow <emph>did</emph> she spend it
     all? 'As she been carryin' on with some one be'ind Isaac's back, or is Isaac in it too? It's
     one or t'other.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bessie, left behind, was consumed by a passionate effort of memory.
      <emph>What</emph> had she done with the key, the night before, after she had locked the
     cupboard? Her brain was blurred. The blow—the fall—seemed to have confused even the
     <pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7023-102"/> remembrance of the scene with Timothy. How was it, for
     instance, that she had put the box back in the wrong place? She put her hand to her head trying
     in an anguish to recollect the exact details.</p>
<p>The little widow sat meanwhile a few yards away, her thin hands clasped on her lap in her
     usual attitude of humble entreaty; her soft grey eyes, brimmed with tears, were fixed on
     Bessie. Bessie did not know that she was there—that she existed.</p>
<p>The door had closed after the two men. Bessie could hear vague movements, but nothing more.
     Presently she could bear it no longer. She went to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>She was just in time. By the light of the bit of candle that John held, she saw Saunders
     sitting on the stair, the shadow of his huge frame thrown black on the white wall; she saw him
     stoop suddenly, as a bird pounces; she heard an exclamation—then a sound of metal.</p>
<p>Her involuntary cry startled the men above.</p>
<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7023-103"/>
<p>“All right, Mrs. Costrell,” said Saunders, briskly—“all right. We'll be down directly.”</p>
<p>She came back into the kitchen, a mist before her eyes, and fell heavily on a chair by the
     fire. Mary Anne approached her, only to be pushed back. The widow stood listening, in an
     agony.</p>
<p>It took Saunders a minute or two to complete his case. Then he slowly descended the stairs,
     carrying the box, his great weight making the house shake. He entered the kitchen first, John
     behind him. But at the same moment that they appeared the outer door opened, and Isaac
     Costrell, preceded by a gust of snow, stood on the threshold.</p>
<p>“Why, John!” he cried, in amazement—“an' <emph>Saunders!</emph>”</p>
<p>He looked at them, then at Mary Anne, then at his wife.</p>
<p>There was an instant's dead silence. Then the tottering John came forward.</p>
<p>“An' I'm glad yer come, Isaac, that I am—thankful! Now yer can tell me what yer wife's
     <pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7023-104"/> done with my money. D'yer mind that box? It wor you an' I
     carried it across that night as Watson come out on us. An' yo'll bear me witness as we locked
     it up, an' yo' saw me tie the two keys roun' my neck—yo' <emph>did</emph>, Isaac. An' now,
     Isaac”—the hoarse voice began to tremble—“now there's two—suverins—left, and one 'arf-crown—out
     o' seventy-one pound fower an' sixpence—seventy-one pound, Isaac! Yo'll get it out on 'er,
     Isaac, yer will, won't yer?”</p>
<p>He looked up imploring.</p>
<p>Isaac, after the first violent start, stood absolutely motionless, Saunders observing him. As
     one of the main props of Church Establishment in the village, Saunders had no great opinion of
     Isaac Costrell, who stood for the dissidence of dissent. The two men had never been friends,
     and Saunders in this affair had perhaps exercised the quasi-judicial functions the village had
     long by common consent allowed him, with more readiness than usual.</p>
<p>As soon as John ceased speaking, Isaac walked up to Saunders.</p>
<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7023-105"/>
<p>“Let me see that box,” he said peremptorily. “Put it down.”</p>
<p>Saunders, who had rested the box on the back of a chair, placed it gently on the table,
     assisted by Isaac. A few feet away stood Bessie, saying nothing, her hand holding the duster on
     her hip, her eyes following her husband.</p>
<p>He looked carefully at the two sovereigns lying on the bit of old cloth which covered the
     bottom of the box, and the one half-crown that Timothy had forgotten; he took up the bit of
     cloth and shook it, he felt along the edge of the box, he examined the wrenched lock.</p>
<p>Then he stood for an instant, his hand on the box, his eyes staring straight before him in a
     kind of dream.</p>
<p>Saunders grew impatient. He pushed John aside, and came to the table, leaning his hands upon
     it, so as to command Isaac's face.</p>
<p>“Now look 'ere, Isaac,” he said, in a different voice from any that he had yet employed,
     “let's come to business. These 'ere are the facks o' this
     <pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7023-106"/> case, and 'ow we're agoin' to get over 'em, I don' see. John
     leaves his money in your cupboard. Yo' an' he lock it up, an' John goes away with 'is keys 'ung
     roun' 'is neck. Yo' agree to that? Well an' good. But there's <emph>another</emph> key in your
     'ouse, Isaac, as opens John's cupboard. Ah—”</p>
<p>He waved his hand in deprecation of Isaac's movement.</p>
<p>“I dessay yo' didn't know nowt about it—that's noather 'ere nor there. Yo' try John's key in
     that there door”—he pointed to the cupboard by the fire—“an' yo'll find it fits
     <emph>ex</emph>—act. Then, thinks I, where's the key as belongs to that 'ere cupboard? An' John
     an' I goes upstairs to look about us, an' in noa time at aw, I sees a 'ole in the skirtin'. I
     whips in my finger—lor bless yer! I knew it wor there the moment I sets eyes on the hole.”</p>
<p>He held up the key triumphantly. By this time, no Old Bailey lawyer making a hanging speech
     could have had more command of his task.</p>
<p>“'Ere then we 'ave”—he checked the items off on
     <pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7023-107"/> his fingers—“box locked up—key in the 'ouse as fits it,
     unbeknown to John—money tuk out—key 'idden away. But that's not all—not by long chalks—there's
     another side to the affair <emph>hal</emph>together.”</p>
<p>Saunders drew himself up, thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“Per'aps yer don' know—I'm sartin sure yer don' know—leastways I'm hinclined that way,—as
     Mrs. Costrell”—he made a polite inclination towards Bessie—“'ave been makin' free with
     money—fower—five—night a week at the Spotted Deer—fower—five—night a week. She'd used to treat
     every young feller, an' plenty old uns too, as turned up; an' there was a many as only went to
     Dawson's becos they knew as she'd treat 'em. Now, she didn't go on tick at Dawson's; she'd
      <emph>pay</emph>,—an' she allus payed in 'arf-crowns. An' those 'arf-crowns were curious
     'alf-crowns; an' it came into Dawson's 'ead as he'd colleck them 'arf-crowns. 'Ee wanted to see
     summat, 'ee said—an' I dessay 'ee did. An' people began to taak. Last night theer wor a bit of a
     <pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7023-108"/> roompus, it seems, while Mrs. Costrell was a-payin' another
     o' them things, an' summat as was said come to my ears—an' come to Watson's. An' me an' Watson
     'ave been makin' inquiries—an' Mr. Dawson wor obligin' enough to make me a small loan, 'ee wor.
     Now, I've got just one question to ask o' John Borroful.”</p>
<p>He put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and drew out a silver coin.</p>
<p>“Is that yourn, John?”</p>
<p>John fell upon it with a cry.</p>
<p>“Aye, Saunders, it's mine. Look ye 'ere, Isaac, it's a king's 'ead. It's Willum—not Victory.
     I saved that un up when I wor a lad at Mason's, an' look yer, there's my mark in the
     corner—every 'arf-crown I ever 'ad I marked like that.”</p>
<p>He held it under Isaac's staring eyes, pointing to the little scratched cross in the
     corner.</p>
<p>“'Ere's another, John—two on, 'em,” said Saunders, pulling out a second and a third.</p>
<p>John, in a passion of hope, identified them both.</p>
<p>“Then,” said Saunders, slapping the table solemnly,
     <pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7023-109"/> “theer's nobbut one more thing to say—an' sorry I am to say
     it. Them coins, Isaac”—he pointed a slow finger at Bessie, whose white, fierce face moved
     involuntarily—“them 'arf-crowns wor paid across the bar lasst night, or the night afore, at
     Dawson's, by <emph>yor wife</emph>, as is now stannin' there, an' she'll deny it if she
     can!”</p>
<p>For an instant the whole group preserved their positions—the breath suspended on their
     lips.</p>
<p>Then Isaac strode up to his wife, and gripped her by the arms.</p>
<p>“Did yer do it?” he asked her.</p>
<p>He held her, looking into her eyes. Slowly she sank away from him; she would have fallen, but
     for a chair that stood beside her.</p>
<p>“Oh, yer brute!” she said, turning her head to Saunders an instant, and speaking under her
     breath, with a kind of sob. “Yer <emph>brute!</emph>”</p>
<p>Isaac walked to the door, and threw it open.</p>
<p>“Per'aps yer'll go,” he said grimly.</p>
<p>And the three went, without a word.</p>
