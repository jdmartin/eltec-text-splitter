<head>THE SILENT FOUNTAIN</head>
<p>I TURNED and followed the spotted leopardess, catching but one glimpse of her as she tore up
     the brow of the hill to the gate of the palace. When I reached the entrance-hall, the princess
     was just throwing the robe around her which she had left on the floor. The blood had ceased to
     flow from her wounds, and had dried in the wind of her flight.</p>
<p>When she saw me, a flash of anger crossed her face, and she turned her head aside. Then, with
     an attempted smile, she looked at me, and said, "I have met with a small accident! Happening to
     hear that the cat-woman was again in the city, I went down to send her away. But she had one of
     her horrid creatures with her: it sprang upon me, and had its claws in my neck before I could
     strike it!"</p>
<p>She gave a shiver, and I could not help pitying her, although I knew she lied, for her wounds
     were real, and her face reminded me of how she looked in the cave. My heart began to reproach
     me that I had let her fight unaided, and I suppose I looked the compassion I felt.</p>
<p>"Child of folly!" she said, with another attempted smile, "—not crying, surely!—Wait for me
     here; I am going into the black hall for a moment. I want you to get me something for my
     scratches."</p>
<p>But I followed her close. Out of my sight I feared her.</p>
<p>The instant the princess entered, I heard a buzzing sound as of many low voices, and, one
     portion after another, the assembly began to be shiftingly illuminated, as by a ray that went
     travelling from spot to spot. Group after group would shine out for a space, then sink back
     into the general vagueness, while another part of the vast company would grow momently
     bright.</p>
<p>Some of the actions going on when thus illuminated, were not unknown to me; I had been in
     them, or had looked on them, and so had the princess: present with every one of them I now saw
     her. The skull-headed dancers footed the grass in the forest-hall: there was the princess
     looking in at the door! The fight went on in the Evil Wood: there was the princess urging it!
     Yet I was close behind her all the time, she standing motionless, her head sunk on her bosom.
     The confused murmur continued, the confused commotion of colours and shapes; and still the ray
     went shifting and showing. It settled at last on the hollow in the heath, and there was the
     princess, walking up and down, and trying in vain to wrap the vapour around her! Then first I
     was startled at what I saw: the old librarian walked up to her, and stood for a moment
     regarding her; she fell; her limbs forsook her and fled; her body vanished.</p>
<p>A wild shriek rang through the echoing place, and with the fall of her eidolon, the princess
     herself, till then standing like a statue in front of me, fell heavily, and lay still. I turned
     at once and went out: not again would I seek to restore her! As I stood trembling beside the
     cage, I knew that in the black ellipsoid I had been in the brain of the princess!—I saw the
     tail of the leopardess quiver once.</p>
<p>While still endeavouring to compose myself, I heard the voice of the princess beside me.</p>
<p>"Come now," she said; "I will show you what I want you to do for me."</p>
<p>She led the way into the court. I followed in dazed compliance.</p>
<p>The moon was near the zenith, and her present silver seemed brighter than the gold of the
     absent sun. She brought me through the trees to the tallest of them, the one in the centre. It
     was not quite like the rest, for its branches, drawing their ends together at the top, made a
     clump that looked from beneath like a fir-cone. The princess stood close under it, gazing up,
     and said, as if talking to herself, "On the summit of that tree grows a tiny blossom which
     would at once heal my scratches! I might be a dove for a moment and fetch it, but I see a
     little snake in the leaves whose bite would be worse to a dove than the bite of a tiger to
     me!—How I hate that cat-woman!"</p>
<p>She turned to me quickly, saying with one of her sweetest smiles, "Can you climb?"</p>
<p>The smile vanished with the brief question, and her face changed to a look of sadness and
     suffering. I ought to have left her to suffer, but the way she put her hand to her wounded neck
     went to my heart.</p>
<p>I considered the tree. All the way up to the branches, were projections on the stem like the
     remnants on a palm of its fallen leaves.</p>
<p>"I can climb that tree," I answered.</p>
<p>"Not with bare feet!" she returned.</p>
<p>In my haste to follow the leopardess disappearing, I had left my sandals in my room.</p>
<p>"It is no matter," I said; "I have long gone barefoot!"</p>
<p>Again I looked at the tree, and my eyes went wandering up the stem until my sight lost itself
     in the branches. The moon shone like silvery foam here and there on the rugged bole, and a
     little rush of wind went through the top with a murmurous sound as of water falling softly into
     water. I approached the tree to begin my ascent of it. The princess stopped me.</p>
<p>"I cannot let you attempt it with your feet bare!" she insisted. "A fall from the top would
     kill you!"</p>
<p>"So would a bite from the snake!" I answered—not believing, I confess, that there was any
     snake.</p>
<p>"It would not hurt <emph>you</emph>!" she replied. "—Wait a moment."</p>
<p>She tore from her garment the two wide borders that met in front, and kneeling on one knee,
     made me put first my left foot, then my right on the other, and bound them about with the thick
     embroidered strips.</p>
<p>"You have left the ends hanging, princess!" I said.</p>
<p>"I have nothing to cut them off with; but they are not long enough to get entangled," she
     replied.</p>
<p>I turned to the tree, and began to climb.</p>
<p>Now in Bulika the cold after sundown was not so great as in certain other parts of the
     country—especially about the sexton's cottage; yet when I had climbed a little way, I began to
     feel very cold, grew still colder as I ascended, and became coldest of all when I got among the
     branches. Then I shivered, and seemed to have lost my hands and feet.</p>
<p>There was hardly any wind, and the branches did not sway in the least, yet, as I approached
     the summit, I became aware of a peculiar unsteadiness: every branch on which I placed foot or
     laid hold, seemed on the point of giving way. When my head rose above the branches near the
     top, and in the open moonlight I began to look about for the blossom, that instant I found
     myself drenched from head to foot. The next, as if plunged in a stormy water, I was flung about
     wildly, and felt myself sinking. Tossed up and down, tossed this way and tossed that way,
     rolled over and over, checked, rolled the other way and tossed up again, I was sinking lower
     and lower. Gasping and gurgling and choking, I fell at last upon a solid bottom.</p>
<p>"I told you so!" croaked a voice in my ear.</p>
