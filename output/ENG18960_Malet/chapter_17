<head>CHAPTER V</head>
<p>“<hi>WELL</hi>, you see,” said she, “what Mr. Perry felt was that Charlotte's marriage did
      not explain itself. I should have thought if the young people loved each other that was
      explanation enough. I am sure when Mr. Perry and I were engaged, our friends took for granted
      that was explanation enough, and so did dear father and mother too. But things move on so fast
      nowadays, Mr. Hammond, I'm sure I never quite know where I am—”</p>
<p>Mrs. Perry sighed.</p>
<p>“You are not alone. The pace is hot, and the Time-Spirit leaves many of us somewhat
      breathless,” I remarked.</p>
<p>My companion probably knew as much about the Zeitgeist as about the theory of Palingenesis;
      but Mrs. Perry had a gracious habit of taking the will for the deed. She comprehended that my
      intention was consolation, she was therefore—in a measure, at all events—consoled.</p>
<p>“Yes, to be sure,” she replied; “and Mr. Perry
      <pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7033-165"/> has kept on saying to me, ‘We owe it to ourselves, Susan,
      and we owe it to Charlotte's very charming and cultivated circle of acquaintance, to show a
      really solid reason, to show sufficient cause—’”</p>
<p>(Ah! shade of M. de Voltaire!)</p>
<p>“For Mr. Perry always pointed out—though I never could quite understand why being clever
      should make so much difference—that in the case of such a talented girl as Charlotte, her
      friends wouldn't recognise affection as very much of a reason. It seems a pity, doesn't
      it?”</p>
<p>“So it does. Ten thousand pities,” I rejoined very cordially.</p>
<p>The good woman beamed again.</p>
<p>“Dear me, with all your nice feelings—if it isn't too intimate to mention it—it does seem a
      loss you ain't married, Mr. Hammond. There must be plenty of young ladies who would be so very
      willing, you know—indeed, I've more than once thought—if it hadn't been decided long ago—Mr.
      Perry and I—for there's no one I've seen for a long while I've taken so to—but then it is all
      decided, you see—and—”</p>
<p>I laid my hand on the arm of my companion's chair. I regarded her, as I believe, with an air
      of delicately mingled gratitude and restraint, for this was the very last road I wished to
      travel down with Mrs. Perry.</p>
<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7033-166"/>
<p>“It is all decided,” I repeated. “And so, as to these settlements?”</p>
<p>“Ah yes,—I'm sure I shall always remember you as a very kind friend after to-day, Mr.
      Hammond. Well, when he'd seen the will, Mr. Perry said to me directly—and I was rather nervous
      Constantine overheard, but then he's very sensible, I don't think he's at all sensitive like
      some young men might be,—he said to me, ‘It all lies here, Mamma, it all lies here! Everyone
      will admit this really fine income explains Charlotte's choice.’”</p>
<p>“Unquestionably wealth explains much to the mind of the modern world,” I remarked.</p>
<p>“I am very pleased you agree with Mr. Perry,” she said, with great cheerfulness. “I'll tell
      him you think Charlotte's friends will be satisfied; and I can't help hoping that may make him
      less excited than he has been lately. He is so very tenacious about her friends being
      satisfied.”</p>
<p>After all, what is truth that we should be so desperately anxious to speak it? Absolute
      truth became unattainable, in all probability, many thousand centuries ago. Very distantly
      approximate truth is the utmost we can hope to arrive at in our present state of lamentable
      over-development, when the mist of unnumbered opinions has obscured every conceivable question
      of human conduct and of human relation. Is not the mere
      <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7033-167"/> attempt to speak it, perhaps, a refined form of spiritual
      pride and self-seeking? Better, I think, rub a little emollient ointment of passing peace upon
      the soul of the brother or sister who happens to be nearest you, by endeavouring to take
      whatever view of things—not actually criminal—you perceive will yield them solace, however
      fleeting. So I begged Mrs. Perry to regard me as the mouthpiece of the social gods; and bade
      her rest assured those high and holy divinities would unanimously applaud the wisdom of her
      daughter's choice, if the fortune Leversedge possessed, and the settlements he made, were
      really handsome.</p>
<p>“And they really are handsome?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“They seem so to me,” she answered. “But then, Mr. Perry and I hadn't much to begin on at
      first, Mr. Hammond. We were in a very small way. He used to repeat beautiful lines about love
      in a cottage, which afforded the greatest pleasure to dear mother and father. I'm sure I can
      hear her kiss me now, upon my wedding-morning, just when she had done lacing my dress—it was
      very becoming to the figure, but a very inconvenient fashion, those day-dresses lacing up
      behind—and say to me,—‘Thank God, Susie, you will have that in your husband which is better
      than riches, for Joseph has a truly good heart.’”</p>
<p>She paused, blushed a little, and her bosom
      <pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7033-168"/> heaved ominously. Ah, well, happy is the woman who has had
      her romance, even if it take the rat-like form of a Joseph Perry! I respectfully averted my
      eyes until such time as my companion should have recovered from too acute memories of those
      early enchantments, and they lighted upon the wearer of the scarlet blouse, reclining on the
      grass at the foot of a grey-green stemmed tulip tree. One of the debilitated young Russians
      stood before her haranguing her with impassioned gestures. Evidently she disagreed with him;
      and disagreement, so far, took the form of a silence quite hugely provoking. I watched them, I
      turned back to Mrs. Perry. That man, at least, touched something very like absolute truth who
      declared “it takes all sorts to make a world.”</p>
<p>“But of course I was very different to Charlotte,” my innocent companion continued. “I had
      not her requirements. I didn't mind makeshifts—”</p>
<p>She laughed a little apologetically.</p>
<p>“Between ourselves, I don't mind them much now. They make me feel easy. But they don't make
      Charlotte easy; they seem to mortify her, and she points things out to me—her standard of
      taste is very high. And I should be the last person to undervalue that, still sometimes I do
      find it a little tiring. You see, you never do quite get over the way you were brought up, Mr.
      Hammond. And I do seem to have so many
      <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7033-169"/> things to remember, people never troubled about when I was
      young, that when I have got hold of one I am pretty sure to forget some other; and, of course,
      I know that must be mortifying to Charlotte and her father.”</p>
<p>“Alas! we must all pay the penalties of progress, my dear lady,” I said, I trust not too
      abominably sententiously.</p>
<p>“I suppose we must”—Mrs. Perry sighed. “Still, it's a very troubling thing to feel what you
      do is a subject of mortification to others. Sometimes it makes me dreadfully low-spirited. I
      do try to feel it's just the cross that is laid upon me, Mr. Hammond; and to count the many
      undeserved blessings I have to set against it.”</p>
<p>Simplicity is disarming.</p>
<p>“I am sure you do,” I replied in tones of the sincerest conviction. “And among the blessings
      we are evidently to count these same settlements. Tell me about them, if it is not indiscreet
      to do so. I am profoundly curious in the matter.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I'm sure you are; and I don't think it is indiscreet with you—at least, if it
      is, I believe I can trust you not to mention it, because I think you are one of those who
      really do like to give pleasure, and naturally you see it's a great pleasure to me to have a
      little chat over it all. And, you know, I wouldn't say a single word for anything, but I had
      been told
      <pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7033-170"/> something, and, the consequence was, dear Charlotte and I
      did fall out a little yesterday. Mr. Perry took her away on the lake afterwards. I daresay he
      acted all for the best, but I felt rather hurt, you know. I daresay I had been over anxious.
      But she keeps it up—Charlotte does keep things up a little sometimes. She's been distant with
      me this morning even, so that I haven't been able to have a nice comfortable gossip with her
      over it all as it would seem suitable I should have.”</p>
<p>“All that will come later, dear Mrs. Perry,” I asserted. “Just now your daughter is of
      necessity slightly self-absorbed, slightly <foreign xml:lang="fre">distraite</foreign>. Surely
      you can recall a kindred state of mind under kindred circumstances—on the eve of your own
      marriage?”</p>
<p>“I'm sure I don't know. I am afraid I cried a great deal at leaving mother—though I wouldn't
      have given up Joseph—Mr. Perry, I mean—on any account. Charlotte doesn't ever cry—she never
      has been given to crying since she was a child, you know. And I suppose I oughtn't to want her
      to. But then Charlotte and I are very different. My tears always came easily.”</p>
<p>“Self-control is the order of the day,” I rejoined. “And as to these settlements, if you
      will pardon my importunity?”</p>
<p>“I am afraid I do wander,” Mrs. Perry said
      <pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7033-171"/> humbly. “They often tell me so. But, you see, I have had so
      much on my mind, and Mr. Perry has been very excitable,—really at times—let me see, he gives
      her—I mean Constantine does—a thousand a year for her separate use; that does seem to me very
      handsome. I'm sure I don't know what she can find to spend it on. I said to her she ought to
      put away more than half against a rainy day. But Constantine laughed—he has a very free,
      pleasant laugh has Constantine. But I don't feel quite easy about him. He looks very pulled
      and worn to me. I shouldn't like to think he'd anything on his mind, Mr. Hammond; but in those
      foreign places young men do lead very wild lives sometimes, I'm afraid.”</p>
<p>“Take my word for it, Leversedge is a jewel of gold, Mrs. Perry,” I asserted warmly.</p>
<p>“Well, I am sure I have often wished to ask you, only it didn't seem a proper thing to do.
      But just now it popped out before I could help it. And, of course, one does hear very sad
      stories now and then. But I suppose it's just his health then, the change, coming away from
      those very hot climates and everything. I think he wants care, and I am sure I should be very
      pleased to give it him. I often wish to make him nice little things to take, and look after
      his linen. If there's anything that goes to my heart it's that a young man should have to sew
      on his own tapes and buttons.
      <pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7033-172"/> But I am always afraid he might resent anything like that
      as a liberty. Of course, there's so much a person of my age can do for a gentleman that
      wouldn't be suitable from a younger person. Perhaps when Charlotte's married I may seem to get
      nearer to him.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Perry clasped and unclasped her hands nervously, upon that which had been her
      waist.</p>
<p>“It was a dreadful thing to lose our baby, Mr. Hammond,” she said. “I always wished for a
      son, and though I did pray to be kept from being rebellious, I am afraid I have been envious
      of other women when I saw them with nice little boys of their own. His dying seemed to leave
      me with a sort of emptiness; and I have felt lately as if Constantine—or any husband Charlotte
      had, because, of course, she might have married otherwise—might come to fill it, if I could
      only get near him, you know.”</p>
<p>The lady of the scarlet silk blouse had arisen from her couch upon the grass. She came
      slowly from under the dancing shade of the tulip-tree, and, passing with her companion along
      the sunny path, paused at the foot of the flight of steps below us. On either hand were wide
      beds of dwarf roses—pink, yellow, and red. Behind lay the long, downward slope of the great
      lawn to the alley by the shore—in which sauntered some ladies of our company, clothed in light
      summer dresses—
      <pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7033-173"/> overshadowed by poplars, chestnuts, and willows, between
      whose stems glittered the intense blue of the lake. The young woman had taken up her parable
      now, and the purrings and spittings of her curiously agitating Russian speech were as
      arresting to the attention as her vigorous angular gestures. My thoughts, I am ashamed to say,
      wandered. I did not hear the beginning of good Mrs. Perry's next remarks.</p>
<p>“—in case of his death—and I know it's wicked, Mr. Hammond, but I do so dislike death;—‘I
      leave to my wife Charlotte, absolutely, all I die possessed of,’ it said,—I mean, the will
      said.”</p>
<p>“Yes! that is liberal,” I exclaimed, half involuntarily. Poor Leversedge, there were no
      reservations, no half measures in his dealing, anyhow. Such as his life was, he lived it to
      the full.</p>
<p>“So it is,” Mrs. Perry agreed; “I really don't see how it could be more so. And there seems
      to be a great deal to leave in stocks and shares, and railways and land and mines, and so on.
      I didn't attempt to tot it up, for I felt a little overcome, you know; but Mr. Perry ran
      through it all in no time—Joseph always has been very noted for rapid calculation—and, of
      course, I know his face so well, after all these years, I could tell in an instant. Too, he
      did say to me, ‘princely, positively princely,’ under his breath, so I knew it must be
      something quite above the average, and
      <pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7033-174"/> that we all had reason to be very thankful. Still, I do
      wish nothing had been said about death, Mr. Hammond.”</p>
<p>I pointed out at some length, and with, I trust, the utmost mildness, that the question of
      death has a frequent habit of entering into the question of a will.</p>
<p>“I suppose it has,” Mrs. Perry said. “All the same, it does seem a very shocking thing for a
      young man like Constantine to be occupied about just when he's going to be married. Of course,
      it was very foolish, but it gave me a dreadful turn. It seemed somehow to bring back these
      last days when we lost our dear little boy; I am sure I don't know why, for Constantine is a
      grown man, and he was an infant. But I seemed to feel as if poor Charlotte was a widow before
      she was a wife, for the minute, if it isn't too familiar to say so, and that's enough to give
      anybody a turn, Mr Hammond, don't you think so?”</p>
