<head>CHAPTER II</head>
<p>IT happened thus. Leversedge was off duty. He and I were alone, drinking our coffee
      after luncheon in the central hall of the hotel. It is a very good hall, lighted from above by
      a glass roof. Galleries—over the white balustrades of which waiters and chambermaids, valets,
      couriers, and ladies'-maids lean half the day, watching the antics of their social superiors
      down below—open upon it right up to the fourth floor.</p>
<p>The Perrys had gone out to luncheon. Mrs. Septimus Mertyns had just announced her advent at
      a popular hostelry in the neighbouring little town—half a mile away down a scorching
      boulevard, very inadequately shaded by rows of small, round-headed mountain-ash trees. You may
      reach the place—the Perrys had done so—by means of an electric tram of phenomenal joltiness,
      the whirrings and hootings of which distract the sensitive ear from 7 A.M. to 9.30 at
      night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mertyns, like the highland chieftain of legend or heroic story, had brought her tail along
      <pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7033-011"/> with her. A truly resplendent tail, socially and
      intellectually considered; dazzling to the eyes of Perry <foreign xml:lang="fre">père et
       mère</foreign>, and even, in a degree, to the more experienced orbs of the Carissima also.
      For it counted a clever peeress who does not get on well with her stupid peer; pretty Mrs.
      Neville St. John, some time Miss Hattie White, an American. (She gets on equally well with St.
      John or without him, so there is no indiscretion in naming names. Upon the present occasion, I
      may remark, she was getting on quite capitally without him.) Walter Creighton, A.R.A., was
      also of the party; and Percy Gerrard, the well-known editor of the <title>Present Day</title>.
      Lastly, Septimus Mertyns himself, looking bleak and slightly harried. When his wife clearly is
      enjoying herself, it is reprehensibly weak of a husband to look harried. Bleak he must look, I
      suppose, poor dear, if nature has fashioned him that way,—but let that pass. The Perrys were
      bidden to meet the resplendent tail, and the Perrys went.</p>
<p>Leversedge did not go. Being a very true gentleman, he assumed that he had not cared to go.
      “It was too hot,”—too hot, forsooth, for this sun-grilled being just home from the tropics!
      Whether he had not been included in the invitation, or whether Miss Perry had desired him to
      refuse it, offered food for speculation. I could not determine. But I observed that he was a trifle
      <pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7033-012"/> low in his mind as he sat in that cool hall, among the palms
      and indiarubber plants, smoking the cigarette of peace and drinking black coffee. His talk ran
      on serious subjects.</p>
<p>The irruption of some lively children from out of the lift, accompanied by French <foreign xml:lang="fre">bonnes</foreign> and English governesses galore, caused a pause in our
      conversation. Leversedge was very fond of children, a wholesome trait in any man's character.
      He watched them, and as their cries and chatter died away out of doors in the garden he asked
      me—</p>
<p>“Do you believe in devils?”</p>
<p>Now, this, if you like, was serious. It almost amounted to being fundamental; and I own to
      an inherent distaste for formulating opinions upon fundamentals.</p>
<p>“A devil, Leversedge,” I therefore playfully protested. “Don't let us approach the question
      in the plural number. It becomes too complicated, too crowded. One devil,—one surely is enough
      for all practical purposes? In the singular he is precious, though archaic; and, if only for
      dramatic and literary reasons, I don't think we can afford to abolish him. He supplies the
      dash of absolute black, you see, which brings out all the delicate lights and shades of the
      moral picture. Without him the <foreign xml:lang="fre">nuances</foreign> would lose their
      values. No, we must keep one. He may be of any size you like,—quite a small one if you wish
      it, a veritable little
      <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7033-013"/> ewe-lamb of a devil. But for the sake of his colour,—I am
      getting slightly mixed as to sex, I fancy, but my knowledge of the sheepfold is scarcely
      professional,—well, of <emph>its</emph> colour, which is black, you understand, uncompromising
      black, I implore that one, just one, may be spared to us.”</p>
<p>Leversedge smiled upon me, but in a spirit of gentle endurance. His pensiveness remained,
      unabated.</p>
<p>“I was not talking of property devils,” he answered; “and they would hardly serve your
      purpose anyhow; for they seem to make them red nowadays, mostly, not black. I saw
       <title>Faust</title> last time I was home, at the Lyceum; but I didn't think the scarlet
      variety patronised there amounted to very much. They were altogether too solid. You know, at a
      push you could do for them,—shoot, or stick, or strangle them. You must be an uncommonly poor
      lot if you find things frightening that you could strangle.”</p>
<p>He smoked reflectively for a little.</p>
<p>“No,” he went on; “I—I mean you—I mean nobody's afraid of what they can strangle. Even when
      I was home last, I could have supplied the management with the ground-plan of a much nastier
      species of fiend than those hairy, pudding-bodied creatures. And now—”</p>
<p>Leversedge's voice caught with a click in his throat. He sprang to his feet, making a violent
      <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7033-014"/> movement of both hands, as though forcing something heavy
      and clinging off his lap.</p>
<p>“Get down,” he cried, “you brute,—you hideous brute.”</p>
<p>This was startling. But there are incidents which, while provoking curiosity almost to
      bursting-point, have about them a gravity—a gravity born of their very absurdity
      sometimes—which would effectually prevent any but a double-soled idiot making comments or
      asking questions. I did neither. Leversedge had just spoken of people being frightened; and
      that more sympathetically than I should have expected, for he was himself certainly no
      poltroon. He was a quiet, steady, sensible fellow, the kind of man to whom women turn
      instinctively, as to a life-belt or lightning-conductor, in an emergency. Yet at this moment
      his face expressed fear, and more than fear. It expressed downright terror and uncontrollable
      disgust.</p>
<p>Really he presented a very distressing spectacle. His mouth was slightly open, while his
      lips curled back queerly from his teeth. It may sound ridiculous, but I could almost swear
      that his hair bristled. His action had been too rapid for premeditation. I never doubted it
      was wholly spontaneous and honest. Still, I knew—knew as positively as I have ever known
      anything in my life—that nothing, animate or inanimate, had been reposing upon his
      <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7033-015"/> excellently white, flannel trousers. Knew, equally well,
      that nothing had slipped from off them on to the inlaid marble floor as, beating his knees, he
      lunged up out of the chair beside me.</p>
<p>We had only just finished our coffee. The tray and a <foreign xml:lang="fre">flacon</foreign> of cognac still stood on the table before me. After about a minute
      Leversedge laid hold of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">flacon</foreign>, and emptied half its
      contents into one of the dirty coffee-cups. He gulped down the brandy, and wiped his moustache
      and beard—as well as he could, for his teeth were chattering and his hands shaking, like those
      of a person in the cold fit of a fever. Then he walked up and down the length of the hall once
      or twice, fished a cane stool out from under one of the seats, came back and sat down beside
      me again.</p>
<p>He had entered into possession of himself. But he was still shaking. Very carefully he
      placed the stool on his knees, wrong way about, so that the four legs of it stuck up into the
      air, took out his cigarette case, and lighted another cigarette.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, Hammond,” he said, as he did so. “This has not happened to me for some
      time, and it took me by surprise. I don't make such a fool of myself when I am in
      training—when I'm habitually hag-ridden. But I've been pretty free of all that lately.”</p>
<p>He looked round, doing his best to smile, though his lips twitched oddly.</p>
<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7033-016"/>
<p>“Now, do you believe in devils?” he asked. “Real ones, I mean,—not property devils.”</p>
<p>“I believe in liver, my dear friend,” I asserted. “And still more sincerely do I believe in
      nerves, which are superior in the production of torments to all the Satans generated by the
      unhealthy imaginations of all ascetics, Oriental and mediæval, put together.”</p>
<p>“And still more readily do you believe in drink, I suppose,” he said quietly. “Only let me
      remind you, the monsters that haunt drunkards do it openly in broad day. You can see them, so
      they tell me, as plain as your hand. Now, I only see this beast at night, when the lights are
      out and there's no moon. And even then only—only part of it. By day I only feel it.”</p>
<p>Leversedge shook again all over, while he slowly slid the cane stool up and down his
      lap.</p>
<p>“When I begin to see it in the light, I shall have sense enough left to look for the nearest
      lunatic asylum, I hope. Or put an end to the business in an even more effectual manner.”</p>
<p>What did I do? Naturally I did what everyone does, except a very few women—on whom may
      heaven rain all blessings, they richly deserve such, faithful souls!—what everyone, I say,
      does when a fellow-creature is in anly vital need of help, or advice, or encouragement. I
      expended myself in ineptitudes, in palpable platitudes, in sieve-like
      <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7033-017"/> commonplaces of consolation, through which the comfort ran
      with the silliest little tinkle imaginable.</p>
<p>Poor Leversedge listened in commendable patience.</p>
<p>“You're extremely kind,” he said; “but this is nothing new. It's been going on for ever so
      long. I've tried drugs, and dieting, and doctors—they make no difference. I hoped perhaps
      coming back to Europe and the old life—”</p>
<p>He paused, still sliding the stool backwards and forwards in that unpleasantly suggestive
      manner.</p>
<p>“Smoke, please,” he said. “Do you mind my telling you? I've never told anybody before. The
      best and the worst things that happen to you, you keep to yourself as a rule, you know.
      But—but—I'm rather knocked about by what's just occurred. I should be glad to have you
      know.”</p>
<p>Again the stool travelled backwards and forwards. Then Leversedge said slowly—</p>
<p>“It began like this—I had been riding for a couple of days expecting to strike a mining camp
      where I had business. But I'd fever on me, and got out of my course. Do you know the Veldt,
      Hammond? Of course you don't—the endless roll of the treeless land, under the dome of the
      thick, tropic sky, both alike grey with the heavy, deadly heat. It gets you with a sort of
      despair. You look at it as you might look at a sentence of penal
      <pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7033-018"/> servitude for life. The monotony takes the heart out of
      you—that, and the heat, the killing heat. At last the hazy warming-pan of a sun went down, and
      the dark came quick, and I muddled on pretty well done. And, from the top of one of those
      everlasting bare ridges, I saw the white tilts of a couple of waggons showing up about half a
      mile away. It wasn't my camp, but it meant something in the way of rest and help. At least, I
      thought so at first, though there was no smoke, and the whole place seemed unaccountably
      quiet, save for the yapping of a dog.”</p>
<p>Leversedge looked round at me, and spoke as though forcing himself.</p>
<p>“I needn't go into details, Hammond,” he said. “That camp was dead. Even in the night, which
      decently hides a good deal, it was a ghastly place. I suppose they'd all died of thirst, they
      and the oxen. And I had fever on me. I shall never know quite all I did see. But in one of the
      waggons I made out a dead woman. Underneath it a dog was tied, a small, yellowish cur, the
      only thing left alive, and it yapped. And—and—there had been a child in the waggon, a little
      baby-child—and I suppose it had lived longer than the rest. And it must have crawled out over
      the tail of the waggon, and fallen close to the dog. It lay there, a white bundle of a thing
      in the gloom. And the dog squatted with its forepaws out across the
      <pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7033-019"/> child's chest, its eyes showing green, straining at the rope
      which tied it. And bending down from the saddle—I was too weak with fever to get off—my horse,
      too, would have scared, it was half mad at—well—at the death all round it, and the stench—I
      saw that the brute had torn the child's throat—for—for the blood.”</p>
<p>He paused a moment. And when he continued, it struck me through all the absorbing terror of
      his story that Leversedge was one of those persons who, even under severest stress of adverse
      circumstance, try to be just.</p>
<p>“I know it was starving,” he said, “and—which is worse—it was parched. Men have done as bad
      things before now at sea,—only, I tell you, Hammond, I had to kill that dog. I could not
      afford to squander cartridges, but I could spare a couple. Twice I tried it, but my revolver
      was heavy, and I was altogether played out, so that my hand shook. The bullets only cut the
      rope. And then—then—I was taken with a sort of panic, Hammond. I cleared out of that awful
      place; and the dog came too.”</p>
<p>His voice sank; and while one hand still held the upturned legs of the stool, he leant
      sideways, and with the other made a slow level motion as of something passing across the
      floor.</p>
<p>“It kept pace with my horse. Those dreadful eyes looking up at me—two yellowish-green discs
      <pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7033-020"/> galloping beside me, dropping behind for a minute or two,
      coming up with me again, mile after mile, all through the night. And the night seemed years
      and years long—”</p>
<p>I am afraid it is true, even with the most civilised of us, that the appetite for horror
      grows with what it feeds on. I am naturally a soft man, a dweller in tents, of the Jacob
      rather than the Esau order of mind. I detest adventures, save of the drawing-room and
      five-o'clock-tea sort. Yet, as Leversedge ceased speaking, I was sensible of an unholy craving
      for more of these horrors. And, when his silence grew somewhat prolonged, I found myself—to my
      shame—saying greedily—</p>
<p>“Well, my dear fellow, well? That's not the end?”</p>
<p>Leversedge turned to me with that pathetically patient smile of his. Did I perceive, though,
      the faintest flavour of contempt behind it? The contempt of Esau, the fighter and hunter, the
      dealer in primitive passions, for the smooth-handed Jacob of the club, and the pavement, and
      the silver teapot?</p>
<p>“No, that's not the end,” he answered at last; “that's only the beginning.—I need not bother
      you with the whole set out. I was pretty bad for some time; though I stumbled across my own
      people next day, and we struck a vein of luck at our mining place, and the money was rolling in
      <pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7033-021"/> hand over hand. It seemed as if the curse and the gold had
      come together.—As soon as I could move I went down to the coast and got away to sea. And I
      thought it was all right. We were a couple of degrees south of the equator, and there had been
      a bad electric storm which had made us all feel pretty jumpy; but the rain had come down and
      the weather was mending. Everyone else had gone under cover—some music and singing was going
      on in the saloon—and I was standing forward against the bulwarks with the doctor. He was a
      nice little chap—tremendously keen on travel and on natural history. He died of fever a year
      and a half afterwards, I heard, exploring somewhere up the Congo. I've always been sorry he
      dropped out. There was good stuff in him.—But about this affair of mine. It must have been
      about half-past eight, and it was very close notwithstanding the rain; and very dark, but for
      the glimmer through the slats of the saloon shutters. And right along the length of the
      promenade deck, straight at us, came a dog, just as hard as it could lick. I only saw its
      eyes,—two glowing green discs a trifle bigger than a sixpence,—but there was no mistaking what
      they were. They travelled along about nine inches above the level of the deck, sometimes
      higher, sometimes lower, as the thing galloped. It turned, just short of us, round the end of
      the saloon, and went, as I supposed, down the other
      <pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7033-022"/> side of the deck. I spoke to the doctor about it—I hoped
      there might be a dog on board I did not know of—but he hadn't observed anything. Then the eyes
      came racing up our side of the deck again. I pointed them out to him, still he didn't see.
      Still I had a sort of hope about me, so I knelt down and whistled the brute to come to
      me.”</p>
<p>Leversedge grasped the up-turned legs of the stool, and leaned forward, looking across to
      where the great glass doors of the hall opened on to the buff of the carriage-drive, and the
      dancing green of the garden in blaze of sunshine beyond.</p>
<p>“It came,” he said. “The eyes were close to me,—quite close. People are sentimental on board
      ship, you know. A girl was singing ‘Annie Laurie’ in the saloon. She'd an uncommonly pretty
      voice. I heard the words of the song quite distinctly; that and the swish of the water against
      the side, and the steady pounding of the engines, as I put out my hand to pat the beast's
      head. And my hand went down, clean down, within a couple of inches of those eyes, where its
      neck should have been—where its neck was—I swear it was—clean down on to the wet planks of the
      deck.—Then I knew something very evil was upon me. In that dead camp I had seen the
      Thing-too-Much.—For there is a Thing-too-Much, you know, in nature, in men and women, in what
      happens. And you may tell by the look in a person's face whether they've
      <pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7033-023"/> seen it. They mayn't be cowards; most fairly healthy people
      have really plenty of pluck. Only, I tell you what takes it out of the bravest. They have seen
      Fear,—Fear itself, that there's no getting over or arguing about. They've been ‘to the end of
      the world and looked over the wall,’—they got to the place from which there's no way out.—Oh!
      I say,” he cried suddenly, “here comes Charlotte—Miss Perry—and the others.”</p>
<p>Then Leversedge, “the man who had gone to the end of the world and looked over the wall,”
      glanced at the <foreign xml:lang="fre">flacon</foreign> of cognac; thought better of it, got
      up and went across the hall to meet the returning revellers.</p>
<p>I am fond of contrasts. At that moment I had reason to congratulate myself. Here promised to
      be contrasts of a high order of interest.</p>
