<head>CHAPTER I</head>
<p>“<hi>THIS</hi> is jocund,” cried Mr. Perry, when I met him in the hall next morning.</p>
<p>In honour of impending events he was clothed distinctly as a citizen, in a shiny black-cloth
      frock coat and a tall hat—which last he put on and took off again with rather feverish
      uncertainty. This might be jocund, yet I am bound to confess I found his appearance highly
      suggestive of that of a successful undertaker. In manner he was varied, spry in the main, but
      lapsing into reticence, self-recollection, even austerity.</p>
<p>“My ladies will be with us directly. At least, if they're not I'll just run up in the lift
      and fetch them. The fair sex is too often a little, just a little deficient in that strict
      observance of the virtue of punctuality, Mr. Hammond, which the sterner public duties falling
      to our lot compel us so
      <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7033-197"/> rigidly to practise. Well, well, we must pardon them— <quote>
<l>'Tis theirs to note the passing of the hour,</l>
<l rend="ti-1">Reclined at ease upon the low divan,</l>
<l>But by the sunshine's waxing, waning power,</l>
<l>But by the opening, closing of the flower,</l>
<l rend="ti-1">The lute's faint echo and the faltering fan</l>
<l rend="ti-1">As sleep invades the drooping eyelids' delicate span,”</l>
</quote> recited Mr. Perry, suddenly becoming quite voluptuous and eastern.—“And on an
      auspicious occasion such as this, we all know how it is,” he added indulgently,—“a bow of
      ribbon here, a trinket there; just those supplementary, those fancy touches, which the mirror
      provokes and from the multiplication of which every true woman finds it so hard to tear
      herself away. Even Mamma is vain. I am happy to say so—upon my word, I am proud to say so.
      For, that a woman should continue to desire to please after three decades of married
      life—though 'tis hardly fair on Mamma to let cats out of bags as to the lapse of time in this
      way, eh?—shows a marvellous freshness of sentiment, of what I may call a wholesomeness of
      disposition, doesn't it, Mr. Hammond?”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Perry increasingly claims my respectful admiration,” I replied, with perfect
      sincerity.</p>
<p>“Good,” he murmured, “good, good. Occasions such as that which brings us together this
      morning—and most happy I am, I'm sure, to be brought
      <pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7033-198"/> together—inevitably carry us back in thought and unseal the
      fount of tender memories. Yes, I am glad to record my hearty conviction that I was not in
      error when I invited her, whom you now know as Susan Perry, to become the partner of my mortal
      course. And it's not every husband who can say as much as that at the end of thirty years, Mr.
      Hammond. Little ups and downs,” he added archly,—“little ups and downs, as a matter of course;
      but on the whole the ups have it.”</p>
<p>Here the arrival of the hotel omnibus at the wide-open door of the portico, with much
      grating of the brake and the jingling of the fat horses' collar bells, claimed Mr. Perry's
      attention. He glanced at his watch in an important, high-official sort of manner, then relaxed
      genially.</p>
<p>“Time yet—time yet,” he said. “We can still afford our ladies five more minutes in which to
      complete the mysteries of the toilette.—Constantine has preceded us on foot to the station. I
      have had a word with him this morning. He appears serious; but that is as it should be. I, for
      one, would not have it otherwise. For, indeed, I have not abstained from pressing home upon
      him frequently, in familiar conversation, the very heavy responsibility which he undertakes in
      undertaking my daughter's future happiness.—But our fair companions tarry. I must see to it.—A
      <pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7033-199"/> moment to fetch Charlotte and Mamma and I will be with you
      again, Mr. Hammond. <foreign xml:lang="fre">Au revoir—a bientôt</foreign>.”</p>
<p>And, humming strange melodies, which I imagine were intended to represent Mendelssohn's
      time-honoured Wedding March, Mr. Perry bestowed himself within the painted cage of the lift,
      and was borne aloft, vanishing god-like in the upper regions of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Yet, after all, was it jocund? I asked myself this question many times as we set forth, a
      self-conscious and ill-assorted little band, upon the morning of that particularly grilling
      September day. For clearly, to my thinking, it would have been far better had we proceeded in
      detachments—Leversedge and myself by boat and the others by train, or <foreign xml:lang="fre">vice versâ</foreign>. I cannot think it fair to keep a man constantly under inspection when
      he is just about to condemn himself to that form of life-sentence commonly known as marriage.
      And the disadvantages of the bridegroom's position were aggravated, in the present instance,
      by the fact that this was but a dress rehearsal, the production of the piece not really taking
      place until to-morrow. I had ventured to submit that it would be a more merciful arrangement
      did the religious marriage follow hard on the heels of the civil one; and did we—Perry
       <foreign xml:lang="fre">père et mère</foreign> and myself—say farewell to the happy pair at Geneva,
      <pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7033-200"/> leaving them to set forth promptly upon their wedding
      journey.</p>
<p>But the wisdom of the Perry family decided otherwise, and I fancy the proprietor of the
       <foreign xml:lang="fre">Grand Hôtel</foreign>, foreseeing custom, fortified them in their
      decision. It was to be a <foreign xml:lang="fre">fête</foreign>, a gala. The little grey
      English Church, which stands in such agitatingly close proximity to the railway that passing
      trains take a very active part in the service, was to be turned into St. George's, Hanover
      Square, for the event. All would be there, friends and enemies alike—for what pretty and
      popular woman but is bound to number a few of the latter among her acquaintance, specially in
      the restricted society of a summer hotel?</p>
<p>“I could have wished to give my daughter away,” Mr. Perry had said to me, “within the
      hallowed precincts of one of our fine, old, historic piles. But, since that pious satisfaction
      is denied me, we must make the most we can of what we have,—make the most of it. A foreign
      land, an alien tongue, but still a rally of warm English hearts about our blushing bride. This
      our sojourn at the <foreign xml:lang="fre">Grand Hôtel</foreign> will have secured us. We can
      count on it, I am happy to say,—count on it.”</p>
<p>So we set forth for Geneva, a self-conscious and ill-assorted little band, as I have already
      stated; and should doubtless have returned thence in
      <pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7033-201"/> the same order, or disorder, save for an unexpected turn of
      feeling on the part of Charlotte Perry.</p>
<p>And here let me pause to render a tribute to a lady of whom I have so far, I am afraid,
      spoken with but moderate enthusiasm, viz., Mrs. Mertyns, who, on this memorable day, certainly
      did her possible to mitigate the embarrassments of the situation.</p>
<p>It fell to my lot to convey Mrs. Perry across the many lines of metals intervening between
      the platform and the train for Geneva. Have you ever happened to drive a tender-hearted stray
      sheep and a loitering lamb? I never have; yet after my experience with Mrs. Perry I seem to
      possess a quite professional knowledge of such driving. For it required all the authority, let
      alone all the persuasive arts, of which I am master to compel the dear, good woman—glorious in
      a purple poplin costume, plentifully “relieved” with gold sequins—across those many lines of
      rails. With the greatest activity I had to head her off to right and left, as she turned and
      doubled, greatly flustered, afraid of non-existent trains, afraid of possible disaster to Mr.
      Perry, supremely afraid of parting with her lamb, the Carissima; afraid that innocent creature
      would be left behind, lost, never bestowed safely within the matrimonial fold after all. And
      it was with sincere relief, after
      <pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7033-202"/> prolonged struggles, that I beheld the grim form and
      cast-iron countenance of the great Septimus Mertyns advancing upon us. Two might attain where
      one had failed. To begin with, he assured my agitated charge that there was plenty of time; to
      go on with, that he had secured seats for us all in a first-class carriage. He proceeded, with
      my assistance, kindly but firmly to hoist the panting lady up the narrow iron steps on to the
      back platform of the said carriage, promising that he would go and find the other members of
      the party and bring them to her.</p>
<p>In the doorway Mrs. Mertyns met us. Forgive me if I fall into the style of contemporary
      fiction—for truly Mrs. Mertyns is nothing if not contemporary—and describe her as a long,
      diaphanous dream of a woman, clothed in slightly faded mauve and white. Her head was crowned
      by a large white chip hat, embowered in shaded mauve carnations, and smothered in a vast white
      net veil tied in a bow high at the back. Her rather thin throat was surrounded by several rows
      of very good pearls. I understand that pearls, like germinating seeds or hatching chickens,
      need a tender and steady warmth to bring them to perfection. To secure this, Mrs. Mertyns
      invariably wore her pearls. My imagination fails to picture her without them.</p>
<p>As of course you know, her looks, in certain
      <pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7033-203"/> circles, have afforded a perennial subject of controversy.
      Some persons assert that she is washed out, sandy, her features meaningless, her figure quite
      uncomfortably attenuated, her arms of a length and leanness almost distressing. They amiably
      add, as a rule, that she is unpardonably self-conscious both in speech and bearing; while
      other, and no doubt more enlightened, critics find in each of the above peculiarities an added
      note of beauty. Not the robust flesh-and-blood beauty, well understood, which the mistaken
      Greek loved to sculpture or the mistaken Venetian to paint; but a beauty altogether refined
      and spiritual—a joy to the imagination rather than the eye, a sentiment rather than a sight, a
      flavour rather than a feeling, a face and form, in short, redolent of infinite suggestion.
      These critics usually wind up their discourse with a reference to Septimus Q.C., and
      murmur—“But, how <emph>could</emph> she?”—in faltering voices.</p>
<p>For my own part, I have always held Mrs. Mertyns to be a very clever person; clever to the
      point of possessing all the effect of a pretty woman, while being, in point of fact, a plain
      one. This is among the very highest of social arts. The successful professor of it commands my
      applause. The more so, probably, that our own well-beloved country-women are somewhat
      incapable in the exercise of it. They need to be really quite pretty before they know how to
      appear so. Such
      <pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7033-204"/> conduct is weakly realistic. Neither their French nor
      American sisters are much handicapped by such obviously false modesties.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mertyns, standing just inside the railway carriage, took good flustered Mrs. Perry's
      thick warm hand tenderly in her long thin one.</p>
<p>“I am so truly glad you are the first to come,” she said, with gentle haste, “because if you
      object, or if you think darling Charlotte would object, you can tell me so at once—we are old
      enough friends, dear Mrs. Perry, to dare to be truthful, are we not?—and I will disappear
      immediately.”</p>
<p>She crossed her left hand over her right, and, with raised elbow and drooping wrist, took my
      left hand and held it.</p>
<p>“Ah! so you are admitted,” she added brightly. “That is delightful. It gives me hope that I
      am not intrusive, after all, in thus coming.”</p>
<p>Then she swayed over Mrs. Perry with renewed tenderness.</p>
<p>“You know how close Charlotte's and my intercourse has been, and how deeply I value her
      friendship—”</p>
<p>“I'm sure you've always tried to behave most kindly by her,” put in Mrs. Perry.</p>
<p>“Kindly?—no, dear Mrs. Perry, the word, the idea, is out of place between your Charlotte and
      myself. I shall always feel it has been one of the truest privileges of my life to be so much with
      <pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7033-205"/> her, to watch her growing powers. Her charm is very, very
      great—you feel it so, don't you, Mr. Hammond?”</p>
<p>“It is unique,” I replied.</p>
<p>Mrs. Perry stared at me.</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose I never shall understand you clever people,” she remarked in tones of
      slight dejection. “As I said, I'm sure there's no one—though I'm sure Charlotte's a very
      fortunate girl in having Mr. Leversedge care so much about her—that Mr. Perry and I would
      sooner have—”</p>
<p>I cast an agonised glance upon Mrs. Mertyns. If she possessed tact, in heaven's name let her
      use it!</p>
<p>“Ah yes,” she said, rising nobly to the occasion, “Mr. Leversedge is so good and
      unaffected—so honest, and English. Everyone must see that. But he is very, very fortunate too,
      dear Mrs. Perry. Charlotte's friends, of course, cannot help dwelling very much in thought on
      that. To be her constant companion would be so truly elevating for any man. Think of the
      delight of her brightness and depth of character! The combination is extraordinary—”</p>
<p>Mrs. Mertyns paused, looking up, smiling at the roof of the railway carriage, her shoulders
      slightly raised and her long wrists crossed just below her bosom. Then she swayed over Mrs.
      Perry again in sudden anxiety.</p>
<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7033-206"/>
<p>“But you are sure you do not think my coming to-day an intrusion?” she said. “I felt so
      strongly about it. I felt I really must come. And yet I was diffident. We discussed the
      question yesterday evening all through dinner. I think all my people would have liked to come.
      But I could not allow that. I know your Charlotte so well. I know and respect her instinctive
      shrinking from publicity. And so I said I would just slip away quietly with my husband. We
      would take a little Darby and Joan day's holiday. We could efface ourselves immediately if it
      seemed better to do so. But I thought it possible Septimus might be useful, for I gathered
      from what Mr. Perry told me there were papers to be witnessed, and my husband is so utterly
      dependable and so accustomed—ah! dear friend,” she cried, making a little rustling rush
      forward with both arms outstretched.</p>
<p>“Well, then, here's Lottie at last! And I'm sure I'm as thankful as possible, Mr. Hammond,
      for I was as nervous as could be something would happen to some of them.”</p>
<p>This parenthetically from Mrs. Perry.</p>
<p>Charlotte looked exceedingly pretty, standing there framed by the dark lines of the doorway.
      She wore a biscuit-coloured dress with very large pink sleeves to it; and a hat to match,
      garlanded with pink roses, the broad brim of which, turning
      <pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7033-207"/> up, formed a pale straw-coloured nimbus about her head. The
      girl's mouth gathered, quivered; her eyes were adorably dewy. She and Mrs. Mertyns held each
      other's hands, looked at each other, sighed, kissed with a sort of chastened rapture,
      murmuring simultaneously—</p>
<p>“Dear, dear friend!”</p>
<p>“I have not done wrong in coming?”</p>
<p>It seemed as if Charlotte Perry could not answer. She threw back her head, smiled, bit her
      lip. Then suddenly she seemed to become aware of my presence. Her breath caught, as though in
      pain. This appeared to me a quite uncalled-for demonstration, for had we not come down
      together inside the omnibus to the station?</p>
<p>Mrs. Mertyns took the place by the window—drew Miss Perry down on the one next to her. I
      think it had been her intention I should occupy the vacant place opposite,—upon the seat of
      the other she had piled parasols, dust cloaks, and a large basket of fruit and flowers,—but if
      such was her intention it was frustrated by the advent of our active Perry, who whipped into
      the empty place, rubbing his hands.</p>
<p>“Delightful surprise!” he cried. “I am sure, most delightful. A display of sympathy, of
      spontaneous solicitude, altogether flattering to myself and my family; adding one more to an
      already long list of charming acts of courtesy.
      <pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7033-208"/> We are in your debt, and how to pay,” said Mr. Perry, with
      sudden solemnity, “passes me. I ransack the chambers of my brain, but they are empty of any
      suggestion of a possible means of payment. Yet,” he continued, brightening, “who knows, a time
      may come, an opportunity may be granted me, and then— <quote>
<l>The faithful heart bound fast to thine by gracious friendly deeds,</l>
<l>Will rouse to stalwart action interpreting thy needs.”</l>
</quote></p>
<p>Charlotte Perry looked hard at the speaker. Then she addressed her friend in low and hurried
      accents.</p>
