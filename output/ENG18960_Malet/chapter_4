<head>CHAPTER IV</head>
<p>I WAS called away to Evian for a couple of days to meet a friend—who does not enter
      into this history, so we will, if you please, leave her out of it. I returned, rather
      depressed, by an afternoon boat that was packed with an amazingly plain-headed selection of
      tourists of all nations. They named the mountains by the help of red Baedekers, patronised the
      beauties of nature, smoked atrocious tobacco, expectorated freely, and were othervise
      objectionable to almost every sense.</p>
<p>Yet if you could detach your mind from the vileness of surrounding humanity, the aspect of
      nature was very enjoyable. Rain had fallen in the early morning, and the fresh-washed
      landscape wore a delightfully clean and youthful look. The hotels and villas on the north
      shore of the lake shone out among their rich orchards and gardens; while the lake itself, a
      “heavenly floor,” showing all shades from indigo to azure, was turned up with the most
      delectable bottle-green at the edges. The Savoy Alps were azure likewise, shot with pinkish
      lights upon their topmost crags, and with a
      <pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7033-039"/> bloom of sunlit woods about their feet. The Swiss are
      nothing but a nation of “<foreign xml:lang="fre">marchands de soupe</foreign>.” Granted; but
      it must be conceded they have the merit of selling the contents of their stock-pots in an
      admirably pretty country.</p>
<p>On disembarking, the first person I saw—barring the heavy porter in peg-top trousers, who
      managed the gang-plank—was Mr. Perry. He appeared worried. He scuttled up and down over the
      black timbers of the pier and clung to the rusty side-rails, scanning the lovely levels of the
      lake with irritable eyes. At intervals he hailed some—to me—imperceptible object in the far
      distance, and signalled with a bulky white umbrella. Catching sight of me, he saluted me with
      wavings of this instrument.</p>
<p>“Ah! you are back again, Mr. Hammond,” he cried. “And all our little society will be most
      happy to welcome you back—I'm sure, most happy. Even in so purely fortuitous an association of
      our fellow-creatures, even in the passing relations of an hotel, we miss the accustomed face,
      the vacant place at table raises a regret.”</p>
<p>I expressed my sense of indebtedness for these polite observations. But Mr. Perry bad
      returned to his agitated survey of the lake.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” he exclaimed. “I think I perceive them.”</p>
<p>He climbed upon the cross-bar ironwork of
      <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7033-040"/> rails with surprising agility, and gave forth a really
      portentous howl.</p>
<p>“Coming in that direction you must have seen them in passing, Mr. Hammond, in the steamer,”
      he said, turning suddenly and almost angrily upon me, after waiting vainly for some response
      to this terrible noise. “Did you not recognise them?”</p>
<p>“Who and what are they?” I ventured to inquire.</p>
<p>“Constantine Leversedge has taken my daughter out boating.”—Mr. Perry descended dejectedly
      from his perch.—“No, I was in error. I did not perceive them, nor evidently did you.”</p>
<p>He removed his hat and wiped his forehead. I may mention that Mr. Perry invariably wore a
      tall hat at this period, and black clothes. After which ceremony he somewhat recovered his
      equanimity.</p>
<p>“No, no,” he cried, “we must school ourselves, we must school ourselves— <quote>
<l>To wait and hope, and still to hope and wait,</l>
<l>Last lesson learned by man of heaven directed fate.</l>
</quote> But I am not among the pessimists, Mr. Hammond. I can look forward, I am thankful to
      say, and look up.”</p>
<p>All of which unquestionably was very praiseworthy on the part of Mr. Perry; but a little too
      large, so it struck me, for the immediate situation. I pointed out that the young people were
      in no
      <pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7033-041"/> danger, that disaster was wholly improbable, the sky being
      absolutely clear, the water as smooth as a millpond.</p>
<p>“Ah, you misconceive me,” Mr. Perry rejoined.—He carried his head on one side, and nodded
      sagely, looking up from under his eyebrows.—“You misconceive me. I fear other dangers than
      material ones just now,—a father's anxieties, natural and not I think condemnable where the
      future of so dear an object as an only daughter is concerned. Frankly, then,—for in speaking
      to you I speak to a man of the world, Mr. Hammond,—our charming friends, Mrs. Septimus Mertyns
      and Mr. Gerrard, have called. They are actually here, they are indoors with Mamma. And it
      annoys me,” he said, “I cannot disguise from myself that it annoys me profoundly, my daughter
      should not be at home to receive them. Constantine shows himself inconsiderate in detaining
      her so long. I thought it probable our friends would visit us this afternoon, and I gave him a
      pretty broad hint on the subject. I regret to say so—but you must have observed it yourself,
      Mr. Hammond—Constantine Leversedge is obtuse, unhappily obtuse; he is insufficiently sensible
      of his social privileges. Having been deprived of intellectual advantages, and the enjoyment
      of intercourse with persons of superior gifts and position for so long, I should have expected
      him to prize these things highly.
      <pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7033-042"/> But unfortunately it is not so. He displays, is displaying
      at this moment, in my opinion, a lamentable indifference to an opportunity of cultivating a
      most valuable acquaintance. I hoped he had taken my hint. He assured me he would return soon
      after five. Unless I am very much mistaken, six will be striking almost immediately.”</p>
<p>Evidently this was serious. So I tried to appease Mr. Perry by remarking that, considering
      how exquisite a companion he possessed, Leversedge's conduct was more than comprehensible,
      excusable, almost justifiable. For is not unpunctuality, as I pointed out, the natural
      prerogative of happy lovers? For them time has ceased. Eternity enfolds them. How, then, can
      they be expected to remember that wholly mechanical contrivance, the clock? And, to pass from
      the general to the particular, was it altogether inconceivable that even Mrs. Mertyns might,
      at a push, recall faint memories of a period when to linger with the great Septimus beyond the
      appointed time had been bliss? Was Perry himself, indeed, entirely guiltless under this head?
      For had he never, in the dear dead past, toyed with Mrs. Perry,—pretty, pretty
      picture!—oblivious of the fleet-footed hours, which, as the poets so insistently remind us,
      “will not stay”?</p>
<p>“Ah yes, the young will be young, will be young, Mr. Hammond,” he admitted. “It therefore is
      <pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7033-043"/> incumbent upon those who, like Mamma and myself, have
      reached what I may term the watershed of our terrestrial existence, to watch attentively and
      prevent the commission of thoughtless indiscretion on the part of our youthful relatives. Keep
      a sharp look-out on our green apples, our green apples, ah ha!—eh? And society is not to be
      trifled with. Not—but, excuse me, this time I do perceive them.”</p>
<p>A rowing-boat, containing two persons, rounded the nose of the stone breakwater which
      protects the bathing-place and little harbour on the right of the garden. And my companion,
      uttering ejaculations of uncontrollable satisfaction, chased off the steamboat pier and
      trotted along the path at the bottom of the hotel grounds to meet it.</p>
<p>The breakwater, I may mention, runs back in a low, broad-topped stone wall, enclosing two
      sides of a triangular piece of ground planted with close rows of plane trees. The hotel
      boatman's house stands at one corner. The men dry their nets here, and the boats are hauled up
      for repairs. It is a nice, moist, shady place, commanding an entrancing view, where the gnat
      trumpets by day and by night, and the midge actively investigates all pasturage afforded by
      the human loiterer.</p>
<p>As for me, I never run; should not, I imagine, were it even to clasp to my heart a potentially
      <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7033-044"/> eloping daughter—which thing, heaven, in its mercy,
      eternally forbid! So I followed Mr. Perry, in all the calm dignity of the non-parental mind,
      along the lake path under quivering balsam-poplars and charmingly pendent willows, arriving at
      the place of gnats only in time to see his lop-sided, little, black figure and the tall,
      cream-coloured one of the fair Charlotte speeding away, through sunshine and shadow, in the
      direction of the hotel and social distinction.</p>
<p>Verily, the ways of Providence are not equal! I had returned from Evian in a depressed frame
      of mind, as I have already recorded. I had started for that agreeably mundane little
      watering-place in a somewhat Byronic humour, determined to do a trifle of living on my own
      account. But the humour had not lasted. With me it rarely does. Once on the spot, a spirit of
      pallid Platonism invaded me, chilling to death all possibility of drama. It really was rather
      provoking, for I love drama; and the position had been worthy of one of those French comedies
      from which the heart must be extracted, during the process of adaptation for the English
      stage, if young maidens are to be spared anxiety when taking members of the elder generation
      to the theatre. I had planned it all so nicely, yet nothing had come of it. And now, directly
      I returned to this innocent locality, to these commonplace, not to
      <pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7033-045"/> say rather common, people, I found that, in full play which
      I had vainly sought across the water.</p>
<p>Mr. Perry's conversation had given me food for thought. While one glance at Leversedge
      assured me that for him the wheels had been going round during my absence, going round to some
      purpose.</p>
