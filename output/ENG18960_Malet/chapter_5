<head>CHAPTER V</head>
<p>HE had just beached the boat, a gaudy emerald-green and buff affair with scarlet
      cushions to it, and stood in the shifting angular shadow of the plane trees, watching the
      receding figure of the lady of his affections and that of his prospective father-in-law. As
      they passed out of sight, behind a belt of flowering shrubs in the garden, Leversedge half
      shut his eyes and threw back his head. Then his chin dropped on his chest, and he stared
      vacantly at a pair of swans sailing about the clear water of the little harbour, just back of
      the row of gaily painted boats—which creaked and bumped together as the slight wash from the
      beat of the birds' black paddles took them.</p>
<p>A good many of us, I suppose, as we get on in life, have a face our friends do not know,
      though our looking-glasses do, when doors are shut and the room is empty. That is the face of
      our naked self, and therefore it is somewhat indecent for any but ourselves to behold it.
      Leversedge believed himself to be alone, he had let
      <pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7033-047"/> slip appearances, and I beheld the face of his naked self.
      It was very interesting; but, as things naked often will, it gave me a shock.</p>
<p>Not that there was anything evil in it. It held no revelation of cleverly veiled iniquities,
      no trace either of fox or satyr. The man's self bare was, like the man's self clothed,
      cleanly, sober, and—on its own lines—not undignified. If sin was about, one judged him more
      likely to be sinned against than sinning; which, so the authorities assure us, “is far
      better.” But, in his case, even the farthest better was still but a poor best. For Leversedge
      looked hunted, looked tormented; looked as people will look after a disaster at sea, or a
      heavy shock of earthquake; looked as those are reported to look who have seen a ghost.</p>
<p>Of course we all join in denying the existence of the supernatural and relegating it to the,
      at present somewhat over-populated, country of Exploded Ideas; or only in permitting its
      existence in the form of some derangement of nerve ganglia or of the intestines. The pill, to
      put it concisely, has superseded the prayer—to the great advantage of the vender of patent
      medicines, whose advertisement-boards have so gracefully usurped the station of the wayside
      cross in modern English landscape.</p>
<p>I mention this in self-defence. For Leversedge
      <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7033-048"/> certainly did look as though, in pre-scientific phrase, he
      had seen a ghost; and no one knows better than I do, I need hardly say, that ghosts, like
      miracles, “do not happen.” Therefore Leversedge's body must clearly have been playing some
      fool's trick on Leversedge's brain; and Leversedge, in being taken in and so harassed by such
      trickery was clearly guilty of a grave scientific misdemeanour. Demonstrably it was my place
      to be angry with him, to convince him of foolishness. But I did none of these things. I own to
      it with contrition, I was horribly sorry for him—that was all. And only the more sorry, when,
      suddenly awakening to the fact of my presence, he gripped himself, left off contemplating the
      swans, accosted me with as much nonchalance as he could muster (not being a very accomplished
      actor); while an almost defiant inquiry as to how much of the face of his naked self I had
      beheld haunted his eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon, Hammond; I didn't see you,” he said. “We've been having a very jolly
      time out on the water. It really is a glorious afternoon. But the sunshine's rather dazzling.
      It strikes right up in your face off the surface of the lake in a blinding sort of way. Well,
      what have you been doing? Been amusing yourself over there?”</p>
<p>“With the wisest moderation,” I replied. “My joys during the last two days have had nothing
      bacchanalian about them. I have lost a little
      <pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7033-049"/> money, I have gained a little experience, since we parted.
      And so have you, I fancy, my dear fellow.”</p>
<p>“Why? I've lost no money,” Leversedge said rather quickly.</p>
<p>“No, but you have lost flesh, which always implies a deepening of experience.”</p>
<p>Leversedge seemed startled. Then, after a moment's pause, he exclaimed inconsequently—</p>
<p>“Why, you don't mean to say it shows as much as that!”</p>
<p>“I only mean to say that you are looking a good deal out of sorts.”</p>
<p>“You see too much, Hammond.” He spoke shortly, but recovered himself almost at once. “I'm
      hardly the person to accuse others of seeing too much, though.”</p>
<p>“So I feared,” I said.</p>
<p>“I have had a hell of a time with—with that blasted dog”—Leversedge flung away from me
      savagely. “Oh, it's humiliating!” he cried. “I tell you I'm ashamed, downright ashamed of
      myself. I can't hold my tongue—I want to talk about it. I want to tell somebody. I am as full
      of my own symptoms and sensations as some hysterical girl. I can't keep them to myself. Oh!
      it's humiliating; I tell you it's degrading to one's manhood.”</p>
<p>He turned and stood quietly by me again, and again I beheld the face of his naked self.</p>
<p>“I don't know what to do for the best,” he said.
      <pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7033-050"/> “I want advice—advice; I, who have never asked advice of any
      living soul, but just shoved along by myself and kept my own counsel, ever since—when I was a
      little chap of eleven, after my mother died—my father chucked me into the rough and tumble of
      Harrow to sink or swim as I could. And I have swum after a fashion—that's just why it's so
      rough on one. If you're going to smash up, upon my word I believe it's best to do it early,
      before you have grown to believe in yourself. You haven't so far to fall, so it hurts less.
      But I beg your pardon, Hammond,” he added civilly, changing his tone. “I have no earthly claim
      on your patience and kindness, and I must be boring you frightfully.”</p>
<p>“Boring me?” I cried. “Ye gods! is one bored watching in the operating theatre? Is one bored
      when seeing a man hanged?”</p>
<p>Leversedge smiled grimly. Perhaps my words evoked some recollection.</p>
<p>“No,” he replied. “There are nicer occupations; but I grant you you are not much bored, as a
      rule, when a man's being hung.”</p>
<p>We moved away and sat down on the top of the wall together, and I confessed
      Leversedge—smoking all the while, which I fear was far from the orthodox attitude of a
      confessor. But it was agitating work, and I needed support of some kind.</p>
<p>“You see, the thing's growing worse,” he said,—
      <pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7033-051"/> “not merely more frequent in coming, but different; it is
      developing—that's what knocks me about so. It doesn't stop where it did. The brute is
      materialising itself—that's the word, isn't it?—more and more.”—He drew his heels up on to the
      coping, and bowed himself together, clasping his bands round his knees.—“When I was sitting
      with the Perrys the other evening, it curled itself up on my lap. And I could not play the
      fool before them, you know, by blaspheming at it and making a scene. I had to sit still.”—He
      leant forward, resting his chin upon his knees, and spoke very steadily.—“And I tell you I
      felt all the shape of it—its shoulder, the crinkled turn of its ribs—it must be horribly
      thin—and its left fore and hind leg pressing down on me as it lay on them, as plain as I feel
      my fingers holding each other just now. It was all cold and damp, and—and it smelt, Hammond,
      and that was unspeakably filthy. You know how a mangy cur can smell.”</p>
<p>“This is bad,” I said.</p>
<p>Leversedge raised his head slowly and looked at me.</p>
<p>“I believe you. It is bad—just as bad as bad can be.” He rested his chin on his knees
      again.—“And the beast has taken a fancy to my bedroom, unfortunately. Last night, as soon as I
      put the candles out, I saw the eyes down by the side of the bed and they made a rush. I heaved
      <pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7033-052"/> a book at them which I had been reading. It was
       <title>Vanity Fair</title>. I'm awfully fond of <title>Vanity Fair</title>. Poor little
      Becky, I always want to give her her five thousand a year to ‘be good on.’ Oh dear me!—Well,
      they wriggled down again; the beast was knocked backwards on to the floor, you understand. But
      in a minute it made another rush, and came up across the counterpane, and settled itself
      against the pillow, those eyes staring bang into mine.”</p>
<p>Leversedge put his feet to the ground and, turning away, leaned his elbows on the low wall.
      His hat was off, and he held his head back. I saw, against the wide heavenly blue expanse of
      the lake, his face in profile, his pointed beard, and the rather long line of his bare
      throat—in which the apple moved sharply as he swallowed once or twice. He was fine-looking,
      but too colourless and worn for health—the Elizabethan adventurer still, but the adventurer
      who has touched the limit of success, who is beginning to make acquaintance with the side of
      adventure which deals in sickness, in prison, in the failure of hope, in foreknowledge of
      death.</p>
<p>“I swore at it, but it did not move. I could not bring myself to touch it, so we stayed like
      that some time.”—He paused and swallowed again.—“At last I turned over on the other side, and
      it came and scratched at my back, between the
      <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7033-053"/> shoulders, as if it was digging out a rabbit. And then—why,
      then I began to pray, Hammond. If there's a devil, there must be a God somewhere too, I
      suppose, if it's only to balance things; and I thought perhaps He might happen to hear. It did
      leave off scratching, but it turned round and round, and snuggled into the small of my back
      and lay there against me like a lump of ice. It chilled me clean through. I couldn't stand it,
      so I lighted the candles again, and walked up and down till that blessed sun arose and it was
      day.”</p>
<p>For a minute or two I smoked in silence, and Leversedge stared across the lake. The grisly
      night of which he told me and this radiant evening were in curious contrast. At last he
      said—“Hammond, what on earth am I to do?”</p>
<p>“About about?” I asked, for I knew he had not finished his confession yet.</p>
<p>“About my engagement—about Charlotte Perry,” he answered rather hoarsely.</p>
<p>“Ah! That comes into it.”</p>
<p>He looked up at me.—“Of course that comes into it. Why, that's the heart of it. Do you
      suppose I should care a twopenny-damn about it but for that?”</p>
<p>“I am afraid I should care a very immense amount, my dear fellow,” I said, “quite entirely
      apart from that.”</p>
<p>Leversedge straightened himself up.</p>
<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7033-054"/>
<p>“No, you wouldn't, though, not if you were in my place. You see, this engagement of mine is
      an old story. It's worked right into the very stuff of my life. And,it may sound queer,”—he
      smiled rather sadly,-“but perhaps you are never really more dependent upon a woman than when
      you are a few thousand miles away from her. You see, when you are knocking about in countries
      where there is not much public opinion to reckon with you are liable to be tempted to live a
      bit loosely; and then her face comes before you at all sorts of odd times, and her letters
      come. And you spend hours planning what you and she will do together when the parting is over
      and you get back. The thought of her is the sweetness of your life, and the salt of it
      too—it's what makes the work worth while. You see other women, nice women some of them,—dear
      women, for a lot of women are nice and dear,—and they're good to you sometimes; but they
      aren't in it, they don't count one bit. You want her, just her and no one else; and you're
      ambitious for her, you slave and pile up money for her, you want to give her just all there is
      to have. And—and, in fact,” Leversedge said, looking full at me, “I love her, Hammond. I love
      her. I suppose I'm a selfish coward, but it's worse than death—oh! my God, it's unutterable
      misery to think of giving her up.”</p>
<p>His voice had grown thick. He did not wait for my answer, but walked away beside the breakwater
      <pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7033-055"/> water—his figure long and white under the <corr>cool</corr>
      green shade of the plane trees.</p>
<p>I like lovers. Their antics rarely irritate me. Even at their worst they are idiots to whom
      I offer myself quite willingly as an asylum, and invite, with open arms, to drivel on my
      breast; while, at their best, they ravish my soul with satisfaction. In spirit I build temples
      to them, and worship prostrate, my frivolous head in the dust. I had erected a quite imposing
      temple to Leversedge by the time he returned; for it appeared to me that, in him, Providence
      granted me acquaintance with a lover of a rather heroic type. If the Beloved was as fine as
      the Lover, I had hope. In that case I snapped my fingers at the diabolic dog. For if Charlotte
      Perry was what her lover imagined her, if she was worthy of his love, I did not fear but that
      she could stay the plague under which he suffered. But was she worthy? Was it probable the
      paternal rat and maternal clock-moon could between them produce offspring of an heroic stamp?
      To believe they could was, I own, a tax on my faith. But, as in law the accused is held
      innocent till proved guilty, so I would assume Miss Perry to be a heroine till she was clearly
      proved to be otherwise, and therefore I said to Leversedge—</p>
<p>“Has it occurred to you, my good friend, that you are treating this matter rather
      high-handedly, and that the young lady in question might be anything
      <pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7033-056"/> thing but grateful to you for—as you put it—giving her
      up?”</p>
<p>“I only want to spare her.”</p>
<p>“Quite so. But as we may, I suppose, take for granted a degree of affection on her side, it
      remains an open question whether you will spare her by retiring from the situation.”</p>
<p>“Ah! if I thought she cared like that,” Leversedge said softly.</p>
<p>“Of course,” I cried, “she cares like that.”</p>
<p>Nothing is sweeter than assurance on the part of others, when one's own confidence grows
      somewhat weak. Leversedge threw back his bead and smiled. Without doubt he was very much in
      love.</p>
<p>“And yet, I don't know,” he said after a moment. “For the more she cares the more likely I
      should be to bring my curse on her. It is too hideous to contemplate. Think, Hammond, if
      later, if afterwards, as the reward of her faithfulness, as the payment of her great goodness
      in giving herself to me—she—she came to see and feel that loathsome beast herself?”</p>
<p>But here cries from the direction of the hotel broke in upon the solemnity of our interview,
      and Mr. Perry bore down upon us at a double.</p>
<p>“Make a clean breast of it,” I said hurriedly. “Trust her—tell her. That is my advice, since
      you have done me the kindness to ask it. Tell her everything. Let her decide.”</p>
