<head>CHAPTER I</head>
<p>The Rome Express, the <hi>direttissimo</hi>, or most direct, was approaching Paris one
     morning in March, when it became known to the occupants of the sleeping-car that there was
     something amiss, very much amiss, in the car.</p>
<p>The train was travelling the last stage, between Laroche and Paris, a run of a hundred miles
     without a stop. It had halted at Laroche for early breakfast, and many, if not all the
     passengers, had turned out. Of those in the sleeping-car, seven in number, six had been seen in
     the restaurant, or about the platform; the seventh, a lady, had not stirred. All had reëntered
     their berths to sleep or doze when the train went on, but several were on the move as it neared
     Paris, taking their turn at the lavatory, calling for water, towels, making the usual stir of
     preparation as the end of a journey was at hand.</p>
<p>There were many calls for the porter, yet no porter appeared. At last the attendant was
     found—lazy villain!--asleep, snoring loudly, stertorously, in his little bunk at the end of the
     car. He was roused with difficulty, and set about his work in a dull, unwilling, lethargic way,
     which promised badly for his tips from those he was supposed to serve.</p>
<p>By degrees all the passengers got dressed, all but two,—the lady in 9 and 10, who had made no
     sign as yet; and the man who occupied alone a double berth next her, numbered 7 and 8.</p>
<p>As it was the porter's duty to call every one, and as he was anxious, like the rest of his
     class, to get rid of his travellers as soon as possible after arrival, he rapped at each of the
     two closed doors behind which people presumably still slept.</p>
<p>The lady cried "All right," but there was no answer from No. 7 and 8.</p>
<p>Again and again the porter knocked and called loudly. Still meeting with no response, he
     opened the door of the compartment and went in.</p>
<p>It was now broad daylight. No blind was down; indeed, the one narrow window was open, wide;
     and the whole of the interior of the compartment was plainly visible, all and everything in
     it.</p>
<p>The occupant lay on his bed motionless. Sound asleep? No, not merely asleep—the twisted
     unnatural lie of the limbs, the contorted legs, the one arm drooping listlessly but stiffly
     over the side of the berth, told of a deeper, more eternal sleep.</p>
<p>The man was dead. Dead—and not from natural causes.</p>
<p>One glance at the blood-stained bedclothes, one look at the gaping wound in the breast, at
     the battered, mangled face, told the terrible story.</p>
<p>It was murder! murder most foul! The victim had been stabbed to the heart.</p>
<p>With a wild, affrighted, cry the porter rushed out of the compartment, and to the eager
     questioning of all who crowded round him, he could only mutter in confused and trembling
     accents:</p>
<p>"There! there! in there!"</p>
<p>Thus the fact of the murder became known to every one by personal inspection, for every one
     (even the lady had appeared for just a moment) had looked in where the body lay. The
     compartment was filled for some ten minutes or more by an excited, gesticulating, polyglot mob
     of half a dozen, all talking at once in French, English, and Italian.</p>
<p>The first attempt to restore order was made by a tall man, middle-aged, but erect in his
     bearing, with bright eyes and alert manner, who took the porter aside, and said sharply in good
     French, but with a strong English accent:</p>
<p>"Here! it's your business to do something. No one has any right to be in that compartment
     now. There may be reasons—traces—things to remove; never mind what. But get them all out. Be
     sharp about it; and lock the door. Remember you will be held responsible to justice."</p>
<p>The porter shuddered, so did many of the passengers who had overheard the Englishman's last
     words.</p>
<p>Justice! It is not to be trifled with anywhere, least of all in France, where the
     uncomfortable superstition prevails that every one who can be reasonably suspected of a crime
     is held to be guilty of that crime until his innocence is clearly proved.</p>
<p>All those six passengers and the porter were now brought within the category of the accused.
     They were all open to suspicion; they, and they alone, for the murdered man had been seen alive
     at Laroche, and the fell deed must have been done since then, while the train was in transit,
     that is to say, going at express speed, when no one could leave it except at peril of his
     life.</p>
<p>"Deuced awkward for us!" said the tall English general, Sir Charles Collingham by name, to
     his brother the parson, when he had reëntered their compartment and shut the door.</p>
<p>"I can't see it. In what way?" asked the Reverend Silas Collingham, a typical English cleric,
     with a rubicund face and square-cut white whiskers, dressed in a suit of black serge, and
     wearing the professional white tie.</p>
<p>"Why, we shall be detained, of course; arrested, probably—certainly detained. Examined,
     cross-examined, bully-ragged—I know something of the French police and their ways."</p>
<p>"If they stop us, I shall write to the <hi>Times</hi>" cried his brother, by profession a man
     of peace, but with a choleric eye that told of an angry temperament.</p>
<p>"By all means, my dear Silas, when you get the chance. That won't be just yet, for I tell you
     we're in a tight place, and may expect a good deal of worry." With that he took out his
     cigarette-case, and his match-box, lighted his cigarette, and calmly watched the smoke rising
     with all the coolness of an old campaigner accustomed to encounter and face the ups and downs
     of life. "I only hope to goodness they'll run straight on to Paris," he added in a fervent
     tone, not unmixed with apprehension. "No! By jingo, we're slackening speed—."</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't we? It's right the conductor, or chief of the train, or whatever you call him,
     should know what has happened."</p>
<p>"Why, man, can't you see? While the train is travelling express, every one must stay on board
     it; if it slows, it is possible to leave it."</p>
<p>"Who would want to leave it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," said the General, rather testily. "Any way, the thing's done now."</p>
<p>The train had pulled up in obedience to the signal of alarm given by some one in the
     sleeping-car, but by whom it was impossible to say. Not by the porter, for he seemed greatly
     surprised as the conductor came up to him.</p>
<p>"How did you know?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Know! Know what? You stopped me."</p>
<p>"I didn't."</p>
<p>"Who rang the bell, then?"</p>
<p>"I did not. But I'm glad you've come. There has been a crime—murder."</p>
<p>"Good Heavens!" cried the conductor, jumping up on to the car, and entering into the
     situation at once. His business was only to verify the fact, and take all necessary
     precautions. He was a burly, brusque, peremptory person, the despotic, self-important French
     official, who knew what to do—as he thought—and did it without hesitation or apology.</p>
<p>"No one must leave the car," he said in a tone not to be misunderstood. "Neither now, nor on
     arrival at the station."</p>
<p>There was a shout of protest and dismay, which he quickly cut short.</p>
<p>"You will have to arrange it with the authorities in Paris; they can alone decide. My duty is
     plain: to detain you, place you under surveillance till then. Afterwards, we will see. Enough,
     gentlemen and madame"—</p>
<p>He bowed with the instinctive gallantry of his nation to the female figure which now appeared
     at the door of her compartment. She stood for a moment listening, seemingly greatly agitated,
     and then, without a word, disappeared, retreating hastily into her own private room, where she
     shut herself in.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, at a signal from the conductor, the train resumed its journey. The
     distance remaining to be traversed was short; half an hour more, and the Lyons station, at
     Paris, was reached, where the bulk of the passengers—all, indeed, but the occupants of the
     sleeper—descended and passed through the barriers. The latter were again desired to keep their
     places, while a posse of officials came and mounted guard. Presently they were told to leave
     the car one by one, but to take nothing with them. All their hand-bags, rugs, and belongings
     were to remain in the berths, just as they lay. One by one they were marched under escort to a
     large and bare waiting-room, which had, no doubt, been prepared for their reception.</p>
<p>Here they took their seats on chairs placed at wide intervals apart, and were peremptorily
     forbidden to hold any communication with each other, by word or gesture. This order was
     enforced by a fierce-looking guard in blue and red uniform, who stood facing them with his arms
     folded, gnawing his moustache and frowning severely.</p>
<p>Last of all, the porter was brought in and treated like the passengers, but more distinctly
     as a prisoner. He had a guard all to himself; and it seemed as though he was the object of
     peculiar suspicion. It had no great effect upon him, for, while the rest of the party were very
     plainly sad, and a prey to lively apprehension, the porter sat dull and unmoved, with the
     stolid, sluggish, unconcerned aspect of a man just roused from sound sleep and relapsing into
     slumber, who takes little notice of what is passing around.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the sleeping-car, with its contents, especially the corpse of the victim, was
     shunted into a siding, and sentries were placed on it at both ends. Seals had been affixed upon
     the entrance doors, so that the interior might be kept inviolate until it could be visited and
     examined by the Chef de la Surêté, or Chief of the Detective Service. Every one and everything
     awaited the arrival of this all-important functionary.</p>
