<head>CHAPTER SEVEN</head>
<head>A PROBLEM</head>
<p>When Mr. Chirgwin caught sight of Joan his astonishment knew no bounds, and his first
      thought was that something must certainly be amiss. He stood in the roadway, a picture of
      surprise, and, for a moment, forgot both his sheep and lambs.</p>
<p>"My stars, Joan! Be it you really? Whatever do 'e make at Drift, 'pon such a day as this? No
      evil news, I hope?"</p>
<p>"Uncle," she answered, "go slow a bit an' listen to what I've got to say. You be a kind,
      good sawl as judges nobody, ban't you? And you love me 'cause your sister was my mother?"</p>
<p>"Surely, surely, Joan; an' I love you for yourself tu—nobody better in this world."</p>
<p>"You wouldn' go for to send me to hell-fire, would 'e?"</p>
<p>"God forbid, lass! Why, whatever be talkin' 'bout?"</p>
<p>"Uncle Thomas, faither's not my faither no more now. He've turned me out his house an'
      denied me. I ban't no darter of his henceforrard; an' he'm no faither o' mine. He don't mean
      never to look 'pon my faace agin, nor me 'pon his. The cottage edn' no home for me no
      more."</p>
<p>"Joan, gal alive! what talk be this?"</p>
<p>"'Tis gospel. I'm a damned wummon, 'cordin' to my faither as was."</p>
<p>"God A'mighty! You—paart a Chirgwin—as comed, o' wan side, from her as loved the Lard so
      dear, an', 'pon t'other, from him as feared un so much. Never, Joan!"</p>
<p>"Uncle Thomas, I be in the fam'ly way; an' faither's damned me, an' likewise the man as
      loves me, an' the cheel I be gwaine to bring in the world. I've comed to hear you speak. Will
      you say the same? If you will, I'll pack off this instant moment."</p>
<p>The old man stood perfectly still and his jaw went down while he breathed heavily; a world
      of amazement and piteous sorrow sat upon his face; his voice shook and whistled in the sound
      as he answered.</p>
<p>"Joan! My poor Joan! My awn gal, this be black news—black news. Thank God she'm not here to
      knaw—your mother."</p>
<p>"I've done no wrong, uncle; I ban't 'shamed of it. He'm a true, good man, and he'm comin' to
      marry me quick."</p>
<p>"Joe Noy?"</p>
<p>"No, no, not him. I thot I loved en well till Mister Jan comed, an' opened my blind eyes,
      an' shawed me what love was. Mister Jan's a gen'leman—a furriner. He caan't live wi'out me no
      more; he's said as he caan't. An' I'm droopin' an' longin' for the sight o' en. An' I caan't
      bide in the streets, so I axes you to keep me till Mister Jan do come to fetch me. I find
      words hard to use to 'splain things, but his God's differ'nt to what the Luke Gosp'lers' is,
      an' I lay 'tis differ'nt to yourn. But his God's mine anyways, an' I'm not afeared o' what I
      done, nor 'shamed to look folks in the faace. That's how 'tis, Uncle Thomas. 'Tis Nature, you
      mind, an' I be Nature's cheel no—wi' no faither nor mother but her."</p>
<p>The old man was snuffling, and a tear or two rolled down his red face, gathered the damp
      already there and fell. He groaned to himself, then brought forth a big, red
      pocket-handkerchief, and wept outright, while Joan stood silently regarding him.</p>
<p>"I'd rather a met death than this; I'd rather a knawn you was coffined."</p>
<p>"Oh, if I could awnly 'splain!" she cried, frantically; "if I awnly could find his words
      'pon my tongue, but I caan't. They be hid down deep in me, an' by them I lives from day to
      day; but how can I make others see same as I see? I awnly brings sorrer 'pon sorrer now.
      Theer's nothin' left but him. If you could a heard Mister Jan! You would understand, wi' your
      warm heart, but I caan't make 'e; I've no terrible, braave, butivul words. I'll gaw my ways
      then. If any sawl had tawld me as I'd ever bring tears down your faace I'd never b'lieved
      'em—never; but so I have, an' that's bitterness to me."</p>
<p>He took her by the hand and pressed it, then put his arm round her and kissed her. His white
      bristles hurt, but Joan rejoiced exceedingly, and now it was her turn to shed tears.</p>
<p>"He'll come back—he'm a true man," she sobbed; "theer ban't the likes o' Mister Jan in
      Carnwall, an'—an' if you knawed en, you'd say no less. You'm the fust as have got to my heart
      since he went; an' he'd bless 'e if he knawed."</p>
<p>"Come along with me, Joan," answered Uncle Chirgwin, straightening himself and applying his
      big handkerchief to her face. "God send the man'll be 'longside 'e right soon, as you sez.
      Till he do come, you shaan't leave me no more. Drift's home for you while you'm pleased to
      bide theer. An' I'll see your faither presently, though I wish 'twas any other man."</p>
<p>"I knawed you was all us the same; I knawed you'd take me in. An' Mister Jan shall knaw. An'
      he'll love you for't when he do." </p>
<p>"Come an' see me put the ewes an' lambs in the croft; then us'll gaw to dinner, an' I'll
      hear you tell me all 'bout en."</p>
<p>He tried hard to put a hopeful face upon the position and, himself as simple as a child,
      presently found Joan's story not hopeless at all. He seemed indeed to catch some of her spirit
      as she proceeded and painted the manifold glories of "Mister Jan" in the best language at her
      command. To love Nature was no sin; Mr. Chirgwin himself did so; and as for the money, instead
      of reading the truth of it, he told himself very wisely that the giver of a sum so tremendous
      must at least be in earnest. The amount astounded him. Fired by Joan's words, for as he played
      the ready listener her eloquence increased, he fell to thinking as she thought, and even
      speaking hopefully. The old farmer's reflections merely echoed his own simple trust in men and
      had best not been uttered, for they raised Joan's spirits to a futile height. But he caught
      the contagion from her and spoke with sanguine words of the future, and even prayed Joan that,
      if wealth and a noble position awaited her, she would endeavor to brighten the lives of the
      poor as became a good Cornish woman. This she solemnly promised, and they built castles in the
      air: two children together. His sheep driven to their new pasture, Uncle Chirgwin led the way
      home and listened as he walked to Joan's story. She quite convinced him before he reached his
      kitchen door—partly because he was very well content to be convinced, partly because he could
      honestly imagine no man base enough to betray this particular blue-eyed child.</p>
<p>Mr. Chirgwin's extremely unworldly review of the position was balm to Joan. Her heart grew
      warm again, and the old man's philosophy brightened her face, as the sun, now making a great
      clearness after rain, brightened the face of the land. But the recollection of Mary Chirgwin
      sobered her uncle not a little. How she would take this tremendous intelligence he failed to
      guess remotely. Opportunity to impart it occurred sooner than he expected, for Joan's box had
      just arrived. During dinner the old man explained that his niece was to be a visitor at Drift
      for a term of uncertain duration; and after the meal, when Joan disappeared to unpack her box
      and make tidy a little apple-room, which was now empty and at her service, Uncle Chirgwin had
      speech with Mary. He braced himself to the trying task, waited until the kitchen was empty of
      those among his servants who ate at his table, and then replied to the question which his
      niece promptly put.</p>
<p>"What do this mean, Uncle Thomas? What's come o' Joan that she do drop in 'pon us like this
      here wi' never a word to say she was comin'?"</p>
<p>"Polly," he answered, "your cousin Joan have seen sore trouble, in a manner o' speakin', an'
      you'd best to knaw fust as last. Us must be large-minded 'bout a thing like this She'm tokened
      to a gen'leman from Lunnon."</p>
<p>"What! An' him—Joe Noy?"</p>
<p>"To be plain wi' you, Polly, she've thrawed en over. Listen 'fore you speaks. 'Twas a match
      o' Michael Tregenza's makin', I reckon, an', so like's not, Joe weern't any more heart-struck
      than Joan. I finds it hard to feel as I ought to Gray Michael, more shame to me. But Joan's
      failed in love wi' a gen'leman, an' he with her, an' he'm comin' any mornin' to fetch
      'er—an'—an'—you must be tawld—'tis time as he did come. An' he've sent Joan a thousand pound
      o' paper money to shaw as 'e means the right thing."</p>
<p>But the woman's mind had not followed these last facts. Her face was white to the lips; her
      hands were shaking. She put her head down upon them as she sat by the fire, and a groan which
      no power could strangle broke from her deep bosom. She spoke, and regretted her words a moment
      later. "Oh, my God! an' he brawk off wi' me for the likes o' she!"</p>
<p>"Theer, theer, lass Mary, doan't 'e, doan't 'e. You've hid your tears that cunnin', but my
      old eyes has seen the marks this many day an' sorrered for 'e. 'Tis a hard matter viewed from
      the point what you looks 'pon it; but I knaws you, my awn good gal; I knaws your Saviour's
      done a 'mazin' deal to hold you up. An' 'twont be for long, 'cause the man'll come for her
      mighty soon seemin'ly. Can 'e faace it, the Lard helpin'? Poor Joan's bin kicked out the house
      by her faither. I do <hi>not</hi> like en—never did. What do 'e say? She doan't count it no
      sin, mind you, an' doan't look for no reprovin', 'cause the gen'leman have taught her terrible
      coorious ideas; but 'tis just this: we'm all sinners, eh, Polly? An' us caan't say 'sactly
      what size a sin do look to God A'mighty's eye. An' us have got the Lard's way o' handlin' sich
      like troubles writ out clear—eh? Eh, Polly? He dedn' preach no sermon at the time
      neither."</p>
<p>The old man prattled on, setting out the position in the most favorable light to Joan that
      seemed possible to him. But his listener was one no longer. She had forgotten her cousin and
      the present circumstances, for her thoughts were with a sailor at sea. One tremendous moment
      of savage joy gripped her heart, but the primitive passion perished in its birth-pang and left
      her cold and faint and ashamed. She wondered from what unknown, unsecured corner of her soul
      the vile thing came. It died on the instant, but the corpse fouled her thoughts and tainted
      them and made her feel faint again. The irony of chance burst like a storm on the woman, and
      mazes of tangled thoughts made her brain whirl in a chaos of bewilderment. She sat motionless,
      her face dark, and much mystery in her wonderful eyes, while Mr. Chirgwin, with shaking head
      and scriptural quotation and tears, babbled on, pleading for Joan with all his strength. Mary
      heard little of what he said. She was occupied with facts and asking herself her duty. From
      the storm in her mind arose a clear question at last, and she could not answer it. The point
      had appeared unimportant to anybody but Mary Chirgwin, but no question of conduct ever looked
      trivial to her. At least the doubt was definite and afforded mental occupation. She wondered
      now whether it was well or possible that she and Joan could live together under the same roof.
      Why such a problem had arisen she knew not; but it stood in the path, a fact to be dealt with.
      Her heart told her that Joan and her uncle alike erred in the supposition that the girl's
      seducer would ever return. She read the great gift of money as Thomasin had read it—rightly;
      and the thought of living with Joan was at first horrible to her.</p>
<p>Mr. Chirgwin talked and Mary reflected. Then she rose to leave the room.</p>
<p>"'Tis tu gert a thing for me to say—no wummon was ever plaaced like what I be now. I do mean
      to see passon at Sancreed, uncle. He'll knaw what's right for me. If he bids me stay, I'll
      stay. 'Tis the thot o' Joe Noy maddens me. My head'll burst if I think any more. I'll go to
      passon."</p>
<p>"Whether you'll stay, Polly! Why shouldn't 'e stay? Surely it do—"</p>
<p>"Doan't 'e talk no more 'tall, uncle. You caan't knaw what this is to me, you doan't
      understan' a wummon faaced wi' a coil like this here. Joe—Joe as loved 'er, I s'pose,
      differ'nt to what 'e did me. An' she, when his back weer turned—an'—an'—me—God help me!—as
      never could do less than love en through all!"</p>
<p>She was gone before he had time to answer, but he realized her mighty agony of mind and
      stood dumb and frightened before it. Then a thought came concerning Joan and he felt that, at
      all costs, he must speak to Mary again before she went out. Mr. Chirgwin waited quietly at the
      stair-foot until she came down. The turmoil was in her eyes still, but she spoke calmly and
      listened to him when he replied.</p>
<p>"Doan't 'e say nuthin' to Joan, Uncle Thomas. I be gwaine to larn my duty, as is hidden from
      me. An' my duty I will do."</p>
<p>"An' so you alias have, Polly, since you was a grawed gal; an' God knaws it. But—do'e think
      as you could—in a manner o' speakin'—hide names from passon? Ban't no call to tell what's
      fallen out to other folks. Joan—eh, Polly? Might 'e speak in a parable like—same as
      Scripture—wi'out namin' no names. For Joan's sake, Mary—eh?"</p>
<p>She was silent a full minute, then answered slowly.</p>
<p>"I see what you mean, uncle. I hadn' thot o' she just then. Iss fay, you'm right theer.
      Ban't no work o' mine to tell 'bout her."</p>
<p>She hesitated, and the old man spoke again.</p>
<p>"I s'pose that a bit o' prayer wouldn' shaw light on it—eh, Polly? Wi'out gwaine to
      Sancreed. The Lard knaws your fix better'n what any words 'ud put it clear to passon. An'
      theer's yourself tu. 'Pears to me, axin' your pardon, for you'm clever'n what I am, that
      'tedn' a tale what you can put out 'fore any other body 'sactly—even a holy man like him."</p>
<p>She saw at once that it was not. Her custom had been to get the kind-hearted old clergyman
      of her parish church to soothe the doubts and perplexities which not seldom rose within her
      strenuous mind. And before this great, crushing problem, with the pretext of the one
      difficulty which had tumbled uppermost from the chaos and so been grasped as a reality, she
      had naturally turned to her guide and friend. But, as her uncle spoke, she saw that in truth
      this matter could not be laid naked before any man. Another's hidden life was involved;
      another's secret must come out if all was told, and Mary's sense of justice warned her that
      this could not be. She had taken her own mighty grief to the little parsonage at Sancreed, and
      a kindly counselor, who knew sorrow at first hand, helped her upon the road that henceforth
      looked so lonely and so long; but this present trial, though it tore the old wounds open, must
      be borne alone. She saw as much, and turned and went upstairs again to her chamber.</p>
<p>"Think of her kindly," said Uncle Chirgwin as Mary left him without more words. "She'm so
      young an' ignorant o' the gert world, Polly. An' if the worst falls, which God forbid, 'tis
      her as'll suffer most, not we."</p>
<p>"Us have all got to suffer an' suffer this side our graaves," she said, mounting
      wearily.</p>
<p>"So young an' purty as she be—the moral o' her mother. I doan't knaw—'tis sich a wonnerful
      world—but them blue eyes—them round blue eyes couldn't do a thing as was wrong afore God as
      wan might fancy," he said aloud, not knowing she was out of earshot. Then he heaved a sigh,
      returned to the kitchen, and presently departed to the fields.</p>
