<head>CHAPTER TWELVE</head>
<head>FROM JOE</head>
<p>Since her visit to the church at Newlyn, Joan had been in no place of worship save the
      chapel of the Luke Gospelers. What might be the nature of the service before her she did not
      know, nor did she care. But the girl kept her promise and drove in the market-cart to Sancreed
      with her uncle and cousin when Sunday came. The little church lay bowered in its grove of
      sycamores, and, around it, a golden-green concourse of quivering shadows cooled those who had
      walked or driven from Drift—an outlying portion of the parish—approached through lanes
      innocent of all shade. Mr. Chirgwin put up the horse and presently joined his nieces in
      church. Then Joan saw him under interesting and novel conditions. He wore glasses with gold
      rims; he covered his bald head with a little velvet cap; at the appointed time he took a
      wooden plate and carried it round for money. Mary found the old man's places for him and sang
      in a way that fairly astounded Joan. The enormous satisfaction brought to herself by these
      vocal efforts was apparent. Her soul appeared mightily lifted up. She amused chance visitors
      to the church, but the regular congregation liked to hear Mary; and Joan, seeing the comfort
      her cousin sucked from singing, wished she had heart to join. That, however, she wholly
      lacked. Moreover, the words were strange to her.</p>
<p>The quiet service, brightened by music, dragged its slow length murmuringly along. The
      sermon, delivered by a visitor, was not of a sort to hold Joan, and, indeed, could hardly be
      expected to attract many in such a congregation. The preacher had lately been reading old
      Cornish history, and, overcome by the startling fact that the far west of England—Cornwall and
      Devon—were Christian long before Augustine saw Kent, dwelt upon the matter after a very
      instructive fashion in ears unlikely to benefit from such knowledge. That the Cornu-British
      bishops preached Christ while yet Sussex, Wessex, Hampshire, Berks and other districts
      worshiped Woden, Freya, the Queen of Heaven, the Thunder God, and other deities whose altars
      were set up after the Conquest, did not interest Joan for one or Mr. Chirgwin for another. But
      the girl woke up at the mention of Irish and Welsh and Breton saints. Pleasant to hear was the
      utterance of names which she had loved once but of late almost forgotten. They came back now,
      and, the service having turned her heart to softness, she welcomed them gladly as friends
      returned from afar. For the rest, the Litany it was which roused Joan to deepest interest and
      opened her mind to new impressions. Here was a prayer, gigantic in length, universal,
      all-embracing, catholic beyond the compass of anything her thoughts had heretofore conceived.
      From the Queen upon her throne to Joan herself, from the bishops, the princes and the Lords of
      the Council to Uncle Chirgwin and his fruits of the earth, that astounding petition ranged
      with equal vigor and earnestness. Nothing was too high, nothing was too low for it; all the
      world was named, and the people cried for a hearing or for mercy between each supplication and
      each prayer. The overwhelming majesty of such praying impressed Joan much; as, indeed, it
      impresses all who come adult thereto and do not associate it with their childhood, with weary
      hours dragging interminably out, with sleepy buzz of voices, with sore knees or a breaking
      back, with yearnings stifled, with devices for passing time, with the longed-for sunshine
      stealing inch by inch eastward on the church walls.</p>
<p>"A power o' larnin' in a small headpiece," commented Uncle Chirgwin as he drove home with
      the girls sitting side by side on his left. "A braave ch'ice o' words an' a easy knowledge o'
      the saints as weern't picked up in a day. Tis well to hear a furriner now an' again. They do
      widen the grasp of a man's mind, looking 'pon things from a changed point o' view. Not as us
      could be 'spected to be Latiners, yet I seem 'tis very well to listen to it as chance offers.
      'Tis something to knaw 'twas Latin, an' that did I, though I doubt some o' the good neighbors
      couldn' tell it for what 'twas, by no means."</p>
<p>Joan said little about the service, but she praised the Litany from her own peculiar
      attitude toward it.</p>
<p>"That be fine prayin'," she said, "with nobody forgot, an' all in black print so's wance
      said 'tedn' lost."</p>
<p>After dinner, when Mary had gone to see a friend and the farm people were dawdling abroad
      till evening milking-time, Joan made her uncle read the service through again. This he did
      comfortably between the whiffs of his pipe, and Joan answered the responses, cooing them in
      her sweet voice as softly as the red and blue pigeons crooned on the roof outside. Drift was
      asleep under a hot blaze of afternoon sunshine. Sometimes a child's keen voice in the road cut
      the drowsy silence and came to Joan's ears where she sat, in the best parlor with Uncle
      Thomas; sometimes slow wheels rumbled up the hill toward Buryan. Other sounds there were none.
      The old people slept within their cottages after the extra baked meats of Sunday's dinner;
      many of the young paired and walked where pathways ran over meadows and through yellowing
      wheat; while others, more gregarious and unattached, had tramped away to Penzance to join the
      parade by the sea and meet their friends from the shops.</p>
<p>Anon nailed boots stamped up the little pathway to Drift farmhouse, and Tom Tregenza
      appeared. To-day he entered fearlessly, for he came upon an errand from his father. He kissed
      Joan and shook hands with Uncle Thomas. Then he said:</p>
<p>"'Tis a letter as I've brought for Joan—a furriner."</p>
<p>The girl's heart beat hard, and the blood rushing from her cheeks left them white. But the
      letter only came from Joe Noy, and it is certain that Mr. Tregenza would have forwarded no
      other. Excitement died, and was painfully renewed, in a fresh direction, when Joan realized
      from whom the missive came and thought about its writer. He had long been a stranger to her
      mind, and now he seemed suddenly to re-enter it—like a stranger.</p>
<p>"I can stay for a bit of tea so long as I be back by chapel-time," explained Tom.</p>
<p>"An' so you shall, my son. Run 'e out o' doors an' amoose yourself where you mind to; awnly
      don't ope the lil linhay in the Brook Croft, 'cause auld bull's fastened up theer an' his
      temper's gettin' more'n more out o' hand."</p>
<p>So Tom departed, and Uncle Chirgwin read Joan's letter aloud to her. It came from Santa
      Rosalia, and contained not much news but plenty of love and some religious sentiments bred
      from the writer's foreign environment. Joe Noy would be back in England again before the end
      of the year.</p>
<p>Joan was reduced to tears by this communication. She refused to be comforted, and, indeed,
      the position was beyond Uncle Chirgwin's power to brighten. The letter had come at a bad
      moment, and that calm and repose which almost appeared to be softening Joan's sorrows now
      spread speedy wings and departed, leaving her wholly forlorn. Curtains were falling behind
      her, but curtains were also rising in front. She had looked forward vaguely, and now the
      position was suddenly defined by the arrival of Joe's letter, with all its future phases
      clear-cut, cold and terrible.</p>
<p>"My baaby's comin' just then. An' that's what'll fall 'pon his ear fust thing. Oh, if us
      could awnly tell en afore he comes so he might knaw 'tis all chaanged! 'Twould be easier for
      en, lovin' me that keen. He'd grawed to be a shadder of a man in my mind; but now I sees en
      real flaish'n blood; an' maybe—maybe he'll seek me out an' kill me for what's done."</p>
<p>"I do creem to hear 'e, gal! No, no, Joe Noy's a God fearin' sawl."</p>
<p>"If he'd forgive me fust, I'd so soon he killed me as not. Sam Martin killed Widow Garth's
      gal 'cause she were ontrue to en; an' a many said 'twas wrong to hang en to Bodmin. Death's my
      deserts, same as Ann Garth; an' she got it; an' I doan't care how soon I do. None wants me no
      more, nor what I'm breedin' neither. I'd die now, an' smilin', if 'tweern't for
      arterwards."</p>
<p>"Cuss the letter!" said Uncle Chirgwin, getting red in the face. "Cuss it, I says, for
      gwaine an' turnin' up just this day! A fortnight later you could 'a' looked on it wi' quiet
      mind an' knawed wheer to turn; to-day's it's just bin an' undone what was done. Not but what
      'tis as butivul a letter as ever comed off the sea; but if theer'd awnly been time to
      'stablish 'e 'fore it comed! Now you've turned your back 'pon the Household o' Faith just as
      arms was being stretched out that lovin'."</p>
<p>"Faith won't undo what I've done, nor yet make my wickedness fall lighter for Joe. Yes,
      'twas wicked, wicked, wicked. I knaw it now."</p>
<p>Mary and Tom came in from different directions about this time. The latter had regaled
      himself with a peep at "auld bull," heard the terrific snorting of his nostrils and observed
      how he bellowed mightily at durance on such an afternoon. Tea being finished, the boy started
      homeward with a basket of fresh eggs and butter, a pound of cream and some early apples of a
      sort used for cider, but yet equal to the making of a pie.</p>
<p>"As for the butter, 'tis Joan's churnin'," said Mary, "but you'd best not to tell your
      faither that, else, so like's not, he'll pitch it into the sea. If us could send en a pound o'
      charity, I doubt he'd be better for't."</p>
<p>"Faither's a holy man, whatever else he be," said Tom stoutly. "He doan't want for no good
      qualities like, 'cause what he doan't knaw 'bout God edn' worth knawin'."</p>
<p>Mary laughed. It was a feat she seldom performed, and the sound of her amusement lacked
      joy.</p>
<p>"Well, us won't argue 'bout en. You'm right to say that. Be the basket too heavy for
      'e?"</p>
<p>"No! not likely. Have 'e ever seed my forearm, Polly?"</p>
<p>"Never. I will another time. Best be gwaine, else you'll be late for chapel."</p>
<p>So Tom marched off, and Mary, returning to the house, heard of Joan's letter.</p>
<p>The old gusts of misery, sorrow, indignation, rose in her heart again then, but faintly,
      like the dying flutter of winds that have blown themselves out. She tried to find a way of
      bringing comfort to her cousin, but failed. Joan had retired and refused consolation.</p>
<p>The glory of splendid summer hours passed away; the long twilight sank to darkness; the opal
      lights in the west at last died under the silver of the moon. And then, like a child weary
      with crying, Joan slept, while Mary, creeping a third time to see and speak with her, departed
      silently. But she did not sleep; and her wakefulness was fortunate, for long after eleven
      o'clock came a noisy summons at the outer door. Looking from her room which faced the front of
      the house, the woman saw Tom with his full basket standing clearly defined below. The world of
      the weald and woods shimmered silvery in dew and moonlight. Infinite silence reigned. Then the
      boy's small, indignant voice broke it.</p>
<p>"You'll have to let me in, I reckon. Blamed if I doan't think you was right 'bout faither
      arter all."</p>
<p>The reason for Tom's return may be briefly told. He had taken his basket home and got it
      safely under cover to his mother. Then, after chapel, Gray Michael went into the village, and
      Thomasin had an opportunity to ask some of those questions she was burning to put.</p>
<p>"An' how be Joan?" she began.</p>
<p>"Wisht an' drawed thin 'bout the faace seemin'ly. An' Joe's letter just made her cry fit to
      bust her eyes, 'stead o' cheerin' of her like."</p>
<p>"Poor lass. I dedn' expect nothin' differ'nt. I've most a mind to go up Drift an' see
      her—for a reason I've thot upon. Did Joan say anythin' 'bout a last will an' testament to
      'e?"</p>
<p>"No, nothin' 'bout anything worth namin'. But Polly had a deal to say. Her wished her could
      send faither a pound o' charity 'stead o' butter."</p>
<p>"She dared!"</p>
<p>At that moment Mr. Tregenza returned to supper, and soon afterward his son went to bed. The
      lad had not been asleep half an hour before Gray Michael came across the basket from Drift.
      Two minutes later Tom heard the thunder of his father's voice.</p>
<p>"Tom! you come down here an' be sharp about it!"</p>
<p>The boy tumbled out of bed instantly, and went down to the kitchen in his nightshirt and
      trousers. Michael Tregenza was standing by the table. Upon it appeared the basket from Drift,
      stored with cream, butter, eggs and apples. Thomasin sat in the low chair by the fire with her
      apron over her face, and that was always a bad sign, as Tom knew.</p>
<p>"What day be this, bwoy?" began Michael.</p>
<p>"The Lard's, faither."</p>
<p>"Ay: the Lard's awn day, though you've forgot it seemin'ly."</p>
<p>"No I abbun, faither."</p>
<p>"Doan't 'e answer me 'cept I tells you to. Where did these things come from?"</p>
<p>"Drift, faither. Uncle Chirgwin bid me bring 'em with his respects."</p>
<p>"Did you tell en 'twas breakin' the commandments?"</p>
<p>"No, faither."</p>
<p>"Why didn't 'e? You knawed it yourself."</p>
<p>"Iss, faither; but uncle's a ancient man, an' I guessed he knawed so well as me, an' I
      reckoned 'twould be sauce for such as me to say anything to a auld, gray body like him."</p>
<p>"Sinners is all colors an' ages. Another time doan't you do what's wrong, whether 'tis auld
      or young as tempts 'e to't. You'm a Luke Gosp'ler, an' it edn' being a shinin' light 'tall to
      go wrong just because wan as did ought to knaw wiser an' doan't, tells 'e to. Now you can lace
      on your boots, as soon as you'm minded to, an' traapse up Drift with that theer basket an' all
      in it. 'Twon't harm godless folks to wake 'em an' faace 'em with their wrongdoing. An' I lay
      you'll remember another time."</p>
<p>Tom, knowing that words would be utterly wasted, went back to his attic, dressed, and
      started. He had the satisfaction of eating apples in the moonlight and of posing as a bitterly
      wronged boy at Drift when Mary came down, lighted a candle, and let him into the house.</p>
<p>Uncle Chirgwin also appeared, and said some hard things in a sleepy voice, while Tom drank
      cider and ate a big slice of bread and bacon.</p>
<p>"A terrible Old Testament man, your faither, sure 'nough," said Uncle Chirgwin. "Be you
      gwaine to stop the night 'long o' us or no?" </p>
<p>"Not me! I got to be in the bwoat 'fore half-past five to-morrer marnin'."</p>
<p>"This marnin' 'tis," said Mary, "or will be in a few minutes. An' you can tell your faither
      what I said 'bout charity, if you like. I sez it again, an' it won't hurt en to knaw."</p>
<p>"But it might hurt me to tell. The less said soonest mended wi' faither."</p>
<p>Tom departed, the lighter for his basket. He flung a stone at a hare, listened to the
      jarring of a night-hawk, and finally returned home about one o'clock. Both his parents were
      awaiting him, and the boy saw that his mother had been enduring some trouble on his
      behalf.</p>
<p>"Mind, my son, hencefarrard that the Sabbath is the Lard thy God's. You may have done others
      a good turn besides yourself this night."</p>
<p>"What did they say, Tom?" asked his mother.</p>
<p>"They wasn't best pleased. They said a hard sayin' I'd better not to say agin," answered the
      boy, heavy with sleep.</p>
<p>"Let it be. Us doan't want to hear it. Get you to bed. An', mind, the bwoat at the steps by
      half-past five to-morrer."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay, faither."</p>
<p>Then Tom vanished, his parents went to their rest, and the cottage on the cliff slept within
      the music of the sea, its thatch all silver-bright under a summer moon.</p>
