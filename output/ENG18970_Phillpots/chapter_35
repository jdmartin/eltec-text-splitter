<head>CHAPTER SEVEN</head>
<head>OUT OF THE DEEP</head>
<p>At the dawn of the day which followed upon the great storm, while yet the sea ran high and
      the gale died hard, many tumbling luggers, some maimed, began to dot the wind-torn waters of
      Mounts Bay. The tide was out, but within the shelter of the shore which rose between Newlyn
      and the course of the wind, the returning boats found safety at their accustomed anchorage;
      and as one by one they made the little roads, as boat after boat came ashore from the fleet,
      tears, hysteric screams and deep-voiced thanks to the Almighty arose from the crowd of men and
      women massed at the extremity of Newlyn pier beneath the lighthouse. Cheers and many a shake
      of hand greeted every party as, weary-eyed and worn, it landed and climbed the slippery steps.
      From such moments even those still in the shadow of terrible fear plucked a little courage and
      brightened hopes. Then each of the returned fishermen, with his own clinging to him, set face
      homeward—a rejoicing stream of little separate processions, every one heralding a saved life.
      There crept thus inland wives smiling through the mist of dead tears, old mothers hobbling
      beside their bearded sons, young mothers pouring blessing on proud sailor boys, sweethearts,
      withered ancients, daughters, sons, little children. Sad beyond power of thought were the
      hearts of all as they had hastened to the pierhead at early morning light; now the sorrowful
      still remained there, but those who came away rejoiced, for none returned without their
      treasures.</p>
<p>Thomasin stood with many another care-stricken soul, but her fears grew greater as the delay
      increased; for the Tregenza lugger was big and fast, yet many boats of less fame had already
      come home. All the fishermen told the same story. Bursting out of an ominous peace the storm
      had fallen suddenly upon them when westward of the Scilly Islands. One or two were believed to
      have made neighboring ports in the isles, but the fleet was driven before the gale and had
      experienced those grave hazards reserved for small vessels in a heavy sea. That all had
      weathered the night seemed a circumstance too happy to hope for, but Newlyn hearts rose high
      as boat after boat came back in safety. Then a dozen men hastened to Mrs. Tregenza with the
      good news that her husband's vessel was in sight.</p>
<p>"She've lost her mizzen by the looks on it," said a fisherman, "an' that's more'n good
      reason for her bein' 'mong the last to make home."</p>
<p>But Thomasin's hysterical joy was cut short by the most unexpected appearance of Mary
      Chirgwin on the pier. She had visited the white cottage to find it locked up and empty; she
      had then joined the concourse at the pierhead, feeling certain that the Tregenza boat must
      still be at sea; and she now added her congratulations to the rest, then told Mrs. Tregenza
      her news.</p>
<p>"I be comed to knaw if you've heard or seen anything o' Joan. 'Tis 'mazin' straange, but
      her've gone, like a dream, an' us caan't find a sign of her. What wi' she an' terrible doin's
      'pon the land last night, uncle's 'bout beside hisself. Us left her in the kitchen, an' when
      we comed back from tryin' to save the hay she was nowheer. Of coorse, us thot she'd gone to
      her bed. But she weern't, an' this mornin' we doan't see a atom of her, but finds a envelope
      empty 'pon the kitchen floor. 'Twas addressed to Joan an' comed from Lunnon."</p>
<p>"Aw jimmery! She've gone to en arter all, then—an' in her state."</p>
<p>"The floods was out, you see. Her might have marched off to Penzance to larn 'bout the
      manner o' gwaine to Lunnon an' bin stopped in home-comin'; or her might have slept in Penzance
      to catch a early train away."</p>
<p>"Iss, or her might a got in the water, poor lamb," said Thomasin, who never left the dark
      side of a position unconsidered. Mary's face showed that the same idea had struck her.</p>
<p>"God grant 'tedn' nothin' like that, though maybe 'twould be better than t'other. Us caan't
      say she've run away, but I thot I'd tell 'e how things is so's you could spread it abroad that
      she'm lost. Maybe us'll hear somethin' 'fore the day's much aulder. I be gwaine to Penzance
      now an' I'll let 'e knaw if theer's anything to tell. Good-by, an' I be right glad all's well
      wi' your husband, though I don't hold wi' his 'pinions."</p>
<p>But Mrs. Tregenza did not answer. Her eyes were fixed on the lugger which had now got to its
      anchorage and looked strange and unnatural shorn of its lesser mast. She saw the moorings
      dragged up; and a few minutes later the boat, which had rolled and tumbled at them all night,
      was baled. Thereupon men took their seats in her and began to row toward the harbor. It seemed
      that Gray Michael was steering, and his crew clearly pulled very weak and short, for their
      strength was spent.</p>
<p>Then, as they came between the arms of the harbor, as they shipped oars and glided to the
      steps, Tregenza's hybrid yellow dog, who accompanied the fisherman in all his goings, jumped
      ashore barking and galloped up the slippery steps with joy; while, at the same moment, a
      woman's sharp cry cut the air like a knife and two wild eyes looked down into the boat.</p>
<p>"Wheer'm the bwoy, Michael? Oh, my good God, wheer'm Tom?"</p>
<p>Everybody strained silently to hear the answer, but though the fisherman looked up, he made
      no reply. The boat steadied and one after another the men in her went ashore, Tregenza
      mounting the steps last. His wife broke the silence. Only a murmur of thankfulness had greeted
      the other men, for their faces showed a tragedy. They regarded their leader fearfully, and
      there was something more than death in their eyes.</p>
<p>"Wheer'm the bwoy—Tom? For the love of God, speak, caan't 'e? Why be you all dumb an'
      glazin' that awful!" cried the woman, knowing the truth before she heard it. Then she listened
      to the elder Pritchard, who whispered his wife, and so fell into a great convulsion of raving,
      dry-eyed sorrow.</p>
<p>"Oh, my bwoy! Drownded—my awn lil precious Tom! God a mercy! Dead! Then let me die tu!"</p>
<p>She gave vent to extravagant and savage grief after the manner of her kind. She would have
      torn her hair and thrown herself off the quay but for kindly hands which restrained.</p>
<p>"God rot you, an' blast you, an' burn you up!" she screamed, shaking her fists at the sea.
      "I knawed this would be the end. I dreamed it 'fore 'e was born. Doan't 'e hold me back, you
      poor fools. Let me gaw an' bury myself in the same graave along wi' en. My Tom, my Tom! I
      awnly had but wan—awnly wan, an' now—"</p>
<p>She wailed and wrung her hands, while rough voices filled her ears with such comfort as
      words could bring to her.</p>
<p>"Rest easy, bide at peace, dear sawl." "'Tis the Lard's doin', mother; an' the lil bwoy's
      better off now." "Take it calm, my poor good creature." "Try an' bring tears to your eyes,
      theer's a dear wummon."</p>
<p>Tears finally came to her relief, and she wept and moaned while friends supported her,
      looking with wonder upon Michael, her husband. He stood aloof with the men about him. But
      never a word he spoke to his wife or any other. His eyes dilated and had lost their steady
      forward glance, though a mad misery lighted them with flashes that came and went; his face was
      a very burrow of time, seared and trenched with pits and wrinkles. His hat was gone, his hair
      blew wild, the strong set of his mouth had vanished; his head, usually held so high, hung
      forward on a shrunken neck.</p>
<p>The brothers Pritchard told their story as a party conducted Thomasin back to her home. For
      the moment Gray Michael stood irresolute and alone, save for his dog, which ran round him.</p>
<p>"Us was tackin' when it fust began to blaw, an' all bustlin' 'bout in the dark, when the
      mainsail went lerrickin' 'cross an' knocked the poor dam bwoy owerboard into as ugly a rage o'
      water as ever I seed. Tom had his sea-boots on, an' every sawl 'pon the bwoat knawed 'twas all
      up as soon as we lost en. We shawed a light an' tumbled 'bout for quarter o' an hour wi' the
      weather gettin' wicked. Then comed a scat as mighty near thrawed us 'pon our beam-ends, an'
      took the mizzen 'long wi' it. 'Tis terrible bad luck, sure 'nough, for never a tidier bwoy
      went feeshin'; but theer's worse to tell 'e. Look at that gert, good man, Tregenza. Oh, my
      God, my blood do creem when I think on't!"</p>
<p>The man stopped and his brother took up the story.</p>
<p>"'Twas arterwards, when us had weathered the worst an' was tryin' to fetch home, Michael
      failed forward on's faace arter the bwoy was drownded; an' us had to do all for the bwoat
      wi'out en. But he comed to bimebye an' didn't take on much, awnly kept so dumb as a adder. Not
      a word did er say till marnin' light; then a 'orrible thing fell 'pon en. You knaw that yaller
      dog as sails wi' us most times? He turned 'pon en sudden an' sez: 'Praise God, praise the Lard
      o' Hosts, my sons, here's Tom, here's my lad as us thot weer drownded!' Then he kissed that
      beast, an' it licked his faace, an' he cried—that iron sawl cried like a wummon! Then he
      thundered out as the crew was to give God the praise, an' said the man as weern't on's knees
      in a twinklin' should be thrawed out the bwoat to Jonah's whale. God's truth! I never seed
      nothin' so awful as skipper's eyes 'pon airth! Then er calmed down, an' the back of en grawed
      humpetty an' his head failed a bit forrard an' he sat strokin' of the dog. Arter that, when us
      seed Newlyn, it 'peared to bring en to his senses a bit, an' he knawed Tom was drownded. He
      rambled in his speech a while; then went mute again, wi' a new look in his eyes as though he'd
      grawed so auld as history in a single night. Theer he do stand bedoled wi' all manner o'
      airthly sufferin', poor creature. Him wi' all his righteousness behind en tu! But the thinkin'
      paarts of en be drownded wheer his bwoy was, an' I lay theer ban't no druggister, nor doctor
      neither, as'll bring 'em back to en."</p>
<p>"Look at that now!" exclaimed another man. "See who's a talkin' to Tregenza! If that ban't
      terrible coorious! 'Tis Billy Jago, the softy!" </p>
<p>Billy was indeed addressing Gray Michael and getting an answer to his remarks. The laborer's
      brains might be addled, but they still contained sane patches. He had heard of the fisherman's
      loss and now touched his hat and expressed regret.</p>
<p>"Ay, the young be snatched, same as a build-in' craw will pick sprigs o' green wood for her
      nest an' leave the dead twig to rot. Here I be, rotten an' coffin-ripe any time this two year,
      yet I'm passed awver for that braave young youth. An' how is it wi' you, Mr. Tregenza? I
      s'pose the Lard do look to His awn in such a pass?"</p>
<p>Gray Michael regarded the speaker a moment and then made answer.</p>
<p>"I be that sleepy, my son, an' hungry wi' it. Iss fay, I could eat a bloody raw dog-fish an'
      think it no sin. See to this, but doan't say nothin' 'bout it. The bwoat went down wi' all
      hands, but us flinged a bottle to Bucca for en to wash ashore wi' the news. But it never
      comed, for why? 'Cause that damnation devil bringed the bottle 'gainst granite rocks, an' the
      message was washed away for mermaids to read an' laugh at; an' the grass-green splinters o'
      glass as held the last cry o' drownin' men—why, lil childern plays wi' 'em now 'pon the sand.
      'Sing to the Lard, ye that gaw down to the sea.' An' I'll sing—trust me for that, but I must
      eat fust. I speaks to you, Billy, 'cause you be wan o' God's chosen fools."</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly, pressed his hand over his forehead, said something about breaking the
      news to his wife, and then walked slowly down the quay. The manner of his locomotion had
      wholly changed, and he moved like one whose life was a failure.</p>
<p>Meantime Jago, full of the great discovery, hastened to the Pritchards and other men who
      were now following Gray Michael at a distance. Them he told that the fisherman had taken leave
      of his senses, that he had actually called Billy himself one of God's chosen fools.</p>
<p>Several more boats had come in, and as it was certainly known that some had taken refuge at
      Scilly, those vitally interested in the few remaining vessels withdrew from the quay
      comforting each other and putting a hopeful face on the position. Gray Michael followed his
      wife home. As yet she had not learned of his state; but, although his conduct on returning was
      somewhat singular, no word which fell now from him spoke clearly of a disordered mind. He
      clamored first for food, and, while he ate, gave a clear if callous account of his son's death
      and the lugger's danger. Having eaten, he went to his bedroom, dragged off his boots, flung
      himself down and was soon sleeping heavily; while Thomasin, marveling at his stolidity and
      resenting it not a little, gave way to utter grief. During an interval between storms of tears
      the woman put on a black gown, then went to her work. The day had now advanced. On seeing her
      again downstairs, two or three friends, including the Pritchards, entered the house and asked
      anxiously after Michael, without, however, stating the nature of their fears. She answered
      querulously that the man was asleep and showed no more sorrow than a brute beast. She was very
      red-eyed and bedraggled. Every utterance was an excuse for a fresh outburst of weeping, her
      breast heaved, her hands moved spasmodically, her nerves were at extreme tension and she could
      not stay long in one place. Seeing that she was nearly lightheaded with much grief, and hoping
      that her husband's disorder would vanish after his slumber was ended, her friends forbore to
      hint at what had happened to him. They comforted her to the best of their power; then, knowing
      that long hours of bitter sorrow must surely pass over the mother's head before such grief
      could grow less, departed one by one, leaving her at last alone. She moved restlessly about
      from room to room, carrying in one hand a photograph of Tom, in the other a handkerchief. Now
      and then she sat down, looked at the picture and wept anew. She tried to eat some supper
      presently but could not. It is seldom a sudden loss strikes home so speedily as had her
      tribulation sunk into Thomasin Tregenza's soul. She drank some brandy and water which a friend
      had poured out for her and left standing on the mantel—shelf. Then she went up to bed—a
      stricken ruin of the woman who had risen from it in the morning. Her husband still slept, and
      Thomasin, her grief being of a nature which required spectators for its fullest and most
      soothing expression, felt irritated alike with him and with those friends who had all
      departed, and, from the best motives, left her thus. She flung herself into bed and anger
      obscured her misery—anger with her husband. His heavy breathing worked her to a frenzy at
      last, and she sat up, took him by the shoulder and tried to shake him.</p>
<p>"Wake up, for God's sake, an' speak to me, caan't 'e? You eat an' drink an' sleep like a
      gert hog—you new—come from your awnly son's drownin'! Oh, Christ, caan't 'e think o' me, as
      have lived a hunderd cruel years since you went to sleep? Ain't you got a word for me? An'
      you, as had your sawl centered 'pon en—how comes it you can—"</p>
<p>She stopped abruptly, for he lay motionless and made no sort of response to her shrill
      complaining. She had yet to learn the cause; she had yet to know that Michael had drifted
      beyond the reach of all further mental suffering whatsoever. No religious anxieties, no
      mundane trials, none of the million lesser carking troubles that fret the sane brain and stamp
      care on the face of conscious intelligence would plague him more. Henceforth he was dead to
      the changes and chances of human life.</p>
<p>At midnight there came the awful waking. Thomasin slept at last and slumbered dream-tossed
      in a shadow-world of fantastic troubles. Then a sound roused her—the sound of a voice speaking
      loudly, breaking off to laugh, and speaking again. The voice she knew, but the laugh she had
      never heard. She started up and listened. It was her husband who had wakened her.</p>
<p>"How do it go then? Lard! my memory be like a fishin' net, as holds the gert things an' lets
      the little 'uns creep through. 'Twas a braave song as faither singed, though maybe for God
      fearers it ban't a likely song."</p>
<p>Then the bed trembled and the man reared up violently and roared out an order in such words
      as he had never used till then.</p>
<p>"Port! Port your God-damned helm if you don't want 'em to sink us."</p>
<p>Thomasin, of whose presence her husband appeared unconscious, crept trembling from the bed.
      Then his voice changed and he whispered:</p>
<p>"Port, my son, 'cause of that 'pon the waters. Caan't 'e see—they bubbles a glimmerin' on
      the foam? That's the last life of my lil Tom; an' the foam-wreath's put theer by God's awn
      right hand. He'm saved, if 'twasn't that down at the bottom o' the sea a man be twenty fathom
      nearer hell than them as lies in graaves ashore. But let en wait for the last trump as'll rip
      the deep oceans. An' the feesh—damn 'em—if I thot they'd nose Tom, by God I'd catch every
      feesh as ever swum. But shall feesh be 'lowed to eat what's had a everlasting sawl in it? God
      forbid. He'm theer, I doubt, wi' seaweed round en an' sea-maids a cryin' awver his lil white
      faace an' keepin' the crabs away. Hell take crabs—they'd a ate Christ 'isself if so be He'd
      falled in the water. Pearls—pearls—pearls is on Tom, an' the sea creatures gives what they
      can, 'cause they knaw as he'd a grawed to be a man an' theer master. God bless 'em, they gives
      the best they can, 'cause they knawed how us loved en. 'The awnly son o' his mother.' Well,
      well, sleep's better'n medicine; but no sleepin' this weather if us wants to make home again.
      Steady! 'Tis freshenin' fast!"</p>
<p>He was busy about some matter and she heard him breathing in the darkness and stirring
      himself. Thomasin, her heart near standing still before this awful discovery, hesitated
      between stopping and flying from the room before he should discover her. But she felt no fear
      of the man himself, and bracing her nerves, struck a light. It showed Gray Michael sitting up
      and evidently under the impression he was at sea. He grasped the bed-head as a tiller and
      peered anxiously ahead.</p>
<p>"Theer's light shawin' forrard!" he cried. Then he laughed, and Thomasin saw his face was
      but the caricature of what it had been, with all the iron lines blotted out and a strange,
      feeble expression about eyes and mouth. He nodded his head, looked up at the ceiling from time
      to time, and presently began to sing.</p>
<p>It was the old rhyme he had been trying to recollect, and it now came, tossed uppermost in
      the mind-quake which had shattered his intellect, buried matters of moment, and flung to the
      surface long hidden events and words of his youth.</p>
<p>  "'Bucca's a churnin' the waves of the sea,     Bucca's a darkenin' the sky wi' his frown,
            His voice is the roll o' the thunder.   The lightnin' do shaw us the land on our lee,
          An' do point to the plaace wheer our bodies shall drown       When the bwoat gaws down
      from under.' </p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha, missis! So you'm aboard, eh? Well, 'tis a funny picksher you makes, an' if
      tweern't murder an' hell-fire to do it, blamed if I wouldn't thraw 'e out the ship. 'Thou
      mad'st him lower than the angels,' but not much lower, I'm thinkin'. 'Tis all play an' no work
      wi' them. They ought to take a back seat 'fore the likes o' us. They abbun no devil at theer
      tails all times.</p>
<p>  "'But I'll tame the wild devil afore very long.   If I caan't wi' my feests, I will wi' my
      tongue!'" </p>
<p>Thomasin Tregenza scuffled into her clothes while he babbled, and now, bidding him sleep in
      a shaking voice, putting out the candle and taking the matches with her, she fled into the
      night to rouse her neighbors and summon a doctor. She forgot all her other troubles before
      this overwhelming tragedy. And the man driveled on in the dark, concerning himself for the
      most part with those interests which had occupied his life when he was a boy.</p>
