<head>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</head>
<head>THE FINDING OF THE MAN</head>
<p>The gratification of his desire and the fulfillment of his revenge, though steadfastly
      foreseen by Joe Noy from the moment when first he set foot in London and began his search, now
      for a moment overwhelmed him at the prospect of their extreme propinquity. Had anything been
      needed to strengthen his determination on the threshold of a meeting with Joan's destroyer, it
      was the startling vision of Joan herself from which he had just departed. No event had brought
      the magnitude of his loss more cruelly to the core of his heart than the sudden splendid
      representation of what he had left behind him in her innocence and beauty; and, for the same
      reason, nothing could have more thoroughly fortified his mind to the deed now lying in his
      immediate future.</p>
<p>Noy's first act was to turn again to the gallery with a purpose to inquire where John Barron
      might be found; but he recollected that many picture catalogues contained the private
      addresses of the exhibitors, and accordingly consulted the list he had brought with him. There
      he found the name and also the house in which the owner of it dwelt—</p>
<p>JOHN BARRON, No. 6 Melbury Gardens, S. W.</p>
<p>Only hours now separated him from his goal, and it seemed strange to Noy that he should have
      thus come in sight of it so suddenly. But his wits cooled and with steady system he followed
      the path long marked out. He stood and looked in at a gunsmith's window for ten minutes, then
      moved forward to another. At the shop-fronts of cutlers he also dawdled, but finally returned
      to the first establishment which had attracted him, entered, and, for the sum of two pounds,
      purchased a small, five-chambered revolver with a box of cartridges. He then went back to his
      lodging, and set to work to find the position of Melbury Gardens upon his map. This done the
      man marked his road to that region, outlining with a red chalk pencil the streets through
      which he would have to walk before reaching it. Throughout the afternoon he continued his
      preparations, acting very methodically, and setting his house in order with the deliberation
      of one who knows that he is going to die, but not immediately. Sometimes he rested from the
      labor of letter-writing to think and rehearse again the scene which was to close that day. A
      thousand times he had already done so; a thousand times the imaginary interview had been the
      last thought in his waking brain; but now the approach of reality swept away those unreal
      dialogues, dramatic entrances, exits and events of the great scene as he had pictured it. The
      present moment found Noy's brain blank as to everything but the issue; and he surprised
      himself by discovering that his mind now continually recurred to those events which would
      follow the climax, while yet the death of John Barron was unaccomplished. His active thoughts,
      under conditions of such excitation as the day had brought upon the top of his discovery,
      traveled with astounding speed, and it was not John Barron's end but his own which filled the
      imagination of the sailor as he wrote. The shadow of the gallows was on the paper, though the
      event which was to bring this consummation still lay some hours deep in unrecorded time. But,
      for Noy, John Barron was as good as dead, and himself as good as under sentence of death.</p>
<p>Grown quite calm, fixed in mind, and immovable as the black sea cliffs of his mother-land,
      he wrote steadily on until thought sped whirling forward to a new aspect of his future: the
      last. He saw himself in eternity, tossed to everlasting flames by his Maker, as a man tosses
      an empty match-box, after it has done its work, into the fire. He put down his pen and
      pictured it. The terrific force of that conviction cannot fairly be set before the
      intelligence of average cultured people, because, whatever they profess to believe in their
      hearts, the truth is that, even with forty-nine Christians out of fifty, hell appears a mere
      vague conceit meaning nothing. They affirm that they believe in eternal torment; they confess
      all humanity is ripe for it; but their pulses are unquickened by the assertion or admission;
      they do <hi>not</hi> believe in it. Nor can educated man so believe, for that way madness
      lies, and he who dwells long and closely upon this unutterable dogma, anon himself feels the
      first flickering of the undying flame. It scorches, not his body, but his brain, and a lunatic
      asylum presently shuts him from a sane world unless medical aid quickly brings healthy
      relief.</p>
<p>But with primitive opinions, narrow beliefs and narrow intelligences, hell can be a live
      conceit enough. Among Luke Gospelers and kindred sects there shall be found such genuine fear
      and such trembling as the church called orthodox never knows; and to Noy the tremendous
      spectacle of his everlasting punishment now made itself actively felt. A life beyond death—a
      life to be spent in one of two places and to endure eternally was to Joe as certain as the
      knowledge that he lived; and that his destination must be determined by the work yet lying
      between him and death appeared equally sure. Further, that work must be performed. There was
      no loophole of escape from it, and had there been such he would have blocked it against
      himself resolutely. Moreover, as the will and desire to do the deed was an action as definite
      in the eye of Heaven as the accomplishment of the deed itself, he reckoned himself already
      damned. He had long since counted the whole cost, and now it only seemed more vast and awful
      than upon past surveys by reason of its nearer approach. Now he speculated curiously upon the
      meetings which must follow upon the world's dissolution; and wondered if those who kill do
      ever meet and hold converse in hell-fire with their victims. Then again he fell to writing,
      and presently completed letters to his father, his mother, to Mrs. Tregenza and to Mary
      Chirgwin. These he left in his apartment, and presently going out into the air, walked, with
      no particular aim, until darkness fell. Hunger now prompted him, and he ate a big meal at a
      restaurant and drank with his food a pint of ale. Physically fortified, he returned to his
      lodging, left upon the table in his solitary room the sum he would that night owe for the hire
      of the chamber, and, then, taking his letters, went out to return no more. A few clothes, a
      brush and comb and a small wooden trunk was all he left behind him. Joe Noy purchased four
      stamps for his letters and posted them. They were written as though the murder of John Barron
      had been already accomplished, and he thus completed and dispatched them before the event,
      because he imagined that, afterward, the power of communicating with his parents or friends
      would be denied him. That they might be spared the horror of learning the news through a
      public source he wrote it thus, and knew, as he did so, that to two of his correspondents the
      intelligence would come without the full force of a novelty. Thomasin Tregenza and Mary
      Chirgwin alike were familiar with his intention at the time of his departure, and to them he
      therefore wrote but briefly; his parents, on the other hand, for all Joe knew to the contrary,
      might still be ignorant of the fact that he had come off his cruise. His letters to them were
      accordingly of great length; and he set forth therein with the nervous lucidity of a meager
      vocabulary the nature of his wrongs and the action which he had taken under Heaven's guidance
      to revenge them. He stated plainly in all four of his missives to Newlyn, Drift and Mousehole
      that the artist, John Barron, was shot dead by his hand and that he himself intended suffering
      the consequent punishment as became a brave man and the weapon of the Lord. These notes then
      he posted, and so went upon his way that he might fulfill to the letter his written words.</p>
<p>Following the roads he had studied upon his map and committed to memory, Noy soon reached
      Melbury Gardens and presently stood opposite No, 6 and scanned it. The hour was then ten
      o'clock and lights were in some of the windows, but not many. Looking over the area railings,
      the sailor saw four servants—two men and two women—eating their supper. He noted, as a
      singular circumstance, that there were wineglasses upon the kitchen table and that they held
      red liquor and white.</p>
<p>Noy's design was simple enough. He meant to stand face to face with John Barron, to explain
      the nature of the events which had occurred, to tell him, what it was possible he might not
      know: that Joan was dead; and then to inform him that his own days were numbered. Upon these
      words Joe designed to shoot the other down like a dog, and to make absolutely certain of his
      death by firing the entire contents of the revolver. He expected that a private interview
      would be vouchsafed to him if he desired it; and his intention, after his victim should fall,
      was to blow the man's brains out at close quarters before even those nearest at hand could
      prevent it. At half-past ten Noy felt that his weapon was in the left breast pocket of his
      coat ready for the drawing; then ascended the steps which rose to the front door of John
      Barron's dwelling and rang the bell.</p>
<p>The man-servant whom he had seen through the area railings in the kitchen came to the door,
      and, much to Noy's astonishment, accosted him before he had time to say that he wished to see
      the master of the house.</p>
<p>"You've come at last, then," said the man.</p>
<p>Joe regarded him with surprise, then spoke.</p>
<p>"I want to see Mr. John Barron, please."</p>
<p>The other laughed, as if this was an admirable jest.</p>
<p>"I suppose you do, though that's a queer way to put it. You talk as though you had come to
      smoke a cigar along with him."</p>
<p>In growing amazement and suspicion, Noy listened to this most curious statement. Fears
      suddenly awoke that, by some mysterious circumstance, Barron had learned of his contemplated
      action and was prepared for it. He stopped, therefore, looked about him sharply to avoid any
      sudden surprise, and put a question to the footman.</p>
<p>"You spoke as though I was wanted," he said. "What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"Blessed if you're not a rum 'un!" answered the man. "Of course you was wanted, else you
      wouldn't be here, would you? You're not a party as calls promiscuous, I should hope. Else it
      would be rather trying to delicate nerves. You're the gentleman as everybody requires some
      time, though nobody ever sends for himself."</p>
<p>Failing to gather the other's meaning, Noy only realized that John Barron expected some
      visitor and felt, therefore, the more determined to hasten his own actions. He saw the footman
      was endeavoring to be jocose, and therefore humored him, pretending at the same time to be the
      individual who was expected.</p>
<p>"You're a funny fellow and must often make your master laugh, I should reckon, Iss, I be the
      chap what you thought I was. An' I should like to see him—the guv'nor—at once if he'll see
      me."</p>
<p>The footman chuckled again.</p>
<p>"He'll see you all right. He's been wantin' of you all day, and he'd have been that dreadful
      disapp'inted if you 'adn't come. Always awful particular about his clothes, you know, so mind
      you're jolly careful about the measuring 'cause this overcoat will have to last him a long
      time."</p>
<p>Taking his cue from these words Noy, still ignorant of the truth, made answer: "Iss, I'll
      measure en all right. Wheer is he to?"</p>
<p>"In the studio—there you are, right ahead. Knock at that baize door and then walk straight
      in, 'cause he'll very likely be too much occupied to answer you. He's quite alone—leastways I
      believe so. I'll come back in quarter'n hour; and mind you don't talk no secrets or tell him
      how I laughed at him behind his back, else he'd give me the sack for certain."</p>
<p>The man withdrew, sniggering at his own humor, and Noy, quite unable to see rhyme or reason
      in his remarks, stood with an expression of bewilderment upon his broad face and watched the
      servant disappear. Then his countenance changed, and he approached a door covered with red
      baize at which the passage terminated. He knocked, waited, and knocked again, straining his
      ear to hear the voice he had labored so long to silence. Then he put his revolver into the
      side pocket of his coat, and, afterward, following the footman's directions, pushed open the
      swing door, which yielded to his hand. A curtain hung inside it, and, pulling this aside, he
      entered a spacious apartment with a glass roof. But scanty light illuminated the studio from
      one oil lamp which hung by a chain from a bracket in the wall, and the rays of which were much
      dimmed by a red glass shade. Some easels, mostly empty, stood about the sides of the great
      chamber; here and there on the white walls were sketches in charcoal and daubs of paint. A
      German stove appeared in the middle of the room, but it was not burning; skins of beasts
      scattered the floor; upon one wall hung the "Negresses Bathing at Tobago." For the rest the
      room appeared empty. Then, growing accustomed to the dim red light, Noy made a closer
      examination until he caught sight of an object which made him catch his breath violently and
      hurry forward. Under the lofty open windows which rose on the northern side of the studio,
      remote from all other objects, was a couch, and upon it lay a small, straight figure shrouded
      in white sheets save for its face.</p>
<p>John Barron had been dead twenty-four hours, and he had hastened his own end, by a space of
      time impossible to determine, through leaving his sick-room two days previously, that he might
      visit the picture gallery wherein hung "Joe's Ship." It was a step taken in absolute defiance
      of his medical men. The day of that excursion had chanced to be a very cold one, and during
      the night which followed it John Barron broke a blood vessel and precipitated his death. Now,
      in the hands of hirelings, without a friend to put one flower on his breast or close his dim
      eyes, the man lay waiting for an undertaker; and while Joe Noy glared at him, unconsciously
      gripping the weapon he had brought, it seemed as though the dead smiled under the red flicker
      of the lamp—as though he smiled and prepared to come back into life to answer this supreme
      accuser.</p>
<p>As by an educated mind Joe Noy's estimate and assurance of the eternal tortures of hell
      cannot be adequately grasped in its full force, so now it is hard to set forth with a power
      sufficiently luminous and terrific the effect of this discovery upon him. He, the weapon of
      the Almighty, found his work finished and the fruits of his labors snatched from his hand. His
      enemy had escaped, and the fact that he was dead only made the case harder. Had Barron
      hastened from him and avoided his revolver, he could have suffered it, knowing that the end
      lay in the future at the determination of God; but now the end appeared before him
      accomplished; and it had been attained without his assistance. His labor was lost and his
      longed-for, prayed-for achievement rendered impossible. He stood and scanned the small,
      marble-white face, then drew a box of matches from his pocket, lighted one and looked closer.
      Worn by disease to mere skin and skull, there was nothing left to suggest the dead man's
      wasted powers; and generation of their own destroyers was the only task now left for his
      brains. The end of Noy's match fell red-hot on John Barron's face. Then he turned as footsteps
      sounded; the curtains were moved aside and the footman reappeared, followed by another
      person.</p>
<p>"Why, you wasn't the undertaker after all!" he explained. "Did you think the man was alive?
      Good Lord! But you've found him anyway."</p>
<p>"Iss, I thot he was alive. I wanted to see en livin' an' leave en—" he stopped. Common sense
      for once had a word with him and convinced him of the folly of saying anything now concerning
      his frustrated projects.</p>
<p>"He died night 'fore last—consumption—and he's left money enough to build a brace of
      ironclads, they say, and never no will, and not a soul on God's earth is there with any legal
      claim upon him. To tell the truth, we none of us never liked him."</p>
<p>"If you'll shaw me the way out into the street, I'll thank 'e," said Noy. The undertaker was
      already busy making measurements. Then, a minute later, Joe found himself standing under the
      sky again; and the darkness was full of laughter and of voices, of gibing, jeering noises in
      unseen throats, of rapid utterances on invisible tongues. The supernatural things screamed
      into his ears that he was damned for a wish and for an intention; then they shrieked and
      yelled their derision, and he understood well enough, for the point of view was not a new one.
      Given the accomplishment of his desire, he was prepared to suffer eternally; now eternal
      suffering must follow on a wish barren of fruit, and hell for him would be hell indeed, with
      no accomplished revenge in memory to lessen the torment. When the voices at length died and a
      clock struck one, Noy came to himself, and realized that, in so far as the present affected
      him, Fate had brought him back to life and liberty by a short cut. Then, seeing his position,
      he asked himself whether life was long enough to make atonement and even allow of ultimate
      escape after death. But the fierce disappointment which beat upon his soul like a recurring
      wave, as thought drifted back and back, told him that he had fairly won hell-fire and must
      abide by it.</p>
<p>So thinking, he returned to his lodging, entered unobserved and prowled the small chamber
      till dawn. By morning light all his life appeared transfigured and a ghastly anti-climax faced
      the man. Presently he remembered the letters he had posted overnight, and the recollection of
      them brought with it sudden resolves and a course of action.</p>
<p>Half an hour later he had reached Paddington Station, and was soon on his way back to
      Cornwall.</p>
