<head>CHAPTER FIVE</head>
<head>COLD COMFORT</head>
<p>John Barron made other preparations for his picture besides those detailed to Joan Tregenza.
      He designed a large canvas and proposed to paint it in the open air according to his custom.
      His health had improved, and the sustained splendor of the spring weather flattered hopes
      that, his model once won, the work he proposed would grow into an accomplished fact. There was
      no cottage where he might house his picture and materials within half a mile of Gorse Point,
      but a granite cow-byre rose considerably nearer, at a corner of an upland field. Wind-worn and
      lichen-stained it stood, situated not more than two hundred yards from the spot on which
      Barron's picture was to be painted. A pathway to outlying farms cut the fields hard by the
      byre, and about it lay implements of husbandry—a chain harrow and a rusty plow. Black,
      tar-pitched double doors gave entrance to the shed, and light entered from a solitary window
      now roughly nailed up from the outside with boards. A padlock fastened the door, but, by
      wrenching down the covering of the window, Barron got sight of the interior. A smell of vermin
      and decay rose from the inner darkness; then, as his eyes focused the gloom, he noted a dry,
      spacious chamber likely enough to answer his purpose. Brown litter of last year's fern filled
      one corner, and in it was marked a lair as of some medium-sized beast; elsewhere a few sacks
      with spades and picks and a small pile of potatoes appeared: the roots were all sprouting
      feebly from white eyes, as though they knew spring held the world, though neither sunshine
      warmed them nor soft earth aided their struggle for life. Here the man might well keep his
      canvas and other matters. Assuming that temporary possession of the shed was possible, his
      property would certainly be safe enough there; for artists are respected in and about Newlyn,
      and their needs considered when possible. A farm, known as Middle Hemyll, showed gray chimneys
      above the fields, half a mile distant, and, after finding the shed, Barron proceeded thither
      to learn its ownership. The master of Middle Hemyll speedily enlightened him, and the visitor
      learned that not only did he speak to the possessor of the cow-byre, but that Farmer Ford was
      a keen supporter of art, and would be happy to rent his outhouse for a moderate
      consideration.</p>
<p>"The land ban't under pasture now, an' the plaace ed'n much used just this minute, so you'm
      welcome if you mind to. My auld goat did live theer wance, but er's dead this long time. Maybe
      you seed the carcass of en, outside? I'll have the byre cleared come to-morrer; an' if so be
      you wants winders in the roof, same as other paintin' gents, you'll have to put 'em theer wi'
      your awn money."</p>
<p>Barron explained that he only needed the shed as a storehouse for his picture and tools.</p>
<p>"Just so, just so. Then you'll find a bwoy wi' the key theer to-morrer, an' all vitty; an'
      you can pay in advancement or arter, as you please to. Us'll say half-a-crown a week, if
      that'll soot 'e."</p>
<p>The listener produced half-a-sovereign, much to Farmer Ford's gratification, and asked that
      a lad or man might be found to return with him there and then to the shed.</p>
<p>"I am anxious to see the place and have it in order before I go back to Newlyn," he
      explained. "I will pay you extra for the necessary labor, and it should not take above an
      hour."</p>
<p>"No more 'twill, an' I'll come 'long with 'e myself this minute," answered the other.</p>
<p>Getting a key to the padlock, and a big birch broom, he returned with Barron, and soon had
      the doors of the disused byre thrown open to the air. </p>
<p>"I shut en up when the auld goat went dead. Theer a used to lie in the corner, but now he'm
      outside, an' I doubt the piskeys, what they talks 'bout, be mighty savage wi' me for not
      buryin' the beast, 'cause all fairies is 'dicted to goats, they do say, an' mighty fond o' the
      milk of 'em."</p>
<p>Farmer Ford soon cleared the place of potatoes, sacks, and tools. Then, taking his broom, he
      made a clean sweep of dust and dirt.</p>
<p>"Theer's a many more rats here than I knawed seemin'ly," he said, as he examined a sink in
      the stones of the floor, used for draining the stalls; "they come up here for sartain, an'
      runs out 'long the heydge to the mangel-wurzel mound, I lay."</p>
<p>Without, evidences of the vermin were clear enough. Long hardened tracks, patted down by
      many paws, ran this way and that; and the main rat thoroughfare extended, as the farmer
      foretold, to a great mound where, stowed snugly in straw under earth, lay packed the remains
      of a mangel-wurzel crop. At one end the store had been opened and drawn upon for winter use;
      but a goodly pile of the great tawny globes still remained, small lemon-colored leaves
      sprouting from them. Farmer Ford, however, viewed the treasure without satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Us killed a power o' sheep wi' they blarsted roots last winter," he said. "You'd never
      think now as the frost could touch 'em, but it did though, awin' to the wicked long winter. It
      got to 'em, sure 'nough, an' theer was frost in 'em when us gived 'em to the sheep, an' it
      rotted theer innards, poor twoads, an' they died, more'n a score."</p>
<p>Barron listened thoughtfully to these details, then pointed to an ugly sight beyond the
      wurzel mound.</p>
<p>"I should like that removed," he said.</p>
<p>It was the dead goat, withered to a mummy almost, with horns and hide intact, and a rat-way
      bored through the body of the beast under a tunnel of its ribs.</p>
<p>"Jimmery! to see what them varmints have done to 'en! But I'll bury what's left right on en;
      an' I'll stop the sink in the house, then you'll be free of 'em."</p>
<p>These things the farmer did, and presently departed, promising to revisit the spot ere long
      with some dogs and a ferret or two. So Barron was left master of the place. He found it dry,
      weather-proof and well suited to his requirements in every respect. The concerns which he had
      ordered from London would be with him by Saturday night if all went well, and he decided that
      they should be conveyed to the byre at an early hour on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday, and half a dozen men, with Barron and Murdoch among them, strolled
      into Brady's great whitewashed studio to see and criticise his academy picture which was
      finished. Everybody declared that the artist had excelled himself in "The End of the Voyage."
      It represented a sweep of the rocky coast by the Lizard, a wide gray sand, left naked by the
      tide, with the fringe of a heavy sea churning on it, and sea-fowl strutting here and there. In
      the foreground, half buried under tangles of brown weed torn from the rocks by past storms,
      lay a dead sailor, and a big herring-gull, with its head on one side and a world of inquiry in
      its yellow eyes, was looking at him. Tremendous vigor marked the work, and only a Brady could
      have come safely through the difficulties which had been surmounted in its creation. Everybody
      sang praises, and Barron nodded warm approval, but said nothing until challenged.</p>
<p>"Now, find the faults, then tell me what's good," said the gigantic painter. He stood there,
      burly, hearty, physically splendid—the man of all others in that throng who might have been
      pointed to as the creator of the solemn gray picture before them.</p>
<p>"Leave fault-finding to Fleet Street," said Barron; "let the press people tell you where you
      are wrong. I am no critic and I know what a mountain of hard work went to this."</p>
<p>"That's all right, old man; never mind the work—or me. Be impartial."</p>
<p>"Why should I? To be impartial, as this world wags, is to be friendless."</p>
<p>"Good Lord! d'you think I mind mauling? There's something wrong or you wouldn't be so
      deucedly evasive. Out with it!"</p>
<p>"Well, your sailor's not dead."</p>
<p>Brady roared with laughter.</p>
<p>"Man! the poor devil's been in the water a week!"</p>
<p>"Not he. 'Tis a mistake in nine painted corpses out of ten. If you want to paint a drowned
      man, wait till you've seen one close. That sailor in the seaweed's asleep. Sleep is graceful,
      remember; death by drowning is generally ugly—stiff, stark, hideous, eyeless, fish-gnawed a
      week after the event. But what does it matter? You've painted a great picture. That sea, with
      the circular swirl, as each wave goes back into the belly of the next, is well done; and those
      lumps of spume fluttering above watermark—that was finely noted. Easy to write down in print,
      but difficult as the fiend to paint. And the picture is full of wind too. Your troubles are
      amply repaid and I congratulate you. A man who could paint that will go as far as he
      likes."</p>
<p>The simple Brady forgot the powder in swallowing the jam. Barron had touched those things in
      his work which were precious to him. His impulsive nature took fire, and there was almost a
      quiver of emotion in his big voice as he answered:</p>
<p>"Damn it, you're a brick! I'd sooner hear you praise those lumps of sea-spume, racing over
      the sand there, than see my picture on the line."</p>
<p>But sentiment was strange to John Barron's impersonal nature, and he froze.</p>
<p>"Another fault exists which probably nobody will tell you but me. Your seaweed's great, and
      you knew it by heart before you painted it—that I'll swear to, but your sleeper there would
      never lie in the line of it as you have him. Reflect: the sea must float the light weed after
      it could move him no more. He should be stogged in the sand nearer the sea."</p>
<p>Brady, however, contested this criticism, and so the talk wore on until the men separated.
      But the Irishman called on Barron after midday dinner and together they strolled through
      Newlyn toward the neighboring village. Chance brought them face to face with two persons more
      vital to the narrative than themselves, and, pausing to chronicle the event of the meeting, we
      may leave the artists and follow those whom they encountered.</p>
<p>Gray Michael kept ashore on Sundays, and today, having come off the sea at dawn, was not
      again putting forth until next morning. He had attended meeting with his wife, his daughter
      and his son; he had dined also, and was now walking over to Mousehole that he might bring some
      religious comfort to a sorely stricken Luke Gospeler—a young sheep but lately won to the fold
      and who now lay at the point of death. Joan accompanied him, and upon the way they met John
      Barron and his companion. The girl blushed hotly and then chilled with a great disappointment,
      for Barron's eyes were on the sea; he was talking as he passed by, and he apparently saw
      neither her nor her Sunday gown; which circumstance was a sorrow to Joan. But in reality
      Barron missed nothing. He had shivered at her green dress and poor finery long before she
      reached him. Her garb ruffled his senses and left him wounded.</p>
<p>"There goes your beauty," laughed Brady; "how would you like to paint her in that frock with
      those sinful blue flowers in her hat?"</p>
<p>"Nature must weep to see the bizarre carnival these people enjoy on the Seventh Day,"
      answered the other. "Their duns and drabs, their russets and tawny tones of red and orange,
      are of their environment, the proper skins for their bodies; but to think of that girl
      brightening the eyes of a hundred louts by virtue of those fine feathers! Dream of her in the
      Stone Age, clad in a petticoat torn from a wolf, with her straw-colored hair to her waist and
      a necklace of shells or wild beasts' teeth between her breasts! And the man—her father, I
      suppose—what a picture his cursed broadcloth and soft black hat make of him—like the head of a
      patriarch stuck on a tailor's dummy."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ignorant of these startling criticisms, Mr. Tregenza and his daughter pursued
      their road, and presently stopped before a cottage in one of the cobble-paved alley-ways of
      Mousehole. A worn old woman opened the door and courtesied to Gray Michael. He wished her
      good-afternoon, then entered the cottage, first bidding Joan return in an hour. She had
      friends near at hand, and hurried off, glad to escape the sight of sickness and the prayers
      she knew that her father would presently deliver.</p>
<p>"How be en?" inquired the fisherman, and the widowed mother of the patient answered:</p>
<p>"Better, I do pray. Er was in the doldrums issterday an' bad by night also, a dwaling an'
      moaning gashly, but, the Lard be praised, he'm better in mind by now, an' I do think 'tis more
      along of Bible-readin' than all the doctor's traade [Footnote: <hi>Traade</hi>—Physic.] he've
      took. I read to en 'bout that theer bwoy, the awnly son o' his mother, an' her a
      widder-wumman, an' how as the Lard brought en round arter he'd gone dead."</p>
<p>Gray Michael sniffed and made no comment.</p>
<p>"I'll see en an' put up a prayer or so," he said.</p>
<p>"An' the Lard'll reward it, Mr. Tregenza."</p>
<p>Young Albert Vallack greeted the visitor with even greater reverence than his mother had
      done. He and the old woman were Falmouth folks and had drifted Westerly upon the father's
      death, until chance anchored them in Newlyn. Now the lad—a dissolute youth enough, until
      sudden illness had frightened him to religion—was dying of consumption, and dying fast, though
      as yet he knew it not.</p>
<p>"'Tis handsome in you, a comin' to see the likes o' me," said the patient, flushing with
      satisfaction. "You'm like the stickler at a wras'lin' match, Mister Tregenza, sir; you sees
      fair play betwixt God an' man."</p>
<p>"So you'm better, Albert, your mother sez."</p>
<p>"Iss, a bit. Theer's more kick an' sprawl [Footnote: <hi>Kick an' sprawl</hi>—Strength,
      vitality.] in me than theer 'ave bin; an' I feels more hopeful like 'bout the future."</p>
<p>Self-righteousness in a new-fledged Luke Gospeler, who had been of the fold but three months
      and whose previous record was extremely unsatisfactory, irritated Gray Michael not a
      little.</p>
<p>"Bwoy!" he said loudly, "doan't 'e be deceived that way. 'Gird 'e wi' sackcloth, lament and
      howl; for the fierce anger o' the Lard is <hi>not</hi> turned back from us.' Three months o'
      righteousness is a purty bad set off 'gainst twenty years o' sin, an' it doan't become 'e to
      feel hopeful, I 'sure ye."</p>
<p>The sick man's color paled, and a certain note as of triumph in his voice died out of it.
      His mother had left them, feeling that her presence might hinder conversation and lessen the
      comfort which Mr. Tregenza had brought.</p>
<p>"I did ought to be chap-fall'n, I s'pose."</p>
<p>"Iss, you did, my son, nobody more'n you. Maybe you'll live; maybe you'll die; but keep
      humble. I doan't wish to deceive 'e. Us ain't had time to make no certainty 'bout things.
      You'm in the Lard's hand, an' it becomes 'e to sing small, an' remember what your life's
      bin."</p>
<p>The other grew uneasy and his voice faltered while he still fought for a happy eternity.</p>
<p>"I'd felt like 'twas all right arter what mother read."</p>
<p>"Not so. God's a just God 'fore everything. Theer ed'n no favorin' wi' Him. I hopes you'll
      live this many a day, Vallack; an' then, when your hour comes, you'll have piled up a tidy
      record an' can go wi' a certainty faacin' you. Seems you'm better, an' us at chapel's prayed
      hot an' strong to the Throne that you might be left to work out your salvation now your foot's
      'pon the right road."</p>
<p>"But if I dies, mister?"</p>
<p>"'The prayer of the righteous man availeth much,'" answered Gray Michael evasively. "I be
      come," he added, "to read the Scriptures to 'e."</p>
<p>"You all prayed for me, sir?"</p>
<p>"Iss, every man, but theer was no mincin' matters, Albert. Us was arskin' for a miserable
      sinner, a lost sheep awnly just strayed back, an' we put it plain as that was so."</p>
<p>"'Tweer mighty kind o' the Luke Gosp'lers, sir."</p>
<p>"'Twas their dooty. Now I be gwaine to read the Book."</p>
<p>"I feels that uneasy now," whined the sufferer, in a voice where fear spoke instead of hope,
      "but I s'pose 'tis a sign o' graace I should be?"</p>
<p>"Iss, 'tis. I've comed to tell 'e the truth, for 'tis ill as a man should be blind to facts
      on what may be his last bed 'bove the airth. Listen to this, my son, an' if theer's anything
      you doan't onderstand, arsk me an' I'll thraw light 'pon it."</p>
<p>He read, with loud, slow voice, the fifty-fifth chapter of Isaiah, and that glorious clarion
      of great promise gave Michael the lie and drowned his own religious opinions as thunder drowns
      the croaking of marsh frogs; but he knew it not. The brighter burned his own shining light,
      the blacker the shadows it threw upon the future of all sinners.</p>
<p>As Tregenza finished and put down his Bible, the other spoke and quoted eagerly:</p>
<p>"'Incline your ear an' come unto Me; fear, an' your sawl shall live!' Theer do seem a hope
      in that if it ed'n awver-bold me thinkin' so?" he asked.</p>
<p>"That's like them Church o' Englanders, a tearin' wan text away from t'others an' readin' it
      accordin' as they pleases. I'll expound it all to wance, as a God-fearin' man did ought to
      treat the Scriptures."</p>
<p>Gray Michael's exposition illustrated nothing beyond his own narrow intellectual
      limitations. His cold cloud of words obscured the prophet's sunshine, and the light went out
      of the dying man's eyes, leaving only alarm. He trembled on the brink of the horrid truth; he
      heard it thinly veiled in the other's stern utterance, saw it looking from his hard blue eyes.
      After the sermon, silence followed, broken by Vallack, who coughed once and again, then raised
      himself and braced his heart to the tremendous question that demanded answering.</p>
<p>"I wants your awn feelin' like, mister. I must have it. I caan't sleep no more wi'out
      knawin' the best or worst. You be the justest man ever I seed or heard tell on out the
      Scriptures. An' I wants 'e to gimme your opinion like. S'pose you was the Judge an' I comed
      afore 'e an' the Books was theer and you'd read 'em an' had to conclude 'pon 'em—?"</p>
<p>The fisherman reflected. Vallack's proposition did not strike him as particularly grotesque.
      He felt it was a natural question, and he only regretted that it had been put, because, though
      he had driven more than one young man to righteousness along the path of terror, in this
      present case the truth came too late save to add another horror to death. He believed in all
      sincerity that as surely as the young man before him presently died, so surely would he be
      damned, but he saw no particular object in stating the fact. Such intelligence might tell upon
      Vallack's physical condition—a thing of all others to be avoided, for Gray Michael held that
      the sufferer's only chance of a happy eternity was increased and lengthened opportunity in
      time.</p>
<p>"It ed'n for me to sit in the Judgment Seat, Albert. 'Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lard.'
      You must allus hold in mind that theer's mighty few saved alive, best o' times. Many be
      called, but few chosen. Men go down to the graave every second o' the day an' night, but if
      you could see the sawls a streamin' away, thicker'n a cloud of starlings, you'd find a mass,
      black as a storm, went down long, an' awnly just a summer cloud like o' the blessed riz up.
      Hell's bigger'n Heaven; an' er's need to be, for Heaven's like to be a lonely plaace, when
      all's said. I won't speak no more 'bout that subjec'. 'Tis good fashion weather for 'e just
      now, an us'll hope as you ban't gwaine to die for many a day."</p>
<p>"Say it out, mister, say it out. I knaws what you means. You reckons if I gaws I'm
      lost."</p>
<p>"My poor sawl, justice is justice; an' the Lard's all for justice an' no less. Theer's no
      favorin' wi' Him, Albert."</p>
<p>"But mightn't He favor the whole bilin' of us—good'n bad—cause He made us?"</p>
<p>"Surely not. Wheer's the justice o' that? If He done that, how'd the godly get their fair
      dues—eh? Be the righteous man to share God's Heaven wi' publicans an' sinners? That ed'n
      justice anyhow. Don't fret, lad; tears won't mend bad years. Bide quiet an' listen to me
      whiles I pray for 'e."</p>
<p>The man in the bed had grown very white, his eyes burned wildly out of a shrunken face, and
      he gripped the sheets and shivered in pure physical terror.</p>
<p>"I caan't die, I caan't die, not yet," he groaned, "pray to the Lard to keep me from dyin'
      yet a while, mister. Arsk en to give me just a lil time, 'cause I'm that sorry for my scarlet
      sins."</p>
<p>Thereupon Michael knelt, clasped his hands so close that the bent finger-joints grew white,
      raised his massive head upward and prayed with his eyes closed. The intercession for life
      ended, he rose up, shook Vallack by the hand, and so departed.</p>
<p>"Allus, when you've got the chance, bear the balm o' Gilead to a sinner's couch," he said to
      his daughter as they walked home. "'Tis the duty of man an' maid to spread the truth an' bring
      peace to the troubled, an' strength to the weak-hearted, an' rise up them that fall."</p>
<p>A week later Mr. Tregenza heard how Albert Vallack had burst a blood-vessel and died,
      fighting horribly with awful invisible terrors.</p>
<p>"Another sawl gone down into the Pit," he said. "I reckon fewer an' fewer be chosen every
      year as the world do grow older an' riper for the last fires."</p>
