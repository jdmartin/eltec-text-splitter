<head>FAIRY STORIES</head>
<p>Joan found her sketch waiting for her the next day when she reached Gorse Point about eleven
      o'clock; and she also discovered John Barron with a large canvas before him. He had
      constructed his picture and already made many drawings for it. Now he knew exactly what he
      wanted, and he designed to paint Joan standing looking out at a distant sea which would be far
      behind the spectator of the picture. When she arrived, on a fine morning and mild, Barron rose
      from his camp-stool, lifted up a little canvas which stood framed at his side and presented it
      to her. The sketch in oils of the "Anna" was cleverer than Joan could possibly know, but she
      took no small delight in it and in the setting of rough deal brightly gilded.</p>
<p>"Sure 'tis truly good of 'e, sir!"</p>
<p>"You are more than welcome. Only let me say one word, Joan. Keep your picture hidden away
      until Joe comes back from sea and marries you. From what you tell me, your father might not
      like you to have this trifle, and I should be very sorry to annoy him."</p>
<p>"I waddun' gwaine to show en," she confessed. "I shall store the picksher away as you
      sez."</p>
<p>"You are wise. Now look here, doesn't this promise to be a big affair? The gorse will be
      nearly as large as life, and I've been wondering ever so long what I shall put in the middle;
      and whatever do you think I've thought of?"</p>
<p>"I dunnaw. That white pony us saw, p'raps?"</p>
<p>"No; something much prettier. How would it do, d'you think, if <hi>you</hi> stood here in
      front of the gorse, just to fill up the middle piece of the picture?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, no! My faither—"</p>
<p>"You misunderstand, Joan. I don't want a picture of <hi>you</hi>, you know; I'm going to
      paint the gorse. But if you just stood here, you'd make a sort of contrast with your brown
      frock. Not a portrait at all, only just a figure to help the color. Besides, you mustn't think
      I'm an artist, I shouldn't go selling the picture or hanging it up for everybody to stare at
      it. I'm certain your father wouldn't mind, and I'll tell him all about it afterward, if you
      like."</p>
<p>She hesitated and reflected with trouble in her eyes, while Barron quietly took the picture
      he had brought her and wrapped it up in a piece of paper. His object was to remind her without
      appearing to do so of her obligation to him, and Joan was clever enough to take the hint,
      though not clever enough to see that it was an intentional one.</p>
<p>"Would it be a long job, sir?" she asked at length.</p>
<p>"Yes, it would; because I'm a slow painter and rather stupid. But I should think it very,
      very kind of you. I'm not strong, you know, and I daresay this is the last picture I shall
      ever paint."</p>
<p>"You ed'n strong, sir?"</p>
<p>"Not at all."</p>
<p>She was silent, and a great sympathy rose in her girl's heart, for frail health always made
      her sad.</p>
<p>"You don't judge 'tis wrong then for a maiden to be painted in a picksher?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not, Joan. I should never suggest such a thing to you if I thought it was in the
      least wrong. I <hi>know</hi> it isn't wrong."</p>
<p>"I seed you issterday," she said, changing the subject suddenly, "but you dedn see me, did
      'e?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did, and your father. He is a grand-looking man. By the way, Joan, I think I never
      told you my name. I'm called John; that's short and simple, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Mister Jan," she said.</p>
<p>"No, not 'mister'—just 'Jan,'" he answered, adopting her pronunciation. "I don't call you
      'Miss' Joan."</p>
<p>She looked at once uncomfortable and pleased.</p>
<p>"We must be friends," the man continued calmly, "now you have promised to let me put you
      here among the gorse bushes."</p>
<p>"Sure, I dunnaw 'bout the picksher, Mister Jan."</p>
<p>"Well, you would be doing me a great service. I want to paint you very much and I think you
      will be kind."</p>
<p>He looked into her eyes with a steady, inquiring glance, and Joan experienced a new emotion.
      Joe had never looked like that; nor yet her father. She felt a will stronger than her own was
      busy with her inclinations. Volition remained free, and yet she doubted whether under any
      circumstances could she refuse his petition. As it happened, however, she already liked the
      man. He was so respectful and polite. Moreover, she felt sad to hear that he suffered in
      health. He would not ask her to do wrong and she felt certain that she might trust him. A
      trembling wish and a longing to comply with his request already mastered her mind.</p>
<p>"You'm sure—gospel truth—theer ed'n no harm in it?"</p>
<p>"Trust me."</p>
<p>In five minutes he had posed her as he wished and was drawing, while every word he spoke put
      Joan more at her ease. The spice of adventure and secrecy fired her and she felt the spirit of
      romance in her blood, though she knew no name for it. Here was a secret delight knocking at
      the gray threshold of every-day life—an adventure which might last for many days.</p>
<p>Barron, to touch the woman in her if he could, harped upon her gown and the color of it, on
      her shoes and sun-bonnet—on everything but herself. Presently he reaped his reward.</p>
<p>"Ban't you gwaine to paint my faace as well, Mister Jan."</p>
<p>"Yes, if I can. But your eyes are blue, and blue eyes are hard to paint well. Yours are so
      very blue, Joan. Didn't Joe ever tell you that?"</p>
<p>"No—that's all fulishness."</p>
<p>"Nothing that's true is foolish. Now I'm going to make some little sketches of you, so as to
      get each fold and shadow in your dress right."</p>
<p>Barron drew rapidly, and Joan—ever ready to talk to a willing listener when her confidence
      was won—prattled on, turning the conversation as usual to the matters she loved. Upon her
      favorite subjects she dared not open her mouth at home, and even her lover refused to listen
      to the legends of the land, but they were part of the girl's life notwithstanding, drawn into
      her blood from her mother, a thousand times more real and precious than even the promised
      heaven of Luke Gospeldom, not to be wholly smothered at any time. Occasionally, indeed, uneasy
      fears that discussion of such concerns was absolutely sinful kept her dumb for a week, then
      the religious wave swept on, and Cornish folk-lore, with its splendor and romance, again
      filled her heart and bubbled from her lips. Her little stories pleased Barron mightily.
      Excitement heightened Joan's beauty. Her absolute innocence at the age of seventeen struck him
      as remarkable. It seemed curious that a child born in a cottage, where realities and facts are
      apt to roughly front boy and girl alike, should know so little. She was a beautiful, primitive
      creature, with strange store of fairy fable in her mind; a treasury which brought color and
      joy into life. So she prattled, and the man painted.</p>
<p>Pure artistic interest filled Barron's brain at this season; not a shadow of passion made
      his pencil shaky or his eye dim; he began to learn the girl with as little emotion as he had
      learned the gorse. He asked her to unfasten the top button of her dress that he might see the
      lines of her plump throat, and she complied without hesitation or ceasing from her chatter. He
      noted where the tan on her neck faded to white under her dress, and occupied himself with all
      the artistic problems she unconsciously spread before him; while she merely talked, garnered
      in his questions and comments on all she said, and found delight in the apparent interest and
      entertainment her conversation afforded him.</p>
<p>"I seed a maggotty-pie [Footnote: <hi>Maggotty-pie</hi>—Magpie.] comin' along this marnin',"
      she said. "Wan's bad an' a sign o' sorrer; but if you spits twice over your left shoulder it
      doan't matter so much. But I be better off than many maidens, 'cause I be saint-protected
      like."</p>
<p>"That's interesting, Joan."</p>
<p>"Faither'd be mad if I let on 'bout it to him, so I doesn't. He doan't b'lieve much in dead
      saints, though Carnwall's full of 'em. Have 'e heard tell 'bout Saint Madern?"</p>
<p>"Ah, the saint of the well?"</p>
<p>"Iss, an' the brook as runs by the Madern chapel."</p>
<p>"I sketched the little ruin of the baptistery some time ago."</p>
<p>"'Twas tho't a deal of wance, an' the holy water theer was reckoned better for childern than
      any doctor's traade as ever was. My mother weer a Madern cheel; an' 'er ordained I should be
      as well, an' when faither was to sea, as fell out just 'pon the right day, mother took me up
      theer. That was my awn mother as is dead. More folks b'lieved in the spring then than what do
      now, 'cause that was sebenteen year agone. An' from bein' a puny cheel I grawed a bonny wan
      arter dipping. But some liked the crick-stone better for lil baabies than even the Madern
      brook."</p>
<p>"Mên-an-tol that stone is called?"</p>
<p>"So 'tis, awnly us knaws it as the crick-stone. Theer's a big hole in en, an' if a cheel was
      passed through nine times runnin', gwaine 'gainst the way of the sun every time, it made en as
      strong as a lion. An' 'tis good for grawn people tu, awnly folks is afeared to try now 'cause
      t'others laugh at en. But I reckon the Madern brook's holy water still. An' theer's wonnerful
      things said 'bout the crick-stones an' long stones tu. A many of 'em stands round 'bout these
      paarts."</p>
<p>"D'you know Mên Scryfa—the stone with the writing on it? That's a famous long stone, up
      beyond Lanyon Farmhouse."</p>
<p>"I've seed en, 'pon the heath. 'Tis butivul an' solemn an' still, all aloan out theer in a
      croft to itself. I trapsed up-long wan day an' got beside of en an' ate a pasty wi' Joe. But
      Joe chid me, an' said 'tweer a heathenish thing sticked theer by the Phoenicians, as comed for
      tin in Solomon's times."</p>
<p>"Don't you believe that, Joan. Mên Scryfa marks the memory of a good Briton—one who knew
      King Arthur, very likely. I love the old stones too. You are right to love them. They are
      landmarks in time, books from which we may read something of a far, fascinating past." </p>
<p>"Iss, but I ded'n tell 'e all 'bout the Madern waters. The best day for 'em be the fust
      Sunday in May; an' come that, the mothers did use to gaw up to the chapel—dozens of 'em—wi'
      poor lil baabies. They dipped 'em naked in the brook, an' 'twas just a miracle for rashes and
      braggety legs and sich like. An', arterward, the mothers made offerin's to the saint. 'Twas
      awnly the thot like, but folks reckoned the saint 'ud take the will for the act, 'cause poor
      people couldn' give a saint nothin' worth namin'."</p>
<p>Barren had heard of the votive offerings left by the faithful in past days at St. Madron's
      shrine, but felt somewhat surprised to find the practice dated back to a time so recent as
      Joan's infancy. He let her talk on, for the subject was evidently dear to the girl.</p>
<p>"And what did the mothers give the saint?"</p>
<p>"Why, rags mostly. Just a rag tored off a petticoat, or some sich thing. They hanged 'em up
      around about on the thorn bushes to shaw as they'd a done more for the good saint if they'd
      had the power. An' theer's another marvelous thing as washin' in thicky waters done: it kep'
      the fairies off—the bad fairies, I mean. 'Cause theer'm gude an' bad piskeys, same as gude an'
      bad men folks."</p>
<p>"You believe in fairies, Joan?"</p>
<p>She looked at him shyly, but he had apparently asked for information and was not in the
      least amused.</p>
<p>"I dunnaw. P'raps. Iss, I do, then! Many wiser'n me do b'lieve in 'em. You arsk the
      tinners—them as works deep. They knaws; they've 'eard the knackers an' gathorns many a time,
      an' some's seen 'em. But the mine fairies be mostly wicked lil humpetty-backed twoads as'll do
      harm if they can; an' the buccas is onkind to fishermen most times; an' 'tis said they used to
      bide in the shape of a cat by day. But theer be land fairies as is mighty good-hearted if a
      body behaves seemly."</p>
<p>"I believe in the fairies too," said Barren gravely, "but I've never seen one."</p>
<p>"Do 'e now, Mister Jan! Then I'm sure theer is sich things. I ne'er seed wan neither; but
      I'd love to. Some maids has vanished away an' dwelt 'mong 'em for many days an' then comed
      home. Theer's Robin o' the Carn as had a maiden to work for en. You may have heard the
      tale?"</p>
<p>"No, never."</p>
<p>"'Tis a fine tale; an' the gal had a braave time 'mongst the lil people till she disobeyed
      'em an' found herself back 'mongst men folk agin. But in coorse some of them—the piskeys, I
      mean—works for men folk themselves. My gran'mother Chirgwin, when she was very auld, seed 'em
      a threshin' corn in a barn up Drift. They was tiny fellers wi' beards an' red faaces, an' they
      handled the flails cruel clever. Then, arter a bit, they done the threshin' an' was kickin'
      the short straw out the grain, which riz a gert dust; an' the piskeys all beginned sneezin'.
      An' my gran'mother, as was peepin' through the door unbeknown to 'em, forgot you must never
      speak to a piskey, an' sez, 'God bless 'e, hi men!' 'cause that's what us allus sez if a body
      sneezes. Then they all took fright an' vanished away in the twinkle of a eye. Which must be
      true, 'cause my awn gran'mother tawld it. But they ded'n leave the farm, though nobody seed
      'em again, for arter that 'tis said as the cows gived a wonnerful shower o' milk, better'n
      ever was knawn before. An' I 'sure 'e I'd dearly like to be maiden to good piskeys if they'd
      let me work for 'em."</p>
<p>"Ah, I'm certain you would suit them well, Joan; and they would be lucky to get you, I
      think; but I hope they won't go and carry you off until I've done with you, at any rate."</p>
<p>She laughed, and he bid her put down her hand from her eyes and rest. He had brought some
      oranges for her, but judged the friendship had gone far enough, and first decided not to
      produce them. Half an hour later, however, when the sitting was ended, he changed his
      mind.</p>
<p>"Can you come to-morrow, Joan? I am entirely in your hands, remember, and must consider your
      convenience always. In fact, I am your servant and shall wait your pleasure at all times."</p>
<p>Joan felt proud and rather important.</p>
<p>"I'll come at 'leben o'clock to-morrow, but I doubt I caan't be here next day, Mister
      Jan."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much. To-morrow at eleven will do splendidly. By the way, I have an orange
      here—two, in fact. I thought we might be thirsty. Will you take one to eat going home?"</p>
<p>He held out the fruit and she took it.</p>
<p>"My! What a butivul orange!"</p>
<p>"Good-by until to-morrow, Joan; and thank you for your great kindness to a very friendless
      man. You'll never be sorry for it, I'm sure."</p>
<p>He bowed gravely and took off his cap, then turned to his easel; and she blushed with a
      lively pleasure. She had seen gentlemen take off their hats to ladies, but no man had ever
      paid her that respect until then, and it seemed good to her. She marched off with her picture
      and her orange, but did not eat the fruit until out of sight of Gorse Point.</p>
<p>The man painting there already began to fill a space in Joan's thoughts. He knew so much and
      yet was glad to learn from her. He never laughed or talked lightly. He put her in mind of her
      father for that reason, but then his heart was soft, and he loved Nature and beautiful things,
      and believed in fairies and spoke no ill of anybody. Joan speculated as to how these meetings
      could be kept a secret and came to the conclusion it would not be difficult to hide them.
      Then, reaching home, she hid her picture behind the pig-sty until opportunity offered for
      taking it indoors to her own bedroom unobserved.</p>
<p>As for John Barren, he felt kindly enough toward his model. He could hold himself with an
      iron hand when he pleased, and proposed that the growing friendship should ripen into a fine
      work of art and no more. But what might go to the making of the picture could not be foretold.
      He would certainly allow nothing to check inspiration or stand between him and the very best
      he had power to achieve. No sacrifice could be too great for Art, and Barron, who was now
      awake and alive for an achievement, would, according to his rule, count nothing hard, nothing
      impossible that might add a grain of value to the work. His own skill and Joan's beauty were
      brought in contact and he meant to do everything a man might do to make the result immortal.
      But the human instruments necessary to such work counted for nothing, and their personal
      prosperity and welfare would weigh no more with him than the future of the brushes which he
      might use, after he had done with them.</p>
