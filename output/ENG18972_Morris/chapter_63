<p>Chapter V ~ They Come Home to the Castle of the Quest</p>
<p>Now they had gone but some three hours, riding dreary and nigh speechless all of them, ere
      they began to know the land they were in, and that they were coming to the place where they
      might look presently to fall in with Sir Aymeris and his company; and even so the meeting
      betid, that they saw men standing and going about their horses beside a little wood, and knew
      them presently for their folk, who mounted at once and spurred forward to meet them, spears
      aloft. Speedily then was the joy of those abiders turned into sorrow, nor may the grief of Sir
      Aymeris be told, so great it was; and Birdalone looked on and saw the mourning and lamentation
      of the warriors, and eked was her anguish of mind; and she beheld Arthur the Black Squire, how
      he sat still upon his horse with a hard and dreary countenance, and looked on those mourners
      almost as if he contemned them. But Sir Aymeris came up to Birdalone, and knelt before her and
      kissed her hand, and said: If my heart might rejoice in aught, as some day it will, it would
      rejoice in seeing thee safe and sound, lady; here at least is gain to set beside the loss.</p>
<p>She thanked him, but looked askance toward Arthur, who said: If that be gain, yet is there
      more, for the Red Knight lieth in the green plain for a supper to the wolf and the crow.
      Vengeance there hath been, and belike more yet may come. But now, if ye have lamented as much
      as ye deem befitteth warriors, let us tarry here no longer; for even yet meseemeth shall we be
      safer behind walls, now that our chief and captain is slain, I scarce know in what
      quarrel.</p>
<p>None naysaid it, so they all rode forth together, and the sergeant and the squire and Sir
      Hugh told of their tale what they might to Sir Aymeris and the others; but Arthur held his
      peace, and rode aloof from Birdalone, whereas Sir Aymeris and Hugh rode on either side of her,
      and did not spare to comfort her what they might.</p>
<p>They rode straight on, and made no stay for nightfall, and thus came home to the Castle of
      the Quest before the day was full; and woeful was their entry as they went in the dawn
      underneath the gate of the said castle, and soon was the whole house astir and lamenting.</p>
<p>As for Birdalone, when she got down from her horse in the gateway, and was stiff and weary
      of body, and all dazed and confused of mind, there was but little life in her; nor could she
      so much as think of the new day and Aureaâ€™s awakening, but crept up unto her own chamber, so
      long as it seemed since she had left it, though it was but a little while; and she cast
      herself upon the bed and fell asleep whether she would or not, and so forgat her much sorrow
      and her little hope.</p>
