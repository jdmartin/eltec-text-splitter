<t:l>“Yet to be loved makes not to love again;</t:l>
<t:l>Not at my years, however it hold in youth.”</t:l>
<t:p>Tennyson.</t:p>
</t:quote>
<t:p>The cathedral was crammed. The tall slender arches seemed to spring out of a vast sea of
     human heads. The orchestra and chorus had gradually merged into one person: one shout of
     praise, one voice of prayer, one wail of terror. The <t:hi>Elijah</t:hi> was in mid-career, sailing
     like a man-of-war upon the rushing waves of music.</t:p>
<t:pb n="10"/>
<t:p>And presently there was a hush, and out of the hush a winged voice arose, as a lark rises out
     of a meadow, singing as it rises:</t:p>
<t:p>“O rest in the Lord, wait patiently for Him, and He shall give thee thy heart's desire.”</t:p>
<t:p>The lark dropped into its nest again. The music swept thundering upon its way, and a large
     tear fell unnoticed from a young girl's eyes on to the bare slim hand which held her score. The
     score quivered; the slender willowy figure quivered in its setting of palest violet and white
     draperies threaded with silver. Only a Frenchwoman could have dared to translate a child's posy
     of pale blue and white violets, tied with a silver string, into a gown; but Sibyl Carruthers'
     dressmaker was an artist in her way, and took an artist's
     <t:pb n="11"/> license, and the half-mourning which she had designed for the great heiress was in
     colouring what a bereaved butterfly might have worn.</t:p>
<t:p>Miss Carruthers was called beautiful. Perhaps she was beautiful for an heiress, but she was
     certainly not, in reality, any prettier than many hundreds of dowerless girls who had never
     been considered more than good-looking.</t:p>
<t:p>Her delicate features were too irregular, in spite of their obvious high breeding; her figure
     was too slight; her complexion was too faintly tinted for regular beauty. But she had something
     of the evanescent charm of a four-petalled dog-rose newly blown—exquisite, ethereal, but as if
     it might fall in a moment. This aspect of fragility was heightened by what women noticed about
     her first, namely, her gossamer
     <t:pb n="12"/> gown with its silver gleam, and by what men noticed about her first—her gray eyes,
     pathetic, eager, shy by turns, always lovely, but hinting of a sword too sharp for its slender
     sheath, of an ardent spirit whose grasp on this world was too slight.</t:p>
<t:p>And as the music passed over her young untried soul, she sat motionless, her hands clasping
     the score. She heard nothing of it, but it accompanied the sudden tempest of passion which was
     shaking her, as wind accompanies storm.</t:p>
<t:p>The voice of the song had stirred an avalanche of emotion.</t:p>
<t:p>“And I will give thee thy heart's desire.”</t:p>
<t:p>She knew nothing about waiting patiently, but her heart's desire—she must have it. She could
     not live without it. Her whole soul went out in an agony of prayer to the God who gives and who
     <t:pb n="13"/>withholds to accord her this one petition—to <t:hi>be his wife</t:hi>. She repeated it
     over and over again. To be near him, to see him day by day—nothing else, nothing else! This one
     thing, without which, poor child! she thought she could not live. It seemed to Sibyl that she
     was falling at God's feet in the whirlwind, and refusing to let Him go until He granted her
     prayer. But would He grant it? Her heart sank. Despair rushed in upon her like a flood at the
     bare thought of its refusal, and she caught yet again at the only hope left to her—a desperate
     appeal to the God who gives and who withholds.</t:p>
<t:p>Presently it was all over, and they were going out.</t:p>
<t:p>“We were to wait for the others here,” said Peggy, the girl who had been sitting with Sibyl,
     as they emerged into the sun
     <t:pb n="14"/>shine with the crowd. “Mother and Mr. Doll were just behind us.”</t:p>
<t:p>Lady Pierpoint, Sibyl's aunt, presently joined them with Mr. Doll Loftus, an
     irreproachable-looking, unapproachable-looking fair young man, who, it was whispered, was
     almost too smart to live, but who nevertheless bore himself with severe simplicity.</t:p>
<t:p>He went up to Sibyl with some diffidence.</t:p>
<t:p>“You are tired,” he said anxiously.</t:p>
<t:p>Doll's remarks were considered <t:hi>banal</t:hi> in the extreme by some women, but others who
     admired fair hair and pathetic eyes found a thoughtful beauty in them.</t:p>
<t:p>It would be difficult from her manner to infer which class of sentiments this particular
     remark awoke in Sibyl.</t:p>
<t:p>“Music always tires me,” she replied,
     <t:pb n="15"/> without looking at him, dropping her white eyelids.</t:p>
<t:p>“Are we all here?” said Lady Pierpoint. “Peggy, and Sibyl—my dear, how tired you look!—and
     myself, and you, Mr. Doll; that is only four, and "we are seven." Ah! here come Mr. and Mrs.
     Cathcart. Now we only want Mr. Loftus.”</t:p>
<t:p>“The Dean caught him in the doorway,” said Doll. “He is coming now.”</t:p>
<t:p>The tall thin figure of an elder man was slowly crossing the angular patch of sunshine where
     the cathedral had not cast its great shadow. The nobility of his bearing seemed to appeal to
     the crowd. They made way for him instinctively, as if he were some distinguished personage. He
     was accompanied by a robust clerical figure with broad calves.</t:p>
<t:p>“Mr. Loftus makes everyone else look
     <t:pb n="16"/>common,” said Peggy plaintively. “It is the only unkind thing I know about him. I
     thought the Dean quite dignified-looking while we were at luncheon at the Deanery, but now he
     looks like a pork-butcher. I'm not going to walk within ten yards of Mr. Loftus, mummy, or I
     shall be taken for a parlourmaid having her day out. I think, Sibyl, you are the only one who
     can afford to go with him.”</t:p>
<t:p>But Doll thought differently, and it was he and Sibyl who walked the short distance to the
     station together through the flag-decked streets in the brilliant September sunshine. People
     turned to glance at them as they passed. They made a striking-looking couple. Mr. Loftus,
     following slowly at a little distance with Lady Pierpoint, looked affectionately at the back of
     his young cousin, who was
     <t:pb n="17"/> also his heir, and said to her, with a smile:</t:p>
<t:p>“I wish it could be. Doll is a good fellow.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I wish indeed it could,” said Lady Pierpoint earnestly, with the slight slackening of
     reserve which is often observable in the atmosphere on the last afternoon of a visit with a
     purpose.</t:p>
<t:p>Lady Pierpoint had not come to spend a whole week with a Sunday in it with Mr. Loftus at
     Wilderleigh for nothing. And she was aware that neither had she and her niece and daughter been
     invited for that long period without a cause. But the week ended with the following morning,
     and she sighed. She had daughters of her own coming on, as well as her dear snub-nosed Peggy,
     who was already out, and it was natural to wish that the re
     <t:pb n="18"/>sponsibility of this delicate, emotional creature, with her great wealth, might be
     taken from her and placed in safe hands. She thought Doll was safe. Perhaps the wish was
     father, or rather <t:hi>aunt</t:hi>, to the thought. But it was no doubt the truest epithet that
     could be applied to the young man. It was a matter of opinion whether he was exhaustingly dull
     in conversation or extraordinarily interesting, but he certainly was safe. He belonged to that
     class of our latter-day youth of whom it may be predicted, with some confidence, that they will
     never cause their belongings a moment's uneasiness; who may be trusted never to do anything
     very right or very wrong; who will get on tolerably well in any position, and with any woman,
     provided there are means to support it and—<t:hi>her</t:hi>; who have enough worldliness to marry
     <t:pb n="19"/> money, and enough good feeling to make irreproachable husbands afterwards; in
     short, the kind of young men who are invented by Providence on purpose to marry heiresses, and
     who, if they fall below their vocation, dwindle, when their youth is over, into the padded
     impecunious bores of society.</t:p>
<t:p>There was a short journey by rail through the hop country. Sibyl watched the rows of hops in
     silence. Cowardice has its sticking-point as well as courage, and she was undergoing the
     miserable preliminary tremors by which that point is reached. Mr. Loftus, sitting opposite her,
     and observing her fixity of gaze, glanced at her rather wistfully from time to time. He saw
     something was working in her mind. He looked tired, and in the strong afternoon light his
     grave, lined
     <t:pb n="20"/> face seemed more worn and world-weary than ever. He had the look of a man who had
     long outlived all personal feeling, and who to-day had been remembering his youth.</t:p>
<t:p>The Wilderleigh omnibus and Doll's spider-wheeled dogcart were waiting at the little roadside
     station, which was so small that the train very nearly overlooked it, and had to be backed.
     Doll was already holding the wheel to protect Sibyl's gown as she got up, and looking towards
     her, and Lady Pierpoint was hurrying Peggy, who had expressed a hankering after the dogcart,
     into the omnibus, when Mr. Loftus observed that he thought he would walk up.</t:p>
<t:p>Sibyl's face changed.</t:p>
<t:p>“May I walk up with you?” she asked instantly.</t:p>
<t:pb n="21"/>
<t:p>Mr. Loftus looked disappointed; everybody looked disappointed. Lady Pierpoint put her head
     out, and said:</t:p>
<t:p>“My dear child, the drive in the open air will refresh you; you are looking tired.”</t:p>
<t:p>“May I go in the dogcart if Sibyl doesn't want to?” put in Peggy in an audible aside to her
     mother.</t:p>
<t:p>“I think you are tired,” said Mr. Loftus, looking at Sibyl and shaking his head. “And,” he
     added in a lower voice, “Doll will be much disappointed.”</t:p>
<t:p>A faint colour covered her face, which quivered as she turned it towards him.</t:p>
<t:p>“Let me walk up with you,” she said again, with a tremor in her voice.</t:p>
<t:p>He met her appealing eyes with gentle scrutiny.</t:p>
<t:p>“It is not far,” he said aloud; “not more than half a mile through the park. I will
     <t:pb n="22"/> take care of her, Lady Pierpoint. We shall be at Wilderleigh almost as soon as you
     are.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Oh, mummy, may I go in the dogcart <t:hi>now</t:hi>?” implored Peggy from the depths of the
     omnibus.</t:p>
<t:p>And Mr. Loftus and Sibyl set out together.</t:p>
<t:p>They were in the park in a few minutes, and were walking down towards Wilderleigh, on the
     opposite side of the river, an old house of weather-beaten gray stone, of twisted chimneys and
     uneven roofs and pointed gables, with quaint carved finials, standing above its terraces and
     its long stone balustrade. The sun was setting in a sky of daffodil behind the tall top-heavy
     elms of the rookery and the tower of the village church. Little fleets of clouds lay motionless
     in high heaven, looking towards
     <t:pb n="23"/> the west. The land in its long shadows dreamed of peace. The old house beyond the
     river was in shadow already. So was the river.</t:p>
<t:p>“Sometimes,” said Mr. Loftus to himself, “a young girl feels more able to confide in an old
     friend than a relation. She has often talked to me before. Perhaps she is going to do so
     again.” And he felt comforted about Doll and the dogcart.</t:p>
<t:p>Presently as he glanced at her, wondering at her continued silence, he saw that she was
     greatly agitated.</t:p>
<t:p>“Something troubles you,” he said gently.</t:p>
<t:p>She looked at him half in terror, as if deprecating his anger.</t:p>
<t:p>They were walking down a narrow ride in the tall bracken. A trunk of a tree lay near the path
     among the yellowing fern.</t:p>
<t:pb n="24"/>
<t:p>He led her to it and sat down by her, looking at her with painful anxiety and with a sense of
     growing fatigue. Emotion of any kind exhausted him. If it had not been for Doll, he would have
     dropped the subject, but for his sake he made an effort.</t:p>
<t:p>“Tell me,” he said, and he took her thin young hand and held it in his thin older hand. It
     was the last afternoon; both were conscious of it.</t:p>
<t:p>She trembled very much, but she did not speak. His heart sank.</t:p>
<t:p>“You wish to tell me something about Doll, perhaps,” he said at last. “Do not be afraid of
     paining me by talking of it. You like him, perhaps, but not enough, and you are grieved because
     you see how much he loves you. Is that it?”</t:p>
<t:p>“I don't like him,” gasped Sibyl. “I have
     <t:pb n="25"/> never thought about it. That is only Aunt Marion.”</t:p>
<t:p>Mr. Loftus sighed, and his gray cheek blanched a little. He had built much on the hope of
     this marriage. He had a tender regard for Sibyl, whose emotional and impulsive nature appealed
     to him, and filled him with apprehension as for a butterfly in a manufactory, which may injure
     itself any moment. And he knew Doll was genuinely in love with her. It would be grievous if she
     were married for her money. And Wilderleigh was dying stone by stone and acre by acre for want
     of that money.</t:p>
<t:p>As he looked mournfully at Sibyl, an expression came into her wide eyes like that which he
     had seen in the eyes of some timid wild animal brought to bay. He recognised that, like a shy
     bird near its
     <t:pb n="26"/> nest, she was defending in impotent despair of broken white wings something which
     was part of her life, which was going from her, which <t:hi>he</t:hi> was taking away.</t:p>
<t:p>“It is you I love,” she said, and her small hand ceased trembling and became cold in his.</t:p>
<t:p>For a moment both were stunned alike, and then some of the grayness of age and suffering
     crept suddenly from his face to hers as she felt his hand involuntarily slacken its clasp of
     hers.</t:p>
<t:p>“My child,” he said at last, with great difficulty and with greater tenderness, “it is very
     many years since I gave up all thought of marriage. I am old enough to be your——” He might have
     said “grandfather” with truth. He meant to say it, but as he approached the word he could not
     wound her with it.</t:p>
<t:pb n="27"/>
<t:p>“I know,” she interrupted hurriedly. “I don't mind. That is nothing to me.”</t:p>
<t:p>“And my life,” he said, “what little there is left of it, hangs by a thread.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I know,” she said again—“I have thought of that. I have thought of nothing but you since I
     first met you a year ago. But if I might only love and serve you and be with you! And I am so
     rich, too. If I might only take away those money troubles which you once spoke of long ago! If
     I might only give you everything I have! The money is the smallest part of it—oh, such a
     little, little part compared to——” And she looked imploringly at him.</t:p>
<t:p>He was deeply moved.</t:p>
<t:p>“My child,” he said again, and the ominous repetition of the word shook her fragile edifice
     of hopes to its brittle
     <t:pb n="28"/> foundation, “you have always looked upon me as a friend, have you not?”</t:p>
<t:p>She shook her head.</t:p>
<t:p>“Well, then,” he added, correcting himself, “as one who cared for and understood you, and
     whose earnest wish was to see you happy?”</t:p>
<t:p>She did not answer.</t:p>
<t:p>He had known difficult hours, but none more difficult than this. He felt as if he were trying
     with awkward hands to hold a butterfly without injuring it, in order to release it from the
     pane of glass against which it was beating its butterfly heart out.</t:p>
<t:p>“To see you happy,” he went on, with authority as well as tenderness in his level voice. “I
     should never see that; I should have no real”—he hesitated—“affection for you at all if I
     allowed you to make
     <t:pb n="29"/> such a woeful mistake in your early youth before you know what love and life are.
     They are terrible things, Sibyl; I have known them. This beautiful generous feeling which you
     have for me is not love, and I should be base indeed to allow you to wreck your life upon it,
     your youth upon the rock of my age. You offer you know not what; you would sacrifice you know
     not what.” He smiled gravely at her, endeavouring to soothe her growing agitation. “It would be
     like taking the Koh-i-Noor out of the hand of a child. I could not do it.”</t:p>
<t:p>Her mind was in too great a tumult wholly to understand him, but one thing was clear to her,
     namely, that he was refusing to marry her. She snatched her hands out of his, and, starting
     wildly to her feet with an inarticulate cry, ran a
     <t:pb n="30"/> short distance and flung herself down on her face among the bracken.</t:p>
<t:p>He looked after her, but he did not follow her. He could do no more, and a sense of
     exhaustion and distress was upon him. He had been clumsy. He had hurt the poor butterfly, after
     all.</t:p>
<t:p>He sat a long time on the tree-trunk, the low sunshine on his worn, patient face, on which
     the refinement of suffering and of thought had set their indelible stamp. And now the thin high
     features wore a new look of present distress over the old outlived troubles, a new look which
     anyone who really loved him would have been heart-stricken to have called into it. But when
     love ceases to wound its object, and bears its own cross, it has ceased to be young.</t:p>
<t:p>As he sat motionless the sun sank.
     <t:pb n="31"/> Far in the amber west the heavens had opened in an agony of glory. The knotted
     arms of the great oaks, upraised like those of Moses and his brethren, shone red as flame
     against the darkness of the forest. The first hint of chill after the great heat came into the
     still air.</t:p>
<t:p>Mr. Loftus rose and went slowly towards the prostrate figure in its delicate gleaming
     gown.</t:p>
<t:p>“Sibyl,” he said gently, but with authority, “you must get up. I see Doll and your cousin
     coming up the glade to meet us.”</t:p>
<t:p>Sibyl started violently and raised herself, turning a white, hopeless face towards him. Her
     entire self-abandonment, which would have brought acute humiliation to another woman, brought
     none to her. Her despair
     <t:pb n="32"/> was too complete to admit of any other feeling.</t:p>
<t:p>“Like a child's,” he thought, as he looked at her sorrowing.</t:p>
<t:p>He helped her to smooth her gown, and he set her hat straight, and took some pieces of dried
     bracken out of her crumpled shining hair. She let him do it, neither helping nor hindering him.
     She evidently did not care what impression might be made on the minds of the two young people
     leisurely approaching them. She would have lain on the ground if it had been a bog instead of
     dry turf until the ice fit of despair had passed. His thoughtfulness for her, and the ashen
     tint of his face, were nothing to her, any more than the moonshine is to the child who has
     cried for the moon and has been denied it.</t:p>
<t:pb n="33"/>
<t:p>At Mr. Loftus's bidding they went slowly to meet the others.</t:p>
<t:p>“Doll,” said Mr. Loftus, lingering behind as Peggy and Sibyl walked on together, “give me
     your arm. I feel ill.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Won't she have me?” said Doll, biting his lip.</t:p>
<t:p>“No, my poor boy, she won't.”</t:p>
<t:pb n="34"/>
