<t:p>Many persons prophesied that the marriage between Mr. Loftus and Sibyl would not take place,
     but it did.</t:p>
<t:p>On a burning day late in July they were married in London, for Sibyl's country place, where
     Mr. Loftus had hoped the wedding might have taken place, was shut up.</t:p>
<t:p>Lady Pierpoint did all in her power to
     <t:pb n="80"/> make the wedding a quiet one, for his sake. Very few invitations were sent out,
     and there was no reception afterwards. But, nevertheless, though the season was at its last
     gasp, when the day came the unfashionable London church was crammed with that “smart” world,
     half of which had condemned Mr. Loftus, while it showered invitations upon him.</t:p>
<t:p>Many hundreds of eyes were fixed upon his stately feeble figure as he moved slowly forward to
     place himself beside the young girl, whose emotion was plainly visible, and whose bouquet shook
     in her hand. The contrast between the two, as they stood together, was of that glaring
     description which appeals to the vulgar and conventional mind, on which shades of difference
     are lost.</t:p>
<t:p>Mr. Loftus went through the ceremony
     <t:pb n="81"/> with equanimity. His grave face betrayed nothing except fatigue and the fact that
     he was suffering from a severe headache. Lady Pierpoint and Doll watched him with anxiety,
     while Peggy, standing close behind the bride, wept silently, she knew not why.</t:p>
<t:p>“Oh, mummy,” she said afterwards when it was all over, and Sibyl, anxious, preoccupied, had
     left Lady Pierpoint and Peggy and Molly, who had been mother and sisters to her, without a
     tear, without a regret, without a backward look, absorbed in the one fact that Mr. Loftus was
     ill—“oh, mummy, you say Sibyl loves him so much. Is that why she did not mind going away from
     all of us a bit? I know he had a headache, but she never used to mind when you had a headache,
     and when she was ill, do you remember how she
     <t:pb n="82"/> always sent for you, even when I told her you were resting? And yet she used to be
     a little fond of us. But since he came she does not seem to care for us any more. If one loves
     anybody, does one forget the others?”</t:p>
<t:p>“Some women do,” said Lady Pierpoint, taking Peggy's red, tear-stained face in her hands and
     kissing it. She could not bear to own, even to Peggy, how wounded her warm maternal heart had
     been because Sibyl, whose delicacy had given her so many anxious hours, had shown no feeling at
     parting with her. Mr. Loftus had shown much more, when he had come to speak to her alone for a
     few minutes in her sitting-room, when the carriage was at the door.</t:p>
<t:p>“Some women,” said Lady Pierpoint, looking wistfully at her daughter, “forget
     <t:pb n="83"/> everyone else when they marry, and are very proud of it. They think it shows how
     devoted they are. A little cup is soon full, Peggy, and a shallow heart, if it takes in a new
     love, has no room left for the old ones. The new love is like the cuckoo in the nest—it elbows
     out everything else.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I will not be like that,” said Peggy, crushing her mother and her mother's bonnet in an
     impulsive embrace. “I will have a deep, deep heart, mummy, and no one shall ever go out that
     once comes in—and—oh, mummy, you shall have the best bedroom in my heart always!”</t:p>
<t:p>“I have a very foolish girl for a daughter,” said Lady Pierpoint, somewhat comforted, smiling
     through her tears, “and one who has no respect for my best bonnet.”</t:p>

<t:pb n="84"/>
<t:p>At Sibyl's wish she and Mr. Loftus went straight to Wilderleigh. They reached it after
     several hours” journey on the evening of their wedding-day. And gradually the nervous
     exhaustion and acute headache from which he had been suffering, and which had become almost
     unbearable in the train, relaxed their hold upon him. They were sitting in the cool, scented
     twilight on the terrace. Through the half-darkness came the low voice of the river talking to
     itself. Noise and light and other voices, and this dreadful day, were gone at last.</t:p>
<t:p>He gave a sigh of relief and smiled deprecatingly at her. They had hardly spoken since they
     were married. She was sitting near him, a slender figure in her pale gown, that shimmered in
     the feeble light. But there was light enough for her
     <t:pb n="85"/> to see him smile, and she smiled back at him with her whole heart in her lovely
     eyes. No thought of self lurked in those clear depths, and Mr. Loftus, looking into them, and
     remembering how, on this her wedding day, her whole mind had been absorbed, to the entire
     oblivion of a bride's divided feelings, in the one fact that he was suffering, was touched, but
     not with elation.</t:p>
<t:p>The long listless hand lying palm upwards on his knee made a slight movement, and in instant
     response to it her hand was placed in his. His closed over it. Perhaps nothing could have
     endeared her more to him than the mute response that had waited on his mute appeal, and had not
     forestalled it.</t:p>
<t:p>His hand clasping hers, he drew her slightly, and, obeying its pressure, she leaned towards
     him.</t:p>
<t:pb n="86"/>
<t:p>“My Sibyl!” he said, and she involuntarily drew closer to him, for something in his voice and
     manner, in spite of their exceeding gentleness and tenderness, seemed to remove him from her.
     “Fate has been hard upon you that I should have been ill on your wedding-day.”</t:p>
<t:p>“No,” she said, timidly pushing off from shore into the new world upon her little raft. “Fate
     was kind, because to-day has been the first day when I could be with you and take care of
     you.”</t:p>
<t:p>“You take too much care of me.”</t:p>
<t:p>“I care for nothing else,” she said, her voice faltering, adoration in her eyes.</t:p>
<t:p>One white star peered low in the western heaven through the violet dusk.</t:p>
<t:p>“Once long ago, before you were born,” said Mr. Loftus, “I loved someone, and she said she
     loved me, and we were
     <t:pb n="87"/> married. But after a time she brought trouble upon me, Sibyl.”</t:p>
<t:p>The great current had caught the little raft, and was hurrying it out to sea.</t:p>
<t:p>“I will never bring trouble upon you,” said the young girl, her lips trembling as she stooped
     to kiss his hand. “When you are tired you shall lean on my arm. When your eyes are tired I will
     read to you. I will take care of you, and keep all trouble from you.”</t:p>
<t:p>“Till I die,” he said below his breath, more to himself than to her.</t:p>
<t:p>“Till you die,” she answered.</t:p>
<t:p>And so, but this time very lightly, Mr. Loftus leaned once again, or made as if he leaned, on
     the fragile reed of human love.</t:p>
