<head>CHAPTER XIII.<hi>TO ROME!</hi></head>
<p> “Plancus, come hither!” </p>
<p> The lady Longa Duilia was in an easy-chair, and a slave-girl, Lucilla, was engaged in
      driving away the flies that, perhaps attracted by her cosmetics, came towards the lady. </p>
<p> Summer was over, and winter storms were beginning to bluster, and the flies were dull with
      cold and only maintained alive by the warmth of the chambers, heated by underground stoves,
      and with pipes to convey the hot air carried through every wall. </p>
<p> “Plancus, did you hear me speak?” </p>
<p> “I am here, my lady, at your service.” </p>
<p> “Really; you have become torpid like the flies. Has the chill made you deaf as well as
      sluggish?” </p>
<p> “My lady, I can always hear when you speak.” </p>
<p> “Do you mean to imply that I shout like a fishwife?” </p>
<p> “I mean not that. But when a harp is played, it sets every thread in every other stringed
      instrument a-chiming; and so is it with me.” </p>
<p> “The simile is wiredrawn. What I want you for is—no, I will have no stroking of your face
      like a cat!—is to go to Rome and see that the palace is made ready to receive us. The stoves
      must be well heated, and everything properly aired, The country at best of times is
      <pb n="106"/>tedious; in winter, intolerable. Besides, I have no right to remain here buried.
      I must consider—Plancus, why are you scratching? I must consider my daughter. She is in a fit
      of the blues, and has nothing to say to amuse me. You need not blow like a sea-horse, breathe
      more evenly and equably;—Plancus, you are becoming unendurable. I must not consider my
      bereaved feelings, but her welfare, her health. The air or the situation of Gabii does not
      suit her. Rome is an extraordinarily healthy place in winter. I myself am never better
      anywhere than I am there. I was pretty well at Antioch; there were military there, and I find
      the soil and climate salubrious where there are military. Plancus?—as the Gods love me, you
      have been in the stables. I know it by infallible proofs. Stand at a distance, I insist. And,
      Plancus! you are not showing off conjuring tricks, that you should fold and unfold your hands.
      You go to Rome and take such of the family with you as are necessary. I am not going to be
      mewed up here any longer, because my two years of widowhood are not over. You are making faces
      at me, positively you are, Plancus. Do, I entreat you, look as if you were not a mountebank
      mouthing at a crowd.” </p>
<p> “I fly, mistress, as though winged at heel like Mercury.” </p>
<p> “Much more like Mercury’s tortoise. Send me Claudius Senecio. I must know what ails
      Domitia. She has the vapors.” </p>
<p> “I obey,” said Plancus, </p>
<p> “Am I much worn, Lucilla?” asked the lady, as soon as her steward had withdrawn. “The
      laceration of the heart tells on a sensitive nature, and precipitates wrinkles and so on.” </p>
<pb n="107"/>
<p> “Madam, you bloom as in a second spring.” </p>
<p> “A second spring, Lucilla!” exclaimed Longa, sitting bolt upright. “You hussy, how dare
      you? A second spring, indeed! Why, by the zone of Venus, I am not through my first summer
      yet.” </p>
<p> “You misconceive me, dear lady. When a virgin has been wedded, then come on her the cares
      of matronhood, the caprices, the ill-humors of her husband—and to some, not without cause, the
      vexation of his jealousy. But when the Gods have removed him, it sometimes happens that the
      ravages caused by the annoyances of marriage disappear, and she reverts to the freshness and
      loveliness of her virginity.” </p>
<p> “There is something in what you say; of course it is true only of highly privileged
      natures, in which is some divine blood. A storm ruffles the surface of the lake. When the
      storm is past, the lake resumes its placidity and beauty—exactly as it was before. I have
      noted it a thousand times. Yes, of course it is so. Here comes Senecio; he waddles just like
      the Hindu nurse I saw at Antioch, laboring about with two fat babies.” </p>
<p> The Philosopher approached. </p>
<p> “I will trouble you to come in front of me,” said the widow. “Have you eaten so heavy a
      meal as to shrink from so much unnecessary exertion? I cannot talk with my neck twisted. The
      windpipe is not naturally constructed like a thread in a rope. I am returning to Rome.” </p>
<p> “To Rome, madam! I do not advise that. The place is in commotion. There have been sad
      scenes of riot and pillage in the capital.” </p>
<p> “As the Gods love me! what care I so long as they do not invade the house in the Carinæ?” </p>
<pb n="108"/>
<p> “But there have been also massacres.” </p>
<p> “Well, when princes shift about, that is inevitable. They all do it. For my part, I rather
      like—that is, I don’t object to massacres in their proper places and confined to the proper
      persons.” </p>
<p> “Madam, you are secure where you are. Why, there was Galba,—he had not been in Rome seven
      months before he was killed, and he did not enter the city save over the bodies of seven
      thousand men, butchered on the Flaminian Way.” </p>
<p> “Well! I am not a man. Moreover, I thank the Gods, my house is not on the Flaminian Way,
      nor is it in the Velabrum, nor the Suburra, nor in the Forum Boarium either. We happen to live
      in the Carinæ, and I conceive that there have been no massacres and all that sort of thing
      there.” </p>
<p> “No, my dear lady, but when the entire city is disturbed——” </p>
<p> “And here, in Gabii, down to the lizards—dead asleep. Give me massacres rather than
      stagnation. I shall get back to Rome before the Ides of December, on account of my daughter’s
      health. By the way, will you believe it? She gave away the sword of my dear Corbulo to Lucius
      Lamia. Just conceive!—how effective that sword would be in my house—in the tablinum, the
      atrium, anywhere—and how I could point to it, and my feelings!—I can imagine nothing more
      striking. I have told Lamia to restore it. I would not lose it for a great deal. Well now,
      come. Any news from the capital?” </p>
<p> “Madam, you are aware that Galba fell, and that Otho threw himself on his sword after a
      reign of ninety days; and now the new Cæsar Vitellius is men
      <pb n="109"/>aced. I hear that the East has risen, and that Vespasian has been proclaimed in
      Syria. The legions in Illyria have also declared for him and are marching into Italy. Egypt
      has pronounced against Vitellius, and it is but seven months since Otho died by his own hand.” </p>
<p> “Vespasian, did you say?” exclaimed the lady. “My good Senecio, he is a sort of cousin, a
      country cousin, just one of those cousins that can be cultivated into kinship, or dropped out
      of relationship as circumstances decide. His father was a pottering sort of a man, an
      auctioneer, and commissioner of drains and dirt and all that sort of thing. A worthy fellow, I
      dare say; I believe he had a statue erected to him somewhere because he did the scavengering
      so well. He married above his position, one Vespasia Polla; I have seen and heard of her, a
      round-faced woman like a pudding; he took her for her blood, but she was only a knight’s
      daughter; and those city knights, as the Gods love me! what a money-grubbing low set they are!
      His son, Flavius Vespasianus is proclaimed! It is really funny. It is, O Morals! I must laugh.
      Now, if my good man had but listened to me. But there, I shall become mad.—I don’t know how
      long it is since you have been pecking, or whether you eat all day long? But you have crumbs
      sticking in your beard. Another time be good enough to comb your beard before approaching me.
      Tell me, what has given Domitia the dumps?” </p>
<p> “I believe, madam, she has been frightened by that unscrupulous impostor, Elymas, or
      Ascleparion, or whatever he is called. I do not know particulars, but believe that he
      pretended to show her the future.” </p>
<p> “The future! Delicious! And what did she see?” </p>
<pb n="110"/>
<p> “That I cannot say, but she has looked wan ever since, neither smiles nor speaks, but sits,
      when the sun shines, on the balustrade above the water, looking into it, as in a dream. I hear
      that she holds converse with none, save her maid, Euphrosyne.” </p>
<p> “I wonder what she has seen! Anything concerning me?” </p>
<p> “Madam, that braggart and intriguer is made up of lies. He has frightened her with
      pretended predictions. If I might advise, I would counsel his expulsion from the house.” </p>
<p> “I should like to hear what are the chances for Flavius Vespasian. I think I shall inquire
      myself. I knew Vespasian once, of course he is vastly my senior. If he be successful, he may
      get a proconsulship for our Lamia. He! Flavius Vespasian a Cæsar! There is push for you! As
      the Gods love me, there is nothing like push. I must go to Rome. Positively two years
      retirement for a widow is unreasonable. In the good old days of the Republic one was thought
      enough. I would not have the Republic back for anything else, though of course we all talk
      about Liberty and Cato, and all that sort of thing—it is talk—nothing else. I must go to Rome.
      Flavius Sabinus is præfect of the city, and he is the elder brother of Vespasian. I might show
      him some little inconspicuous civilities—give a little cosy, quiet supper. By the way—yes, he
      is married to an old hunks, I remember. Oh! if his brother gets to the top, he can divorce
      her. Yes, positively I shall not be able to breathe till I get back to Rome. By the way, draw
      me up on a couple of tablets some moral philosophizing suitable to widowhood, pepper it well
      with lines from lyric poets. I will learn it all by
      <pb n="111"/>heart in my litter, and serve out as occasion offers. I positively must be home
      before the Ides; why—” with a start of pleasure—“The Ides of December! that is the dedication
      feast of the temple of Tellus in the Carinæ. There you have it! Devotion to the gods—an excuse
      for a little supper—a wee little supper—but so good and so nicely turned out.” </p>
