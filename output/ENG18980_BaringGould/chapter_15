<head>CHAPTER XV.<hi>THE LECTISTERNIUM.</hi></head>
<p> “My dear child,” said Duilia, “I never did a better stroke of policy than that supper a few
      evenings ago. It went off quite charmingly, without a hitch. I allowed that good Flavius
      Sabinus to talk; and he is just one of those men who enjoys himself best where he is given
      full flow for his twaddle. A good, worthy, commonplace man. I doubt if he has push in him, but
      he is just so situated now that he must go ahead. The news is most encouraging. Mucianus is on
      his way to Italy at the head of an army. Primus, with his legions, is approaching; he has
      beaten the troops sent against him, and has sacked Cremona; there are positively none who hold
      by Vitellius except his brother in Campania, and his German bodyguard. Domitia,” the widow
      dropped her voice, “we can do better than with that milksop Ælius Lamia.” </p>
<p> “Mother, I will have no other.” </p>
<p> “Then we must push him up into position. But come, my dear, we must show ourselves at the
      Lectisternia. It will be expected of us, and be setting a good example, and all that sort of
      thing, and it is positively wicked to mope indoors when we ought to be seen in the streets and
      the forum. So there, make yourself ready. I am going instantly. I have ordered round
      <pb n="122"/>the palanquins, and, as you may perceive, I am dressed and my hair done to go
      out. That supper was <hi>quite</hi> a success.” </p>
<p> The time was now that of the Saturnalia, lasting seven days, beginning on the 17th December
      with a strange institution, a banquet of the gods. Usually the several gods had their feasts
      in their own temples and invited others to them, but on certain solemn occasions all banqueted
      together in public. The distress, the butcheries, the general confusion caused by the setting
      up and casting down of emperors—three in ten months—and now, eight months after, a fourth
      tottering; and every change involving massacre, plunder, disturbance of order;—this had moved
      the priests to decree a solemn lectisternium and supplication for the restoration of
      tranquillity and the cessation of civil broil. </p>
<p> The banquet was to take place in the forum. </p>
<p> “You shall come in the <foreign>lectica</foreign> (palanquin) with me,” said Duilia. “It
      will have quite a pathetic aspect—the widow and the orphan together. Besides, I want some one
      to talk to. What do you think of Flavius Domitianus? A modest lad, to my mind.” </p>
<p> “Shy and clumsy,” observed Domitia. “The sight of him is a horror to me.” </p>
<p> “My dear child, only a fool will take sprats when he can have whitebait. Look out to better
      yourself.” </p>
<p> “Oh, mother!—what is that?” </p>
<p> “A god going to supper,” said the lady. “We shall see plenty of them presently.” </p>
<p> That which had attracted her daughter’s attention was a bier supported on the shoulders of
      priests, on which lay a figure dressed handsomely, in the attitude
      <pb n="123"/>of a man at table, raised on his left elbow that was buried in a pillow, the head
      erect and the right arm extended, balanced in the air. The body was probably of wood under the
      drooping drapery, but the face and hands and feet were of wax. In jolting over the pavement,
      the sleeve had become disarranged, and showed the wooden prop that sustained the waxen right
      hand. The face was colored, the eyes were of glass, and real hair was affixed to the head; the
      lower jaw, hung on wires, opened and shut with the jostling. The staring figure swaying on the
      shoulders of the bearers, had a sufficiently startling effect, sweeping round a corner,
      wagging its beard, and past the palanquin in which were the ladies. </p>
<p> “A thing like that can’t eat,” said Domitia. </p>
<p> “Oh, my dear child, no. The gods only sniff at the food. After it has been set before them,
      it is carried away, and the people scramble for it.” </p>
<p> “They are naught but wax and woodwork,” said the girl contemptuously. </p>
<p> “My child, how often have I not had to quote to you that text, “It is not well to be
      overwise about the gods?” Here we are! What a crowd!” </p>
<p> The forum of Rome, that wondrous basin towered over on one side by the Capitol, inclosed on
      another by the Palatine, and on the third by the densely packed blocks of houses in the
      Suburra below the Quirinal, Viminal and Esquiline Hills, was itself crowded with temples and
      basilicas, yet not then as dense with monuments as later, when the open spaces were further
      encroached upon by the <corr>Antonines</corr>. </p>
<p> “Domitia,” said Longa Duilia, in her ear, “all things are working out excellently.
      Vitellius is aware
      <pb n="124"/>that he has no chance, and has been consulting with our cousin in the Temple of
      Concord yonder, and they have nearly settled between them that Vespasian is to assume the
      purple without further opposition. Vitellius will retire to some country villa on a handsome
      annuity. That will prevent more bloodshed and confiscation, and all that sort of thing. It is
      always advisable to avoid unpleasantnesses if possible. There, child, there are quite a bevy
      of gods already at table. See that dear old doll, Summanus, without a head—you know it was
      struck off by lightning in the time of Pyrrhus. It was of clay, and rolled all the way to the
      Tiber and plopped in. Since then he has been without a head, the darling!” </p>
<p> “How can he either smell or eat, mother?” </p>
<p> “My child, I don’t ask. It is not well to be overwise about the gods. There go the Arval
      Brothers with the image of Aca Larentia seated—of course not lying. You will see some
      venerable curiosities, who put in an appearance on days like this so as not to be wholly
      forgotten.” </p>
<p> The sight presented by the forum was indeed strange. A space had been cleared and shut off
      from the intrusion of the crowd, and there lay and sat the images at tables that were spread
      with viands. All were either life-size or larger. Some were skilfully modelled, and wore
      gorgeous clothing, but others were of the rudest moulding in terra cotta, or carved wood, and
      evidently of very ancient date, of Etruscan workmanship little influenced by Greek art. </p>
<p> Domitia looked on in astonishment. The populace laughed and commented on the images,
      without the least reverence; and the priests and their assistants
      <pb n="125"/>laid the dishes before the puppets, then whisked them off and carried them
      without the barriers. Thereupon ensued a struggle who should get hold of the savory morsels
      that were being conveyed from the table of the gods; even the vessels used for the viands and
      for the wine were snatched at and carried away, and the priests offered no resistance. </p>
<p> Domitia was completely transported out of herself by astonishment at the sight. Every now
      and then the hum of voices spluttered into a burst of laughter at some ribald joke, and then
      roared up into a hubbub of sound over the trays of meats and wine that were being fought for. </p>
<p> Already the short winter day was closing in, and torches were being brought forth and stood
      beside the images. Then the tables were cleared and removed. </p>
<p> A trumpet blast sounded, and instantly the barriers were cast down, and the second act of
      this extraordinary spectacle ensued. This was the supplication. Instantly the temper of the
      mob changed from scepticism and mockery to enthusiastic devotion, and those pressed forward to
      kneel and touch the cushions and drapery on which the gods reposed, and to entreat their
      assistance, whose lips had but recently uttered a scoff. </p>
<p> Nothing so completely differentiates Christian worship from that of Pagan Rome as the
      congregational character of the former contrasted with the uncongregational nature of the
      latter. At the present day in Papal Rome the priests may be seen behind glass doors in little
      chapels annexed to S. Peter’s and S. Maria Maggiore saying their offices,
      <pb n="126"/>indifferent to there being no laity present, indeed, with no provision made that
      they should assist. This is a legacy of Pagan Rome. The sacrifices, the services in the
      temples and other sanctuaries, were entirely independent of the people, some performed within
      closed doors. The only popular religious service was the <foreign>supplication</foreign>,
      which took place but occasionally. Then the public streamed to the images of the gods,
      uttering fervent prayer, chanting hymns, prostrating themselves before the couches, catching
      at their bed-coverings, esteeming themselves blessed if they could lay their hands on the
      sacred pillows. But there was no general consent as to which of the gods and goddesses were
      most potent. Some cried out that Mother Orbona had helped them, others that Fortuna was a jade
      and promised but performed nothing. One fanatic, in a transport, shrieked that these gods were
      good for naught, for his part he trusted only in Consus, whose temple was in ruins, whose
      altar was buried in earth by the circus of Tarquin. But there were others who swept in a
      strong current towards the couch of Jupiter and of that of Venus. Another strong current,
      howling ‘Io Saturne! Salve Mater Ops!’ made for the images of the Old God of Time and his
      divine Mate. </p>
<p> Simultaneously came a cross current of vendors of cakes and toys from the Suburra,
      regardless of the devotion of the people, careful only to sell their goods—for the Saturnalia
      was a period at which the children were regaled with gingerbread, and treated to dolls of
      terra cotta, of ivory and of wood. Hawkers selling pistachio nuts, the cones of the edible
      pine, men with baked chestnuts, others with trays of Pomponian pears
      <pb n="127"/>and Mattian apples, vociferating and belauding their wares, increased the clamor. </p>
<p> Whilst this was at its height, down from the Palatine by the New Way came the German
      Imperial Body-Guard, forcing a passage through the mob, their short swords drawn, bellowing
      imprecations, whirling their blades, striking with the flat of the steel, threatening to cut
      down such as impeded their progress. </p>
<p> Some <foreign>vigiles</foreign>, or city police, came up. There was no love lost between
      them and the pampered foreigners employed in the palace, and they opposed the household
      troops. Remonstrances were employed and cast away. Then a German was struck in the face by a
      pine cone, another tripped, fell, and a hawker with a barrow-load of dolls, in his eagerness
      to escape, ran his vehicle over the prostrate guardsman. At once the Germans’ blood was up,
      they rushed upon the police, and a fray ensued in which now this side, then that, gained
      advantage. The populace, densely packed, came in for blows and wounds. When a guardsman fell,
      and they could lay hold of him, he was dragged away, and almost torn to pieces by eager hands
      stripping him of his splendid uniform. </p>
<p> The Præfect, who was in the Forum, summoned three cohorts to his aid, to drive back the
      household troops, and in a moment the trough between the hills was converted into a scene of
      the wildest confusion, some women screaming that they had lost their children, others crying
      to the gods to help them. Boys had scrambled up the bases of the statues, and one urchin sat
      with folded legs on the shoulders of Julius Cæsar, hallooing, and occasionally pelting with
      nuts where they did not fear retaliation. </p>
<pb n="128"/>
<p> The vendors of cakes and toys cursed as their trays were upset, or their barrows clashed.
      Men fought each other, for no other reason than that the soldiers were engaged, and they were
      unable to keep their itching hands off each other. </p>
<p> Down a stair from the palace came the Emperor Vitellius, carried on the shoulders of
      soldiers, while slaves bore flambeaux before him. </p>
<p> He was seen to gesticulate, but in the uproar none heard what he said. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the priests were endeavoring to remove the gods, and met with the greatest
      difficulty. Some frantic women clung to the images and refused to allow them to be taken away.
      Some of the figures had been upset, and the servants of the temples to which they belonged
      made rings about them with interlaced arms, to protect them from being trampled under foot.
      Jupiter Capitolinus had been injured and lost his nose. </p>
<p> A priest with the help of a torch, was melting the wax and fastening it on again, whilst
      the guard of the temple kept off the rabble. </p>
<p> The currents of human beings, driven by diverse passions, jostled, broke across each other,
      resolved themselves into swirls of living men and women carried off their feet. </p>
<p> The litter of the lady Duilia and her daughter tossed like a boat in a whirlpool, and the
      widow shrieked with terror. </p>
<p> Then two powerful arms were thrust within the curtains of the palanquin, and the slave
      Eboracus laid hold of Domitia, and said:— </p>
<p> “There is no safety here. Trust me. I will battle through with you. Come on my arm. Fear
      not.” </p>
<pb n="129"/>
<p> “Save <corr>me!</corr> Me, also!” screamed Duilia, “I shall be thrown out, trodden under
      foot! O my wig! My wig!” </p>
<p> But Eboracus, regardless of the widow, holding his young mistress on his left arm, with the
      right armed with a cudgel, which he whirled like a flail, and with which, without compunction
      he broke down all opposition, drove, battered his way through the throng where most dense,
      across the currents most violent, and did not stay till he had reached a comparatively
      unobstructed spot, in one of the narrow lanes between the Fish Market and the Hostilian Court. </p>
