<head>CHAPTER XXIII.<hi>THE END OF THE DAY.</hi></head>
<p> A rumor, none knew from whom it arose, spread rapidly in whispers, sending a quiver of
      alarm, distress, pity, through the entire wedding party, reaching last of all him most
      concerned. </p>
<p> None dared breathe in his ear what all feared; but none would separate till it was surely
      ascertained whether what was surmised was a fact or not. </p>
<p> The slaves knew it and looked wistfully at Lamia. </p>
<p> He was engaged in making trifling presents to the many guests and well-wishers, moving from
      one to another, attended by slaves with trays piled up with gifts. </p>
<p> Eboracus burst on him, through the throng, forgetting, in his agitation and fear, the
      diffidence that belonged to his position. </p>
<p> “Sir! Where is the mistress?” </p>
<p> Lamia, without looking at him, or desisting from what he was about, answered: </p>
<p> “Within, being freed from her veil and bridal ornaments.” </p>
<p> “Sir! Lucius! she has been stolen from you! she has been carried away.” </p>
<p> Lamia stood as one petrified. </p>
<p> “How dare you utter such a jest?” </p>
<pb n="185"/>
<p> “It is no jest—she has been conveyed hence. She is not in your house.” </p>
<p> Without another word, Lamia flew into the portion of the house to which Domitia had
      retired. </p>
<p> There all was in confusion. The female slaves were either struck down with terror, or
      crying out that they were not to blame. </p>
<p> “Where is she?” asked Lamia, hardly realizing that there was actual loss, thinking this was
      some frolic of his young companions, who on such occasions allowed themselves great licence. </p>
<p> To add to the confusion, a tame magpie with clipped wing, belonging to the gouty old Lamia,
      got in the way of every one, and screamed when run over; and the elder man roared out reproach
      and brandished his crutch when the life of his pet was endangered. </p>
<p> Claudia, like a pious woman, had rushed to the <foreign>lararium</foreign> to supplicate
      the assistance of the Gods, especially of Lamius, son of Hercules and Omphale, the reputed
      half-divine ancestor of the family. </p>
<p> Domitia had disappeared.—How?—none could say. She had been spirited away, one said in this
      manner, another said in that. One held it as his opinion that she had been carried off by some
      disbanded Vitellian soldiers who were said to lurk about the suburbs of Rome and commit
      depredations. Some thought that in maiden shyness she had fled home; some whispered that the
      Gods had translated her; others that a former lover had suborned the servants to admit him,
      and that he had conveyed her from her husband’s house to his own. </p>
<p> But in what direction had she been taken? There again opinions differed, and tongues gave
      conflicting
      <pb n="186"/>accounts. One had seen a litter hurried down the <corr>Clivus</corr> Scauri. One
      declared that he had seen a girl running in the direction of Nero’s lake, and suggested that
      this was Domitia who had gone thither to destroy herself. One had noticed suspicious-looking
      men wrapped in military cloaks lounging about, and these had disappeared—he had even seen the
      backs of some near the Porta Metrovia. Then one cried out:— </p>
<p> “What else can be expected when such an ill-omened bird is kept in the house, as a magpie?” </p>
<p> Not until all guests, visitors, had been excluded from the house, could anything be learned
      with certainty, and that was little. During the afternoon, shortly before the arrival of the
      procession, several male and female slaves had arrived under the direction of a Chaldæan
      soothsayer, who announced that he had been sent along with them to the house of the bridegroom
      by the bride’s mother, the Lady Duilia, and that they formed a portion of Domitia’s
      attendance, who had been associated with her in her former home, and would be about her person
      in her new quarters. No suspicion had been roused, and as the Magian spoke with authority, and
      gave directions, which it was presumed he was commissioned to do, and as old Lamia was
      crippled with gout and moreover indisposed to attend to such matters, and the old lady was
      simple to childishness, these strangers were suffered to do much what they pleased; and on the
      bride retiring to be divested of the flame colored veil, her wreath and other ornaments, had
      been allowed to take possession of her. </p>
<p> What happened further they did not know. In the excitement of the arrival of visitors
      nothing had been
      <pb n="187"/>observed till some of the household servants remarked that the servants of the
      family of Duilia had left,—that there had been a bustle in the garden court, and that a litter
      had departed, borne by men who ran under their load. But even then no notion that the bride
      had been carried off was entertained. For some time no suspicion of mischief arose. When the
      slaves became aware that their new mistress was no longer in the house, there was first some
      surprise entertained that she was not seen, then a notion that she might be unwell or
      over-tired—but the first word that suggested that she had been conveyed away came from without
      the house, from a guest who inquired casually what lady had left the house, in a litter, borne
      by trotting porters. Lamia, in violent agitation, at once hurried to the house whence Domitia
      had come, to ask for an explanation. There he <corr>learned</corr> nothing satisfactory. No
      servants had been sent beforehand. Domitia had taken with her two female slaves, but they had
      attended her in the procession. The sorcerer, it was true, had disappeared and had not
      returned. </p>
<p> Lamia was obliged to return home, without his anxiety being in any way removed. </p>
<p> On reaching his palace on the Cœlian, he learned something further. In the room in which
      Domitia had been divested of her bridal ornaments, which lay scattered in disorder, was a
      crystal cup that contained the dregs of wine, and this wine was drugged with a powerful
      narcotic. Of this the slave who acted as house-surgeon and physician was certain. He had
      tasted it and detected the presence of an opiate. Nothing further could be learned, neither
      whence came the strange slaves nor whither they had gone. </p>
<pb n="188"/>
<p> In the mean time a party surrounding a closed litter had passed through the Porta Capena,
      and was hurrying along the Appian Way. </p>
<p> Directly the city was left, a tall man who directed the convoy called a halt;—then
      approaching the litter, he drew back the curtains, and said:— </p>
<p> “Asleep! Two of you take her up, lift her, set her on her feet and rouse her.” </p>
<p> He was obeyed and a helpless body was removed, sustained between two stout slaves, and made
      to stand on the causeway. </p>
<p> “Shake her,” said the director, who was none other than the Chaldæan. “If she sleep on, she
      will never wake. Roused and made to walk she must be. We need fear no pursuit. I have left
      those behind who will spread a false rumor, and send such as think she has been carried away
      along the wrong road. Make her walk.” </p>
<p> The helpless girl—it was Domitia—staggered with drowsiness and stumbled. </p>
<p> “Let me sleep,” she murmured. </p>
<p> “It must not be, lady. To let you sleep is to consign you to death. You must be constrained
      to walk.” </p>
<p> “Let me sleep!” <corr>she</corr> fretfully said. </p>
<p> “If you sleep you die.” </p>
<p> “I want to die—only to sleep. I am dead weary.” </p>
<p> “Make her move along,” said the sorcerer in a low tone, and the slaves who held her up drew
      her forward. She scarce moved her feet. </p>
<p> “Oh, you are cruel. I want to sleep. An hour! half an hour. For one moment longer!” she
      pleaded. </p>
<p> Still the bearers drew her forward, they did not lift
      <pb n="189"/>her so that she need not move her feet. She was constrained to step forward. </p>
<p> “I pray you! I will give you gold. You shall have all my jewels. Lay me down. Let go your
      hold, and I will lie where I am, and sleep.” </p>
<p> “Draw her further.—Hark! here come horses. Aside! behind that tomb!” </p>
<p> The party stole from off the road and secreted itself behind one of the mausoleums that
      line the sides of the Appian Way. </p>
<p> “Shake her—lest she doze off in your arms,” said Elymas, and the slaves obeyed. </p>
<p> Then Domitia began to sob. “Have pity! only for a little while, I am so tired. The day has
      been so long and so wearying.” </p>
<p> “They are passed—mere travellers,” said the sorcerer. “Into the road again. Force her to
      walk.” </p>
<p> Then she called, “Lamia—my Lucius! come to me, drive these men away. They will not let me
      sleep,” and she struggled to free herself, and unable to do so by a spasmodic effort, began to
      sob, and sobbed herself into a half doze. </p>
<p> “She is sleeping. Run with her,” called the Magus. </p>
<p> In vain did she weep, entreat, threaten, naught availed, she was forced to advance; now to
      take a few steps, to rest on her feet, to walk in actuality. The very anger she felt at not
      being allowed to cast herself down, fold her hands under her head, and drop off into
      unconsciousness, tended to rouse her. </p>
<p> After about half an hour, her entreaties to be allowed to rest became less frequent, and
      alternated with inquiries as to where she was, whither she was going, why she was forced to
      walk, and that at night.
      <pb n="190"/>Then she ceased altogether to complain of drowsiness, and finding she met with no
      response to her inquiries as to her destination, she became silent; she was now conscious, but
      her brain was clouded, perplexed. She could remember nothing that would account for her
      present position. Whether she were in a dream, laboring under nightmare, she could not tell,
      and purposely she struck her foot against one of the paving blocks of lava, and by the pain
      assured herself that she was actually awake. </p>
<p> But where was she? </p>
<p> She looked up. The sky was besprent with stars, a sky limpid, tender, vaporless and vast,
      out of which the stars throbbed with iridescent light in all the changeful flicker of topaz,
      emerald and ruby. And the air was full of flying stars, in tens of thousands, they settled on
      rushes by the roadside in chains of fire, they flashed across the eyes, they settled down on
      the dress; and out of the cool grass shone the steady lustre of innumerable glow-worms. </p>
<p> The milky way, like an illumined veil, crossed the vault, vaporous, transparent with stars
      shining through it. </p>
<p> From the black monuments on each side hooted the owls, bats swept by, diving out of night
      to brush by the passers along the road and plunge back into night, like old forgotten fancies
      of the dreaming mind, that recur and vanish again, in waking hours. Out of the grass the
      crickets shrilled, and frogs called with flutelike tones at intervals, whilst others
      maintained an incessant chatter. </p>
<p> Where was she? What were these great fantastic edifices on each side of the road? They were
      no
      <pb n="191"/>houses, for out of none glimmered a light. No occupants stood in the doors, or
      sang and piped on the threshold. These were no taverns, for no host invited to rest within,
      and praised his fare. The road was forsaken, still as death, and these mansions were the
      dwellings of the dead. She knew this now—that she was on one of the roads that led from the
      gates of Rome, lined with tombs. How she had got there she knew not. Least of all did she know
      for what reason she was being dragged along it. She had thus trudged for a considerable time;
      she had ceased to speak. She was occupied with her thoughts. Weary she was, but in too great
      anguish of mind to be aware how weary she was, till tripping on a stone she fell. </p>
<p> Then a voice said:— </p>
<p> “She is full awake now. There is naught to fear. Let her again mount the litter.” </p>
<p> “Elymas!” exclaimed the girl, “I know you, I know your voice. What means this? Whither am I
      being taken?” </p>
<p> “Madam,” said the sorcerer in reply, after a pause, “your own eyes shall answer the
      question better than my lips, to-morrow.” </p>
