<head>CHAPTER II.<hi>THE FISH.</hi></head>
<p> Domitian had been accorded by his brother a portion of the palace of Tiberius on the
      Palatine Hill, that was crowded with imperial residences; and Domitia had been brought there
      from Albanum. </p>
<p> She was one day on the terrace. The hilltop was too much encumbered with buildings to
      afford much space for gardens, but there were platforms on which grew cypresses, and about the
      balustrades roses twined and poured over in curtains of flower. Citrons and oleanders also
      stood in tubs, and against the walls glistened the burnished leaves of the pomegranate; the
      scarlet flowers bloomed in spring and the warm fruit ripened till it burst in the hot autumn. </p>
<p> Domitia, seated beside the balustrade, looked over mighty Rome, the teeming forum, roofs
      with gilded tiles of bronze, lay below her, flashing in the sun, and beyond on the Capitol,
      white as snow, but glinting with gold, was the newly completed temple of Jupiter, rebuilt in
      greater splendor than before since the disastrous fire. </p>
<p> The hum of the city came up to her as the murmur of a sea, not a troubled one, but a sea of
      a thousand wavelets trifling with the pebbles of a beach, and dancing in and out among the
      teeth of a reef; a hum not unlike that of the bees—but somewhat louder, and pitched on a lower
      note. </p>
<pb n="223"/>
<p> Domitia paid no attention to the scene, nor to the sounds, she was engaged with her
      jewel-box, that she had brought forth into the sun, in order that she might count over her
      treasures. </p>
<p> At a respectful distance sat Euphrosyne spinning. </p>
<p> Domitia had some Syrian filagree gold work in her hand—it formed a decoration for the head,
      to be fastened by two pins; the heads were those of owls with opals for eyes. </p>
<p> She laid it aside and looked at her rings and brooches. There was one of the latter, a
      cameo given her by her mother, of coral of two hues, a Medusa’s head, a beautiful work of art.
      Then she took up a necklace of British pearls from the Severn, she twisted it about her arm
      and lovely were the pure pearls against her delicate flesh,—like the dainty tints on the rose
      and white coral of the brooch she had laid aside. </p>
<p> She replaced the chain, and took up a cornelian fish. </p>
<p> “Euphrosyne,” said Domitia, “come hither! observe this fish. Thy sister gave it me the day
      I was married, but alack! it brought me no luck. Think you it is an omen of ill? But Glyceria
      would not have given me one such.” </p>
<p> “Nay, lady, the fish brings the greatest happiness.” </p>
<p> “What is its meaning? It is a strange symbol. It must have some purport.” </p>
<p> The slave hesitated about answering. </p>
<p> Then, hearing steps on the pavement, and looking round, Domitia called—“Thou! Elymas! who
      pretendest to know all things, answer me this, I have an amulet—a fish—what doth it portend?” </p>
<p> “What?—the murex? That gives the imperial purple.” </p>
<pb n="224"/>
<p> “Bah! It is no murex, not a sea snail but a fish. What is the signification?” </p>
<p> “Lady, to one so high, ever-increasing happiness.” </p>
<p> “Away! you are all wrong. Happiness is not where you deem it. False thou art, false to thy
      creed. <hi>Thou</hi> speak of a divine ray in every man and woman! an emanation from the
      Father of Light, quivering, battling, straining to escape out of its earthly envelope and soar
      to its source!—thou speak of this, and in all thy doings and devisings seekest what is sordid
      and dark!” </p>
<p> The gloomy man folded his cloak about him, and looking at her from under his penthouse
      brows answered:— </p>
<p> “Thou launchest forth against me without reason. Knowest thou what is a comet? It is a star
      that circles about the sun and from it drinks in all the illumination it can absorb, like as
      the thirsty soil in summer sucks in the falling rain, or the fields the outflow of the Alban
      Lake; then it flies away into space, and as it flies it sheds its effulgence, becoming ever
      more dim till it reaches infinite darkness and is there black in the midst of absolute
      nigritude. Then it turns and comes back to replenish its urn.” </p>
<p> “Nay,” said Domitia, “that can never be. When all light is gone, then all desire for return
      goes likewise. I know that in myself—I—I am such a comet. When I was a child I longed, I
      hungered for the light, and in my days of adolescence it was the same, only stronger—it was as
      a famine. I was the poor comet sweeping up towards my sun; but where my sun was, that—in the
      vast abyss of infinity—I knew not. I sought and found not, I sought and shed my glory, till
      there was but a faint glimmer left in me;
      <pb n="225"/>and now—now all light is extinguished, and with it desire to know, to love, to be
      happy, to return.” </p>
<p> “Madam, you, as the comet, are reaching your apogee, your extreme limit; you must shed all
      your light before you can return to the source of light.” </p>
<p> “What! is that your philosophy? The Father of Light sends forth his ray to expire in utter
      darkness, predestined this ray of light to extinction. If so—then He is not good. And yet,”
      she sighed, “it is so. I am such. In blackness of night. Look you, Elymas, when I was a child,
      I laughed and danced; I cannot dance, I can but force a laugh now. I once loved the flowers
      and the butterflies; I love them no more. My light is gone. The faculty of enjoyment is gone
      with it. Do I want to return? To what? To the source of light that launched me into this
      misery? No, not into that cold and cruel fate. Let me go on my inky way, I have no more light
      to lose—I look only to go out as a fallen star and leave nothing behind me.” </p>
<p> “What! when a great future is before you?” </p>
<p> “What future? you have none to offer me that I value. Away with your hints concerning the
      purple—it is the sable of mourning to me.” </p>
<p> She panted. The tears came into her eyes. </p>
<p> “It is you who have wrecked my life—you—you. It was you who devised that crime—when I was
      snatched away from the only man I loved—the only man with whom I could have been happy—whom
      I—” she turned aside and hid her face. Then recovering herself, but with a cheek glistening
      with tears, she said: “I admit it, I love still, and ever shall love. And he loves me. He has
      taken none to wife, for he thinks on me. There, could darkness be deeper than
      <pb n="226"/>my now condition? And you did it, you betrayed me into the hands—” she had
      sufficient self-control not to say to whom, before this man and her slave. </p>
<p> “Lady, it is not I, but Destiny.” </p>
<p> “And you, with your tortuous ways, work to ends that you desire, and excuse it by saying,
      It is Destiny.” </p>
<p> “What, discussing the lore of emanations, little woman?” asked the Emperor, coming suddenly
      up. </p>
<p> Elymas stood back and assumed a deferential attitude. Titus waved him to withdraw, and was
      obeyed. Then he took Domitia by the hand. </p>
<p> “A philosopher, are you?” </p>
<p> “No, I ask questions, but get no answers that content me.” </p>
<p> “Ah! you asked a favor of me the other day and spiced it with a sneer—your jibes hit me.” </p>
<p> “I meant not to give pain.” </p>
<p> “I have come to you touching this very matter. I am not sure, child, that the scandal is
      not greater so long as you and Domitian remain linked together, and pulling opposite ways,
      than if you were parted. Your quarrels are now the talk of Rome, and many a cutting jest is
      put into your pretty mouth at our expense; invented by others, attributed to you.” </p>
<p> “You will have us divorced!” her breath came quick and short. </p>
<p> “Listen to what I propose. Domitia, I am not well. I have this accursed Roman fever on me.” </p>
<p> “Sire, I mark suffering in your face.” </p>
<p> “It has been vexing me for some days, and it is my intent to leave Rome and be free from
      business and take my cure at Cutiliæ—our old estate in the Sabine country. Perhaps the air,
      the waters of the old home,
      <pb n="227"/>the nest of our divine family—” his mouth twitched, but there was a sad
      expression in his face—“they may do me good. It is something, Domitia, to stand on the soil
      that was turned by one’s forbears, when they bent as humble farmers over the plough. They were
      honest men and happy; and when one is down at heart, there is naught like home—the old home
      where are the bones of one’s ancestors, though they may have been yeomen, and one a
      commissioner, and another an usurer, and so on. They were honest men. Aye! the rate-collector,
      he was an honest man. Here all is false, and unreal, and—Domitia—I feel that I want to stand
      on the soil where my worthy, humble, dear old people worked and worshipped, and laid them down
      to <corr>die.</corr>” </p>
<p> “You are downcast indeed,” said Domitia. </p>
<p> “And because downcast, I have been brooding over your troubles, little sister-in-law. Come!
      I did something for your poor Lamia,—I made him consul, and I will do more. Can you be patient
      and tarry till my strength is restored? I shall return from my family farm in rude health, I
      trust, and by the Gods! the first matter I will then take in hand will be yours. I know what
      my brother is. By Jupiter Capitolinus! if Rome should ever have him as its prince, it will
      weep tears of blood. I know his savage humor and his sullen mind. No, Domitia, you cannot be
      happy with him. A cruel wrong was done you, and when I return from Cutiliæ I will right it.
      You shall be separated!” </p>
<p> She threw herself at his feet. </p>
<p> He smiled, and withdrawing from her clasp, said:— </p>
<p> “I will do more than that for your very good friend, in whom you still take such a lively
      interest.
      <pb n="228"/>I shall find means to advance him to some foreign post—he knows Antioch, I will
      give him the proconsulship of Syria and Cilicia, and so move him away from Rome. And then—” he
      took a turn, looked smilingly at Domitia, and said,—“I do not see that you need mope at Gabii.
      You know Antioch; you were there for some years. It is, I believe, not well for a governor to
      take his wife with him; she has the credit of being a very horse-leech to the province. But I
      can trust thee, little woman! There, no thanks, I seek mine own interest, and to protect our
      divine images and the new gilding from the rasp of that tongue. That is the true motive of my
      making this offer. Do not thank me. On my return from Cutiliæ you may reckon on me.” </p>
<p> Then hastily brushing away her thanks, and evading her arms, extended to clasp him, he
      walked from the terrace. </p>
<p> “Euphrosyne!” cried Domitia, “did you hear! The comet has reached its extreme limit, it is
      turning—it is drawing to the light—to hope. Happiness is near—ah!” </p>
<p> In her excitement she had struck her jewel-case that stood on the marble balustrade, and
      sent it, with all its costly contents, flying down the precipice into the thronged lanes at
      the back of the forum in a glittering rain. </p>
<p> “Ye Gods!” gasped Domitia, “the omen! O ye Gods! the bad omen.” </p>
<p> “Lady,” said Euphrosyne, “all is not lost” </p>
<p> “What remains? Ah! the Fish!” </p>
<p> “Yes, mistress dear, when all else is lost, remember the Fish.” </p>
