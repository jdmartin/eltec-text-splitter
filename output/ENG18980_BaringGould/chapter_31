<head>CHAPTER V.<hi>ATRIUM VESTÆ.</hi></head>
<p> When the Romans were a pastoral people at Alba, then it was the duty of the young girls to
      attend to the common hearth and keep the fire ever burning. To obtain fresh fire was not
      always possible, and at the best of times not easy. </p>
<p> Fire was esteemed sacred, being so mysterious, and so indispensable, and reverence was made
      to the domestic hearth (hestia) as the altar of the Fire goddess. </p>
<p> When the Roman settlement was made on the banks of the Tiber, one hut of a circular form
      was constituted the central hearth, and provision was made that thence every household should
      obtain its fire. This hut became the Temple of Hestia or Vesta, and certain girls were set
      apart to watch the fire that it should never become extinguished. </p>
<p> This was the origin of the institution of the Vestal Virgins, an institution which lasted
      from the founding of Rome in B. C. 753, to the disestablishment of Paganism, and the expulsion
      of the last Vestal, in A. D. 394, nearly eleven hundred and fifty years. </p>
<p> No girl under six or above ten years of age was admissible as priestess of the sacred fire,
      and but six damsels were allowed,—their term of service was thirty years, after which the
      Vestal was free to return home and to marry. The eldest of the Vestals was
      <pb n="246"/>termed Maxima, and she acted as superior or abbess over the community. </p>
<p> They enjoyed great possessions and privileges and were shown the most extraordinary
      respect. Seats of honor were accorded to the Vestals in the theatres, the amphitheatre and the
      circus. </p>
<p> The Vestals had other duties to perform beside that of maintaining the perpetual fire. They
      preserved the palladia of Rome, those mysterious articles on which the prosperity, nay, the
      very existence of the city was thought to depend. What these were was never known. The last
      Vestal carried them away and concealed them. With her death the secret was lost. Moreover,
      they took charge of the wills of great men, emperors and nobles, and in times of civil war
      they mediated between the conflicting parties. </p>
<p> Cornelia gently detached the hands of Domitia from the altar of Vesta, and led her within
      the college of the Vestals, the only door to which opened on the platform on which stood the
      Temple. </p>
<p> On entering, she found herself in an oblong court surrounded on all four sides by a
      cloister, the prototype of those to be in later days erected in the several convents and
      abbeys, and collegiate buildings of Christendom. In the open space in the midst was the
      circular treasury of the palladia, at one end was the well whence the virgins drew their
      water. The cloister was composed of marble columns, and sustained an upper gallery, also open
      to the court but roofed over and the roof supported on columns of red marble. </p>
<p> Between the columns below and above stood statues of the Superiors, who had merited
      commemoration.
      <pb n="247"/>There was no garden, the place for walking was the cloister. </p>
<p> Cornelia conducted Domitia into the reception-chamber, and kissing her said:— </p>
<p> “Under the protection of the Goddess you are safe.” </p>
<p> “I trust I in no way endanger your safety.” </p>
<p> “Mine!” Cornelia laughed. “There is none above me save the supreme pontiff, and so long as
      I do no wrong, no one can molest me. But tell me—what wilt thou do?” </p>
<p> “In the first place send out and bid my servants return home; and if they ask when to come
      for me, answer, when I send for them.” </p>
<p> “That is easily done,” said the Abbess. She clapped her hands and a slave girl answered and
      received this commission. </p>
<p> “Now,” said she, “now we come to the real difficulty. Here you are, but here you cannot
      tarry for long. For six days we may accord sanctuary, but for no more. After that we must
      deliver over the person who has taken refuge with us if required.” </p>
<p> “I have for some time considered what might be done. I have been so miserable, so degraded,
      so impatient, that I have racked my brain how to escape, and I see but one course. When we
      were at Cenchræa, my mother and I, we were in the house of a Greek client of our family, who
      was very kind to us, and his wife loved me well. If I could escape thither in disguise, then I
      think he would be able to secrete me, there are none so astute as are the Greeks, and who so
      love to outwit their masters.” </p>
<p> “But how is this possible?” </p>
<pb n="248"/>
<p> “That I know not—only let me get away from Rome, then trust my craft to enable me to evade
      pursuit. Let it be given out that I am here in fulfilment of a vow, then no suspicion will be
      roused, and I can take my measures.” </p>
<p> “It is not possible,” said Cornelia in some alarm. “Have you considered what your mother
      said? the Augustus is all-seeing and all-powerful, and has his hand everywhere.” </p>
<p> “Get me out of Italy, and I shall be safe. I will not return to the Palatine. If my life
      was hateful to me before, what will it be made now? Then <hi>he</hi> had some fear of his
      father and of his brother, now he has none to fear.” </p>
<p> The Vestal said, “Let me have time to think this over—and yet, it doth not seem to me
      feasible.” </p>
<p> “Get me but a beggar’s suit, and walnut juice, that I may stain my face and hands and arms.
      I will wash all this gold-dust from my hair—and I warrant you none will know me, with a staff
      and a wallet, I will go forth, right willingly. I will not return to <hi>him</hi>.” </p>
<p> “That is impossible. You—with your beauty—your nobility——” </p>
<p> “My nobility is of no account with me now.” </p>
<p> “You think so, and so it may be whilst untouched, but I am certain the least ruffle would
      make your pride flash out.” </p>
<p> Domitia remembered her resentment at the physician’s apparent familiarity. </p>
<p> “Well—my beauty will be disguised.” </p>
<p> “That nothing can conceal.” </p>
<p> “Oh! do not speak thus, or I shall mistrust you, as I mistrust every one else—except my
      slave Euphro
      <pb n="249"/>syne, and Eboracus, and Glyceria the actor’s wife. These seem to me the only true
      persons in the world. I would cast myself on them, but two are slaves and the other is
      paralyzed. Consider now, Cornelia, do you not understand how that one may reach a condition of
      mind or soul, call it which you will, when we become desperate. One must make an effort to
      break away into a new and free and better life, or succumb and become bad, and dead to all
      that is noble and true and good, hard of heart, callous to right and wrong. I am at that
      point. I know, if I were to return to <hi>him</hi>, and to be Empress of the Roman world, that
      I should have but one thing to live for—the pride of my place and the blazoning of my
      position; and to all that which lies deep within me, bleeding, crying out, hungering, and with
      dry lips—dead.” </p>
<p> “My dear lady, you were never made for what you are forced to become.” </p>
<p> “Then, why do the Gods thrust me on to a throne that I hate, tie me to a man that I loathe,
      surround me with a splendor that I despise. Tell me why? O Vesta! immaculate Goddess! how I
      would that I had been as one of thy consecrated virgins, to spend my days in this sweet house,
      and pure, peaceful cloister! Do you see? I must away. I am lost to all good—if I remain. I
      must away! it is my soul that speaks, that spreads its hands to thee, Cornelia! save me!” </p>
<p> She threw herself on her knees and extended her arms to the Vestal Abbess, caught her dress
      and kissed it. </p>
<p> Cornelia was deeply moved, </p>
<p> “I beseech you, rise,” she said, lifting the kneeling
      <pb n="250"/>suppliant, clasping her in her arms, and caressing her as a child. </p>
<p> “Hearken to me, Domitia, I can think but of one person that can assist us; that is my
      cousin Celer. He is a good man, and whatever I desire, he will strive to execute as a sacred
      duty. Yet the risk is great.” </p>
<p> “I pray you!—I pray you get him to assist me to escape.” </p>
<p> “He must furnish you with attendants. It will not be secure for you to be accompanied by
      any of your own servants. They might be traced. Celer has got a villa. Stay, I will go forth
      at once and see him. He can give counsel. Do nothing till my return.” </p>
<p> The Vestal Great-Mother left, and Domitia was glad to be alone. </p>
<p> The habitation of the Vestals was wonderfully peaceful, in the midst of busy, seething
      Rome, and in the centre of its greatest movement. As already said, it had no windows, and but
      one door that opened on the outer world. It drew all its air, all its light, from the patch of
      sky over the central court. Figures of Vestals glided about like spirits, and the white
      statues stood ghostlike on their pedestals. </p>
<p> But to be without flowers, without a peristyle commanding a landscape of garden and lake
      and trees and mountains! That was terrible. It would have been an unendurable life, but that
      the Vestal college was possessed of country seats, to which some of the elder of the
      sisterhood were allowed occasionally to go and take with them some one or two of the novices. </p>
<p> Although there were no flowers in the quadrangle, there was abundance of birds. In and out
      among the variegated marbles, perching on balustrades, fluttering
      <pb n="251"/>among the statues, were numerous pigeons, as marbled in tint as the sculptured
      stonework, and looking like animated pieces of the same; and a tame flamingo in gorgeous
      plumage basked himself, then strutted, and on seeing a Vestal approach hopped towards her.
      When, moreover, the same maiden drew water from the well, the pigeons came down like a fall of
      snow about her, clustering round the bucket to obtain a dip and a drink. </p>
<p> Several hours passed. At length the Abbess returned. She at once sought Domitia, who rose
      on her entry. Cornelia took both her hands within her own and said:— </p>
<p> “We women are fools, that is what Celer said, when I told him your plan. As he at once
      pointed out, it is impossible for you to lie hid anywhere in Italy—and impossible to escape
      from it, unknown to the Augustus. Any one endeavoring to assist you to escape would lose his
      life, most assuredly. “I cannot sell smoke to a clown,” said he bluntly—he is a plain man—“I
      will not put out a finger to assist in such an attempt, which would bring ruin on us all.
      But,” he said, “this may be done; let the Lady Domitia retire to one of her own villas, in the
      country, and commit the matter to the Vestals. Your entreaty is powerful, and if attended by
      two of the sisters—or perhaps better alone, for this is not a matter to be made public—go to
      the prince, and plead in the lady’s name, that thou feelest unequal to the weight of duties
      that will now fall on the Augusta, and that thy health is feeble and thou needest repose and
      country air—then he may yield his consent, at least to a temporary retreat.” But my kinsman
      Celer advised nothing beyond this. In very truth, nothing else can be done. Most men’s noses
      are crooked,—he
      <pb n="252"/>said—and he is a blunt man—and those who have straight ones do not like to follow
      them. But in your case, Lady Domitia, there is practically no other way.” </p>
<p> “Then I will to Gabii,” said Domitia with a sigh. “If he will force me back—there is the
      lake.” </p>
<p> Then, said Cornelia, “Dost thou know that blind-man Messalinus?” </p>
<p> “Full well—he hangs on to the Cæsar Domitian, like a leech.” </p>
<p> “Since thou didst enter the house of us Vestals, he hath been up and down the Via Nova and
      the Sacred Way, never letting this place out of his eye—blind though he be. Some say he scents
      as doth a dog, and that is why he works his head about from side to side snuffing the wind.
      When I went forth he detached two of his slaves to follow—and they went as far as myself and
      stood watching outside the door of the knight Celer, and when I came forth they were still
      there, and when I returned to the Atrium of Vesta, I found Messalinus peering with his
      sightless eyes round the corner. But, I trow, he sees through his servants’ eyes.” </p>
<p> “He is a bird of ill omen,” said Domitia, “a vulture scenting his prey.” </p>
