<head>CHAPTER XIV.<hi>IN THE TULLIANUM.</hi></head>
<p> No sooner had Domitia got the signet from the finger of the dead Emperor, than she hastened
      from the room, trembling, almost blind as to her course, but armed with more than her natural
      strength to force her way through those who filled the passage. </p>
<p> Parmenas was now there, and he cleared a way for her, and in a loud voice forbade any of
      the slaves to leave the palace; Petronius at the same time gave orders to the soldiers of the
      guard to remain where they were, keeping watch that none left to spread the tidings, until
      Cocceius Nerva had been communicated with, and the Senate had been summoned. </p>
<p> Domitia, however, made her way from among the excited and alarmed throng, and finding some
      of her own slaves, bade them bring Eboracus to her. </p>
<p> “I am here, lady,” answered the Briton. </p>
<p> “Then quick—with me. Not a moment is to be lost. Light a torch and lead the way.” </p>
<p> “Whither, mistress?” </p>
<p> “To the Tullianum.” </p>
<p> He stared at her in amazement. </p>
<p> “Quick—a life, a precious life is at stake. Not a minute must we delay or it will be too
      late.” </p>
<p> “I am ready, lady.” </p>
<p> He snatched a torch from an attendant, and advanced towards a postern gate that
      communicated with a flight of steps leading to the Forum. It was employed almost
      <pb n="320"/>wholly by the servants and was used for communication between the kitchen and the
      markets. </p>
<p> “Shall we take any one else with us?” asked Eboracus. He answered himself—“Yes—here is
      Euphrosyne. She shall attend, and a boy shall carry the link. At night—and on such a night, I
      must have both arms at my disposal.” </p>
<p> Domitia said nothing. She was eager to be on her way, was impatient of the smallest delay.
      Euphrosyne came up, and obeyed a sign from the Briton. He caught a scullion who was rubbing
      his sleepy eyes, and wondering what had caused the commotion, and had roused him from his bed.
      Eboracus thrust the torch into his hand and opened the door for the Empress. </p>
<p> Domitia stepped out to the head of the stairs. The rain had ceased, but the steps were
      running with water. The eaves dripped. The shrubs were laden with rain, they stooped their
      boughs and shed a load of moisture on the soil, then raised their leaves again, once more to
      accumulate the wet, and again to stoop and shower it down. Runnels conveying water from the
      roof were flowing as streams, noisily: the ground covered with pools, reflected the torch; as
      also every gleam from the retiring storm. Still in the distance thunder muttered, but it was a
      grumble of discontent at having failed to achieve all it had been sent to execute. </p>
<p> On such a night few would be abroad, except the patrols of the <foreign>Vigiles</foreign>
      and them there would be no difficulty in passing as the watchword was known to Eboracus, the
      word which allowed those only who could say it to traverse the streets at night in the
      respectable portions of the city. But there were no lamps, not even the feeble glimmer of a
      lantern slung in the midst of the street. Notwithstanding all the civili
      <pb n="321"/>zation of ancient Rome the art of lighting the thoroughfares at night was
      unknown. Such as were constrained to walk abroad after dark were attended by slaves bearing
      torches. </p>
<p> The streets of Rome had for long been of bad repute for the brawls and murders committed in
      them at night. Tipsy youths and rufflers had assaulted honest men, and should a woman be out
      after dark, she was certain of insult. Nero himself had distinguished himself in such vulgar
      performances. But under the Flavian princes much had been done to establish order and to
      ensure protection to life and purse of such as were out after dark, so that now, except in the
      slums, a citizen could visit his friends, a doctor his patients, by night, without fear of
      molestation. </p>
<p> And of all portions of Rome, the Forum with its splendid monuments, its rich temples,
      especially that of Saturn, that contained the city treasures, was most patrolled and therefore
      the safest. Eboracus had little expectation that his mistress would meet with rudeness or
      encounter danger, the rain must have swept the street of all idlers. </p>
<p> The long flight of steps was descended with caution, as they were slippery with rain,
      indeed with more caution than Domitia approved, so impatient was she to reach the object of
      her journey. The distance was not great. She had but to traverse the upper end of the Forum. </p>
<p> That at which she aimed was the prison of Rome. It lay at the foot of the Capitoline Hill,
      and consisted of an ancient well or subterranean chamber in which flowed a small spring. Above
      this was the prison, consisting of a series of cells that rose in stages to a considerable
      height, against the rock, the chambers being in part scooped out of the travestine. From the
      top
      <pb n="322"/>of the hill ran a set of steps called the Gemonian stair, and it was customary
      for State prisoners who had been condemned to death, after execution to be cast from the upper
      chamber of the Tullianum down the stairs; whence with hooks the corpses were dragged across
      the Forum and then flung into the Tiber. </p>
<p> To the house of the jailer, Domitia with her attendants made her way. She had been stopped
      once in crossing the Forum, but the watch recognized her, and saluted with respect, though
      with an expression of astonishment on his countenance at seeing Cæsar’s wife abroad at such a
      time of the night, in such weather and with such scant attendance. </p>
<p> On reaching the jailer’s door, Eboracus knocked. No answer was given. He knocked again and
      louder, and continued knocking, till at length a gruff voice from within called to know who
      was without, and what was wanted. </p>
<p> “Open—in the name of the Augustus,” said the British slave; and at once the keeper of the
      prison let down the bars and withdrew the bolts and chains, then carrying a lamp, peered out
      at those who demanded admittance. </p>
<p> Then Domitia stood forward. </p>
<p> “You have a prisoner here—Lucius Ælius Lamia?” </p>
<p> “Yes.” </p>
<p> “You must lead me to him.” </p>
<p>
<corr>The</corr> jailer appeared disconcerted, he held his lamp aloft and eyed the woman who
      spake. He did not know her, his light was feeble, and as it happened, he had seen little of
      the Empress. </p>
<p> “You do not know me,” said Domitia. “Know you this ring?” </p>
<p> The prison-keeper held the flame of his lamp to the
      <pb n="323"/>signet, and made the usual sign of respect and recognition. </p>
<p> “You are required to lead me within,” said Domitia. </p>
<p> The jailer at once stood aside, and suffered the Empress and her attendants to enter. Then
      he barred and bolted the door again. </p>
<p> “And now,” said Domitia, impatient at the leisurely proceeding of the man, “lead me to
      him.” </p>
<p> Without another word he went forward, holding his lamp down that those who followed might
      see the steps and not stumble at them. </p>
<p> “This way,” said he, “and bow your heads, the entrance is low; but most of them that pass
      this way have to hold their heads still lower when they are taken out. Look at these
      stones—great blocks built by the Kings—by Servius Tullus, they say. By Hercules! this is not a
      tavern where men tarry long, nor do they relish our fare. One thing I must say in our favor,
      we make no charge for our hospitality.” Thus the jailer muttered as he went along. </p>
<p> “Look there—on your right—there is the cell where Simon Bar Gioras, the Jew, was
      strangled—he who was the last to maintain the struggle against the God Titus, in defence of
      Jerusalem; and see—” he threw open a door. “Here is the Bath of Mamertius in which Jugurtha
      was starved, all in blackness of darkness and soaking in ice-cold water. What! Impatient—do
      you not care to see the sights and hear my gossip? Well, well—but I have pretty things to
      show. I have a shankbone of Appius Claudius, who committed suicide in yon cell, and a garment
      of Sejanus, and the very bowstring wherewith—I am going on as fast as may be. See! we have had
      Christians here also. There was another Jew, Simon Petrus by name, he was in this
      <pb n="324"/>cell, and I have the chain whereby he was bound, and I sell the links to the
      followers of the Nazarene,” he began to cackle. “By Hercules! the chain is long enough. They
      come for more links than there would be, were the chain to reach across the Tiber. But any bit
      of old iron will serve, and they are not particular—take any scrap and pay in silver. I am
      going as fast as may be. I am not young. Fast enough I warrant. He is in no hurry—not Lamia.
      He can wait. All the same to him whether we reach him now or an hour hence.” </p>
<p> Then Domitia, whose brow was beaded with cold sweat, like the stones of the vault that ran
      with moisture, laid hold of the prison-keeper’s arm and said:—“Tell me—is he—” she could not
      say the word, her heart beat so furiously, and everything swam before her eyes. </p>
<p> “Aye, aye, you shall see for yourself. Come from the Augustus to satisfy him that we do our
      work properly, I trow. I have not much strength in these old-hands, but my two sons are
      lusty—and say the word—they will bend your back and snap the spine, smite and shear off your
      head like a pumpkin under a scythe, twist, and the life is throttled out of you. Here—here we
      are. Go in and see for yourself that we are good workmen.” </p>
<p> He threw open a door and raised his lamp. </p>
<p> A low vaulted chamber was faintly illumined by the flame, the torch held by Eboracus was
      behind Domitia and the jailer; he had taken it from the link boy at the prison door. He and
      Euphrosyne attended their mistress, the boy was left without. </p>
<p> The old prison-keeper stood on one side. </p>
<p> “The order came yesterday,” said he, “and we are not slack in the execution.” </p>
<p> Domitia saw the figure of a man lying on the stone floor. She started forward— </p>
<pb n="325"/>
<p> “He sleeps!” </p>
<p> “I warrant you—right soundly.” </p>
<p> She uttered a smothered cry. </p>
<p> “Put down the lamp!” </p>
<p> She turned and faced the jailer. “Leave me alone with him. I will wake him. I know he but
      sleeps.” </p>
<p> The man hesitated. </p>
<p> Then Eboracus pressed forward and laid hold of the jailer and whispered—“Go without, it is
      the Augusta!” </p>
<p> The keeper of the prison started, raised his hand to his lips, bowed, set the lamp on the
      moist floor and drew back. </p>
<p> “Without! Without all!” ordered Domitia. </p>
<p> Then Eboracus pulled the jailer out of the cell. Euphrosyne stood doubtful whether to
      remain with her mistress or obey—but an impatient sign from the Empress drove her forth, and
      the British slave closed the door. </p>
<p> “He is dead,” said the jailer. “Did the Augustus desire to withdraw the order? His signet
      has arrived too late. The prisoner has been throttled by my sons.” </p>
<p> The old man and the two slaves remained for some quarter of an hour in the passage almost
      smothered by the smoke emitted by the torch. </p>
<p> From within they heard a voice—at intervals, now raised in weeping, then uttering low
      soothing tones, then raised in a cry as the <foreign>conclamatio</foreign> of hired wailers
      for the dead, calling on Lamia by name to return, to return, to leave the Shadowland and come
      back into light. </p>
<p> And then—a laugh. </p>
<p> A laugh so weird, so horrible, so unexpected, that with a thrust, without scruple, Eboracus
      threw open the door. </p>
<pb n="326"/>
<p> On the stone pavement sat Domitia, her hair dishevelled, and on her lap the head of the
      dead man. She was wiping his brow with her veil, stooping, kissing his lips, weeping, then
      laughing again—then pointing to purple letters, crossed L’s woven into his tunic. </p>
<p> Eboracus saw it all—her reason was gone. </p>
