<head>CHAPTER XV.<hi>DRAWING TO THE LIGHT.</hi></head>
<p> In the old home of Gabii, under the tender care of Euphrosyne and in the soothing company
      of Glyceria, little by little, stage by stage, Domitia recovered. </p>
<p> There was a horrible past to which no reference might be made. The true British slave,
      Eboracus, was ever at hand to help—when needed. Never a day, never half a day, but his honest
      face appeared at the door to inquire after his dear lady, and as her senses came flickering
      back, it was he to whom she clung to take her in his arms into the trellised walk, or when
      stronger to lead her where she could pick violets for Glyceria, and to pile about the feet of
      the little statue of the Good Shepherd. He took her a row on the lake and let her fish—he
      found nests of young birds and brought them to her; and all at once disclosed great powers of
      story-telling; he told marvellous British tales as to a little child, of the ploughing of Hu
      Cadarn, of Ceridwen and her cauldron. And he would sing—he fashioned himself a harp, of
      British shape, and sang as he accompanied himself, but his ballads were all in the Celtic
      tongue that Domitia could not understand—
      <pb n="327"/>nevertheless it soothed and pleased her to listen to his music. </p>
<p> Longa Duilia did not visit her often. She made formal duty calls at long intervals, and as
      Domitia became better, these visits grew proportionately fewer. </p>
<p> Duilia, as she herself said, was not created to be a nurse. She knew that some were fitted
      by nature to attend to the sick, and all that sort of thing—but it was not her gift. Society
      was her sphere in which she floated and which she adorned, but she was distraught and drooping
      in a sick-room. She wished she had the faculty—and all that sort of thing—but all women were
      not cast in the same mould, run out of the same metal—and, my dear, parenthetically—some are
      of lead, others of Corinthian brass—and which are which it is not for me to say—she thanked
      the Gods it was so. </p>
<p> Nor did the visits and efforts to amuse, of Duilia, avail anything towards Domitia’s cure.
      On the contrary, she was always worse after her mother had been with her. The old lady ripped
      up ill-healed sores, harped on old associations, could not check her tongue from scolding. </p>
<p> “My poor dear child—I never made a greater blunder in my life—I, too, who have the pedigree
      at my finger’s ends—as to fancy that there was any connection with those Flavians. My dear!
      yellow hair is quite out of fashion now, quite out. Look at mine, a raven’s wing is not
      darker. It was through Vespasia Polla—I thought we were related—stupid that I was—it was the
      Vipsanians we were allied to, not those low and beggarly Vespasians. As the Gods love me, I
      believe Polla’s father was an army contractor. But I have made it all right. I have smudged
      out the line I had
      <pb n="328"/>added to the family tree, and as for the wax heads of those Flavians, I have had
      them melted up. Will you believe it—I had the mask of Domitian run into a pot and that stupid
      Lucilla did not put a cover on it, and the rats have eaten it—eaten all the wax. I hope it has
      clogged their stomachs and given them indigestion. They doubtless thought it was dripping. But
      I really have made a most surprising discovery. I find there was an alliance with the
      Cocceii—most respectable family, very ancient, admirable men all—and so there is a sort of
      cousinship with the present admirable prince. His brother Aulus—rather old perhaps—but an
      estimable man—is—well—may be—in a word, I intend to give a little supper—a dainty affair—all
      in the best style—so sorry you can’t be there, my dear Domitia—but of course absolutely
      impossible. Your state of health and all that sort of thing. Don’t be surprised if you
      hear—but there, there—he is rather old though, for one who is only just turning off the very
      bloom of life and beauty.” </p>
<p> After such a visit and such talk the mind of Domitia was troubled for several days. She
      became timid, alarmed at the least noise, and distraught. But then the poor crippled woman
      succeeded in comforting and laying her troubles, and the painful expression faded from her
      face. It became placid, but always with a sadness that was inseparable from the eyes, and a
      tremulousness of the lips, as though a very little—a rough word or two—would dissolve her into
      tears. </p>
<p> With the spring, the growing light, the increasing warmth, the bursting life in plant and
      insect, she began to amend more steadily, and relapses became fewer. </p>
<p> One sweet spring day, when Glyceria had been car
      <pb n="329"/>ried forth into the garden, and Domitia sat on the turf near her with purple
      anemones in her lap, that she was binding into a garland, the paralyzed woman was startled by
      hearing Domitia suddenly speak of the past. </p>
<p> She spoke, and continued weaving the flowers, “My Glyceria, I intend this for the little
      temple of my father. It is all I can do for him—to give flowers where his ashes lie—but it
      does not content me. There were two whom I loved and looked up to as the best of men, and both
      are gone—gone to dust: my own dearest father, and my lover, my husband, Lamia. I cannot bear
      to think of them as heaps of ashes or as wandering ghosts. When that thought comes over me, I
      seem to be as one drowning, and then darkness is before my eyes. I cannot cry—I smother.” </p>
<p> “Why should you think of them as wandering ghosts or as heaps of dust?” </p>
<p> “I know that they are dust—I suppose they are shadows. But of anything else, all is
      guess-work, we know nothing—and that is so horrible. I love two only—have loved two only—and
      they are no more than shadows. No, no! I mean not that.” She flung her arms about Glyceria,
      and laid her cheek against that of the sick woman. “No, I do love you, and I love Euphrosyne
      and I love Eboracus. But I mean—I mean in a different manner. One was my father, and the other
      my husband. It is so terribly sad to think they are lost to me like yesterday or last summer.” </p>
<p> “They are not lost. You will see them again.” </p>
<p> “See my father! See my Lamia!” </p>
<p> “Yes—I know it will be so.” </p>
<p> “O, Glyceria, do not say such things. You make my heart jump. How can it be? They have
      been.” </p>
<pb n="330"/>
<p> “They are and will be. Death is swallowed up in Life.” </p>
<p> “That is impossible. Death is death and nothing more.” </p>
<p> Then Glyceria took the hand of Domitia, and looking into her eyes, said solemnly: “Dost
      thou remember having asked me about the Fish?” </p>
<p> “Yes—this amulet,” answered the noble lady, and she detached the cornelian from her throat,
      and held it in the hand not engaged by Glyceria. “Yes—I recollect—there was some mystery, but
      what was it?” </p>
<p> “The Fish is a symbol, as I said once before, and it is no amulet.” </p>
<p> “Of what is it the symbol?” </p>
<p> “Of One who died—who tasted of the bitterness of the parting of soul and body, and who went
      into the region of Shadows and returned—the soul to the body, and rose from the dead, and by
      the virtue of His resurrection gives power to all who believe in Him to rise in like manner.” </p>
<p> “And he could tell about what the ghosts do—how they wander?” </p>
<p> “I cannot say that. There would be no comfort in that. He rose to give us joy and to rob
      death of its terrors.” </p>
<p> “But what has this to do with the Fish?” </p>
<p> “You know what the word Fish is in Greek.” </p>
<p> “Very well.” </p>
<p> “Take each letter of that word, and each letter is the first of words that contain the very
      substance of the Christian belief—Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Saviour.” </p>
<p> Domitia looked at the little cornelian fish; she could not understand. </p>
<pb n="331"/>
<p> “I believe that one could die and wake again. I have fainted and come round. And he might
      say what was in the spirit world into which he had been—but the region of ghosts is very
      dreary, very sad.” </p>
<p> “Nay, He can do more. As He rose, He can raise us to new life, and He will do it, for He is
      God. He made us, and He will recall us from death.” </p>
<p> “What—my father! Lucius! I shall see them again—not as shadows, but as they were—?” </p>
<p> “Not so—not as they were, mortal; but raised to an immortal life.” </p>
<p> “I shall kiss my darling father—put my arms around my Lucius from whom I have been parted
      so long, and so cruelly, and who has been so—so true to me.” </p>
<p> Then Domitia burst into tears. </p>
<p> Glyceria stroked her hand. </p>
<p> “There—you see how joyous is our hope. Death is nothing—it is only a good-bye for a bit to
      meet again.” </p>
<p> “O, Glyceria! O, if I could see them—O Glyceria! O, you should not have said this if it be
      not true. My heart will break. O, if it might be so! if I could! but once only—for a moment——” </p>
<p> “Nay, that would not suffice; forever, never to be separated; no more tears, no more
      death.” </p>
<p> “O, Glyceria—not another word—I cannot bear it. My heart is over full. Another time. My
      head, my head! O, if it might—it could be!” </p>
<p> Next day Glyceria saw by the red eyes of Domitia that she had slept little and had wept
      much. She did not turn the conversation to the same topic; she wisely waited for the noble
      lady to begin on it herself, and she judged that she would take some time to consider what had
      been spoken about and to digest it. </p>
<pb n="332"/>
<p> And in fact Domitia made no further allusion to the matter for some days. But after about a
      week, when alone with the paralyzed woman, she said to her abruptly: “You have never been in
      Syria?” </p>
<p> “No, dear lady.” </p>
<p> “I have—and I have been on the confines of the desert and looked away, as far as the eye
      could reach, and have seen nothing but sand and barren rock. Behind me a rose-garden,
      syringas, myrtle and citron trees, and murmuring streams, before me—no green leaf, only death.
      It is to me, as I stand now and look back on my life as if it were that barren desert; and the
      fearful thing is—I dare not turn and look the other way, for it is into impenetrable night.
      But no, my life is not all desolation, there are just two green spots in it where the date
      palms stand and there are wells—my childhood, when I sat on my father’s knee and cuddled into
      his arms; and once again, when I was recovering from the loss of him and was basking in the
      joy of my love for Lucius Lamia. All the rest—” she made a gesture of despair—“Death.” </p>
<p> “Dearest lady! I would like to turn you about and show you that where you think only
      blackness reigns, lies a beautiful garden, a paradise, and One at the gate who beckons and
      says, Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” </p>
<p> “Ah! but that may be all fancy and dream work like the promises of the Magi, and the
      mysteries of Isis.” </p>
<p> Glyceria got no further than this. Domitia was disposed to talk with her on her hope, and
      on the Christian belief, but always with reserve and some mistrust. </p>
<p> There were old prejudices to be overcome, there was the consciousness that the promises so
      largely made
      <pb n="333"/>by the votaries of the many cults from East and South who came to Rome were
      unfulfilled, and this made her unable to place confidence in the new religion held by slaves
      and ignorant people, however alluring it might seem. </p>
<p> Among the very few who came to Gabii during her illness and convalescence, was Flavia
      Domitilla, the widow of Flavius Clemens, who had been put to death by Domitian. Domitilla had
      been banished, but returned immediately on the death of the tyrant. She had suffered as had
      Domitia. In her manner and address there was something so gentle and assuring, that the poor
      ex-empress, in the troubled condition of her brain, was drawn to her, and after her visits
      felt better. She knew, or rather supposed, that Domitilla was a Christian. Her husband had
      been one, and had suffered for his faith. </p>
<p> It was with real pleasure that she ran to welcome her one morning, when the steward entered
      and announced: “The Lady Flavia Domitilla.” </p>
