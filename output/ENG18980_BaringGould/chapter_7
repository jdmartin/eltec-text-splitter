<head>CHAPTER VII.<hi>THE FACE OF THE DEAD.</hi></head>
<p> The Imperial galley! </p>
<p> Domitia leaped to her feet. Everything was forgotten in the one thought that before her, on
      the sea, floated the man who had caused the death of her father. </p>
<p> “Lucius I must see——” </p>
<p> He drew her forward, but at the same time checked her speech. </p>
<p> “Every word dropped is fraught with danger,” he said. “What know you but that yon physician
      be a spy?” </p>
<p> “He is not that,” she answered, “show him to me—him——” </p>
<p> They walked together to the bows. </p>
<p> With the declining of the sun, the light wind had died away, and, although the sea heaved
      after the recent storm, like the bosom of a sleeping girl, in the stillness of the air, the
      sail drooped and the ship made no way. </p>
<p> Accordingly the sail was furled, and, by the advice of the mate, the rowers, who had rested
      during the day, were summoned to their benches and bidden work the oars during the night. </p>
<pb n="53"/>
<p> The sky was clear, and the stars were beginning to twinkle. No part of the voyage in calm
      weather would be less dangerous than this, which might be performed at night, across open sea,
      unbroken by rocks and sand-banks. </p>
<p> So long as the vessel had to thread her way between the headland of Araxus and the
      Echinades, and then betwixt the isles of Cephalonia and Zacynthus, an experienced navigator
      was necessary, and caution had to be exercised both in the management of the sail and in the
      manipulation of the helm. But now all was plain, and the mate had retired below to rest.
      During the time he reposed Lamia took charge of the vessel, assisted by the second mate. </p>
<p> “You take your meridian by Polaris, Castor and Pollux, steer due west; if there be a slight
      deviation from the right course, that is a trifle. I will set it right when my watch comes.” </p>
<p> Such was the mate’s injunction as he retired below. </p>
<p> “The steersman is done up,” said Lamia; “he shall rest now, and no better man can be found
      to replace him than Eboracus, who has been accustomed to the stormy seas of Britain, and whose
      nerves are of iron.” </p>
<p> Indeed, the <foreign>gubernator</foreign> or helmsman had hard work for his arms. The two
      enormous paddles had short cross-pieces let into them, like the handles of a scythe, and the
      clumsy and heavy mechanism for giving direction to the head of the vessel was worked by
      leverage in this manner. </p>
<p> The sailors managed everything on deck, the cordage, the anchors, the sail and the boats.
      In rough weather they undergirded the ship; that is to say,
      <pb n="54"/>passed horizontal cords round her to brace the spars together so as to facilitate
      resistance to the strain when laboring against the waves. The sailors were under the direction
      of the captain or trierarch, so called whether he commanded a trireme or a Liburnian of two
      benches. </p>
<p> On deck the steersman occupied a sort of sentry-box in the stern, and beside him sat the
      mate, the second mate, and often also the captain, forming a sort of council for the direction
      of the vessel. </p>
<p> It was a favorite figure in the early Church to represent the Bishop as the helmsman of the
      sacred vessel, and the presbyters who sat about him as the mates occupying the stern bench. As
      already said, in a Roman vessel, there was a lack of that unity in direction under the captain
      to which we are accustomed. A military officer was always supreme everywhere on sea as on
      land. </p>
<p> When the sailors were engaged in sailing, then the rowers rested or caroused, and when they
      in turn bowed over the oars, the sailors had leisure. </p>
<p> The sun went down in the west, lighting up the sky above where he set with a rainbow or
      halo of copper light fading into green. </p>
<p> The night fell rapidly, and the stars looked out above and around, and formed broken
      reflections in the sea. </p>
<p> In winter the foam that broke and was swept to right and left had none of the flash and
      luminosity it displayed in summer, when the water was warm. </p>
<p> Already in the wake the Greek isles and mountain ridges had faded into night. </p>
<p> The oars dipped evenly, and the vessel sped for
      <pb n="55"/>ward at a speed equal to that of a modern Channel steamer. </p>
<p> At a signal from Lamia the mourners on the quarter-deck ceased to intone their wail. </p>
<p> He and Domitia stood in the bows and looked directly before them. They could see a large
      vessel ahead, of three banks of oars, but she floated immovable on the gently heaving, glassy
      sea. The oars were all shipped and she was making no way. </p>
<p> The deck sparkled with lights. Torches threw up red flames, lamps gave out a fainter yellow
      gleam. To the cordage lights had been suspended, and braziers burning on the quarter-deck, fed
      with aromatic woods, turned the water around to molten fire, and sent wafts of fragrance over
      the sea. </p>
<p> The twang of a lyre and the chirp of a feeble voice were faintly audible; and then, after a
      lull, ensued a musical shout of applause in rhythmic note. </p>
<p> “It is the Augustus singing,” said Lamia in a tone of smothered rage and mortification.
      “And he has his band of adulators about him.” </p>
<p> “But why do not the rowers urge on the vessel?” asked Domitia. </p>
<p> “Because the piper giving the stroke would be committing high treason in drowning the song
      of the princely performer. By the Gods! the grinding of the oars in the rowlocks and the plash
      in the water would drown even his most supreme trills.” </p>
<p> “Hast thou seen him on the stage, Lamia?” </p>
<p> “The Gods forbid,” answered the young man passionately, “this fancy to be the first of
      singers and mimes had not come on him before I left Rome for Syria. To think of it, that
      he—the head of the magis
      <pb n="56"/>tracy, of the army, of the senate, of the priesthood, should figure as Apollo,
      half naked, in a gold-powdered wig, and with painted cheeks before sniggering Greeks! The Gods
      deliver me from such a sight!” </p>
<p> “But you will behold it now. As we speed along we shall overtake this floating dramatic
      booth.” </p>
<p> “I will give her a wide berth, and stop my ears with wax, though, by the Gods! this is no
      siren song.” </p>
<p> Domitia leaned over the side of the vessel. </p>
<p> “Are they sharp, Lucius?” </p>
<p> “Are what sharp, Domitia?” </p>
<p> “The beaks.” </p>
<p> “Sharp as lancets.” </p>
<p> “And strong?” </p>
<p> “Strong as rams.” </p>
<p> “Then, Lucius, we will not give her wide berth. You loved my father. You regard me. You
      will do what I desire, for his sake and for mine.” </p>
<p> “What would you have of me?” </p>
<p> “Ram her!” </p>
<p> Lucius Lamia started, and looked at the girl. </p>
<p> She laid her hand on his arm, and gripped it as with an iron vice. </p>
<p> “Run her down, Lucius! Sink the accursed murderer and mountebank in the depths of the
      Ionian sea.” </p>
<p> Lamia gasped for breath. </p>
<p> She looked up into his face. </p>
<p> “Can it be done?” </p>
<p> “By Hercules! we could rip up her side.” </p>
<p> “Then do so.” </p>
<p> He stood undecided. </p>
<p> “Hearken to me. None will suspect our intention as we swiftly shoot up—no, none in this
      vessel, only
      <pb n="57"/>Eboracus must be in it. Suddenly we will round and ram and welt her; and send the
      new Orion with his fiddle to the fishes. By the Furies! We shall hear him scream. We shall see
      him beat the waves. Lucius, let me have a marline-spike to dash at him as he swims and split
      his skull and let out his brains for the fishes to banquet on them.” </p>
<p> “We risk all our lives.” </p>
<p> “What care I? My father, your friend, will be avenged.” </p>
<p> Still Lamia stood in unresolve. </p>
<p> “Lucius! I will twine my white arms about your neck, and will kiss you with my red lips,
      the moment his last scream has rung in my ears.” </p>
<p> “In the name of Vengeance—then,” said Lamia. </p>
<p> “Eboracus I can count on,” said Domitia. </p>
<p> “There is the under-mate. If any one on board suspect our purpose, we are undone.” </p>
<p> “None need suspect,” said the girl. “Say that the prince is holding festival on board the
      trireme, and that it behoves us to salute. None will think other than that we are befooling
      ourselves like the rest. At the right moment, before any has a thought of thy purpose, call
      for the double-stroke, and trust Eboracus—he will put the helm about, and in a moment we run
      her down.” </p>
<p> Lamia walked to the quarter-deck, bade the mourning women go below. He extinguished the
      funeral torches, and threw the ashes from the tripod into the sea. Then the Artemis was no
      longer distinguishable by any light she bore. </p>
<p> Next Lamia walked aft, and in a restrained voice said: </p>
<pb n="58"/>
<p> “The vessel of Cæsar is before us. We dare not pass without leave asked and granted.” </p>
<p> “All right, sir,” said the second mate. “Any orders below?” </p>
<p> “Keep on at present speed. When I call Slack, then let them slacken. When I call Double,
      then at once with full force double.” </p>
<p> “Right, sir. I will carry down instructions.” </p>
<p> The mate went to the ladder and descended into the hold. </p>
<p> There were now left on deck only Lamia, Domitia, the steersman, Eboracus, one sailor and
      the physician, who was leaning over the bulwarks looking north at the glittering constellation
      of Cassiopea’s Chair. </p>
<p> He was near the quarter-deck, in the fore part of the vessel, and had been unobserved in
      the darkness by Lamia and Domitia, till they returned aft. </p>
<p> Then the young man started as he observed him. </p>
<p> Was it possible that the man had overheard the words spoken? There was nothing in the
      attitude or manner of the physician to show that he entertained alarm. Lamia resolved on
      keeping an eye upon him that he did not communicate with the crew. </p>
<p> Luke returned aft when the young people came in that direction, and seated himself quietly
      on a bench. </p>
<p> Eboracus was rapidly communicated with and gained. </p>
<p> The Artemis flew forward, noiselessly, save for the plunge of the oars and the hiss of the
      foam, as it rushed by like milk, and from the hold sounded the muffled note of the
       <foreign>symphonicius</foreign> or piper. </p>
<p> Every moment the vessel neared the imperial galley, and sounds of revelry became audible.
      Nothing
      <pb n="59"/>showed that any on board were aware of the approach of a Liburnian. </p>
<p> It was now seen that tables were spread on the deck of the Imperial vessel, and that the
      prince and his attendants, and indeed the entire crew were engaged in revelry. </p>
<p> Between the courses which were served, Nero ascended the quarter-deck, and sang or else
      delivered a recitation from a Greek tragedian, or a piece of his own composition. </p>
<p> If the approach of the bireme was observed, which did not seem to be the case, it caused no
      uneasiness. The Emperor’s vessel had been accompanied by a convoy, but the ships had been
      dispersed by the storm; and the bireme, if perceived, was doubtless held to be one of the
      fleet. </p>
<p> And now Helios, the confidant of Nero, had ascended the quarter-deck to his master, and
      began to declaim the speech of the attendant in the Electra descriptive of the conquests of
      Orestes—applying the words, by significant indications to the prince returning a victor from
      the Grecian games. </p>
<p> “He, having come to the glorious pageantry of the sports in Greece, entered the lists to
      win the Delphic prizes, he, the admired of every eye. And having started from his goal in
      wondrous whirls he sped along the course, and bore away the of all coveted prize of victory.
      But that I may tell thee in few words amidst superfluity I have never known such a man of
      might and deeds as he—” and he bowed and waved his hands towards Nero. </p>
<p> A roar of applause broke out, interrupted by a cry from Nero who suddenly beheld a dark
      ship plunge
      <pb n="60"/>out of the night and come within the radiance of the lights on board his vessel. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, on the Artemis, with set face sat Eboracus, guiding the head of the Liburnian as
      directed. He could see the twinkling lights, and hear the sounds of rejoicing. </p>
<p> “Slack speed,” called Lamia. </p>
<p> “Slack your oars,” down into the hold. </p>
<p> There was a pause—all oars held poised for a moment. </p>
<p> “Double!” shouted Lamia. </p>
<p> “Double your oars!” down the ladder. </p>
<p> Instantly the water hissed about the bows, and the oars plunged. </p>
<p> Eboracus by a violent movement threw himself and his entire weight on the handle of one
      paddle, so as to turn the bireme about, and ram her midships into the Imperial trireme, when
      suddenly, without a word, Luke had drawn a knife through the thong that restrained the paddle,
      and instantly the <foreign>pedalion</foreign> leaped out of place, and would have gone
      overboard, had not the physician caught and retained it. </p>
<p> Immediately the direction of the Artemis was altered and in place of running into the
      trireme, she swerved and swung past the Imperial galley without touching her. </p>
<p> Nero, white with alarm and rage shrieked from the quarter-deck, </p>
<p> “Who commands?” </p>
<p> Then to those by him, “Pour oil on the flames.” </p>
<p> At once from the braziers, tongues of brilliant light leaped high into the air. </p>
<p> “The name!” yelled the furious prince. </p>
<pb n="61"/>
<p> Then came the reply:— </p>
<p> “Cnæus Domitius Corbulo.” </p>
<p> And by the glare he saw, standing by the mast, distinct against the darkness of the night
      behind, the form of a man—and the face was the face of the murdered general. </p>
<p> Nero staggered back—and would have fallen unless caught by Helios. </p>
<p> “The dead pursue me,” he gasped. “Wife, mother, brother, and now, Corbulo!” </p>
