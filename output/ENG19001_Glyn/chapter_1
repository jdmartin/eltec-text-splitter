<t:head>NAZEBY HALL</t:head>
<t:p>It was perhaps a fortunate thing for Elizabeth that her ancestors went back to the Conquest,
     and that she numbered at least two Countesses and a Duchess among her relatives. Her father had
     died some years ago, and, her mother being an invalid, she had lived a good deal abroad. But,
     at about seventeen, Elizabeth began to pay visits among her kinsfolk. It was after arriving at
     Nazeby Hall, for a Cricket Week, that she first wrote home.</t:p>
<t:p>Nazeby Hall, <t:hi>26th July</t:hi>.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Afternoon Tea</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>Dearest Mamma,—I got here all right, without even a smut on my face, for Agnès tidied me up
     in the brougham before we arrived at the gate. The dust in the train was horrid. It is a nice
     house. They were at tea when I was ushered in; it was in the hall—I suppose it was because it
     was so windy outside. There seemed to be a lot of people there; and they all stopped talking
     suddenly, and stared at me as if I were a new thing in the Zoo, and then, after a minute, went
     on with their conversations at the point they had left off.</t:p>
<t:p>Lady Cecilia pecked my cheek, and gave me two fingers; and asked me, in a voice right up at
     the top, how were you. I said you were better, and—you know what you told me to say. She
     murmured something while she was listening to what a woman with a sweet frock and green eyes
     was saying at the other end of the table. There was heaps of tea. She waved vaguely for me to
     sit down, which I did; but there was a footstool near, and it was half dark, so I fell over
     that, but not very badly, and got safely to my seat.</t:p>
<t:p>Lady Cecilia—continuing her conversation across the room all the time—poured out a cup of
     tea, with lumps and <t:hi>lumps</t:hi> of sugar in it, and lots of cream, just what you would give
     to a child for a treat! and she handed it to me, but I said, "Oh! please, Lady Cecilia, I don't
     take sugar!" She has such bulgy eyes, and she opened them wide at me, perfectly astonished, and
     said, "Oh! then please ring the bell; I don't believe there is another clean cup." Everybody
     stopped talking again, and looked at me, and the green-eyed lady giggled—and I rang the bell,
     and this time didn't fall over anything, and so presently I got some tea. Just as I was
     enjoying such a nice cake, and watching all the people, quite a decent man came up and sat down
     behind me. Lady Cecilia had not introduced me to anybody, and he said, "Have you come a long
     way?" And I said, "Yes." And he said, "It must have been dusty in the train," and I said it
     was—and he was beginning to say something more, when the woman with the green eyes said,
     "Harry, do hand me the cucumber sandwiches," and so he had to get up, and just then Sir Trevor
     came in, and he was glad to see me. He is a jolly soul, and he said I was eight when he last
     saw me, and seemed quite surprised I had grown any taller since! Just as though people could
     stay at eight! Then he patted my cheek, and said, "You're a beauty, Elizabeth," and Lady
     Cecilia's eyes bulged at him a good deal, and she said to me, "Wouldn't you like to see your
     room?" and I said I wasn't a bit in a hurry, but she took me off, and here I am; and I am going
     to wear my pink silk for dinner, and will finish this by-and-by.</t:p>
<t:p>12.30.—Well, I have had dinner, and I found out a good many of their names—they mostly
     arrived yesterday. The woman with the green eyes is Mrs. de Yorburgh-Smith. I am sure she is a
      <t:hi>pig</t:hi>. The quite decent man, "Harry," is a Marquis—the Marquis of Valmond—because he
     took Lady Cecilia in to dinner. He is playing in the Nazeby Eleven.</t:p>
<t:p>There is a woman I like, with stick-out teeth; her name is Mrs. Vavaseur. She knows you, and
     she is awfully nice, though so plain, and she never looks either over your head, or all up and
     down, or talks to you when she is thinking of something else. There are heaps more women, and
     the eleven men, so we are a party of about twenty-five; but you will see their names in the
     paper.</t:p>
<t:p>Such a bore took me in! He began about the dust again, but I could not stand that, so I said
     that every one had already asked me about it. So he said "Oh!" and went on with his soup.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>The Cricket Talk</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>At the other side was another of the Eleven, and he said, Did I like cricket? And I said, No,
     I hated always having to field (which was what I did, you know, when I played with the Byrne
     boys at Biarritz); and I asked him if he was a good player, and he said "No," so I said I
     supposed he always had to field too, then; and he said, No, that sometimes they allowed him a
     bat, and so I said I was sure that wasn't the same game I played; and he laughed as if I had
     said something funny—his name is Lord George Lane—and the other one laughed too, and they both
     looked idiots, and so I did not say any more about that. But we talked on all the time, and
     every one else seemed to be having such fun, and they all call each other by pet names, and
     shorten up all their adjectives (it <t:hi>is</t:hi> adjectives I mean, not adverbs). I am sure you
     made a mistake in what you told me, that all well-bred people behave nicely at dinner, and sit
     up, because they don't a bit; lots of them put their elbows on the table, and nearly all sat
     anyhow in their chairs. Only Lady Cecilia and Mrs. Vavaseur behaved like you; but then they are
     both quite old—over forty.</t:p>
<t:p>They all talk about things that no stranger could understand, but I dare say I shall pick it
     up presently. And after dinner, in the drawing-room, Lady Cecilia did introduce me to two
     girls—the Roose girls—you know. Well, Lady Jane is the best of the two; Lady Violet is a lump.
     They both poke their heads, and Jane turns in her toes. They have rather the look in their eyes
     of people with tight boots. Violet said, "Do you bicycle?" and I said, "Yes, sometimes;" and
     she said, with a big gasp: "Jane and I adore it. We have been ten miles since tea with Captain
     Winchester and Mr. Wertz."</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>An African Millionaire</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>I did not think that interesting, but still we talked. They asked me stacks of questions, but
     did not wait for the answers much. Mr. Wertz is the African millionaire. He does not play
     cricket, and, when the men came in afterwards, he crossed over to us, and Jane introduced him
     to me when he had talked a little. He is quite a sort of gentleman, and is very much at home
     with every one. He laughed at everything I said. Mrs. Smith (such bosh putting "de Yorburgh"
     on!) sat on a big sofa with Lord Valmond, and she opened and shut her eyes at him, and Jane
     Roose says she takes every one's friend away; and Lord George Lane came up, and we talked, and
     he wasn't such an idiot as at dinner, and he has nice teeth. All the rest, except the Rooses
     and me, are married—the women, I mean—except Miss La Touche, but she is just the same, because
     she sits with the married lot, and they all chat together, and Violet Roose says she is a cat,
     but I think she looks nice; she is so pretty, and her hair is done at the right angle, because
     it is like Agnès does mine, and she has nice scent on; and I hope it won't rain to-morrow, and
     good-night, dear Mamma.—Your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:hi>P.S.</t:hi>—Jane Roose says Miss La Touche will never get married; she is too smart, and all
     the married women's men talk to her, and that the best tone is to look rather dowdy; but I
     don't believe it, and I would rather be like Miss La Touche. E.</t:p>
<t:p>Elizabeth received an immediate reply to her letter, and the next one began:</t:p>
<t:p>Nazeby Hall, <t:hi>28th July</t:hi>.</t:p>
<t:p>Dearest Mamma,—I <t:hi>am</t:hi> sorry you find I use bad grammar and write incoherently, and you
     don't quite approve of my style; but you see it is just because I am in a hurry. I don't speak
     it; but if I must stop to think of grammar and that, I should never get on to tell you what I
     am doing here, so do, dear Mamma, try and bear it bravely. Well, everybody came down to
     breakfast yesterday in a hat, and every one was late—that is, every one who came down at all,
     the rest had theirs upstairs.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>The Cricket Match</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>The cricket began, and it was really a bore. We sat in a tent, and all the nice men were
     fielding (it is always like that), and the married lot sat together, and talked about their
     clothes, and Lady Doraine read a book. She is pretty too, but has big ears. Her husband is
     somewhere else, but she does not seem to miss him; and the Rooses told me her hair used to be
     black, and that they have not a penny in the world, so I think she must be clever and nice to
     be able to manage her clothes so well. They are perfectly lovely, and I heard her say her maid
     makes them.</t:p>
<t:p>Miss La Touche happened to be next me, so she spoke to me, and said my hat was "too devey for
     words" (the blue one you got at Caroline's); and by-and-by we had lunch, and at lunch Lord
     Valmond came and sat by me, and so Mrs. Smith did too, and she gushed at me. He seemed rather
     put out about something—I suppose it was having to field all the time.—and she talked to him
     across me, and she called him "Harry" lots of times, and she always says things that have
     another meaning. But they all do that—repeat each other's Christian names in a sentence, I
     mean—just like you said that middle-class people did when you were young, so I am sure
     everything must have changed now.</t:p>
<t:p>Well, after lunch, all the people in the county seemed to come; some of them had driven
     endless miles, and we sat apart, I suppose to let them see how ordinary we thought them; and
     Lady Cecilia was hardly polite, and the others were more or less rude; but presently something
     happened—I don't know what—and the nice men had not to field any more. Perhaps they could not
     stand it any longer, and so every one who had been yawning woke up, and Mr. Wertz, who had been
     writing letters all this time, appeared, and Lady Doraine made room for him beside her, and
     they talked; and when our Eleven had drunk something they came and lay on the grass near us,
     and we had such a nice time. There is a beautiful man here, and his name is Sir Dennis Desmond,
     and his grandfather was an Irish King, and he talks to me all the time, and his mother looks at
     him and frowns; and I think it silly of her, don't you? And if I were a man I wouldn't visit
     with my mother if she frowned at me. Do you know her? She dresses as if she were as young as I
     am. She had a blue muslin on this morning, and her hair is red with green stripes in it, and
     she is all white with thick pink cheeks, and across the room she doesn't look at all bad; but
     close! Goodness gracious she looks a hundred! And I would much sooner have nice white hair and
     a cap than look like that, wouldn't you? I'll finish this when I come to bed.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Sir Dennis Desmond</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>12.30.—What <t:hi>do</t:hi> you think has happened? Sir Dennis sat beside me on the sofa just as
     he did last night—but I forget, I have not yet told you of yesterday and last night; but never
     mind now, I must get on. Well, he said I was a perfect <t:hi>darling</t:hi>, but that he never
     could get a chance to say a word to me alone, but that if I would only drop my glove outside my
     door it would be all right; and I thought that such a <t:hi>ridiculous</t:hi> thing to say, that I
     couldn't help laughing, and Lady Cecilia happened to be passing, and so she asked me what I was
     laughing at, and so I told her what he had said, and asked why? There happened to be a pause
     just then and, as one has to speak rather loud to Lady Cecilia to attract her attention, every
     one heard, and they all looked <t:hi>flabergasted;</t:hi> and then all shrieked with laughter, and
     Sir Dennis said so crossly, "Little fool!" and Lady Desmond simply glared at me, and Lady
     Cecilia said, "Really, Elizabeth!" and Sir Dennis got purple in the face, and Jane Roose
     whispered, "How could you dare with his wife listening!" and every one talked and chaffed. It
     was too stupid about nothing; but the astonishing part is, that funny old thing I thought was
     the mother turns out to be <t:hi>his wife!</t:hi>
</t:p>
<t:p>Imagine! years and years older than him! Jane Roose said he had to marry her because her
     husband died; but I think that the most absurd reason I ever heard, don't you? Lots of people's
     husbands die, and they don't have to get married off again at once—so why should that ugly old
     thing, specially when there are such heaps of nice girls about?</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>A Man of Honour</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>Jane Roose said it was so honourable of him, but I call it crazy—unless, perhaps, he was a
     great friend of the husband's, who made him promise when he was dying, and he did not like to
     break his word. How he must have hated it! I wonder if he had ever met her before, or if the
     husband made him take her, a pig in a poke. I expect that was it, because he never could have
     done it if he had ever seen her.</t:p>
<t:p>I can't think why he is so cross with me, but I am sorry, as he is such a nice man. Now I am
     sleepy, and it is frightfully late, so I suppose I had better get into bed. Agnès came up, and
     has been fussing about for the last hour. Best love from your affectionate daughter,</t:p>
<t:p>Elizabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>Nazeby Hall, <t:hi>30th July</t:hi>.</t:p>
<t:p>Dearest Mamma,—Yesterday was the best day we have had yet; the nice men had not to field at
     all, and the stupid cricket was over at four o'clock, and so we went into the gardens and lay
     in hammocks, and Miss La Touche had such nice shoes on, but her ankles are thick.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Ghosts in the Corridor</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>The Rooses told me it wasn't "quite nice" for girls to loll in hammocks (and they sat on
     chairs)—that you could only do it when you are married; but I believe it is because they don't
     have pretty enough petticoats. Anyway, Lady Doraine and that horrid Smith creature made a place
     for me in the empty hammock between them, and, as I knew my "frillies" were all right, I
     hammocked too, and it was <t:hi>lovely</t:hi>. Lord Valmond and Mr. Wertz were lying near, and they
     said agreeable things, at least I suppose so, because both of them—Lady Doraine and Mrs.
     Smith—looked purry-purry-puss-puss. They asked me why I was so sleepy, and I said because I had
     not slept well the last night—that I was sure the house was haunted. And so they all screamed
     at me, "Why?" and so I told them, what was really true, that in the night I heard a noise of
     stealthy footsteps, and as I was not frightened I determined to see what it was, so I got
     up—Agnès sleeps in the dressing-room, but, of course, <t:hi>she</t:hi> never wakes—I opened the
     door and peeped out into the corridor. There are only two rooms beyond mine towards the end,
     round the corner, and it is dimly lit all night. Well, I distinctly saw a very tall grey figure
     disappear round the bend of the hall! When I got thus far every one dropped their books and
     listened with rapt attention, and I could see them exchanging looks, so I am sure they know it
     is haunted, and were trying to keep it from me. I asked Mrs. Smith if she had seen or heard
     anything, because she sleeps in one of the rooms. She looked perfectly green, but she said she
     had not heard a sound, and had slept like a top, and that I must have dreamt it.</t:p>
<t:p>Then Lady Doraine and every one talked at once, and Lord Valmond asked did any one know if
     the London evening papers had come. But I was not going to be put off like that, so I just
     said, "I know you all know it is haunted and are putting me off because you think I'll be
     frightened; but I assure you I am not, and if I hear the noise again I am going to rush out and
     see the ghost close."</t:p>
<t:p>Then every one looked simply <t:hi>ahuri</t:hi>. So I mean to get the ghost story out of Sir
     Trevor to-night after dinner—I had not a chance yesterday—as I am sure it is interesting. Mrs.
     Smith looked at me as if she wanted to poison me, and I can't think why specially, can you?</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:hi>Twelve p.m.</t:hi>—I asked Sir Trevor if the house is haunted, and he said, "God bless my
     soul, no!" and so I told him, and he nearly had a fit; so I <t:hi>know</t:hi> it is, but I am not a
     bit frightened.—Your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>Nazeby Hall, <t:hi>Sunday.</t:hi>
</t:p>
<t:p>Dearest Mamma,—Agnès and I go to Aunt Mary's by the 10:30 train to-morrow, and I am not a bit
     sorry, although I have enjoyed myself, and now I begin to feel quite at home with every one—at
     least, some of them; but such a tiresome thing happened last night. It was like this: After
     dinner it was so hot that we all went out on the terrace, and, as soon as we got there, Mrs.
     Smith and Lady Doraine and the rest said it was too cold, and went in again; but the moon was
     pretty, so I stayed alone, and presently Lord Valmond came out, and stood beside me. There is
     such a nice view, you remember, from there, and I didn't a bit want to talk.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>A Kiss and a Blow</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>He said something, but I wasn't listening, when suddenly I did hear him say this: "You
     adorable <t:hi>enfant terrible</t:hi>, come out and watch for ghosts to-night; and I will come and
     play the ghost, and console you if you are frightened!" And he put his horrid arm right round
     my waist, and kissed me—somewhere about my right ear—before I could realise what he was at!</t:p>
<t:p>I <t:hi>was</t:hi> in a rage, as you can fancy, Mamma, so I just turned round and gave him the
     hardest slap I could, right on the cheek! He was furious, and called me a "little devil," and
     we both walked straight into the drawing-room.</t:p>
<t:p>I suppose I looked <t:hi>savage</t:hi>, and in the light I could see he had great red finger
     marks on his face. Anyway, Mrs. Smith, who was sitting on the big sofa near the window alone,
     looked up, and said in an odious voice, that made every one listen, "I am afraid, Harry, you
     have not enjoyed cooing in the moonlight; it looks as if our sweet Elizabeth had been
     difficult, and had boxed your ears!"</t:p>
<t:p>That made me <t:hi>wild</t:hi>, the impudence! That <t:hi>parvenue</t:hi> calling me by my Christian
     name! So I just lost my temper right out, and said to her, "It is perfectly true what you say,
     and I will box yours if you call me 'Elizabeth' again!"</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:hi>Tableau!</t:hi> She almost fainted with astonishment and fury, and when she could get her
     voice decent enough to speak, she laughed and said—</t:p>
<t:p>"What a charming savage! How ingenuous!"</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Lord Valmond in Disgrace</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>And then Lady Cecilia did a really nice thing, which shows that she is a brick, in spite of
     having bulgy eyes, and being absent and tiresome. She came up to me as if nothing had happened,
     and said, "Come, Elizabeth, they are waiting for you to begin a round game," and she put her
     arm through mine and drew me into the billiard-room, and on the way she squeezed my arm, and
     said, in a voice quite low down for her, "She deserved it," and I was so touched I nearly
     cried. From where I sat at the card-table I could see Mrs. Smith and Lord Valmond, and they
     were quarrelling. She looked like green rhubarb juice, and he had the expression of "Damn!" all
     over him.</t:p>
<t:p>Of course I did not say good-night to him, and I hope I shall never see him again.—Your
     affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.</t:p>
