<t:head>CARRISTON TOWERS</t:head>
<t:p>Carriston Towers,</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:hi>27th October</t:hi>.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Carriston Towers</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>Dearest Mamma,—I shall never again arrive at a place at three o'clock in the afternoon; it is
     perfectly ghastly! As we drove up to the door—it was pouring with rain—I felt that I should not
     like anything here. It does look such a large grey pile: and how cold and draughty that immense
     stone hall must be in winter! There were no nice big sofas about, or palms, or lots of papers
     and books; nothing but suits of armour and great marble tables, looking like monuments. I was
     taken down endless passages to the library, and there left such a long time that I had got down
     an old <t:hi>Punch</t:hi> and was looking at it, and trying to warm my feet, when Lady Carriston
     came in with Adeline. I remember how I hated playing with her years ago; she always patronised
     me, being three years older, and she is just the same now, only both their backs have got
     longer and their noses more arched, and they are the image of each other. Adeline seems very
     suppressed; Lady Carriston does not—her face is carved out of stone. They look very well bred
     and respectable, and badly dressed; nothing rustled nicely when they walked, and they had not
     their nails polished, or scent on, or anything like that; but Lady Carriston had a splendid row
     of pearls round her throat, on the top of her rough tweed dress and linen collar.</t:p>
<t:p>They pronounce their words very distinctly, in an elevated kind of way, and you feel as if
     icicles were trickling down your back, and you can't think of a <t:hi>thing</t:hi> to say. When we
     had got to the end of your neuralgia and my journey, there was such a pause! and I suppose they
     thought I was an idiot, and were only too glad to get me off to my room, where Adeline took me,
     and left me, hoping I had everything I wanted, and saying tea was at five in the blue
     drawing-room. And there I had to stay while Agnès unpacked. It was dull! It is a big room, and
     the fire had only just been lit. The furniture is colourless and ugly, and, although it is all
     comfortable and correct, there are no books about, except "Romola" and "Middlemarch" and some
     Carlyle and John Stuart Mill, and I did not feel that I could do with any of that just then. So
     there I sat twiddling my thumbs for more than an hour, and Agnès did make such a noise, opening
     and shutting drawers, but at last I remembered a box of caramels in my dressing-bag, and it was
     better after that.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>A Dull Hour</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>Agnès had put out my white cashmere for tea, and at five I started to find my way to the blue
     drawing-room. The bannisters are so broad and slippery—the very things for sliding on. I feel
     as if I should start down them one day, just to astonish Adeline, only I promised you I would
     be good. Well, when I got to the drawing-room, the party—about twelve—had assembled. The old
     Earl had been wheeled in from his rooms: he wears a black velvet skull-cap and a stock but he
     has a splendid and distinguished old face. If I were he, I would not have such a dull
     daughter-in-law to live with me as Lady Carriston is, even if my son was dead. The boy, Charlie
     Carriston, was there too; he does look a goose. He is like those pictures in the <t:hi>Punch</t:hi>
     that I was looking at, where the family is so old that their chins and foreheads have gone. He
     is awfully afraid of his mother. There were two or three elderly pepper-and-salt men, and that
     Trench cousin, who is a very High Church curate (you know Aunt Mary told us about him), and
     there are a Sir Samuel and Lady Garnons, with an old maid daughter, and Adeline's German
     governess, who has stayed on as companion, and helped to pour out the tea.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>A Modern Grandison</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>The conversation was subdued; about politics and Cabinet Ministers, and pheasants and foxes,
     and things of that kind, and no one said anything that meant anything else, as they did at
     Nazeby, or were witty like they were at Tournelle, and the German governess said "Ach" to
     everything, and Lady Garnons and Miss Garnons knitted all the time, which gave their voices the
     sound of "one-two-three" when they spoke, although they did not really count. No one had on
     tea-gowns—just a Sunday sort of clothes. I don't know how we should have got through tea if the
     coffee-cream cakes had not been so good. The old Earl called me to him when he had finished,
     and talked so beautifully to me; he paid me some such grand old-fashioned compliments, and his
     voice sounds as if he had learnt elocution in his youth. There is not a word of slang or
     anything modern; one quite understands how he was able to wake up the House of Lords before his
     legs gave way. It seems sad that such a ninny as Charlie should succeed him. I feel proud of
     being related to him, but I shall never think of Lady Carriston except as a distant cousin.
     Both Charlie and Adeline are so afraid of her that they hardly speak.</t:p>
<t:p>I shan't waste any of my best frocks here, so I made Agnès put me on the old blue silk for
     the evening. She was disgusted. At dinner I sat between Charlie and one of the
     pepper-and-salts—he is a M.P. They are going to shoot partridges to-morrow; and I don't know
     what we shall do, as there has been no suggestion of our going out to lunch.</t:p>
<t:p>After dinner we sat in the yellow drawing-room; Lady Carriston and Lady Garnons talked in
     quite an animated way together about using their personal influence to suppress all signs of
     Romanism in the services of the Church. They seemed to think they would have no difficulty in
     stopping it. They are both Low Church, Miss Garnons told me, but she herself held quite
     different views. Then she asked me if I did not think the Reverend Ernest Trench had a "soulful
     face," so pure and abstracted that merely looking at him gave thoughts of a higher life. I said
     No; he reminded me of a white ferret we had once, and I hated curates. She looked perfectly
     sick at me and did not take the trouble to talk any more, but joined Adeline, who had been
     winding silk with Fräulein Schlarbaum for a tie she is knitting. So I tried to read the
      <t:hi>Contemporary Review</t:hi>, but I could not help hearing Lady Carriston telling Lady Garnons
     that she had always brought up Adeline and Charlie so carefully that she knew their inmost
     thoughts. (She did not mention Cyril, who is still at Eton.)</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, I assure you, Georgina," she said, "my dear children have never had a secret from me in
     their innocent lives."</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>The Duke's Shirt</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>When the men came in from the dining-room, one of the old fellows came and talked to me, and
     I discovered he is the Duke of Lancashire. He is ordinary looking, and his shirts fit so
     badly—that nasty sticking-out look at the sides, and not enough starch. I would not have shirts
     that did not fit if I were a Duke, would you? They are all staying here for the Conservative
     meeting to-morrow evening at Barchurch. These three pepper-and-salts are shining lights in this
     county, I have gathered. Lady Carriston seems very well informed on every subject. It does not
     matter if she is talking to Mr. Haselton or Sir Andrew Merton, (the two M.P.'s), or the Duke,
     who is the M.F.H., or the curate; she seems to know much more about politics, and hunting, and
     religion than they do. It is no wonder she can see her children's thoughts!</t:p>
<t:p>At half-past ten we all said good-night. The dear old Earl does not come in from the
     dining-room; he is wheeled straight to his rooms, so I did not see him. Miss Garnons and
     Adeline both looked as if they could hardly bear to part with their curate, and finally we got
     upstairs, and now I must go to bed.—Best love, from your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:hi>P.S.</t:hi>—Everything is kept up with great state here; there seems to be a footman behind
     every one's chair at dinner.</t:p>
<t:p>Carriston Towers,</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:hi>28th October</t:hi>.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Charlie's Dissimulation</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>Dearest Mamma,—I was so afraid of being late for breakfast this morning that I was down quite
     ten minutes too soon, and when I got into the breakfast-room I found Charlie alone, mixing
     himself a brandy cocktail. He wanted to kiss me, because he said we were cousins, but I did not
     like the smell of the brandy, so I would not let him. He made me promise that I would come out
     with him after breakfast, before they started to shoot, to look at his horses; then we heard
     some one coming, and he whisked the cocktail glass out of sight in the neatest way possible. At
     breakfast he just nibbled a bit of toast, and drank a glass of milk, and Lady Carriston kept
     saying to him, "My dear, dear boy, you have no appetite," and he said, "No, having to read so
     hard as he did at night took it away."</t:p>
<t:p>The Duke seemed a little annoyed that there was not a particular chutney in his curried
     kidneys, which I thought very rude in another person's house; and, as it was Friday, the
     Reverend Mr. Trench refused every dish in a loud voice, and then helped himself to a whole sole
     at the side-table.</t:p>
<t:p>The food was lovely. Miss Garnons did not eat a thing, and Lady Garnons was not down nor, of
     course, the old Earl.</t:p>
<t:p>After breakfast we meandered into the hall. Smoking is not allowed anywhere except in the
     billiard-room, which is down yards and yards of passages, so as not to let the smell get into
     the house. We seemed to be standing about doing nothing, so I said I would go up and get my
     boots on, or probably there would not be time to go with Charlie to see his horses before they
     started.</t:p>
<t:p>You should have seen the family's three faces! Charlie's silly jaw dropped, Adeline's
     eyebrows ran up to her hair almost, while Lady Carriston said in an icy voice: "We had not
     thought of visiting the stables so early."</t:p>
<t:p>Did you ever hear of anything so ridiculous, Mamma? Just as though I had said something
     improper! I was furious with Charlie, he had not even the pluck to say he had asked me to go;
     but I paid him out. I just said, "I concluded you had consulted Lady Carriston before asking me
     to go with you, or naturally I should not have suggested going to get ready." He did look a
     stupid thing, and bolted at once; but Lady Carriston saw I was not going to be snubbed, so she
     became more polite, and presently asked me to come and see the aviary with her.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>The Slip of Paper</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>As we walked down the armour gallery she met a servant with a telegram, and while she stopped
     to read it I looked out of one of the windows. The wall is so thick they are all in recesses,
     and Charlie passed underneath, his head just level with the open part. The moment he saw me he
     fished out a scrap of paper from his pocket and pressed it into my hand, and said, "Don't be a
     mug this time," and was gone before I could do anything. I did not know what to do with the
     paper, so I had to slip it up my sleeve, as with these skirts one hasn't a pocket, and I did
     feel so mad at having done a thing in that underhand way.</t:p>
<t:p>The aviary is such a wonderful place, there seem to be birds of every kind, and the
     parrakeets do make such a noise. There are lots of palms here and seats, but it is not just an
     ideal place to stay and talk in, as every creature screams so that you can hardly hear yourself
     speak. However, Miss Garnons and Mr. Trench did not seem to think so, as, while Lady Carriston
     stopped to say, "Didysy, woodsie, poppsie, dicksie," to some canaries, I turned a corner to see
     some owls, and there found them holding hands and kissing (the White Ferret and Miss Garnons I
     mean, of course, not the owls).</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>The Mysteries of Religion</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>They must have come in at the other door, and the parrots' noises had prevented them from
     hearing us coming. You never saw two people so taken aback. They simply jumped away from one
     another. Mr. Trench got crimson up to his white eyelashes, and coughed in a nervous way, while
     poor Miss Garnons at once talked nineteen to the dozen about the "darling little owlies," and
     never let go my arm until she had got me aside, when she at once began explaining that she
     hoped I would not misinterpret anything I had seen; that of course it might look odd to one who
     did not understand the higher life, but there were mysteries connected with her religion, and
     she hoped I would say nothing about it. I said she need not worry herself. She is quite
     twenty-eight, you know, Mamma, so I suppose she knows best; but I should hate a religion that
     obliged me to kiss White Ferret curates in a parrot-house, shouldn't you?</t:p>
<t:p>Lady Carriston detests Mr. Trench, but as he is a cousin she has to be fairly civil to him,
     and they always get on to ecclesiastical subjects and argue when they speak; it is the greatest
     fun to hear them. They walked on ahead and left me with Miss Garnons until we got back to the
     hall.</t:p>
<t:p>By this time the guns had all started, so we saw no more of them. Then Adeline suggested that
     she and I should bicycle in the Park, which has miles of lovely road (she is not allowed out of
     the gates by herself), so at last I got up to my room, and there, as I was ringing the bell for
     Agnès, Charlie's piece of paper fell out on the floor. I had forgotten all about it. Wasn't it
     a mercy it did not drop while I was with Lady Carriston? This was all it was: "Come down to tea
     half-an-hour earlier; shall sham a hurt wrist to be back from shooting in time. Charlie."</t:p>
<t:p>I could not help laughing, although I was cross at his impertinence—in taking for granted
     that I would be quite ready to do whatever he wished. I threw it in the fire, and, of course, I
     shan't go down a moment before five. Adeline has just been in to see why I am so long getting
     ready.—Good-bye, dear Mamma, love from your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>Carriston Towers,</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:hi>Saturday</t:hi>.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>An Anchor in Life</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>Dear Mamma,—Oh! what a long day this has been! But I always get so muddled if I don't go
     straight on, that I had better finish telling you about Friday first. Well, while Adeline and I
     were bicycling, she told me she thought I should grow quite pretty if only my hair was arranged
     more like hers—she has a jug-handle chignon—and if I had less of that French look. But she
     supposed I could not help it, having had to spend so much time abroad. She said I should find
     life was full of temptations, if I had not an <t:hi>anchor</t:hi>. I asked her what that was, and
     she said it was something on which to cast one's soul. I don't see how that could be an
     anchor—do you, Mamma? because it is the anchor that gets cast, isn't it? However, she assured
     me that it was, so I asked her if she had one herself, and she said she had, and it was her
     great reverence for Mr. Trench, and they were secretly engaged! and she hoped I would not
     mention it to anybody; and presently, when he joined us, would I mind riding on, as she had so
     few chances to talk to him? That she would not for the world deceive her mother, but there were
     mysteries connected with her religion which Lady Carriston could not understand, being only Low
     Church. But when they saw a prospect of getting married they would tell her about it; if they
     did it now, she would persuade the Duke not to give Mr. Trench the Bellestoke living, which he
     has half promised him, and so make it impossible for them to marry.</t:p>
<t:p>I asked her if Mr. Trench was Miss Garnons' anchor too? and she seemed quite annoyed, so I
     suppose their religion has heaps of different mysteries; but I don't see what all that has got
     to do with telling her mother, do you? And I should rather turn Low Church than have to kiss
     Mr. Trench, anyway. He came from a side path and joined us, and as soon as I could I left them;
     but they picked me up again by the inner gate, just as I was going in to lunch, after having
     had a beautiful ride. The Park is magnificent.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Putting on the Clock</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>At lunch I sat by the old Earl. He said my hair was a sunbeam's home, and that my nose was
     fit for a cameo; he is perfectly charming. Afterwards we went <t:hi>en bloc</t:hi> to the library,
     and the Garnons began to knit again. Nobody says a word about clothes; they talked about the
     Girls' Friendly Society, and the Idiot Asylum, and the Flannel Union, and Higher Education, and
     whenever Lady Garnons mentions any one that Lady Carriston does not know all about, she always
     says, "Oh! and <t:hi>who was</t:hi> she?" And then, after thoroughly sifting it, if she finds that
     the person in question does not belong to any of the branches of the family that she is
     acquainted with, she says "Society is getting very mixed now." Presently about six more people
     arrived. There seems to be nothing but these ghastly three o'clock trains here. All the new lot
     were affected by it, just as I was. There were endless pauses.</t:p>
<t:p>I would much rather scream at Aunt Maria for a whole afternoon than have to spend it with
     Lady Carriston. I am sure she and Godmamma would be the greatest friends if they could meet.
     When I got up to my room I was astonished to find it was so late. I had not even scrambled into
     my clothes when the clock struck five. I had forgotten all about Charlie and his scrap of
     paper, but when I got into the blue drawing-room, there he was, with his wrist bandaged up, and
     no signs of tea about. What do you think the horrid boy had done, Mamma? Actually had the big
     gold clock in my room put on! There were ten chances to one, he said, against my looking at my
     watch, and he knew I would not come down unless I thought it was five. I was so cross that I
     wanted to go upstairs again, but he would not let me; he stood in front of the door, and there
     was no good making a fuss, so I sat down by the fire.</t:p>
<t:p>He said he had seen last night how struck his Grandfather had been with me, and he did want
     me to get round him, as he had got into an awful mess, and had not an idea how he was going to
     get out of it, unless I helped him. I said I was sorry, but I really did not see how I could do
     anything, and that he had better tell his Mother, as she adored him.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Cora's Necklace</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>He simply jumped with horror at the idea of telling his Mother. "Good Lord!" he said, "the
     old girl would murder me," which I did not think very respectful of him. Then he fidgeted, and
     humm'd and haw'd for such a time that tea had begun to come in before I could understand the
     least bit what the mess was; but it was something about a Cora de la Haye, who dances at the
     Empire, and a diamond necklace, and how he was madly in love with her, and intended to marry
     her, but he had lost such a lot of money at Goodwood, that no one knew about, as he was
     supposed not to have been there, that he could not pay for the necklace unless his grandfather
     gave him a lump sum to pay his debts at Oxford with, and that what he wanted was for me to get
     round the old Earl to give him this money, and then he could pay for Cora de la Haye's
     necklace.</t:p>
<t:p>He showed me her photo, which he keeps in his pocket. It is just like the ones in the shops
     in the Rue de Rivoli that Mademoiselle never would let me stop and look at in Paris. I am sure
     Lady Carriston can't have been having second sight into her children's thoughts lately!</t:p>
<t:p>Just then Lady Garnons and some of the new people came in, and he was obliged to stop. We had
     a kind of high tea, as the Conservative meeting was to be at eight, and it is three-quarters of
     an hour's drive into Barchurch, and there was to be a big supper after. Lady Carriston did make
     such a fuss over Charlie's wrist. She wanted to know was it badly sprained, and did it ache
     much, and was it swollen, and he had the impudence to let her almost cry over him, and
     pretended to wince when she touched it! As we were driving in to the meeting he sat next me in
     the omnibus, and kept squeezing my arm all the time under the rug, which did annoy me so, that
     at last I gave his ankle a nasty kick, and then he left off for a little. He has not the ways
     of a gentleman, and I think he had better marry his Cora, and settle down into a class more
     suited to him than ours; but <t:hi>I</t:hi> shan't help him with his Grandfather.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Politics and Principle</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>Have you ever been to a political meeting, dear Mamma? It is funny! All these old gentlemen
     sit up on a platform and talk such a lot. The Duke put in "buts" and "ifs" and "thats" over and
     over again when he could not think of a word, and you weren't a bit the wiser when he had
     finished, except that it was awfully wrong to put up barbed wire; but I can't see what that has
     to do with politics, can you? One of the pepper-and-salts did speak nicely, and so did one of
     the new people—quite a youngish person; but they all had such a lot of words, when it would
     have done just as well if they had simply said that of course our side was the right
     one—because trade was good when we were in, and that there are much better people Conservatives
     than Radicals. Anyway, no one stays a Radical when he gets to be his own father, as it would be
     absurd to cut off one's nose to spite one's face—don't you think so, Mamma? So it is nonsense
     talking so much.</t:p>
<t:p>One or two rude people in the back called out things, but no one paid any attention; and at
     last, after lots of cheering, we got into the omnibus again. I <t:hi>was</t:hi> hungry. At supper
     we sat more or less anyhow, and I happened to be next the youngish person who spoke. I don't
     know his name, but I know he wasn't any one very grand, as Lady Carriston said, before they
     arrived in the afternoon, that things were changing dreadfully; that even the Conservative
     party was being invaded by people of no family; and she gave him two fingers when she said "How
     d'ye do?" But if he is nobody, I call it very nice of him to be a Conservative, and then he
     won't have to change afterwards when he gets high up. The old Earl asked me what I thought of
     it all, so I told him; and he said that it was a great pity they could not have me at the head
     of affairs, and then things would be arranged on a really simple and satisfactory basis.</t:p>
<t:p>After breakfast this morning most of the new people went, and the Duke and the
     pepper-and-salts; Lady Carriston drove Lady Garnons over to see her Idiot Asylum. They were to
     lunch near there, so we had our food in peace without them, and you would not believe the
     difference there was! Everyone woke up: Old Sir Samuel Garnons, who had not spoken once that I
     heard since I came, joked with Fräulein Schlarbaum. Charlie had two brandies-and-sodas instead
     of his usual glass of milk, and Adeline and Miss Garnons were able to gaze at their
      <t:hi>anchor</t:hi> without fear.</t:p>
<t:p>This afternoon I have been for a ride with Charlie, and do you know, Mamma, I believe he is
     trying to make love to me, but it is all in such horrid slang that I am not quite sure. I must
     stop now.—With love, from your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>A Good Protestant</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:hi>P.S.</t:hi>—Sunday. I missed the post last night. We did spend a boring evening doing
     nothing, not even dummy whist, like at Aunt Maria's, and I was so tired hearing the two old
     ladies talking over the idiots they had seen at the Asylum, that I was thankful when half-past
     ten came. As for to-day, I am glad it is the last one I shall spend here. There is a settled
     gloom over everything, a sort of Sunday feeling that makes one eat too much lunch. Mr. Trench
     had been allowed to conduct the service in the chapel this morning, and Lady Carriston kept
     tapping her foot all the time with annoyance at all his little tricks, and once or twice, when
     he was extra go-ahead, I heard her murmuring to herself "Ridiculous!" and "Scandalous!" What
      <t:hi>will</t:hi> she do when he is her son-in-law?</t:p>
<t:p>Adeline and Miss Garnons knelt whenever they could, and as long as they could, and took off
     their gloves and folded their hands. I think Adeline hates Miss Garnons, because she is allowed
     to cross herself; and of course Adeline daren't, with her mother there.</t:p>
<t:p>After tea Charlie managed to get up quite close to me in a corner, and he said in a low voice
     that I was "a stunner," and that if I would just "give him the tip," he'd "chuck Cora
     to-morrow;" that I "could give her fits!" And if that is an English proposal, Mamma, I would
     much rather have the Vicomte's or the Marquis's.</t:p>
<t:p>We are coming by the evening train to-morrow; so till then good-bye.—Your affectionate
     daughter, Elizabeth.</t:p>
</t:div>
