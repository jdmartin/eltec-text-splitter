<t:head>HOTEL FRASCATI, HAVRE</t:head>
<t:p>Hotel Frascati, Havre,</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:hi>Sunday, 21st August</t:hi>.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Havre to Trouville</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>Dearest Mamma,—I am sorry our nice voyage is nearly finished, for we go over to Trouville
     this evening, and from there by train back to Vinant. The river is not nearly so pretty after
     you leave Caudebec, but Tancarville is fine, and looks very imposing sitting up so high. The
     Vicomte has been talking to me all the time, but Jean stays by. We were dusty and sun-burnt by
     the time we got to Havre, and Héloise and the Marquise and I started at once for the big baths.
     They do not quite join the hotel, so we covered a good deal of absence, in the way of dress, by
     our faithful mackintoshes and trotted across. On the steps we met de Tournelle just coming out
     from the baths; he laughed when he saw us, and said he had never before realised that garments
     of so much respectability could have such possibilities! Oh! how nice to have a real bath
     again!</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>A Gay Dinner</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>Agnès hasn't enjoyed this trip much, I can see. Heaven knows where she has slept! I thought
     it wiser not to ask. We had such a gay dinner. I am getting accustomed to shouting across the
     table at every one; it will feel quite queer just talking to one's neighbour when I get back to
     England. The restaurant at Frascati isn't at all bad, and it was agreeable to have proper food
     again.</t:p>
<t:p>Hippolyte thinks we are awfully greedy; he was heard yesterday grumbling to the Baronne's
     maid, "Mais où diable est-ce que ces dames mettent tout ce qu'elles mangent? Elles goblottent
     toute la journée!"</t:p>
<t:p>After dinner we drank our coffee on the terrace and listened to the band. Héloise would
     hardly speak to "Antoine" all day, and he looked perfectly miserable, and Madame de Vermandoise
     every now and then laughed to herself—I don't know what at. However we took a walk on the pier
     presently, and as there was such a crowd we weren't able to walk all together as usual, but had
     to go two and two. "Antoine" walked with Héloise, and I suppose they made it up. I just caught
     this: "N'oubliez jamais, bien chère Madame, qu'une église a deux portes." Héloise said she
     would not forget, and he thanked her rapturously; but what it meant I don't know. They have
     both smiled often since so I expect it is some French idiom for reconciliation.</t:p>
<t:p>The crowd on the pier was common, and we returned to Frascati's garden. It was so fearfully
     hot, that beyond wondering if the dew was falling, no one suggested we should get cold, as they
     always do. It really has been a delightful trip, and I have enjoyed it so. They are all
     charming. They seem to have kinder hearts than some of the people at Nazeby, but what strikes
     one as quite different is that every one is witty; they are making epigrams or clever
      <t:hi>tournures de phrases</t:hi> all the time, and don't seem to talk of the teeny weeny things
     we do in England. They have most exquisite manners, and extraordinarily unpleasant personal
     habits, like eating, and coughing, and picking their teeth, etc.; but they do have nice
     under-clothes, and lovely soaps and scents and things.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>Views for Victorine</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>The Frascati beds were comfortable, and I could not wake in the morning, in spite of Agnès
     fussing about. The Vicomte has awakened every one each day by rapping at their doors, but this
     morning I was at last aroused by Héloise, who had the next room, and we had our coffee
     together. She says she does hope soon to get Victorine married, and that they have a nephew of
     the Baronne's in view, but he has not seen her yet. It appears it is easier to get them off if
     they are quiet looking and dowdy, but not so aggressive as Victorine. You haven't much chance
     if you are very pretty and lively; as she says, the men only like you to be that when you are
     married to some one else. Héloise wishes to have everything smart as the Tournelles have, but
     Godmamma and Victorine are always against her. She says life there is for ever eating
      <t:hi>galette de plomp</t:hi>, which I suppose means a suet pudding feeling. We all went to High
     Mass at eleven; it was very pretty, and such a good-looking priest handed the bag. I should
     hate to be a priest; shouldn't you, Mamma? You mayn't even look at any one nice.</t:p>
<t:p>We breakfasted at Frascati, but we were a little bit gloomy at our trip being over. This
     afternoon they have nearly all gone for a drive in hired motor cars, but I haven't a hat here
     that would stay on, so I am writing to you instead, and we cross over to Trouville at five
     o'clock in the ordinary boat, as it is too rough for the <t:hi>Sauterelle</t:hi>.—Good-bye, dear
     Mamma, your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:label>A Full-blown Bride</t:label>
</t:p>
<t:p>
<t:hi>P.S.</t:hi>—I forgot to tell you the story of the "<t:hi>Côte des deux Amants.</t:hi>" You know
     the fearfully straight, steep hill we have often noticed from the train if you go to Paris from
     Dieppe. Well, Hippolyte told us the story when we passed it. It is quite close from the river,
     and looks as if it had been cut with a knife, it is so steep. It appears that in the Middle
     Ages there was a castle on the top, and there lived a Comte who had a tremendously stout
     daughter. He said no one should have her and her fortune unless he was strong enough to carry
     her from the bottom to the top of the hill. Hundreds tried—it was a beauty then to be fat—but
     every one dropped her half-way, and the poor thing got "très fatiguée d'être plantée comme ça,"
     when a handsome cavalier came along, and he succeeded. His snorts of out-of-breathness could be
     heard for miles, but he got her to the top and then fell dead at her feet; and she went into a
     convent and died. Hippolyte said also that the other ending of the story was, that she got so
     thin from pining for the knight that the next one who came along had no difficulty, and so they
     married and lived happy ever after. But I like the tragic end best. And he said that the
     peasants still declare they can hear the knight wheezing on moonlight nights, but "Antoine"
     said it was probably a traction engine. And I don't think it nice of him; do you, Mamma?</t:p>
