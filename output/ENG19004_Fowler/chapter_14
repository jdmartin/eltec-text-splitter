<t:head>ON THE RIVER</t:head>
<t:quote>
<t:l>For many a frivolous, festive year</t:l>
<t:l>I followed the path that I felt I must;</t:l>
<t:l>I failed to discover the road was drear,</t:l>
<t:l>And rather than otherwise liked the dust.</t:l>
<t:l>It led through a land that I knew of old,</t:l>
<t:l>Frequented by friendly, familiar folk,</t:l>
<t:l>Who bowed before Mammon, and heaped up gold,</t:l>
<t:l>And lived like their neighbours, and loved their joke.</t:l>
</t:quote>
<t:p>It was a lovely summer's day when Lady Silverhampton collected her forces at Paddingdon,
     conveyed them by rail as far as Reading, and then transported them from the train to her
     steam-launch on the river. The party consisted of Lady Silverhampton herself, Lord and Lady
     Robert Thistletown, Lord Stonebridge, Sir Wilfred Madderley (President of the Royal Academy),
     Cecil Farquhar, and Elisabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>"I'm afraid you'll be frightfully crowded," said the hostess, as they packed themselves into
     the dainty little launch; "but it can't be helped. I tried to charter a P. and O. steamer for
     the day; but they were all engaged, like cabs on the night of a county ball, don't you know?
     And then I tried to leave somebody out so as to make the party smaller, but there wasn't one of
     you that could have been spared,
     <t:pb n="273"/> except Silverhampton; so I left him at home, and decided to let the rest of you
     be squeezed yet happy."</t:p>
<t:p>"How dear of you!" exclaimed Lord Robert; "and I'll repay your kindness by writing a book
     called How to be Happy though Squeezed."</t:p>
<t:p>"The word <t:hi>though</t:hi> appears redundant in that connection," Sir Wilfred Madderley
     remarked.</t:p>
<t:p>"Ah! that's because you aren't what is called 'a lady's man,'" Lord Robert sighed. "I always
     was, especially before my unfortunate—oh! I beg your pardon, Violet, I forgot you were here; I
     mean, of course, my fortunate—marriage. I was always the sort of man that makes girls timidly
     clinging when they are sitting on a sofa beside you, and short-sighted when you are playing
     their accompaniments for them. I remember once a girl sat so awfully close to me on a sofa in
     mid-drawing-room, that I felt there wasn't really room for both of us; so—like the true hero
     that I am—I shouted 'Save the women and children,' and flung myself upon the tender mercies of
     the carpet, till I finally struggled to the fireplace."</t:p>
<t:p>"How silly you are, Bobby!" exclaimed his wife.</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, darling; I know. I've always known it; but the world didn't find it out till I married
     you. Till then I was in hopes that the secret would die with me; but after that it was
     fruitless to attempt to conceal the fact any longer."</t:p>
<t:p>"We're all going to be silly to-day," said the hostess; "that's part of the treat."</t:p>
<t:p>"It won't be much of a treat to some of us," Lord Robert retorted. "I remember when I was a
     little chap going to have tea at the Mershire's; and when I wanted to gather some of their most
     ripping orchids, Lady M. said I might go into the garden and pick mignonette instead. 'Thank
     you,' I replied in my
     <t:pb n="274"/> most dignified manner, 'I can pick mignonette at home; that's no change to me!'
     Now, that's the way with everything; it's no change to some people to pick mignonette."</t:p>
<t:p>"Or to some to pick orchids," added Lord Stonebridge.</t:p>
<t:p>"Or to some to pick oakum." And Lord Bobby sighed again.</t:p>
<t:p>"Even Elisabeth isn't going to be clever to-day," continued Lady Silverhampton. "She promised
     me she wouldn't; didn't you, Elisabeth?"</t:p>
<t:p>Every one looked admiringly at the subject of this remark. Elisabeth Farringdon was the
     fashion just then.</t:p>
<t:p>"She couldn't help being clever, however hard she tried," said the President.</t:p>
<t:p>"Couldn't I, though? Just you wait and see."</t:p>
<t:p>"If you succeed in not saying one clever thing during the whole of this picnic affair," Lord
     Bobby exclaimed, "I'll give you my photograph as a reward. I've got a new one, taken sideways,
     which is perfectly sweet. It has a profile like a Greek god—those really fine and antique
     statues, don't you know? whose noses have been wiped out by the ages. The British Museum teems
     with them, poor devils!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Thank you," said Elisabeth. "I shall prize it as an incontrovertible testimony to the fact
     that neither my tongue nor your nose are as sharp as tradition reports them to be."</t:p>
<t:p>Lord Bobby shook his finger warningly. "Be careful, be careful, or you'll never get that
     photograph. Remember that every word you say will be used against you, as the police are always
     warning me."
     <t:pb n="275"/></t:p>
<t:p>"I'm a little tired to-day," Lady Silverhampton said. "I was taken in to dinner by an
     intelligent man last night."</t:p>
<t:p>"Then how came he to do it?" Lord Robert wondered.</t:p>
<t:p>"Don't be rude, Bobby: it doesn't suit your style; and, besides, how could he help it?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Well enough. Whenever I go out to dinner I always say in an aside to my host, 'Not Lady
     Silverhampton; anything but that.' And the consequence is I never do go in to dinner with you.
     It isn't disagreeableness on my part; if I could I'd do it for your sake, and put my own
     inclination on one side; but I simply can't bear the intellectual strain. It's a marvel to me
     how poor Silverhampton stands it as well as he does."</t:p>
<t:p>"He is never exposed to it. You don't suppose I waste my own jokes on my own husband, do you?
     They are far too good for home consumption, like fish at the seaside. When fish has been up to
     London and returned, it is then sold at the place where it was caught. And that's the way with
     my jokes; when they have been all round London and come home to roost, I serve them up to
     Silverhampton as quite fresh."</t:p>
<t:p>"And he believes in their freshness? How sweet and confiding of him!"</t:p>
<t:p>"He never listens to them, so it is all the same to him whether they're fresh or not. That is
     why I confide so absolutely in Silverhampton; he never listens to a word I say, and never has
     done."</t:p>
<t:p>Lord Stonebridge amended this remark. "Except when you accepted him."</t:p>
<t:p>"Certainly not; because, as a matter of fact, I refused him; but he never listened, and so he
     <t:pb n="276"/>married me. It is so restful to have a husband who never attends to what you say!
     It must be dreadfully wearing to have one who does, because then you'd never be able to tell
     him the truth. And the great charm of your having a home of your own appears to be that it is
     the one place where you can speak the truth."</t:p>
<t:p>Lord Bobby clapped his hands. "Whatever lies disturb the street, there must be truth at
     home," he ejaculated.</t:p>
<t:p>"Wiser not, even there," murmured Sir Wilfred Madderley, under his breath.</t:p>
<t:p>"But you have all interrupted me, and haven't listened to what I was telling you about my
     intelligent man; and if you eat my food you must listen to my stones—it's only fair."</t:p>
<t:p>"But if even your own husband doesn't think it necessary to listen to them," Lord Bobby
     objected, "why should we, who have never desired to be anything more than sisters to you?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Because he doesn't eat my food—I eat his; that makes all the difference, don't you see?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Then do you listen to his stories?"</t:p>
<t:p>"To every one of them every time they are told; and I know to an inch the exact place where
     to laugh. But I'm going on about my man. He was one of those instructive boring people, who
     will tell you the reason of things; and he explained to me that soldiers wear khaki and polar
     bears white, because if you are dressed in the same colour as the place where you are, it looks
     as if you weren't there. And it has since occurred to me that I should be a much wiser and
     happier woman if I always dressed myself in the same colour as my drawing-room furniture. Then
     nobody would be able to find me even
     <t:pb n="277"/> in my own house. Don't you think it is rather a neat idea?" And her ladyship
     looked round for the applause which she had learned to expect as her right.</t:p>
<t:p>"You are a marvellous woman!" cried Lord Stonebridge, while the others murmured their
     approval.</t:p>
<t:p>"I need never say 'Not at home'; callers would just come in and look round the drawing-room
     and go out again, without ever seeing that I was there at all. It really would be sweet!"</t:p>
<t:p>"It seems to me to be a theory which might be adapted with benefit to all sorts and
     conditions of men," said Elisabeth; "I think I shall take out a patent for designing invisible
     costumes for every possible occasion. I feel I could do it, and do it well."</t:p>
<t:p>"It is adopted to a great extent even now," Sir Wilfred remarked; "I believe that our
     generals wear scarlet so that they may not always be distinguishable from the red-tape of the
     War Office."</t:p>
<t:p>"And one must not forget," added Lord Bobby thoughtfully, "that the benches of the House of
     Commons are green."</t:p>
<t:p>"Now in church, of course, it would be just the other way," said Lady Silverhampton; "I
     should line my pew with the same stuff as my Sunday gown, so as to look as if I was there when
     I wasn't."</t:p>
<t:p>Lord Stonebridge began to argue. "But that wouldn't be the other way; it would be the same
     thing."</t:p>
<t:p>"How stupid and accurate you are, Stonebridge! If our pew were lined with gray chiffon like
     my Sunday frock, it couldn't be the same as if my Sunday frock was made of crimson carpet like
     our pew.
     <t:pb n="278"/> How can things that are exactly opposite be the same? You can't prove that they
     are, except by algebra; and as nobody here knows any algebra, you can't prove it at all."</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes; I can. If I say you are like a person, it is the same thing as saying that that person
     is like you."</t:p>
<t:p>"Not at all. If you said that I was like Connie Esdaile, I should embrace you before the
     assembled company; and if you said she was like me, she'd never forgive you as long as she
     lived. It is through reasoning out things in this way that men make such idiotic mistakes."</t:p>
<t:p>"Isn't it funny," Elisabeth remarked, "that if you reason a thing out you're always wrong,
     and if you never reason about it at all you're always right?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Ah! but that is because you are a genius," murmured Cecil Farquhar.</t:p>
<t:p>Lady Silverhampton contradicted him. "Not at all; it's because she is a woman."</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, I'd rather be a woman than a genius any day," said Elisabeth; "it takes less keeping
     up."</t:p>
<t:p>"You are both," said Cecil.</t:p>
<t:p>"And I'm neither," added Lord Bobby; "so what's the state of the odds?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Let's invent more invisible costumes," cried Lady Silverhampton; "they interest me. Suggest
     another one, Elisabeth."</t:p>
<t:p>"I should design a special one for lovers in the country. Don't you know how you are always
     coming upon lovers in country lanes, and how hard they try to look as if they weren't there,
     and how badly they succeed? I should dress them entirely in green, faintly relieved by brown;
     and then they'd look as if they were only part of the hedges and stiles."
     <t:pb n="279"/></t:p>
<t:p>"How the lovers of the future will bless you!" exclaimed Lord Bobby. "I only regret that my
     love-making days are over before your patent costumes come out. I remember Sir Richard Esdaile
     once coming upon Violet and me when we were spooning in the shrubbery at Esdaile Court, and we
     tried in vain to efface ourselves and become as part of the scenery. You see, it is so
     difficult to look exactly like two laurel bushes, when one of you is dressed in pink muslin and
     the other in white flannel."</t:p>
<t:p>Lady Robert blushed becomingly. "Oh, Bobby, it wasn't pink muslin that day; it was blue
     cambric."</t:p>
<t:p>"That doesn't matter. There are as many laurel bushes made out of pink muslin as out of blue
     cambric, when you come to that. The difficulty of identifying one's self with one's environment
     (that's the correct expression, my dear) would be the same in either costume; but Miss
     Farringdon is now going, once for all, to remove that difficulty."</t:p>
<t:p>"I came upon two young people in a lane not long ago," said Elisabeth, "and the minute they
     saw me they began to walk in the ditches, one on one side of the road and one on the other. Now
     if only they had worn my costumes, such a damp and uncomfortable mode of going about the
     country would have been unnecessary; besides, it was absurd in any case. If you were walking
     with your mother-in-law you wouldn't walk as far apart as that; you wouldn't be able to hear a
     word she said."</t:p>
<t:p>"Ah! my dear young friend, that wouldn't matter," Lord Bobby interposed, "nor in any way
     interfere with the pleasure of the walk. Really nice men never make a fuss about little things
     like that. If only their mothers-in-law are kind enough to go out
     <t:pb n="280"/> walking with them, they don't a bit mind how far off they walk. It is in
     questions such as this that men are really so much more unselfish than women; because the
     mothers-in-law do mind—they like us to be near enough to hear what they say."</t:p>
<t:p>"Green frocks would be very nice for the girls, especially if they were fair," said Lady
     Robert thoughtfully; "but I think the men would look rather queer in green, don't you? As if
     they were actors."</t:p>
<t:p>"I'm afraid they would look a bit dissipated," Elisabeth assented; "like almonds-and-raisins
     by daylight. By the way, I know nothing that looks more dissipated than almonds-and-raisins by
     daylight."</t:p>
<t:p>"Except, perhaps, one coffee-cup in the drawing-room the morning after a dinner party,"
     suggested Farquhar.</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth demurred. "No; the coffee-cup is sad rather than sinful. It is as much part and
     parcel of a bygone time, as the Coliseum or the ruins of Pompeii; and the respectability of the
     survival of the fittest is its own. But almonds-and-raisins are different; to a certain class
     of society they represent the embodiment of refinement and luxury and self-indulgence."</t:p>
<t:p>Sir Wilfred Madderley laughed softly to himself. "I know exactly what you mean."</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, I don't agree with Miss Farringdon," Lord Bobby argued; "to my mind
     almonds-and-raisins are an emblem of respectability and moral worth, like chiffonniers and
     family albums and British matrons. No really bad man would feel at home with
     almonds-and-raisins, I'm certain; but I'd appoint as my trustee any man who could really enjoy
     <t:pb n="281"/> them on a Sunday afternoon. Now take Kesterton, for instance; he's the type of
     man who would really appreciate them. My impression is that when his life comes to be written,
     it will be found that he took almonds-and-raisins in secret, as some men take absinthe and
     others opium."</t:p>
<t:p>"It is scandalous to reveal the secrets of the great in this manner," said Elisabeth, "and to
     lower our ideals of them!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Forgive me; but still you must always have faintly suspected Kesterton of respectability,
     even when you admired him most. All great men have their weaknesses; mine is melancholy and
     Lord K.'s respectability, and Shakespeare's was something quite as bad, but I can't recall just
     now what it was."</t:p>
<t:p>"And what is Lady K.'s?" asked the hostess.</t:p>
<t:p>"Belief in Kesterton, of course, which she carries to the verge of credulity, not to say
     superstition. Would you credit it? When he was at the Exchequer she believed in his Budgets;
     and when he was at the War Office she believed in his Intelligence Department; and now he is in
     the Lords she believes in his pedigree, culled fresh from the Herald's Office. Can faith go
     further?"</t:p>
<t:p>"'A perfect woman nobly planned,'" murmured Elisabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>"Precisely," continued Bobby,</t:p>
<t:quote>
<t:l>"To rule the man who rules the land,</t:l>
<t:l>But yet a spirit still, and damp</t:l>
<t:l>With something from a spirit-lamp—</t:l>
</t:quote>
<t:p>or however the thing goes. I don't always quote quite accurately, you will perceive! I
     generally improve."
     <t:pb n="282"/></t:p>
<t:p>"I'm not sure that Lady Kesterton does believe in the pedigree," and Elisabeth looked wise;
     "because she once went out of her way to assure me that she did."</t:p>
<t:p>Lord Bobby groaned. "I beseech you to be careful, Miss Farringdon; you'll never get that
     photograph if you keep forgetting yourself like this!"</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth continued—</t:p>
<t:p>"If I were a man I should belong to the Herald's Office. It would be such fun to be called a
     'Red Bonnet' or a 'Green Griffin,' or some other nice fairy-tale-ish name; and to make it one's
     business to unite divided families, and to restore to deserving persons their long-lost
     great-great-grandparents. Think of the unselfish joy one would feel in saying to a worthy
     grocer, 'Here is your great-great-grandmother; take her and be happy!' Or to a successful
     milliner, 'I have found your mislaid grandfather; be a mother to him for the rest of your
     life!' It would give one the most delicious, fairy-godmotherly sort of satisfaction!"</t:p>
<t:p>"It would," Sir Wilfred agreed. "One would feel one's self a philanthropist of the finest
     water."</t:p>
<t:p>"Thinking about almonds-and-raisins has made me feel hungry," exclaimed Lady Silverhampton.
     "Let us have lunch! And while the servants are laying the table, we had better get out of the
     boat and have a stroll. It would be more amusing."</t:p>
<t:p>So the party wandered about for a while in couples through fields bespangled with buttercups;
     and it happened—not unnaturally—that Cecil and Elisabeth found themselves together.</t:p>
<t:p>"You are very quiet to-day," she said; "how is that? You are generally such a chatty person,
     but to-day you out-silence the Sphinx."
     <t:pb n="283"/></t:p>
<t:p>"You know the reason."</t:p>
<t:p>"No; I don't. To my mind there is no reason on earth strong enough to account for voluntary
     silence. So tell me."</t:p>
<t:p>"I am silent because I want to talk to you; and if I can't do that, I don't want to talk at
     all. But among all these grand people you seem so far away from me. Yesterday we were such
     close friends; but to-day I stretch out groping hands, and try in vain to touch you. Do you
     never dream that you seek for people for a long time and find them at last; and then, when you
     find them, you can not get near to them? Well, I feel just like that to-day with you."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth was silent for a moment; her thoughts were far away from Cecil. "Yes, I know that
     dream well," she said slowly, "I have often had it; but I never knew that anybody had ever had
     it except me." And suddenly there came over her the memory of how, long years ago, she used to
     dream that dream nearly every night. It was at the time when she was first estranged from
     Christopher, and when the wound of his apparent indifference to her was still fresh. Over and
     over again she used to dream that she and Christopher were once more the friends that they had
     been, but with an added tenderness that their actual intercourse had never known. Which of us
     has not experienced that strange dream-tenderness—often for the most unlikely people—which
     hangs about us for days after the dream has vanished, and invests the objects of it with an
     interest which their living presence never aroused? In that old dream of Elisabeth's her
     affection for Christopher was so great that when he went away she followed after him, and
     sought him for a long time in vain; and when at last she found him he was no longer the same
     Christopher that he
     <t:pb n="284"/> used to be, but there was an impassable barrier between them which she
     fruitlessly struggled to break through. The agony of the fruitless struggle always awakened
     her, so that she never knew what the end of the dream was going to be.</t:p>
<t:p>It was years since Elisabeth had dreamed this dream—years since she had even remembered
     it—but Cecil's remark brought it all back to her, as the scent of certain flowers brings back
     the memory of half-forgotten summer days; and once again she felt herself drawn to him by that
     bond of similarity which was so strong between them, and which is the most powerfully
     attractive force in the world—except, perhaps, the attractive force of contrast. It is the
     people who are the most like, and the most unlike, ourselves, that we love the best; to the
     others we are more or less indifferent.</t:p>
<t:p>"I think you are the most sympathetic person I ever met," she added. "You have what the
     Psalmist would call 'an understanding heart.'"</t:p>
<t:p>"I think it is only you whom I understand, Miss Farringdon; and that only because you and I
     are so much alike."</t:p>
<t:p>"I should have thought you would have understood everybody, you have such quick perceptions
     and such keen sympathies." Elisabeth, for all her cleverness, had yet to learn to differentiate
     between the understanding heart and the understanding head. There is but little real similarity
     between the physician who makes an accurate diagnosis of one's condition, and the friend who
     suffers from the identical disease.</t:p>
<t:p>"No; I don't understand everybody. I don't understand all these fine people whom we are with
     to-day, for instance. They seem to me so utterly worldly and frivolous and irresponsible, that
     I haven't
     <t:pb n="285"/> patience with them. I daresay they look down upon me for not having blood, and I
     know I look down upon them for not having brains."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth's eyes twinkled in spite of herself. She remembered how completely Cecil had been
     out of it in the conversation on the launch; and she wondered whether the King of Nineveh had
     ever invited Jonah to the state banquets. She inclined to the belief that he had not.</t:p>
<t:p>"But they have brains," was all she said.</t:p>
<t:p>Cecil was undeniably cross. "They talk a lot of nonsense," he retorted pettishly.</t:p>
<t:p>"Exactly. People without brains never talk nonsense; that is just where the difference comes
     in. If a man talks clever nonsense to me, I know that man isn't a fool; it is a sure test."</t:p>
<t:p>"There is nonsense and nonsense."</t:p>
<t:p>"And there are fools and fools." Elisabeth spoke severely; she was always merciless upon
     anything in the shape of humbug or snobbery. Maria Farringdon's training had not been thrown
     away.</t:p>
<t:p>"I despise mere frivolity," said Cecil loftily.</t:p>
<t:p>"My dear Mr. Farquhar, there is a time for everything; and if you think that a lunch-party on
     the river in the middle of the season is a suitable occasion for discussing Lord Stonebridge's
     pecuniary difficulties, or solving Lady Silverhampton's religious doubts, I can only say that I
     don't." Elisabeth was irritated; she knew that Cecil was annoyed with her friends not because
     they could talk smart nonsense, but because he could not.</t:p>
<t:p>"Still, you can not deny that the upper classes are frivolous," Cecil persisted.</t:p>
<t:p>"But I do deny it. I don't think that they are a bit more frivolous than any other class, but
     I think
     <t:pb n="286"/> they are a good deal more plucky. Each class has its own particular virtue, and
     the distinguishing one of the aristocracy seems to me to be pluck; therefore they make light of
     things which other classes of society would take seriously. It isn't that they don't feel their
     own sorrows and sicknesses, but they won't allow other people to feel them; which is, after
     all, only a form of good manners."</t:p>
<t:p>But Cecil was still rather sulky. "I belong to the middle class and I am proud of it."</t:p>
<t:p>"So do I; but identifying one's self with one class doesn't consist in abusing all the
     others, any more than identifying one's self with one church consists in abusing all the
     others—though some people seem to think it does."</t:p>
<t:p>"These grand people may entertain you and be pleasant to you in their way, I don't deny; but
     they don't regard you as one of themselves unless you are one," persisted Cecil, with all the
     bitterness of a small nature.</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth smiled with all the sweetness of a large one. "And why should they? Sir Wilfred and
     you and I are pleasant enough to them in our own way, but we don't regard any of them as one of
     ourselves unless he is one. They don't show it, and we don't show it: we are all too
     well-mannered; but we can not help knowing that they are not artists any more than they can
     help knowing that we are not aristocrats. Being conscious that certain people lack certain
     qualities which one happens to possess, is not the same thing as despising those people; and I
     always think it as absurd as it is customary to describe one's consciousness of one's own
     qualifications as self-respect, and other people's consciousness of theirs as pride and
     vanity."
     <t:pb n="287"/></t:p>
<t:p>"Then aren't you ever afraid of being looked down upon?" asked Cecil, to whom any sense of
     social inferiority was as gall and wormwood.</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth gazed at him in amazement. "Good gracious, no! Such an idea never entered into my
     head. I don't look down upon other people for lacking my special gifts, so why should they look
     down upon me for lacking theirs? Of course they would look down upon me and make fun of me if I
     pretended to be one of them, and I should richly deserve it; just as we look down upon and make
     fun of Philistines who cover their walls with paper fans and then pretend that they are
     artists. Pretence is always vulgar and always ridiculous; but I know of nothing else that is
     either."</t:p>
<t:p>"How splendid you are!" exclaimed Cecil, to whose artistic sense fineness of any kind always
     appealed, even if it was too high for him to attain to it. "Therefore you will not despise me
     for being so inferior to you—you will only help me to grow more like you, won't you?"</t:p>
<t:p>And because Cecil possessed the indefinable gift which the world calls charm, Elisabeth
     straightway overlooked his shortcomings, and set herself to assist him in correcting them.
     Perhaps there are few things in life more unfair than the certain triumph of these individuals
     who have the knack of gaining the affection of their fellows; or more pathetic than the
     ultimate failure of those who lack this special attribute. The race may not be to the swift,
     nor the battle to the strong; but both race and battle are, nine times out of ten, to the man
     or the woman who has mastered the art of first compelling devotion and then retaining it. It
     was the possession of this gift on the part of King David, that made men go in jeopardy
     <t:pb n="288"/> of their lives in order to satisfy his slightest whim; and it was because the
     prophet Elijah was a solitary soul, commanding the fear rather than the love of men, that after
     his great triumph he fled into the wilderness and requested for himself that he might die.
     Nevertheless, it must not be forgotten that to this lonely prophet it was granted to see
     visions of angels and to hear the still small Voice; and that, therefore, there are abundant
     compensations for those men and women who have not the knack of hearing and speaking the glib
     interchanges of affection, current among their more attractive fellows. There is infinite
     pathos in the thought of these solitary souls, yearning to hear and to speak words of loving
     greeting, and yet shut out—by some accident of mind or manner—from doing either the one or the
     other; but when their turn comes to see visions of angels and to hear the still small Voice,
     men need not pity them overmuch. When once we have seen Him as He is, it will matter but little
     to us whether we stood alone upon the mountain in the wind and the earthquake and the fire,
     while the Lord passed by; or whether He drew near and walked with us as we trod the busy ways
     of life, and was known of us, as we sat at meat, in breaking of bread.</t:p>
<t:p>As Elisabeth looked at him with eyes full of sympathy, Cecil continued—</t:p>
<t:p>"I have had such a hard life, with no one to care for me; and the hardness of my lot has
     marred my character, and—through that—my art."</t:p>
<t:p>"Tell me about your life," Elisabeth said softly. "I seem to know so little of you and yet to
     know you so well."</t:p>
<t:p>"You shall read what back-numbers I have, but most of them have been lost, so that I have not
     read
     <t:pb n="289"/> them myself. I really don't know who I am, as my father died when I was a baby,
     and my poor mother followed him in a few months, never having recovered from the shock of his
     death. I was born in Australia, at Broken Hill, and was an only child. As far as I can make
     out, my parents had no relations; or, if they had, they had quarrelled with them all. They were
     very poor; and when they died, leaving one wretched little brat behind them, some kind friends
     adopted the poor beggar and carried him off to a sheep-farm, where they brought him up among
     their own children."</t:p>
<t:p>"Poor little lonely boy!"</t:p>
<t:p>"I was lonely—more lonely than you can imagine; for, kind as they were to me, I was naturally
     not as dear to them as their own children. I was an outsider; I have always been an outsider;
     so, perhaps, there is some excuse for that intense soreness on my part which you so much
     deprecate whenever this fact is once more brought home to me."</t:p>
<t:p>"I am sorry that I was so hard on you," said Elisabeth, in a very penitent voice; "but it is
     one of my worst faults that I am always being too hard on people. Will you forgive me?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Of course I will." And Elisabeth—also possessing charm—earned forgiveness as quickly as she
     had accorded it.</t:p>
<t:p>"Please tell me more," she pleaded.</t:p>
<t:p>"The other children were such a loud, noisy, happy-go-lucky pack, that they completely
     overpowered a delicate, sensitive boy. Moreover, I detested the life there—the roughness and
     unrefinement of it all." And Cecil's eyes filled with tears at the mere remembrance of his
     childish miseries.</t:p>
<t:p>"Did you stay with them till you grew up?"
     <t:pb n="290"/></t:p>
<t:p>"Yes; I was educated—after a fashion—with their own sons. But at last a red-letter day dawned
     for me. An English artist came to stay at the sheep-farm, and discovered that I also was among
     the prophets. He was a bachelor, and he took an uncommon fancy to me; it ended in his adopting
     me and bringing me to England, and making of me an artist like himself."</t:p>
<t:p>"Another point of similarity between us!" Elisabeth cried; "my parents died when I was a
     baby, and I also was adopted."</t:p>
<t:p>"I am so glad; all the sting seems to be taken out of things if I feel I share them with
     you."</t:p>
<t:p>"Then where is your adopted father now?"</t:p>
<t:p>"He died when I was five-and-twenty, Miss Farringdon; and left me barely enough to keep me
     from abject poverty, should I not be able to make a living by my brush."</t:p>
<t:p>"And you have never learned anything more about your parents?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Never; and now I expect I never shall. The friends who brought me up told me that they
     believed my father came from England, and had been connected with some business over here; but
     what the business was they did not know, nor why he left it. It is almost impossible to find
     out anything more, after this long lapse of time; it is over thirty years now since my parents
     died. And, besides, I very much doubt whether Farquhar was their real name at all."</t:p>
<t:p>"What makes you think that?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Because the name was carefully erased from the few possessions my poor father left behind
     him. So now I have let the matter drop," added Cecil, with a bitter laugh, "as it is sometimes
     a mistake to
     <t:pb n="291"/> look up back-numbers in the colonies; they are not invariably pleasant
     reading."</t:p>
<t:p>Here conversation was interrupted by Lady Silverhampton's voice calling her friends to lunch;
     and Cecil and Elisabeth had to join the others.</t:p>
<t:p>"If any of you are tired of life," said her ladyship, as they sat down, "I wish you'd try
     some of this lobster mayonnaise that my new cook has made, and report on it. To me it looks the
     most promising prescription for death by torture."</t:p>
<t:quote>
<t:l>"O bid me die, and I will dare</t:l>
<t:l>E'en mayonnaise for thee,"</t:l>
</t:quote>
<t:p>exclaimed Lord Bobby, manfully helping himself.</t:p>
<t:p>And then the talk flowed on as pleasantly and easily as the river, until it was time to land
     again and return to town. But for the rest of the day, and for many a day afterward, a certain
     uncomfortable suspicion haunted Elisabeth, which she could not put away from her, try as she
     would; a suspicion that, after all, her throne was not as firmly fixed as she had hoped and had
     learned to believe.
