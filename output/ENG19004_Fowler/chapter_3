<t:head>MRS. BATESON'S TEA-PARTY</t:head>
<t:quote>
<t:l>The best of piggie when he dies</t:l>
<t:l>Is not "interred with his bones,"</t:l>
<t:l>But, in the form of porcine pies,</t:l>
<t:l>Blesses a world that heard his cries,</t:l>
<t:l>Yet heeded not those dying groans.</t:l>

<t:p>"Cousin Maria, please may I go to tea at Mrs. Bateson's with Christopher?" said Elisabeth one
     day, opening the library door a little, and endeavouring to squeeze her small person through as
     narrow an aperture as possible, as is the custom with children. She never called her playmate
     "Chris" in speaking to Miss Farringdon; for this latter regarded it as actually sinful to
     address people by any abbreviation of their baptismal names, just as she considered it
     positively immoral to partake of any nourishment between meals. "Mrs. Bateson has killed her
     pig, and there will be pork-pies for tea."</t:p>
<t:p>Miss Farringdon looked over her spectacles at the restless little figure. "Yes, my child; I
     see no reason why you should not. Kezia Bateson is a God-fearing woman, and her husband has
     worked at the Osierfield for forty years. I have the greatest respect for Caleb Bateson; he is
     a worthy man and a good Methodist, as his father was before him."
     <t:pb n="30"/></t:p>
<t:p>"He is a very ignorant man: he says Penny-lope."</t:p>
<t:p>"Says what, Elisabeth?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Penny-lope. I was showing him a book the other day about Penelope—the woman with the web,
     you know—and he called her Penny-lope. I didn't like to correct him, but I said Penelope
     afterward as often and as loud as I could."</t:p>
<t:p>"That was very ill-bred of you. Come here, Elisabeth."</t:p>
<t:p>The child came and stood by the old lady's chair, and began playing with a bunch of seals
     that were suspended by a gold chain from Miss Farringdon's waist. It was one of Elisabeth's
     little tricks that her fingers were never idle when she was talking.</t:p>
<t:p>"What have I taught you are the two chief ends at which every woman should aim, my
     child?"</t:p>
<t:p>"To be first a Christian and then a gentlewoman," quoted Elisabeth glibly.</t:p>
<t:p>"And how does a true gentlewoman show her good breeding?"</t:p>
<t:p>"By never doing or saying anything that could make any one else feel uncomfortable,"
     Elisabeth quoted again.</t:p>
<t:p>"Then do you think that to display your own knowledge by showing up another person's
     ignorance would make that person feel comfortable, Elisabeth?"</t:p>
<t:p>"No, Cousin Maria."</t:p>
<t:p>"Knowledge is not good breeding, remember; it is a far less important matter. A true
     gentlewoman may be ignorant; but a true gentlewoman will never be inconsiderate."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth hung her head. "I see."</t:p>
<t:p>"If you keep your thoughts fixed upon the people
     <t:pb n="31"/> to whom you are talking, and never upon yourself, you will always have good
     manners, my child. Endeavour to interest and not to impress them."</t:p>
<t:p>"You mean I must talk about their things and not about mine?"</t:p>
<t:p>"More than that. Make the most of any common ground between yourself and them; make the least
     of any difference between yourself and them; and, above all, keep strenuously out of sight any
     real or fancied superiority you may possess over them. I always think that Saint Paul's saying,
     'To the weak became I as weak,' was the perfection of good manners."</t:p>
<t:p>"I don't think I quite understand."</t:p>
<t:p>Miss Farringdon spoke in parables. "Then listen to this story. There was once a common
     soldier who raised himself from the ranks and earned a commission. He was naturally very
     nervous the first night he dined at the officers' mess, as he had never dined with gentlemen
     before, and he was afraid of making some mistake. It happened that the wine was served while
     the soup was yet on the table, and with the wine the ice. The poor man did not know what the
     ice was for, so took a lump and put it in his soup."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth laughed.</t:p>
<t:p>"The younger officers began to giggle, as you are doing," Miss Farringdon continued; "but the
     colonel, to whom the ice was handed next, took a lump and put it in his soup also; and then the
     young officers did not want to laugh any more. The colonel was a perfect gentleman."</t:p>
<t:p>"It seems to me," said Elisabeth thoughtfully, "that you've got to be good before you can be
     polite."
     <t:pb n="32"/></t:p>
<t:p>"Politeness appears to be what goodness really is," replied Miss Farringdon, "and is an
     attitude rather than an action. Fine breeding is not the mere learning of any code of manners,
     any more than gracefulness is the mere learning of any kind of physical exercise. The gentleman
     apparently, as the Christian really, looks not on his own things, but on the things of others;
     and the selfish person is always both unchristian and ill-bred."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth gazed wistfully up into Miss Farringdon's face. "I should like to be a real
     gentlewoman, Cousin Maria; do you think I ever shall be?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I think it quite possible, if you bear all these maxims in mind, and if you carry yourself
     properly and never stoop. I can not approve of the careless manners of the young people of
     to-day, who loll upon easy-chairs in the presence of their elders, and who slouch into a room
     with constrained familiarity and awkward ease," replied Miss Farringdon, who had never sat in
     an easy-chair in her life, and whose back was still as straight as an arrow.</t:p>
<t:p>So in the afternoon of that day Christopher and Elisabeth attended Mrs. Bateson's
     tea-party.</t:p>
<t:p>The Batesons lived in a clean little cottage on the west side of High Street, and enjoyed a
     large garden to the rearward. It was a singular fact that whereas all their windows looked upon
     nothing more interesting than the smokier side of the bleak and narrow street, their pigsties
     commanded a view such as can rarely be surpassed for beauty and extent in England. But Mrs.
     Bateson called her front view "lively" and her back view "dull," and congratulated herself
     daily upon the aspect and the prospect of her dwelling-place. The good lady's ideas as to what
     constitutes beauty in furniture were by no
     <t:pb n="33"/> means behind her opinions as to what is effective in scenery. Her kitchen was
     paved with bright red tiles, which made one feel as if one were walking across a coral reef,
     and was flanked on one side with a black oak dresser of unnumbered years, covered with a brave
     array of blue-and-white pottery. An artist would have revelled in this kitchen, with its
     delicious effects in red and blue; but Mrs. Bateson accounted it as nothing. Her pride was
     centred in her parlour and its mural decorations, which consisted principally of a large and
     varied assortment of funeral-cards, neatly framed and glazed. In addition to these there was a
     collection of family portraits in daguerreotype, including an interesting representation of
     Mrs. Bateson's parents sitting side by side in two straight-backed chairs, with their whole
     family twining round them—a sort of Swiss Family Laocoon; and a picture of Mr. Bateson—in the
     attitude of Juliet and the attire of a local preacher—leaning over a balcony, which was
     overgrown with a semi-tropical luxuriance of artificial ivy, and which was obviously too frail
     to support him. But the masterpiece in Mrs. Bateson's art-gallery was a soul-stirring
     illustration of the death of the revered John Wesley. This picture was divided into two
     compartments: the first represented the room at Wesley's house in City Road, with the assembled
     survivors of the great man's family weeping round his bed; and the second depicted the
     departing saint flying across Bunhill Fields burying-ground in his wig and gown and bands,
     supported on either side by a stalwart angel.</t:p>
<t:p>As Elisabeth had surmised, the entertainment on this occasion was pork-pie; and Mrs. Hankey,
     a near neighbour, had also been bidden to share the feast.
     <t:pb n="34"/> So the tea-party was a party of four, the respective husbands of the two ladies
     not yet having returned from their duties at the Osierfield.</t:p>
<t:p>"I hope that you'll all make yourselves welcome," said the hostess, after they had sat down
     at the festive board. "Master Christopher, my dear, will you kindly ask a blessing?"</t:p>
<t:p>Christopher asked a blessing as kindly as he could, and Mrs. Bateson continued:</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, to be sure, it is a pleasure to see you looking so tall and strong, Master
     Christopher, after all your schooling. I'm not in favour of much schooling myself, as I think
     it hinders young folks from growing, and puts them off their vittles; but you give the
     contradiction to that notion—doesn't he, Mrs. Hankey?"</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Hankey shook her head. It was her rule in life never to look on the bright side of
     things; she considered that to do so was what she called "tempting Providence." Her theory
     appeared to be that as long as Providence saw you were miserable, that Power was comfortable
     about you and let you alone; but if Providence discovered you could bear more sorrow than you
     were then bearing, you were at once supplied with that little more. Naturally, therefore, her
     object was to convince Providence that her cup of misery was full. But Mrs. Hankey had her
     innocent enjoyments, in spite of the sternness of her creed. If she took light things
     seriously, she took serious things lightly; so she was not without her compensations. For
     instance, a Sunday evening's discourse on future punishment and the like, with illustrations,
     was an unfailing source of pure and healthful pleasure to her; while a funeral sermon—when the
     chapel was hung with black, and
     <t:pb n="35"/> the bereaved family sat in state in their new mourning, and the choir sang Vital
     Spark as an anthem—filled her soul with joy. So when Mrs. Bateson commented with such unseemly
     cheerfulness upon Christopher's encouraging appearance, it was but consistent of Mrs. Hankey to
     shake her head.</t:p>
<t:p>"You can never tell," she replied—"never; often them that looks the best feels the worst; and
     many's the time I've seen folks look the very picture of health just before they was took with
     a mortal illness."</t:p>
<t:p>"Ay, that's so," agreed the hostess; "but I think Master Christopher's looks are the right
     sort; such a nice colour as he's got, too!"</t:p>
<t:p>"That comes from him being so fair complexioned—it's no sign of health," persisted Mrs.
     Hankey; "in fact, I mistrust those fair complexions, especially in lads of his age. Why, he
     ought to be as brown as a berry, instead of pink and white like a girl."</t:p>
<t:p>"It would look hideous to have a brown face with such yellow hair as mine," said Christopher,
     who naturally resented being compared to a girl.</t:p>
<t:p>"Master Christopher, don't call anything that the Lord has made hideous. We must all be as He
     has formed us, however that may be," replied Mrs. Hankey reprovingly; "and it is not our place
     to pass remarks upon what He has done for the best."</t:p>
<t:p>"But the Lord didn't make him with a brown face and yellow hair; that's just the point,"
     interrupted Elisabeth, who regarded the bullying of Christopher as her own prerogative, and
     allowed no one else to indulge in that sport unpunished.</t:p>
<t:p>"No, my love; that's true enough," Mrs. Bateson said soothingly: "a truer word than that
     never was spoken. But I wish you could borrow some of Master
     <t:pb n="36"/> Christopher's roses—I do, indeed. For my part, I like to see little girls with a
     bit of colour in their cheeks; it looks more cheerful-like, as you might say; and looks go a
     long way with some folks, though a meek and quiet spirit is better, taking it all round."</t:p>
<t:p>"Now Miss Elisabeth does look delicate, and no mistake," assented Mrs. Hankey; "she grows too
     fast for her strength, I'll be bound; and her poor mother died young, you know, so it is in the
     family."</t:p>
<t:p>Christopher looked at Elisabeth with the quick sympathy of a sensitive nature. He thought it
     would frighten her to hear Mrs. Hankey talk in that way, and he felt that he hated Mrs. Hankey
     for frightening Elisabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>But Elisabeth was made after a different pattern, and was not in the least upset by Mrs.
     Hankey's gloomy forebodings. She was essentially dramatic; and, unconsciously, her first object
     was to attract notice. She would have preferred to do this by means of unsurpassed beauty or
     unequalled talent; but, failing these aids to distinction, an early death-bed was an
     advertisement not to be despised. In her mind's eye she saw a touching account of her short
     life in Early Days, winding up with a heart-rending description of its premature close; and her
     mind's eye gloated over the sight.</t:p>
<t:p>The hostess gazed at her critically. "She is pale, Mrs. Hankey, there's no doubt of that; but
     pale folks are often the healthiest, though they mayn't be the handsomest. And she is wiry, is
     Miss Elisabeth, though she may be thin. But is your tea to your taste, or will you take a
     little more cream in it?"</t:p>
<t:p>"It is quite right, thank you, Mrs. Bateson; and the pork-pie is just beautiful. What a light
     hand for pastry you always have! I'm sure I've said over and
     <t:pb n="37"/> over again that I don't know your equal either for making pastry or for engaging
     in prayer."</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Bateson, as was natural, looked pleased. "I doubt if I ever made a better batch of pies
     than this. When they were all ready for baking, Bateson says to me, 'Kezia,' he says, 'them
     pies is a regular picture—all so smooth and even-like, you can't tell which from t'other.'
     'Bateson,' said I, 'I've done my best with them; and if only the Lord will be with them in the
     oven, they'll be the best batch of pies this side Jordan.'"</t:p>
<t:p>"And so they are," said Elisabeth; "they are perfectly lovely."</t:p>
<t:p>"I'm glad you fancy them, my love; take some more, deary, it'll do you good."</t:p>
<t:p>"No, thanks; I'd rather have a wig now." And Elisabeth helped herself to one of the
     three-cornered cakes, called "wigs," which are peculiar to Mershire.</t:p>
<t:p>"You always are fortunate in your pigs," Mrs. Hankey remarked; "such fine hams and such
     beautiful roaded bacon I never see anywhere equal to yours. It'll be a sad day for you, Mrs.
     Bateson, when swine fever comes into the district. I know no one as'll feel it more."</t:p>
<t:p>"Now you must tell us all about your niece's wedding, Mrs. Hankey," Mrs. Bateson said—"her
     that was married last week. My word alive, but your sister is wonderful fortunate in settling
     her daughters! That's what I call a well-brought-up family, and no mistake. Five daughters, and
     each one found peace and a pious husband before she was five-and-twenty."</t:p>
<t:p>"The one before last married a Churchman," said Mrs. Hankey apologetically, as if the union
     thus referred to were somewhat morganatic in its character,
     <t:pb n="38"/> and therefore no subject for pride or congratulation.</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, to be sure! Still, he may make her a good husband."</t:p>
<t:p>"He may or he may not; you never can tell. It seems to me that husbands are like new
     boots—you can't tell where they're going to pinch you till it's too late to change 'em. And as
     for creaking, why, the boots that are quietest in the shop are just the ones that fairly
     disgrace you when you come into chapel late on a Sunday morning, and think to slip in quietly
     during the first prayer; and it is pretty much the same with husbands—those that are the
     meekest in the wooing are the most masterful to live with."</t:p>
<t:p>"What was the name of the Churchman your niece married?" asked Mrs. Bateson. "I forget."</t:p>
<t:p>"Wilkins—Tom Wilkins. He isn't a bad fellow in some respects—he is steady and sober, and
     never keeps back a farthing of his wages for himself; but his views are something dreadful. I
     can not stand them at any price, and so I'm forever telling his wife."</t:p>
<t:p>"Dear me! That's sad news, Mrs. Hankey."</t:p>
<t:p>"Would you believe it, he don't hold with the good old Methodist habit of telling out loud
     what the Lord has done for your soul? He says religion should be acted up to and not talked
     about; but, for my part, I can't abide such closeness."</t:p>
<t:p>"Nor I," agreed Mrs. Bateson warmly; "I don't approve of treating the Lord like a poor
     relation, as some folks seem to do. They'll go to His house and they'll give Him their money;
     but they're fairly ashamed of mentioning His Name in decent company."</t:p>
<t:p>"Just so; and that's Tom Wilkins to the life.
     <t:pb n="39"/> He's a good husband and a regular church-goer; but as for the word that edifieth,
     you might as well look for it from a naked savage as from him. Many a time have I said to his
     wife, 'Tom may be a kind husband in the time of prosperity, as I make no doubt he is—there's
     plenty of that sort in the world; but you wait till the days of adversity come, and I doubt
     that then you'll be wishing you'd not been in such a hurry to get married, but had waited till
     you had got a good Methodist!' And so she will, I'll be bound; and the sooner she knows it the
     better."</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Bateson sighed at the gloomy prospect opening out before young Mrs. Wilkins; then she
     asked:</t:p>
<t:p>"How did the last daughter's wedding go off? She married a Methodist, surely?"</t:p>
<t:p>"She did, Mrs. Bateson; and a better match no mother could wish for her daughter, not even a
     duchess born; he's a chapel-steward and a master-painter, and has six men under him. There he
     is, driving to work and carrying his own ladders in his own cart, like a lord, as you may say,
     by day; and there he is on a Thursday evening, letting and reletting the pews and sittings
     after service, like a real gentleman. As I said to my sister, I only hope he may be spared to
     make Susan a good husband; but when a man is a chapel-steward at thirty-four, and drives his
     own cart, you begin to think that he is too good for this world, and that he is almost ripe for
     a better one."</t:p>
<t:p>"You do indeed; there's no denying that."</t:p>
<t:p>"But the wedding was beautiful: I never saw its equal—never; and as for the prayer that the
     minister offered up at the end of the service, I only wish you'd been there to hear it, Mrs.
     Bateson, it was so interesting and instructive. Such a lot of information in it about love and
     marriage and the like as I'd never
     <t:pb n="40"/> heard before; and when he referred to the bridegroom's first wife, and drew a
     picture of how she'd be waiting to welcome them both, when the time came, on the further
     shore—upon my word, there wasn't a dry eye in the chapel!" And Mrs. Hankey wiped hers at the
     mere remembrance of the scene.</t:p>
<t:p>"But what did Susan say?" asked Elisabeth, with great interest. "I expect she didn't want
     another wife to welcome them on the further shore."</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh! Miss Elisabeth, what a naughty, selfish little girl you are!" exclaimed Susan's aunt,
     much shocked. "What would Miss Farringdon think if she heard you? Why, you don't suppose,
     surely, that when folks get to heaven they'll be so greedy and grasping that they'll want to
     keep everything to themselves, do you? My niece is a good girl and a member of society, and she
     was as pleased as anybody at the minister's beautiful prayer."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth was silent, but unconvinced.</t:p>
<t:p>"How is your sister herself?" inquired Mrs. Bateson. "I expect she's a bit upset now that the
     fuss is all over, and she hasn't a daughter left to bless herself with."</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Hankey sighed cheerfully. "Well, she did seem rather low-spirited when all the mess was
     cleared up, and Susan had gone off to her own home; but I says to her, 'Never mind, Sarah, and
     don't you worry yourself; now that the weddings are over, the funerals will soon begin.' You
     see, you must cheer folks up a bit, Mrs. Bateson, when they're feeling out of sorts."</t:p>
<t:p>"You must indeed," agreed the lady of the house, feeling that her guest had hit upon a happy
     vein of consolation; "it is dull without daughters when you've once got accustomed to 'em,
     daughters being
     <t:pb n="41"/> a sight more comfortable and convenient than sons, to my mind."</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, you see, daughters you can teach to know theirselves, and sons; you can't. Though even
     daughters can never rest till they've got married, more's the pity. If they knowed as much
     about men as I do, they'd be thanking the Lord that He'd created them single, instead of
     forever fidgeting to change the state to which they were born."</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, I holds with folks getting married," argued Mrs. Bateson; "it gives 'em something to
     think about between Sunday's sermon and Thursday's baking; and if folks have nothing to think
     about, they think about mischief."</t:p>
<t:p>"That's true, especially if they happen to be men."</t:p>
<t:p>"Why do men think about mischief more than women do?" asked Elisabeth, who always felt
     hankerings after the why and wherefore of things.</t:p>
<t:p>"Because, my dear, the Lord made 'em so, and it is not for us to complain," replied Mrs.
     Hankey, in a tone which implied that, had the rôle of Creator been allotted to her, the
     idiosyncrasies of the male sex would have been much less marked than they are at present.
     "They've no sense, men haven't; that's what is the matter with them."</t:p>
<t:p>"You never spoke a truer word, Mrs. Hankey," agreed her hostess; "the very best of them don't
     properly know the difference between their souls and their stomachs; and they fancy that they
     are a-wrestling with their doubts, when really it is their dinners that are a-wrestling with
     them. Now take Bateson hisself, and a kinder husband or a better Methodist never drew breath;
     yet so sure as he touches a bit of pork, he begins to worn hisself about the doctrine of
     Election till there's no living with him."
     <t:pb n="42"/></t:p>
<t:p>"That's a man all over, to the very life," said Mrs. Hankey sympathetically; "and he never
     has the sense to see what's wrong with him, I'll be bound."</t:p>
<t:p>"Not he—he wouldn't be a man if he had. And then he'll sit in the front parlour and engage in
     prayer for hours at a time, till I says to him, 'Bateson,' says I, 'I'd be ashamed to go
     troubling the Lord with a prayer when a pinch o' carbonate o' soda would set things straight
     again.'"</t:p>
<t:p>"And quite right, Mrs. Bateson; it's often a wonder to me that the Lord has patience with
     men, seeing that their own wives haven't."</t:p>
<t:p>"And to me, too. Now Bateson has been going on like this for thirty years or more; yet if
     there's roast pork on the table, and I say a word to put him off it, he's that hurt as never
     was. Why, I'm only too glad to see him enjoying his food if no harm comes of it; but it's
     dreary work seeing your husband in the Slough of Despond, especially when it's your business to
     drag him out again, and most especially when you particularly warned him against going in."</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Hankey groaned. "The Bible says true when it tells us that men are born to give trouble
     as the sparks fly upward; and it is a funny Providence, to my mind, as ordains for women to be
     so bothered with 'em. At my niece's wedding, as we were just speaking about, 'Susan,' I says,
     'I wish you happiness; and I only hope you won't live to regret your marriage as I have done
     mine.' For my part, I can't see what girls want with husbands at all; they are far better
     without them."</t:p>
<t:p>"Not they, Mrs. Hankey," replied Mrs. Bateson warmly; "any sort of a husband is better than
     none, to my mind. Life is made up of naughts and
     <t:pb n="43"/> crosses; and the folks that get the crosses are better off than those that get the
     naughts, though that husbands are crosses I can't pretend to deny; but I haven't patience with
     single women, I haven't—they have nothing to occupy their minds, and so they get to talking
     about their health and such-like fal-lals."</t:p>
<t:p>"Saint Paul didn't hold with you," said Mrs. Hankey, with reproach in her tone; "he thought
     that the unmarried women minded the things of the Lord better than the married ones."</t:p>
<t:p>"Saint Paul didn't know much about the subject, and how could he be expected to, being only a
     bachelor himself, poor soul? But if he'd had a wife, she'd soon have told him what the
     unmarried women were thinking about; and it wouldn't have been about the Lord, I'll be bound.
     Now take Jemima Stubbs; does she mind the things of the Lord more than you and I do, Mrs.
     Hankey, I should like to know?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I can't say; it is not for us to judge."</t:p>
<t:p>"Not she! Why, she's always worrying about that poor little brother of hers, what's lame. I
     often wish that the Lord would think on him and take him, for he's a sore burden on Jemima, he
     is. If you're a woman you are bound to work for some man or another, and to see to his food and
     to bear with his tantrums; and, for my part, I'd rather do it for a husband than for a father
     or a brother. There's more credit in it, as you might say."</t:p>
<t:p>"There's something in that, maybe."</t:p>
<t:p>"And after all, in spite of the botheration he gives, there's something very cheerful in
     having a man about the house. They keep you alive, do men. The last time I saw Jemima Stubbs
     she was as low as low could be. 'Jemima,' I says, 'you are out of
     <t:pb n="44"/> spirits.' 'Mrs. Bateson,' says she, 'I am that. I wish I was either in love or in
     the cemetery, and I don't much mind which.'"</t:p>
<t:p>"Did she cry?" asked Elisabeth, who was always absorbingly interested in any one who was in
     trouble. With her, to pity was to love; and it was difficult for her ever to love where she did
     not pity. Christopher did not understand this, and was careful not to appeal to Elisabeth's
     sympathy for fear of depressing her. Herein, both as boy and man, he made a great mistake. It
     was not as easy to depress Elisabeth as it was to depress him; and, moreover, it was sometimes
     good for her to be depressed. But he did unto her as he would she should do unto him; and, when
     all is said and done, it is difficult to find a more satisfactory rule of conduct than
     this.</t:p>
<t:p>"Cry, lovey?" said Mrs. Bateson; "I should just think she did—fit to break her heart."</t:p>
<t:p>Thereupon Jemima Stubbs became a heroine of romance in Elisabeth's eyes, and a new interest
     in her life. "I shall go and see her to-morrow," she said, "and take her something nice for her
     little brother. What do you think he would like, Mrs. Bateson?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Bless the child, she is one of the Good Shepherd's own lambs!" exclaimed Mrs. Bateson, with
     tears in her eyes.</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Hankey sighed. "It is the sweetest flowers that are the readiest for transplanting to
     the Better Land," she said; and once again Christopher hated her.</t:p>
<t:p>But Elisabeth was engrossed in the matter in hand. "What would he like?" she persisted—"a new
     toy, or a book, or jam and cake?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I should think a book, lovey; he's fair set on
     <t:pb n="45"/> books, is Johnnie Stubbs; and if you'd read a bit to him yourself, it would be a
     fine treat for the lad."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth's eyes danced with joy. "I'll go the first thing to-morrow morning, and read him my
     favourite chapter out of The Fairchild Family; and then I'll teach him some nice games to play
     all by himself."</t:p>
<t:p>"That's a dear young lady!" exclaimed Mrs. Bateson, in an ecstasy of admiration.</t:p>
<t:p>"Do you think Jemima will cry when I go?"</t:p>
<t:p>"No, lovey; she wouldn't so far forget herself as to bother the gentry with her troubles,
     surely."</t:p>
<t:p>"But I shouldn't be bothered; I should be too sorry for her. I always am frightfully
     interested in people who are unhappy—much more interested than in people who are happy; and I
     always love everybody when I've seen them cry. It is so easy to be happy, and so dull. But why
     doesn't Jemima fall in love if she wants to?"</t:p>
<t:p>"There now!" cried Mrs. Bateson, in a sort of stage aside to an imaginary audience. "What a
     clever child she is! I'm sure I don't know, dearie."</t:p>
<t:p>"It is a pity that she hasn't got a Cousin Anne," said Elisabeth, her voice trembling with
     sympathy. "When you've got a Cousin Anne, it makes everything so lovely."</t:p>
<t:p>"And so it does, dearie—so it does," agreed Mrs. Bateson, who did not in the least understand
     what Elisabeth meant.</t:p>
<t:p>On the way home, after the tea-party was over, Christopher remarked:</t:p>
<t:p>"Old Mother Bateson isn't a bad sort; but I can't stand Mother Hankey."</t:p>
<t:p>"Why not?"</t:p>
<t:p>"She says such horrid things." He had not yet
     <t:pb n="46"/> forgiven Mrs. Hankey for her gloomy prophecies respecting Elisabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>"Not horrid, Chris. She is rather stupid sometimes, and doesn't know when things are funny;
     but she never means to be really horrid, I am sure."</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, I think she is an old cat," persisted Christopher.</t:p>
<t:p>"The only thing I don't like about her is her gloves," added Elisabeth thoughtfully; "they
     are so old they smell of biscuit. Isn't it funny that old gloves always smell of biscuit. I
     wonder why?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I think they do," agreed Christopher; "but nobody except you would ever have thought of
     saying it. You have a knack of saying what everybody else is thinking; and that is what makes
     you so amusing."</t:p>
<t:p>"I'm glad you think I'm amusing; but I can't see much funniness in just saying what is
     true."</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, I can't explain why it is funny; but you really are simply killing sometimes," said
     Christopher graciously.</t:p>
<t:p>The next day, and on many succeeding ones, Elisabeth duly visited Jemima Stubbs and the
     invalid boy, although Christopher entreated her not to worry herself about them, and offered to
     go in her place. But he failed to understand that Elisabeth was goaded by no depressing sense
     of duty, as he would have been in similar circumstances; she went because pity was a passion
     with her, and therefore she was always absorbingly interested in any one whom she pitied.
     Strength and success and such-like attributes never appealed to Elisabeth, possibly because she
     herself was strong, and possessed all the qualities of the successful person; but weakness and
     failure were all-powerful in enlisting her sympathy and
     <t:pb n="47"/>interest and, through these, her love. As Christopher grew older he dreamed dreams
     of how in the future he should raise himself from being only the nephew of Miss Farringdon's
     manager to a position of wealth and importance; and how he should finally bring all his glories
     and honours and lay them at Elisabeth's feet. His eyes were not opened to see that Elisabeth
     would probably turn with careless laughter from all such honours thus manufactured into her
     pavement; but if he came to her bent and bruised and brokenhearted, crushed with failure
     instead of crowned with success, her heart would never send him empty away, but would go out to
     him with a passionate longing to make up to him for all that he had missed in life.</t:p>
<t:p>A few days after Mrs. Bateson's tea-party he said to Elisabeth, for about the twentieth
     time:</t:p>
<t:p>"I say, I wish you wouldn't tire yourself with going to read to that Stubbs brat."</t:p>
<t:p>"Tire myself? What rubbish! nothing can tire me. I never felt tired in my life; but I
     shouldn't mind it just once, to see what it feels like."</t:p>
<t:p>"It feels distinctly unpleasant, I can tell you. But I really do wish you'd take more care of
     yourself, or else you'll get ill, or have headaches or something—you will indeed."</t:p>
<t:p>"No, I shan't; I never had a headache. That's another of the things that I don't know what
     they feel like; and yet I want to know what everything feels like—even disagreeable
     things."</t:p>
<t:p>"You'll know fast enough, I'm afraid," replied Christopher; "but even if it doesn't tire you,
     you would enjoy playing in the garden more than reading to Johnnie Stubbs—you know you would;
     and I can go and read to the little chap, if you are set on his being read to."
     <t:pb n="48"/></t:p>
<t:p>"But you would much rather play in the garden than read to him; and especially as it is your
     holidays, and your own reading-time will soon begin."</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh! <t:hi>I</t:hi> don't matter. Never bother your head about <t:hi>me</t:hi>; remember I'm all
     right as long as you are; and that as long as you're jolly, I'm bound to have a good time. But
     it riles me to see you worrying and overdoing yourself."</t:p>
<t:p>"You don't understand, Chris; you really are awfully stupid about understanding things. I
     don't go to see Jemima and Johnnie because I hate going, and yet think I ought; I go because I
     am so sorry for them both that my sorriness makes me like to go."</t:p>
<t:p>But Christopher did not understand, and Elisabeth could not make him do so. The iron of duty
     had entered into his childish soul; and, unconsciously, he was always trying to come between it
     and Elisabeth, and to save her from the burden of obligation which lay so heavily upon his
     spirit. He was a religious boy, but his religion was of too stern a cast to bring much joy to
     him; and he was passionately anxious that Elisabeth should not be distressed in like manner.
     His desire was that she should have sufficient religion to insure heaven, but not enough to
     spoil earth—a not uncommon desire on behalf of their dear ones among poor, ignorant human
     beings, whose love for their neighbour will surely atone in some measure for their injustice
     toward God.</t:p>
<t:p>"You see," Elisabeth continued, "there is nothing that makes you so fond of people as being
     sorry for them. The people that are strong and happy don't want your fondness, so it is no use
     giving it to them. It is the weak, unhappy people that want
     <t:pb n="49"/> you to love them, and so it is the weak, unhappy people that you love."</t:p>
<t:p>"But I don't," replied Christopher, who was always inclined to argue a point; "when I like
     people, I should like them just the same as if they went about yelling Te Deums at the top of
     their voices; and when I don't like them, it wouldn't make me like them to see them dressed
     from head to foot in sackcloth and ashes."</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh! that's a stupid way of liking, I think."</t:p>
<t:p>"It may be stupid, but it's my way."</t:p>
<t:p>"Don't you like me better when I cry than when I laugh?" asked Elisabeth, who never could
     resist a personal application.</t:p>
<t:p>"Good gracious, no! I always like you the same; but I'd much rather you laughed than cried—it
     is so much jollier for you; in fact, it makes me positively wretched to see you cry."</t:p>
<t:p>"It always vexes me," Elisabeth said thoughtfully, "to read about tournaments, because I
     think it was so horrid of the Queen of Beauty to give the prize to the knight who won."</t:p>
<t:p>Christopher laughed with masculine scorn. "What nonsense! Who else could she have given it
     to?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Why, to the knight who lost, of course. I often make up a tale to myself that I am the Queen
     of Beauty at a tournament; and when the victorious knight rides up to me with his visor raised,
     I just laugh at him, and say, 'You can have the fame and the glory and the cheers of the crowd;
     that's quite enough for you!' And then I go down from my daïs, right into the arena where the
     unhorsed knight is lying wounded, and take off his helmet, and lay his head on my lap, and say,
     'You shall have the
     <t:pb n="50"/> prize, because you have got nothing else!' So then that knight becomes my knight,
     and always wears my colours; and that makes up to him for having been beaten at the tournament,
     don't you see?"</t:p>
<t:p>"It would have been a rotten sort of tournament that was carried on in that fashion; and your
     prize would have been no better than a booby-prize," persisted Christopher.</t:p>
<t:p>"How silly you are! I'm glad I'm not a boy; I wouldn't have been as stupid as a boy for
     anything!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Don't be so cross! You must see that the knight who wins is the best knight; chaps that are
     beaten are not up to much."</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, they are the sort I like best; and if you had any sense you'd like them best, too."
     Whereupon Elisabeth removed the light of her offended countenance from Christopher, and dashed
     off in a royal rage.</t:p>
<t:p>As for him, he sighed over the unreasonableness of the weaker sex, but accepted it
     philosophically as one of the rules of the game; and Chris played games far too well to have
     anything but contempt for any one who rebelled against the rules of any game whatsoever. It was
     a man's business, he held, not to argue about the rules, but to play the game according to
     them, and to win; or, if that was out of his power, to lose pluckily and never complain.
