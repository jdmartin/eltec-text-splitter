<t:p>"Do you know what I mean to do as soon as Cousin Maria will let me?" Elisabeth asked of
     Christopher, as the two were walking together—as they walked not unfrequently—in Badgering
     Woods.</t:p>
<t:p>"No; please tell me."</t:p>
<t:p>"I mean to go up to the Slade School, and study there, and learn to be a great artist."</t:p>
<t:p>"It is sometimes a difficult lesson to learn to be great."</t:p>
<t:p>"Nevertheless, I mean to learn it." The possibility of failure never occurred to Elisabeth.
     "There is so much I want to teach the world, and I feel I can only do it through my pictures;
     and I want to begin at once, for fear I shouldn't get it all in before I die. There is plenty
     of time, of course; I'm only twenty-one now, so that gives me forty-nine years at the least;
     but forty-nine years will be none too much in which to teach the world all that I want to teach
     it."</t:p>
<t:p>"And what time shall you reserve for learning all that the world has to teach you?"
     <t:pb n="115"/></t:p>
<t:p>"I never thought of that. I'm afraid I sha'n't have much time for learning."</t:p>
<t:p>"Then I am afraid you won't do much good by teaching."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth laughed in all the arrogance of youth. "Yes, I shall; the things you teach best are
     the things you know, and not the things you have learned."</t:p>
<t:p>"I am not so sure of that."</t:p>
<t:p>"Surely genius does greater things than culture."</t:p>
<t:p>"I grant you that culture without genius does no great things; neither, I think, does genius
     without culture. Untrained genius is a terrible waste of power. So many people seem to think
     that if they have a spark of genius they can do without culture; while really it is because
     they have a spark of genius that they ought to be, and are worthy to be, cultivated to the
     highest point."</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, anyway—culture or no culture—I mean to set the Thames on fire some day."</t:p>
<t:p>"You do, do you? Well, it is a laudable and not uncommon ambition."</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, I do; and you mustn't look so doubtful on the subject, as it isn't pretty manners."</t:p>
<t:p>"Did I look doubtful? I'm very sorry."</t:p>
<t:p>"Horribly so. I know exactly what you will do, you are so shockingly matter-of-fact. First
     you will prove to a demonstration that it is utterly impossible for such an inferior being as a
     woman to set the Thames on fire at all. Then—when I've done it and London is illuminated—you
     will write to the papers to show that the 'flash-point' of the river is decidedly too low, or
     else such an unlooked-for catastrophe could never have occurred. Then you will get the
     Government to take the matter up, and to bring a charge of arson against the New Woman.
     <t:pb n="116"/> And, finally, you will have notices put up all along the banks from Goring to
     Greenwich, 'Ladies are requested not to bring inflammatory articles near the river; the right
     of setting the Thames on fire is now—as formerly—reserved specially for men.' And then you will
     try to set it on fire yourself."</t:p>
<t:p>"A most characteristic programme, I must confess. But now tell me; when you have set your
     Thames on fire, and covered yourself with laurels, and generally turned the world upside down,
     sha'n't you allow some humble and devoted beggarman to share your kingdom with you? You might
     find it a little dull alone in your glory, as you are such a sociable person."</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, if I do, of course I shall let some nice man share it with me."</t:p>
<t:p>"I see. You will stoop from your solitary splendour and say to the devoted beggarman, 'Allow
     me to offer you the post of King Consort; it is a mere sinecure, and confers only the semblance
     and not the reality of power; but I hope you will accept it, as I have nothing better to give
     you, and if you are submissive and obedient I will make you as comfortable as I can under the
     circumstances.'"</t:p>
<t:p>"Good gracious! I hope I am too wise ever to talk to a man in that way. No, no, Chris; I
     shall find some nice man, who has seen through me all the time and who hasn't been taken in by
     me, as the world has; and I shall say to him, 'By the way, here is a small fire and a few
     laurel leaves; please warm your hands at the one and wear the others in your button-hole.' That
     is the proper way in which a woman should treat fame—merely as a decoration for the man whom
     she has chosen."</t:p>
<t:p>"O noble judge! O excellent young woman!"
     <t:pb n="117"/> exclaimed Christopher. "But what are some of the wonderful things which you are
     so anxious to teach?"</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth's mood changed at once, and her face grew serious. "I want to teach people that
     they were sent into the world to be happy, and not to be miserable; and that there is no virtue
     in turning their backs to the sunshine and choosing to walk in the shade. I want to teach
     people that the world is beautiful, and that it is only a superficial view that finds it common
     and unclean. I want to teach people that human nature is good and not evil, and that life is a
     glorious battlefield and not a sordid struggle. In short, I want to teach people the dignity of
     themselves; and there is no grander lesson."</t:p>
<t:p>"Except, perhaps, the unworthiness of themselves," suggested Christopher.</t:p>
<t:p>"No, no, Chris; you are wrong to be so hard and cynical. Can't you understand how I am
     longing to help the men and women I see around me, who are dying for want of joy and beauty in
     their lives? It is the old struggle between Hellenism and Hebraism—between happiness and
     righteousness. We are sorely in need, here in England to-day, of the Greek spirit of Pantheism,
     which found God in life and art and nature, 'as well as in sorrow and renunciation and
     death."</t:p>
<t:p>"But it is in sorrow and renunciation and death that we need Him; and you, who have always
     had everything you want, can not understand this: no more could the Pagans and the Royalists;
     but the early Christians and the persecuted Puritans could."</t:p>
<t:p>"Puritanism has much to answer for in England," said Elisabeth; "we have to thank Puritanism
     for teaching men that only by hurting themselves can they please their Maker, and that God has
     given them
     <t:pb n="118"/> tastes and hopes and desires merely in order to mortify the same. And it is all
     false—utterly false. The God of the Pagan is surely a more merciful Being than the God of the
     Puritan."</t:p>
<t:p>"A more indulgent Being, perhaps, but not necessarily a more merciful one, Elisabeth. I
     disagree with the Puritans on many points, but I can not help admitting that their conception
     of God was a fine one, even though it erred on the side of severity. The Pagan converted the
     Godhead into flesh, remember; but the Puritan exalted manhood into God."</t:p>
<t:p>"Still, I never could bear the Puritans," Elisabeth went on; "they turned the England of
     Queen Elizabeth—the most glorious England the world has ever known—into one enormous
     Nonconformist Conscience; and England has never been perfectly normal since. Besides, they
     discovered that nature, and art, and human affection, which are really revelations of God, were
     actually sins against Him. As I said before, I can never forgive the Puritans for eradicating
     the beauty from holiness, and for giving man the spirit of heaviness in place of the garment of
     praise."</t:p>
<t:p>"I wonder if Paganism helped you much when you were poor and ill and unhappy, and things in
     general had gone wrong with you. I daresay it was very nice for the cheerful, prosperous
     people; but how about those who had never got what they wanted out of life, and were never
     likely to get it?" Christopher, like other people, looked at most matters from his own
     individual standpoint; and his own individual standpoint was not at all a comfortable spot just
     then.</t:p>
<t:p>"The Greeks suffered and died as did the Jews and the Christians," replied Elisabeth, "yet
     they were a joyous and light-hearted race. It is not sorrow that
     <t:pb n="119"/> saddens the world, but rather modern Christianity's idealization of sorrow. I do
     not believe we should be half as miserable as we are if we did not believe that there is virtue
     in misery, and that by disowning our mercies and discarding our blessings we are currying
     favour in the eyes of the Being, Who, nevertheless, has showered those mercies and those
     blessings upon us."</t:p>
<t:p>Thus had Alan Tremaine's influence gradually unmoored Elisabeth from the old faiths in which
     she had been brought up; and he had done it so gradually that the girl was quite unconscious of
     how far she had drifted from her former anchorage. He was too well-bred ever to be blatant in
     his unbelief—he would as soon have thought of attacking a man's family to his face as of
     attacking his creed; but subtly and with infinite tact he endeavoured to prove that to adapt
     ancient revelations to modern requirements was merely putting new wine into old bottles and
     mending old garments with new cloth; and Elisabeth was as yet too young and inexperienced to
     see any fallacy in his carefully prepared arguments.</t:p>
<t:p>She had nobody to help her to resist him, poor child! and she was dazzled with the
     consciousness of intellectual power which his attitude of mind appeared to take for granted.
     Miss Farringdon was cast in too stern a mould to have any sympathy or patience with the blind
     gropings of an undisciplined young soul; and Christopher—who generally understood and
     sympathized with all Elisabeth's difficulties and phases—was so jealous of her obvious
     attachment to Tremaine, and so unhappy on account of it, that for the time being the faithful
     friend was entirely swallowed up in the irate lover, sighing like one of the Osierfield
     furnaces. Of course this was very
     <t:pb n="120"/>unfair and tiresome of him—nobody could deny that; but it is sometimes trying to
     the amiability of even the best of men to realize that the purely mundane and undeserved
     accident of want of money can shut them off entirely from ever attaining to the best kind of
     happiness whereof their natures are capable—and especially when they know that their natures
     are capable of attaining and appreciating a very high standard of happiness indeed. It may not
     be right to be unsociable because one is unhappy, but it is very human and most particularly
     masculine; and Christopher just then was both miserable and a man.</t:p>
<t:p>There was much about Alan that was very attractive to Elisabeth: he possessed a certain
     subtlety of thought and an almost feminine quickness of perception which appealed powerfully to
     her imagination. Imagination was Elisabeth's weak, as well as her strong, point. She was
     incapable of seeing people as they really were; but erected a purely imaginary edifice of
     character on the foundations of such attributes as her rapid intuition either rightly or
     wrongly perceived them to possess. As a rule, she thought better of her friends than they
     deserved—or, at any rate, she recognised in them that ideal which they were capable of
     attaining, but whereto they sometimes failed to attain.</t:p>
<t:p>Life is apt to be a little hard on the women of Elisabeth's type, who idealize their fellows
     until the latter lose all semblance of reality; for experience, with its inevitable
     disillusionment, can not fail to put their ideal lovers and friends far from them, and to hide
     their etherealized acquaintances out of their sight; and to give instead, to the fond, trusting
     souls, half-hearted lovers, semi-sincere friends, and acquaintances who care for them only as
     the world can care.
     <t:pb n="121"/> Poor imaginative women—who dreamed that you had found a perfect knight and a
     faithful friend, and then discovered that these were only an ordinary selfish man and woman
     after all—life has many more such surprises in store for you; and the surprises will shock you
     less and hurt you more as the years roll on! But though life will have its surprises for you,
     death perchance will have none; for when the secrets of all hearts are opened, and all thwarted
     desires are made known, it may be that the ordinary selfish man and woman will stand forth as
     the perfect knight and faithful friend that God intended them, and you believed them, and they
     tried yet failed to be; and you will be satisfied at last when you see your beloved ones wake
     up after His likeness, and will smile as you say to them, "So it is really you after all."</t:p>
<t:p>Although Tremaine might be lacking in his duty toward God, he fulfilled (in the spirit if not
     in the letter) his duty toward his neighbour; and Elisabeth was fairly dazzled by his many
     schemes for making life easier and happier to the people who dwelt in the darkness of the Black
     Country.</t:p>
<t:p>It was while he was thus figuring as her ideal hero that Elisabeth went to stay with Felicia
     Herbert, near a manufacturing town in Yorkshire. Felicia had been once or twice to the Willows,
     and was well acquainted with the physical and biographical characteristics of the place; and
     she cherished a profound admiration both for Miss Farringdon and Christopher Thornley. Tremaine
     she had never met—he had been abroad each time that she had visited Sedgehill—but she
     disapproved most heartily of his influence upon Elisabeth, and of his views as set forth by
     that young lady. Felicia had been brought up along extremely strict lines, and in a spirit of
     comfortable
     <t:pb n="122"/> intolerance of all forms of religion not absolutely identical with her own;
     consequently, a man with no form of religion at all was to her a very terrible monster indeed.
     On the Sundays of her early youth she had perused a story treating of an Unbeliever (always
     spelled with a capital U), and the punishments that were meted out to the daughter of light who
     was unequally yoked with him; and she was imbued with a strong conviction that these same
     punishments were destined to fall upon Elisabeth's head, should Elisabeth incline favourably to
     the (at present) hypothetical suit of the master of the Moat House. Thus it happened that when
     Elisabeth came to the Herberts', full of girlish admiration for Alan Tremaine, Felicia did her
     best to ripen that admiration into love by abusing Alan in and out of season, and by
     endeavouring to prove that an attachment to him would be a soul-destroyer of the most
     irreparable completeness.</t:p>
<t:p>"It is no use talking to me about his goodness," she said; "nobody is good who isn't a
     Christian."</t:p>
<t:p>"But he is good," persisted Elisabeth—"most tremendously good. The poor people simply adore
     him, he does such a lot for them; and he couldn't have lovelier thoughts and higher ideals if
     he were a girl instead of a man. There must be different ways of goodness, Felicia."</t:p>
<t:p>"There are not different ways of goodness; mamma says there are not, and it is very wicked to
     believe that there are. I am afraid you are not half as religious as you were at Fox How."</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, I am; but I have learned that true religion is a state of mind rather than a code of
     dogmas."</t:p>
<t:p>Felicia looked uncomfortable. "I wish you wouldn't talk like that; I am sure mamma wouldn't
     <t:pb n="123"/> like it—she can not bear anything that borders on the profane."</t:p>
<t:p>"I am not bordering on the profane; I am only saying what I uphold is true. I can not take
     things for granted as you do; I have to think them out for myself; and I have come to the
     conclusion that what a man is is of far more importance than what a man believes."</t:p>
<t:p>"But you ought not to think things like that, Elisabeth; it isn't right to do so."</t:p>
<t:p>"I can't help thinking it. I am an independent being with a mind of my own, and I must make
     up that mind according to what I see going on around me. What on earth is the good of having an
     intellect, if you submit that intellect to the will of another? I wonder how you can take your
     ideas all ready-made from your mother," exclaimed Elisabeth, who just then was taking all hers
     ready-made from Alan Tremaine.</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, I can not argue. I am not clever enough; and, besides, mamma doesn't like us to argue
     upon religious subjects—she says it is unsettling; so I will only say that I know you are
     wrong, and then we will let the matter drop and talk about Christopher. How is he?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, he is all right, only very horrid. To tell you the truth, I am getting to dislike
     Christopher."</t:p>
<t:p>"Elisabeth!" Felicia's Madonna-like face became quite sorrowful.</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, I am; and so would you, if he was as stand-off to you as he is to me. I can't think
     what is wrong with him; but whatever I do, and however nice I try to be to him, the North Pole
     is warm and neighbourly compared with him. I'm sick of him and his unsociable ways!"
     <t:pb n="124"/></t:p>
<t:p>"But you and he used to be such friends."</t:p>
<t:p>"I know that; and I would be friends now if he would let me. But how can you be friends with
     a man who is as reserved as the Great Pyramid and as uncommunicative as the Sphinx, and who
     sticks up iron palings all round himself, like a specimen tree in the park, so that nobody can
     get near him? If a man wants a girl to like him he should be nice to her, and not require an
     introduction every time they meet."</t:p>
<t:p>Felicia sighed: her sweet, placid nature was apt to be overpowered by Elisabeth's rapid
     changes of front. "But he used to be so fond of you," she expostulated feebly.</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth shrugged her shoulders. "Oh, I suppose he likes me now, in his cold, self-satisfied
     way: it isn't that. What I complain of is that he doesn't admire me enough, and I do so love to
     be admired."</t:p>
<t:p>"Do you mean he doesn't think you are pretty?" Felicia always had to have things fully
     explained to her; excess of imagination could never lead her astray, whatever it might do to
     her friend.</t:p>
<t:p>"Of course not; I don't see how he could, considering that I'm not: women don't expect men to
     admire them for things that they don't possess," replied Elisabeth, who had still much to
     learn. "What I mean is he doesn't realize how clever I am—he despises me just as he used to
     despise me when I was a little girl and he was a big boy—and that is awfully riling when you
     know you are clever."</t:p>
<t:p>"Is it? I would much rather a man liked me than thought I was clever."</t:p>
<t:p>"I wouldn't; anybody can like you, but it takes a clever person to appreciate cleverness. I
     have
     <t:pb n="125"/> studied myself thoroughly, and I have come to the conclusion that I need
     appreciation far more than affection: I'm made like that."</t:p>
<t:p>"I don't understand you. To me affection is everything, and I can not live without it. If
     people are really fond of me, they can think me as stupid as they like."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth's face grew thoughtful; she was always interested in the analysis of herself and
     her friends. "How different we two are! I couldn't forgive a person for thinking me stupid,
     even if I knew that person adored me. To me no amount of affection would make up for the lack
     of appreciation. I want to be understood as well as liked, and that is where Christopher and I
     come across each other; he never understands me in the least. Now that is why Mr. Tremaine and
     I get on so well together; he understands and appreciates me so thoroughly."</t:p>
<t:p>Felicia's pretty month fell into stern lines of disapproval. "I am sure I should hate Mr.
     Tremaine if I knew him," she said.</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, no, you wouldn't—you simply couldn't, Felicia, he is so delightful. And, what is more,
     he is so frightfully interesting: whatever he says and does, he always makes you think about
     him. Now, however fond you were of Chris—and he really is very good and kind in some ways—you
     could never think about him: it would be such dreadfully uninteresting thinking, if you
     did."</t:p>
<t:p>"I don't know about that; Christopher is very comfortable and homelike, somehow," replied
     Felicia.</t:p>
<t:p>"So are rice-puddings and flannel petticoats, but you don't occupy your most exalted moments
     in meditating upon them."
     <t:pb n="126"/></t:p>
<t:p>"Do you know, Elisabeth, I sometimes think that Christopher is in love with you." Unlike
     Elisabeth, Felicia never saw what did not exist, and therefore was able sometimes to perceive
     what did.</t:p>
<t:p>"Good gracious, what an idea! He'd simply roar with laughter at the mere thought of such a
     thing! Why, Christopher isn't capable of falling in love with anybody; he hasn't got it in him,
     he is so frightfully matter-of-fact."</t:p>
<t:p>Felicia looked dubious. "Then don't you think he will ever marry?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, yes, he'll marry fast enough—a sweet, domestic woman, who plays the piano and does
     crochet-work; and he will talk to her about the price of iron and the integrity of the empire,
     and will think that he is making love, and she will think so too. And they will both of them go
     down to their graves without ever finding out that the life is more than meat or the body than
     raiment."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth was very hard on Christopher just then, and nothing that Felicia could say
     succeeded in softening her. Women are apt to be hard when they are quite young—and sometimes
     even later.</t:p>
<t:p>Felicia Herbert was the eldest of a large family. Her parents, though well-to-do, were not
     rich; and it was the dream of Mrs. Herbert's life that her daughter's beauty should bring about
     a great match. She was a good woman according to her lights, and a most excellent wife and
     mother; but if she had a weakness—and who (except, of course, one's self) is without one?—that
     weakness was social ambition.</t:p>
<t:p>"You will understand, my dear," she said confidentially to Elisabeth, "that it would be the
     greatest comfort to Mr. Herbert and myself to see Felicia married to a God-fearing man; and, of
     course, if he kept
     <t:pb n="127"/> his own carriage as well we should be all the better satisfied."</t:p>
<t:p>"I don't think that money really makes people happy," replied Elisabeth, strong in the
     unworldliness of those who have never known what it is to do without anything that money can
     buy.</t:p>
<t:p>"Of course not, my dear—of course not; nothing but religion can bring true happiness.
     Whenever I am tempted to be anxious about my children's future, I always check myself by
     saying, 'The Lord will provide; though I can not sometimes help hoping that the provision will
     be an ample one as far as Felicia is concerned, because she is so extremely nice-looking."</t:p>
<t:p>"She is perfectly lovely!" exclaimed Elisabeth enthusiastically; "and she gets lovelier and
     lovelier every time I see her. If I were to change places with all the rich men in the world, I
     should never do anything but keep on marrying Felicia."</t:p>
<t:p>"Still, she could only marry one of you, my dear. But, between ourselves, I just want to ask
     you a few questions about a Mr. Thornley whom Felicia met at your house. I fancied she was a
     wee bit interested in him."</t:p>
<t:p>"Interested in Chris! Oh! she couldn't possibly be. No girl could be interested in
     Christopher in that way."</t:p>
<t:p>"Why not, my dear? Is he so unusually plain?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh! no; he is very good-looking; but he has a good head for figures and a poor eye for
     faces. In short, he is a sensible man, and girls don't fall in love with sensible men."</t:p>
<t:p>"I think you are mistaken there; I do indeed. I have known many instances of women becoming
     sincerely attached to sensible men."
     <t:pb n="128"/></t:p>
<t:p>"You don't know how overpoweringly sensible Christopher is. He is so wise that he never makes
     a joke unless it has some point in it."</t:p>
<t:p>"There is no harm in that, my dear. I never see the point of a joke myself, I admit; but I
     like to know that there is one."</t:p>
<t:p>"And when he goes for a walk with a girl, he never talks nonsense to her," continued
     Elisabeth, "but treats her exactly as if she were his maiden aunt."</t:p>
<t:p>"But why should he talk nonsense to her? It is a great waste of time to talk nonsense; I am
     not sure that it is not even a sin. Is Mr. Thornley well off?"</t:p>
<t:p>"No. His uncle, Mr. Smallwood, is the general manager of our works; and Christopher has only
     his salary as sub-manager, and what his uncle may leave him. His mother was Mr. Smallwood's
     sister, and married a ne'er-do-weel-who left her penniless; at least, that is to say, if he
     ever had a mother—which I sometimes doubt, as he understands women so little."</t:p>
<t:p>"Still, I think we can take that for granted," said Mrs. Herbert, smiling with pride at
     having seen Elisabeth's little joke, and feeling quite a wit herself in consequence. One of the
     secrets of Elisabeth's popularity was that she had a knack of impressing the people with whom
     she talked, not so much with a sense of her cleverness as with a sense of their own. She not
     only talked well herself, she made other people talk well also—a far more excellent gift.</t:p>
<t:p>"So," she went on, "if his uncle hadn't adopted him, I suppose Chris would have starved to
     death when he was a child; and that would have been extremely unpleasant for him, poor boy!"
     <t:pb n="129"/></t:p>
<t:p>"Ah! that would have been terrible, my dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Herbert, so full of pity for
     Christopher that she was willing to give him anything short of her firstborn. She was really a
     kind-hearted woman.</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth looked out of the window at the group of stunted shrubs with black-edged leaves
     which entitled Felicia's home to be called Wood Glen. "There is one thing to be said in favour
     of starvation," she said solemnly, "it would keep one from getting stout, and stoutness is the
     cruellest curse of all. I'd rather be dead than stout any day."</t:p>
<t:p>"My dear child, you are talking nonsense. What would be the advantage of being thin if you
     were not alive?"</t:p>
<t:p>"When you come to that, what would be the advantage of being alive if you weren't thin?"
     retorted Elisabeth.</t:p>
<t:p>"The two cases are not parallel, my dear; you see you couldn't be thin without being alive,
     but you could be alive without being thin."</t:p>
<t:p>"It is possible; I have come across such cases myself, but I devoutly trust mine may never be
     one of them. As the hymn says, I shall always be 'content to fill a little space.'"</t:p>
<t:p>"Ah! but I think the hymn doesn't mean it quite in that sense. I believe the hymn refers
     rather to the greatness of one's attainments and possessions than to one's personal bulk."</t:p>
<t:p>Elisabeth opened her eyes wide with an expression of childlike simplicity. "Do you really
     think so?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I do, my dear. You know one must not take poetry too literally; verse writers are allowed
     what is termed 'poetic license,' and are rarely, if ever,
     <t:pb n="130"/> quite accurate in their statements. I suppose it would be too difficult for
     anybody to get both the truth and the rhyme to fit in, and so the truth has to be somewhat
     adapted. But about Mr. Thornley, my love; you don't think that he and Felicia are at all
     interested in one another?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Good gracious, no! I'm sure they are not. If they had been, I should have spotted it and
     talked about it ages ago."</t:p>
<t:p>"I hope you are not given to talk about such things, even if you do perceive them," said Mrs.
     Herbert, with reproof in her tone; "talking scandal is a sad habit."</t:p>
<t:p>"But it isn't scandal to say that a man is in love with a woman—in fact, it is the very
     opposite. It is much worse scandal never to talk about a woman in that way, because that means
     that you think she is either too old or too ugly to have a lover, and that is the worst scandal
     of all. I always feel immensely tickled when I hear women pluming themselves on the fact that
     they never get talked about; and I long to say to them, 'There is nothing to be proud of in
     that, my dears; it only means that the world is tacitly calling you stupid old frights.' Why,
     I'd rather people found fault with me than did not talk about me at all."</t:p>
<t:p>"Then I am afraid you are not 'content to fill a little space,'" said Mrs. Herbert
     severely.</t:p>
<t:p>"To tell you the truth I don't think I am," replied Elisabeth, with engaging frankness;
     "conceit is my besetting sin and I know it. Not stately, scornful, dignified pride, but
     downright, inflated, perky, puffed-up conceit. I have often remarked upon it to Christopher,
     and he has always agreed with me."
     <t:pb n="131"/></t:p>
<t:p>"But, my dear, the consciousness of a fault is surely one step toward its cure."</t:p>
<t:p>"Not it," replied Elisabeth, shaking her head; "I've always known I am conceited, yet I get
     conceiteder and conceiteder every year. Bless you! I don't want to 'fill a little space,' and I
     particularly don't want 'a heart at leisure from itself'; I think that is such a dull,
     old-maidish sort of thing to have—I wouldn't have one for anything. People who have hearts at
     leisure from themselves always want to understudy Providence, you will notice."</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Herbert looked shocked. "My dear, what do you mean?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I mean that really good people, who have no interests of their own, are too fond of playing
     the part of Providence to other people. That their motives are excellent I admit; they are not
     a bit selfish, and they interfere with you for your own good; but they successfully accomplish
     as much incurable mischief in half an hour as it would take half a dozen professional
     mischief-makers at least a year to finish off satisfactorily. If they can not mind their own
     business it doesn't follow that Providence can't either, don't you see?"</t:p>
<t:p>Whereupon Felicia entered the room, and the conversation was abruptly closed; but not before
     Mrs. Herbert had decided that if Providence had selected her daughter as the consoler of
     Christopher's sorrows, Providence must be gently and patiently reasoned with until another and
     more suitable comforter was substituted. She did not, of course, put the matter to herself thus
     barely; but this was what her decision practically amounted to.</t:p>
<t:p>But although people might not be talking, as Mrs. Herbert imagined, about Christopher and
     <t:pb n="132"/> Felicia, the tongues of Sedgehill were all agog on the subject of the evident
     attachment between Elisabeth Farringdon and the master of the Moat House.</t:p>
<t:p>"I'm afeared as our Miss Elisabeth is keeping company with that Mr. Tremaine; I am indeed,"
     Mrs. Bateson confided to her crony, Mrs. Hankey.</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Hankey, as was her wont, groaned both in spirit and in person. "So I've heard tell,
     more's the pity! Miss Elisabeth is no favourite of mine, as you know, being so
     dark-complexioned as a child, and I never could abide dark babies. I haven't much to be
     thankful for, I'm sure, for the Lord has tried me sore, giving me Hankey as a husband, and such
     a poor appetite as I never enjoy a meal from one year's end to another; but one thing I can
     boast of, and that is my babies were all fair, with as clear a skin as you could want to see.
     Still, I don't wish the young lady no harm, it not being Christian to do so; and it is sad at
     her age to be tied to a husband from which there is no outlet but the grave."</t:p>
<t:p>"I don't hold with you there, Mrs. Hankey; it is dull work for the women who have nobody to
     order 'em about and find fault with 'em. Why, where's the good of taking the trouble to do a
     thing well, if there's no man to blame you for it afterward? But what I want to see is Miss
     Elisabeth married to Master Christopher, them two being made for one another, as you might
     say."</t:p>
<t:p>"He has a new heart and a nice fresh colour, has Master Christopher; which is more than his
     own mother—supposing she was alive—could say for Mr. Tremaine."</t:p>
<t:p>"That is so, Mrs. Hankey. I'm afeared there isn't much religion about him. He don't even go
     to
     <t:pb n="133"/> church on a Sunday, let alone chapel; though he is wonderful charitable to the
     poor, I must admit."</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Hankey pursed up her mouth. "And what are works without faith, I should like to
     know!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Quite true—quite true; but maybe the Lord ain't quite as hard on us as we are on one
     another, and makes allowances for our bringing-up and such."</t:p>
<t:p>"Maybe," replied Mrs. Hankey, in a tone which implied that she hoped her friend was
     mistaken.</t:p>
<t:p>"You see," continued Mrs. Bateson, "there's nothing helps you to understand the ways of the
     Lord like having children of your own. Why, afore I was married, I was for whipping every child
     that was contrairy till it got good again; but after my Lucy Ellen was born, I found that her
     contrairiness made me sorry for her instead of angry with her, and I knowed as the poor little
     thing was feeling poorly or else she'd never have been like that. So instead of punishing her,
     I just comforted her; and the more contradictious she got, the more I knowed as she wanted
     comfort. And I don't doubt but the Lord knows that the more we kick against Him the more we
     need Him; and that He makes allowance accordingly."</t:p>
<t:p>"You seem to have comfortable thoughts about things; I only hope as you are not encouraging
     false hopes and crying peace where there is no peace," remarked Mrs. Hankey severely.</t:p>
<t:p>But Mrs. Bateson was not affrighted. "Don't you know how ashamed you feel when folks think
     better of you than you deserve? I remember years ago, when Caleb came a-courting me, I was
     minded once to throw him over, because he was full solemn to take a young maid's fancy. And
     when I was debating within myself whether I'd throw him over or
     <t:pb n="134"/> no, he says to me, 'Kezia, my lass,' he says, 'I'm not afeared as ye'll give me
     the slip, for all your saucy ways; other folks may think you're a bit flirty, but I know you
     better than they do, and I trust you with all my heart.' Do you think I could have disappointed
     him after that, Mrs. Hankey? Not for the whole world. But I was that ashamed as never was, for
     even having thought of such a thing. And if we poor sinful souls feel like that, do you think
     the Lord is the One to disappoint folks for thinking better of Him than He deserves? Not He,
     Mrs. Hankey; I know Him better than that."</t:p>
<t:p>"I only wish I could see things in such a cheerful light as you do."</t:p>
<t:p>"It was only after my first baby was born that I began to understand the Lord's ways a bit.
     It's wonderful how caring for other folks seems to bring you nearer to Him—nearer even than
     class meetings and special services, though I wouldn't for the world say a word against the
     means of grace."</t:p>
<t:p>This doctrine was too high for Mrs. Hankey; she could not attain to it, so she wisely took
     refuge in a side issue. "It was fortunate for you your eldest being a girl; if the Lord had
     thought fit to give me a daughter instead of three sons, things might have been better with
     me," she said, contentedly moving the burden of personal responsibility from her own shoulders
     to her Maker's.</t:p>
<t:p>"Don't say that, Mrs. Hankey. Daughters may be more useful in the house, I must confess, and
     less mischievous all round; but they can't work as hard for their living as the sons can when
     you ain't there to look after them."</t:p>
<t:p>"You don't know what it is to live in a house full of nothing but men, with not a soul to
     speak
     <t:pb n="135"/> to about all the queer tricks they're at, many a time I feel like Robinson Crusoe
     on a desert island among a lot of savages."</t:p>
<t:p>"And I don't blame you," agreed Mrs. Bateson sympathetically; "for my part I don't know what
     I should have done when Caleb and the boys were troublesome if I couldn't have passed remarks
     on their behaviour to Lucy Ellen; I missed her something terrible when first she was married
     for that simple reason. You see, it takes another woman to understand how queer a man is."</t:p>
<t:p>"It does, Mrs. Bateson; you never spoke a truer word. And then think what it must be on your
     death-bed to have the room full of stupid men, tumbling over one another and upsetting the
     medicine-bottles and putting everything in its wrong place. Many a time have I wished for a
     daughter, if it was but to close my eyes; but the Lord has seen fit to withhold His blessings
     from me, and it is not for me to complain: His ways not being as our ways, but often quite the
     reverse."</t:p>
<t:p>"That is so; and I wish as He'd seen fit to mate Miss Elisabeth with Master Christopher,
     instead of letting her keep company with that Mr. Tremaine."</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Hankey shook her head ominously. "Mr. Tremaine is one that has religious doubts."</t:p>
<t:p>"Ah! that's liver," said Mrs. Bateson, her voice softening with pity; "that comes from eating
     French kickshaws, and having no mother to see that he takes a dose of soda and nitre now and
     then to keep his system cool. Poor young man!"</t:p>
<t:p>"I hear as he goes so far as to deny the existence of a God," continued Mrs. Hankey.</t:p>
<t:p>"All liver!" repeated Mrs. Bateson; "it often takes men like that; when they begin to doubt
     the
     <t:pb n="136"/> inspiration of the Scriptures you know they will be all the better for a dose of
     dandelion tea; but when they go on to deny the existence of a God, there's nothing for it but
     chamomile. And I don't believe as the Lord takes their doubts any more seriously than their
     wives take 'em. He knows as well as we do that the poor things need pity more than blame, and
     dosing more than converting; for He gave 'em their livers, and we only have to bear with them
     and return thanks to Him for having made ours of a different pattern."</t:p>
<t:p>"And what do the women as have doubts need, I should like to know?"</t:p>
<t:p>"A husband and children is the best cure for them. Why, when a woman has a husband and
     children to look after, and washes at home, she has no time, bless you! to be teaching the Lord
     His business; she has enough to do minding her own."
