<t:head>WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS</t:head>
<t:p>"Half a minute, Dillon!" said the Commissioner abruptly, as the doctor, ushered in by a
     scarlet-sin-stain of an orderly, entered the tent where the former was working. "I must attend
     to these gentlemen first."</t:p>
<t:p>These gentlemen were Dya Ram, Ramanund, and a third very different sort of person,
     obtrusively Hindoo in face, figure, attire.</t:p>
<t:p>The Commissioner's manner, as he returned to the business in hand, changed from careless
     familiarity to an elaborate courtesy.</t:p>
<t:p>"I quite understand, <t:hi>pundit-sahib</t:hi>," he said in English to Ramanund, "that you are,
     as you say, actuated by no personal motive. A man of your attainments and culture can scarcely
     feel a keen interest in <t:hi>jogi</t:hi> Gorakh-nâth's--that is the name, I think--domicile in a
     gun barrel!"</t:p>
<t:p>The sarcasm was lost on the hearer, who smiled, satisfied. "Quite so, sir," he replied. "It
     is merely, as my friend Dya Ram postulates, a question as to the legality--"</t:p>
<t:p>The Commissioner interrupted him suavely. "In that case it is a matter for the courts,
     surely."</t:p>
<t:p>"Unless your Honour should, as magistrate, act under Section 418 providing for emergencies,"
     began Dya Ram; whereat the official sat back in his chair resignedly.</t:p>
<t:p>"Of course," he answered, his brogue running riot, as it always did, when he was
     contemptuous, "I have that power. But do ye really think, sir, that this present matter is of
     such paramount importance to the stability of the British Empire, that I should be justified in
     running counter to the ordinary course of law and justice?" Here the futility of his own
     sarcasm seemed to come home to him. He paused to consult a file, and when he looked up again,
     he spoke in Hindustani--evidently for the benefit of the third party. "There is no record
     whatever," he said briefly, "of any previous claim to the gun. It has been worshipped, of
     course; but that is a different matter. The military power has no intention of interfering with
     this habit. I may add that a counter petition, praying me not to allow appeal on the ground
     that this <t:hi>jogi</t:hi> is a man of ill fame, and a public nuisance, has been filed by the
      <t:hi>mohunt</t:hi> (guardian of shrines) at the Pool of Immortality."</t:p>
<t:p>The obtrusively Hindoo figure which had remained standing, though his companions were seated,
     here folded his hands as if in prayer, leant forward, and began garrulously:--</t:p>
<t:p>"<t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi> it is malice--malice of hereditary nature. They hope to gain money--"</t:p>
<t:p>"Exactly, <t:hi>Mohunt-jee</t:hi>; your money! if the pilgrims haven't the attraction of a live
     man in a gun close to your shrine your trade will suffer," interrupted the Commissioner, with
     brutal truth. "I am afraid I can do nothing. Of course," he continued, reverting to English,
     "if you bring a suit to claim prescriptive right, you may," here his patience gave way finally,
     "but God bless my soul, gentlemen! Surely men like you have something better to do than bolster
     up your countrymen in a preposterous business like this!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Pardon me, sir," protested Dya Ram, litigiously, "but if it is prescriptive right, vested in
     citizens, then--"</t:p>
<t:p>"Then, sir!" interrupted the stern, high voice, "the British Empire will have no choice but
     to allow <t:hi>jogi</t:hi> Gorakh-nâth to be a son-of-a-gun till the day of his death! So
     good-morning to you; unless--" here the suavity returned in full force--"there is any other
     subject you wish to bring forward."</t:p>
<t:p>There was not, apparently; and as the trio were ushered out, the Commissioner sat still
     further back in his chair, tilting it with his feet against the table, and ran his fingers
     through his hair in an exasperated fashion.</t:p>
<t:p>"'Pon my soul, it's inconceivable," he said; then, reaching forward, took up a newspaper that
     was lying on the table, and began to read.</t:p>
<t:p>"<t:hi>If we are asked what we, the educated natives of India, claim, we reply boldly, all
      things that Englishmen of equal culture possess by right of birth. We refuse flatly to be
      lumped in with the crass ignorance of our fellow-countrymen who have, alas! not yet risen to a
      pitch of desiring that liberty of which John Stuart Mill speaks in such glowing terms in his
      valuable pamphlet</t:hi>."</t:p>
<t:p>"Hark to that, now!" he commented, flinging the paper back. "That's Mr. Dya Ram's last, and
     it goes on, as per usual, to abuse. They asked me to put a name to it, and I've just been
     telling the confidential department that, barring a horrible misuse of synonym, there's no
     sedition, no harm in it whatever! And there isn't, Dillon. The son-of-a-gun business is ten
     times as dangerous. Dering's within his rights, but I wish to blazes he'd left the brute alone;
     or he might have put a blank cartridge in and fired a salute by mistake when Gorakh-nâth was
     inside! But ye can't keep the military in subjection. The department's aimin' at a fight, and
     small blame to it! I'm spoiling for one myself this instant moment; so come along, doctor, an'
     let me hear what your criminals have to say. There's a pretty sheaf of complaints for ye, ye
     hard-hearted murderin' slave driver!"</t:p>
<t:p>He took up a bulky file of papers as he spoke, and passed them to an orderly in exchange for
     his hat, which the man held ready.</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes! it's pretty good," assented the doctor, placidly, as, keeping step, the two passed out
     of the tent, so down the palm avenue towards the gaol, which the Commissioner was going to
     inspect. "It comes of their being idle. Wait till I get them digging again. I'll work the
     mischief out of them. When are we going on; and where?"</t:p>
<t:p>His companion shook his head. "Can't get an answer out of the Public Works. Is there anything
     you would like done, meanwhile?"</t:p>
<t:p>Dr. Dillon laughed sardonically. "Pretty considerable, rather! Only it would take months to
     get sanction. But, if you pass it, Smith says he could put a wire on from the Fort easily in a
     day. It would save sending by road if there was trouble, and the great thing is to hit back as
     quick as you can. The mutiny taught us that."</t:p>
<t:p>"Ay," said the Commissioner, musingly, "that's the straight tip; and that's why steam and
     electricity rule India. One can be ready without letting people know. If that had been the case
     in the mutiny--" he shrugged his shoulders, then went on--"these things come so easily; a touch
     starts them; but you mustn't show that you know it. Still, if you thought there would be any
     difficulty--I mean if you mightn't be able to hold your own till they came from the Fort--we
     might make some excuse for quartering a troop closer."</t:p>
<t:p>Dr. Dillon shook his head. "It isn't worth it. I believe myself they'll settle down when that
     big brute, Gopi, I told you about, gets his ticket to-morrow. If I didn't want to get rid of
     him I'd put him in cells for six weeks. And there's a warder, too,--or perhaps more. But
     there's no fear. I could hold the whole 'biz' myself, till the brutes managed to get off their
     leg irons, and as I keep every tool <t:hi>extra mural</t:hi>, I don't believe there's a bit of iron
     within the walls--except the shackles themselves. So I should have an hour or two,
     anyhow--"</t:p>
<t:p>"Now, here you are," he continued, with pardonable pride, as they passed under the mud
     archway which led into the gaol; a long archway with a massive door at either end, tunnelling a
     square block of flat-roofed building. "You'll find everything spick and span, I can tell you,
     for I've been making the beggars polish their own leg irons, so as to keep 'em a bit busy."</t:p>
<t:p>It was, indeed, spick and span, as only an Indian gaol can be, where everything, including
     the prisoners' beds, is freshly mud-plastered every week. Spick and span in a mere monotony of
     mud and lack of colour. The prisoners, fifteen hundred of them or more, stood in four long,
     straight rows, naked save for their waistcloths and the eared caps on their shaven heads; their
     blankets, folded to a small square under their feet, giving them a strangely wooden appearance,
     as if they stood on stands, like the figures in Noah's ark.</t:p>
<t:p>A couple of policemen fell out and drew their truncheons to walk close behind the
     Commissioner; but Dr. Dillon waved his pair back.</t:p>
<t:p>"Never show you expect anything," he said laconically, "and as I've always refused a guard, I
     can't take one now."</t:p>
<t:p>Nor was there any apparent need for one. Some faces scowled at him, but most were occupied
     with the Commissioner, who, when a prisoner raised his hand, paused to take the written
     petition which, nine times out of ten, was ready for presentation.</t:p>
<t:p>"There must be a good many warders in it," remarked the Commissioner, dryly. And the doctor
     nodded.</t:p>
<t:p>"Now there's only the hospital," said the latter, when the solitary cells had been inspected,
     the cook room interviewed, and the dinner to come tasted. "It won't take you long. There was
     only one case in this morning."</t:p>
<t:p>But as they entered the long open ward, like a cloister, mud-plastered as all else, but with
     iron beds looking strangely at variance with their surroundings, two of these were occupied,
     and at one, a hospital dresser was standing, looking somewhat scared.</t:p>
<t:p>Dr. Dillon gave a hasty exclamation as he stepped up to the bed and looked at the sick
     man.</t:p>
<t:p>"When did he come in?" he asked briefly.</t:p>
<t:p>"Ten minutes ago, <t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi>; the <t:hi>baboo</t:hi> hath given him--"</t:p>
<t:p>"Never mind what he hath given him," interrupted the doctor, holding up his hand in warning,
     "go on with it, and tell the <t:hi>baboo-sahib</t:hi> to come to me for orders--at once. Now then,
     sir, that's all--and a bit too much too--" he added in a lower voice, as they passed out
     together, "for it's a case of cholera."</t:p>
<t:p>The Commissioner looked grave. "That will complicate matters, won't it?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Can't say. You never can tell. They may take it as a dispensation, or there may never be
     another case. That fellow's done for, anyhow--he'll be dead in an hour."</t:p>
<t:p>"That's quick, isn't it?" asked his companion, calmly.</t:p>
<t:p>"Rather. I've seen a man go out in ten minutes, though. The worst of it is," he added, with a
     frown, "if there really is some conspiracy at the bottom of the discontent, it is as likely as
     not the devils who are working it, may take advantage of this--I don't mean of this
      death--<t:hi>that</t:hi> goes without saying. But when cholera is about, poison is hard to detect,
     and even if I stamp out the <t:hi>disease</t:hi>, which I mean to do, they may simulate it." He bit
     at his thumbnail viciously as he strode on, thinking and muttering. "By God!" he murmured, "if
     I could catch 'em at it! However," he added aloud, "it's no good fussing. If the thing comes,
     it comes, and I've kept you here too long as it is, sir. Do you know it's close on half-past
     ten?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Be jabers!" exclaimed the Commissioner, "only twenty minutes to bathe, shave, breakfast, and
     put on me gold lace continuations. Well, ta, ta! I'll see you at the show, of course."</t:p>
<t:p>Dr. Dillon looked puzzled for an instant; the puzzledom of a man whose thoughts are recalled
     from afar. "The show? Oh, yes! I was forgetting. Rather, sir. Why! it is as much my canal as
     Smith's, for we've done every inch of it together; besides, I have got to drive his wife
     down."</t:p>
<t:p>"Where the deuce is Dering?" asked the Commissioner, quite ingenuously; but George Dillon
     flushed up. It was visible even under his leather-like tan.</t:p>
<t:p>"I really can't say, sir; otherwise engaged, I presume."</t:p>
<t:p>His elder turned to him, surprised, yet with instant apology. "I'm sorry; I shouldn't have
     said it; but I really meant nothing."</t:p>
<t:p>Dr. Dillon gave a dry, sardonic laugh. "Oh! it is all right, sir. I quite believe you didn't.
     Nobody does mean anything in that sort of connection. It's left for the doctors to face facts
     as they are really; and then you call us brutal." He turned back, as he spoke, to the
     hospital.</t:p>
<t:p>Half an hour afterwards, however, having in the interim provided for every contingency he
     could foresee, including the bare possibility of his carrying infection, he appeared in Mrs.
     Smith's drawing-room, looking--for him--quite smart and spruce; since, as he had said, this end
     to three years' work was an event in his life also.</t:p>
<t:p>He found her, dressed in her daintiest, in a rocking-chair; and as he entered, his quick
     trained ear took in the petulance of the recurring push of one daintily shod foot. The room was
     darkened, and full of the scent of flowers. It was a familiar room to him, yet he never entered
     it without a glad recognition of the extreme feminine refinement shown in its every detail; for
     its mistress was one of those women whose fragility comes less from physical delicacy than from
     sensitiveness of mind.</t:p>
<t:p>She was leaning back in her chair listlessly; yet the white ringed hands which clasped the
     fair curls on her forehead showed an almost passionate strain of muscle.</t:p>
<t:p>"I believe you'll have to go without me," she said, as he approached, "I've such a racking
     headache. I don't believe I can face it--I'm sure I can't."</t:p>
<t:p>He passed on to her side, and laid his hand on one of hers for an instant, while his quick
     eye took in the details around him. A note had slipped from her lap to the floor. It lay face
     up, and the words "Dear Mrs. Smith, so sorry--" showed in Vincent Dering's writing. So, not
     content with the message of excuse sent her by the offender through him, she must have written!
     That was a dangerous development of the situation. He stood looking down at her indulgently, as
     he might on a fractious child who did not understand. And she did not--poor soul!</t:p>
<t:p>"You're nervous," he said. "Let me give you half a whiskey-and-soda before we start. It'll
     make you all right."</t:p>
<t:p>"Nervous!" she echoed irritably, her foot setting her chair a-swing to match her tone. "I'm
     never nervous--you know that is not one of my failings--is it?"</t:p>
<t:p>"No," he replied, "but you are a bundle of nerves for all that. You wouldn't be the woman you
     are if you weren't. And you are nervous at this moment. Nervous, despondent, out of heart.
     Come! make an effort!"</t:p>
<t:p>She gave a petulant little giggle of impatience. "You speak as if I were a Mrs. Dombey; but
     I'm not that sort. Besides, it killed her. I am not coming. It doesn't really matter, you know;
     nobody will miss me--it will be all right."</t:p>
<t:p>George Dillon, watching her, felt sorry, for once, at the correctness of his own diagnosis.
     He knew her so well that it seemed imperative to give her a hint of the reality. The danger of
     a final <t:hi>éclaircissement</t:hi> with Captain Dering seemed imminent, and the shock of it might
     lead to anything, if the knowledge of her own weakness came to her in the presence of the man
     she had cheated herself into calling a friend.</t:p>
<t:p>"Your husband would. It is a great day for him," he said, laying his dexterous surgeon's hand
     full on the raw. As he expected, the answer came passionately, and gave him an opening.</t:p>
<t:p>"He! O, he is quite happy as it is! He wouldn't miss me a bit. Why should he? I am not
     complaining, mind you--but why should he? He has interests enough without me."</t:p>
<t:p>Dr. Dillon deliberately sought for the nearest chair, drew it close, and sat down beside his
     patient in professional fashion, his eyes on her face, his hands on his knees.</t:p>
<t:p>"My dear lady," he said, "don't talk--excuse me--rubbish. Try and remember what women are
     always forgetting--that they <t:hi>are</t:hi> women, and that, while Eve swallowed her portion of
     the fatal apple, his stuck--thank God for it!--in Adam's throat."</t:p>
<t:p>She ceased her rocking, to sit and stare at him with a growing resentment, which belied the
     words that came at last, almost sullenly.</t:p>
<t:p>"I don't understand what you mean in the very least. What has Eve's apple to do with--my
     headache?"</t:p>
<t:p>"A very great deal," he answered coolly, "and with more than your headache, which, by the
     way, is only a symptom, not a cause. The real evil is--is something different. If you do not
     understand--though I think you do a little--" she shook her head--"I can only repeat my advice
     about the whiskey-and-soda; for I cannot explain to you crudely what I mean."</t:p>
<t:p>She interrupted him angrily. "You have no right to hint at things you dare not say."</t:p>
<t:p>Her very indignation betrayed her, and he smiled kindly. "Perhaps not," he said. Then he
     paused, hesitated, finally leant nearer, with a look of resolve in his queer, intelligent face.
     "But I will tell you what I can do. I can sacrifice my self-respect and tell you a bit of my
     personal history which I never meant you to know, but which may help to cure--your headache."
     His voice, usually so dry, had a softness in it, though he went on without the faintest
     emotion. "Mrs. Smith, I have done myself the honour for nearly three years, of considering you
     as near perfection as a woman can he. Allow me to finish, please! I have done more. I have
     been, as the phrase runs, in love with my ideal of perfection; but I think you will admit that
     I have never allowed my feelings to give you, myself, or anyone else a--shall we say, a nervous
     headache? Now, after that, don't you think we had better start?"</t:p>
<t:p>He rose in quite a matter-of-fact way, took up his hat, and waited for her answer.</t:p>
<t:p>He had to wait some time, while the petulance of her renewed rocking ceased gradually in a
     determined rhythm, and he felt his courage going down to his boots. It was heroic treatment,
     but she was a healthy subject, and her anger would pass. Anything was better than letting her
     perfection suffer.</t:p>
<t:p>The even creak of the rocker ended at last, and she rose, as he had risen, calmly, and faced
     him.</t:p>
<t:p>"I quite understand now what you meant, Dr. Dillon," she said freezingly, "and why you did
     not care to explain. I shall, of course, never be able to forgive you for daring to dream such
     a thing possible, but--"</t:p>
<t:p>"But," he interrupted, without a quiver, "you will take that half whiskey-and-soda. Here!
      <t:hi>qui-hi! Whiskey sharâb belâtee pani la'o juldi; mem-sahiba jata hai</t:hi>. (Bring
     whiskey-and-soda; the <t:hi>mem</t:hi> is going.)"</t:p>
<t:p>Perhaps the command of that assertion helped her to a decision. At any rate she did not
     countermand it, but spent the rather awkward pause which inevitably ensued in a perfect
     field-day of her hat-pins among her curls and veil. Whereat George Dillon, despite a certain
     bruised feeling, smiled, telling himself she was a true woman.</t:p>
<t:p>Nevertheless when, as she was stepping into the dogcart, his friendly help came necessarily
     to the fore again, she reverted to her dignified resentment. "I ought," she said stiffly, "to
     have thanked you for--for your good opinion of me, and your evident desire to be kind. I do so
     now. But I fear it will be quite impossible for me to forget or forgive the delusion."</t:p>
<t:p>"That is quite a minor matter," he put in, gleefully. "Now, cheer up, Bacilla, you brute, or
     we shall be late," Bacilla being his term of abuse for a pony which required a little
     stick.</t:p>
<t:p>They were only just in time, no more. Five minutes after they had joined the company gathered
     on the red-brick masonry of the canal head, under a canopy of waving garlands and gay bunting,
     with that inevitable British flag as the centre of all, the small man with the big star on his
     breast took a step forward, raised a handle, and, as the first drops of water trickled through
     a sluice, declared, in a violent Scotch accent, "that the Victoria-Kaiser-i-Hind" canal was
     open. So, keeping time as it were, slowly, majestically, to those (also inevitable) strains of
     "God save the Queen," the outer floodgates swung back, allowing the river to have permanent
     possession during good behaviour, of the walled basin between them and the inner ones. Thus,
     slowly, with a gurgling of water seeking its level, the surface rose till the half-open sluices
     in the second gates were reached, and a thin curve tipped over to fall with a splash, and send
     a tiny scout of a stream to find out what this new straight road might mean. Only a tiny scout,
     since the earthworks beyond had to be accustomed by degrees to their new tenant.</t:p>
<t:p>Still the new way was open, and the current of the river hesitated in the old one.</t:p>
<t:p>"Bravo, Smith!" cried George Dillon, coming round, when the cheering and general
     congratulations were over, to slap his colleague on the back, metaphorically and actually.
     "We've done that; and now perhaps, old man, you'll have time for other things."</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes," assented the tall, gaunt man, dreamily; "now I shall have time to settle that point
     about the searchlight."</t:p>
<t:p>"The what?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Search-light. There's been a correspondence in the <t:hi>Engineer</t:hi> about it; and as I've
     all the electric plant here, lying useless, now the show's over,--until it's wanted for
     something else, of course,--I am going to see if I can't overcome their difficulty in
     concentrating all the power on a sufficiently narrow area. I believe I know how to do it."</t:p>
<t:p>George Dillon looked at him with fierce, humorous exasperation. "Believe!" he echoed. "I know
     you can! You are the most intolerably circumscribed, self-concentrated, narrow-minded machine
     of a man I ever came across. Heaven help you!"</t:p>
<t:p>As he drove Mrs. Smith home again, it was his turn to sit mumchance until, womanlike, she
     relented faintly, and, exaggerating her own powers, trusted she had not been, <t:hi>etc</t:hi>.,
     though of course, <t:hi>etc</t:hi>.--</t:p>
<t:p>"Not in the least, thank you," he replied. "I was only meditating if I should tell you that I
     think Eugene has softening of the brain."</t:p>
<t:p>"Softening of the brain!" she echoed, horrified. "Oh, doctor, do you think it's that?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, it isn't softening of the heart, anyhow," he said grimly. "But I'm not joking. If
     someone doesn't get a hold on some portion of that man--I don't care what it is--heart, brain,
     stomach, anything--and prevent him from killing himself with work, India will lose her best
     engineer. What he wants is someone to--to give him a nervous headache!"</t:p>
<t:p>"We will leave that subject alone, please," she said loftily; but when her husband joined
     them in the verandah, she went over ostentatiously to him and pinned a carnation in his
     buttonhole, hoping he would like it better than the rose she gave him the day before,
     which--this was in a louder tone for the doctor's benefit--he had forgotten to put in!</t:p>
<t:p>"Did I, my dear?" replied her spouse. "Oh, yes! I remember you put it in my minim glass
     because I was working in my shirt-sleeves. Then I wanted the glass. So it got withered and the
     head snapped off."</t:p>
<t:p>Dr. Dillon laughed--his usual dry laugh. "That is one of the many tragedies which come from
     the delusion all women have that flowers can't be out of place."</t:p>
</t:div>
