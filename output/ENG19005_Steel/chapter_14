<t:head>MIRACLE MONGERS</t:head>
<t:p>Roshan Khân flung his cigarette away, and walked up and down his quarters in the Fort like an
     Englishman; he felt rather like one, also, in his vague distaste for something which refused to
     fit in with his previous experiences.</t:p>
<t:p>"So she will see my grandmother," he said, at last. "That is a step, certainly, but--" he
     turned quickly to Akbar Khân, "it seems impossible!"</t:p>
<t:p>The quondam chief-eunuch giggled like a girl. "Nothing is impossible with women, oh,
     Protector of the Poor!" he said; then, with a jaunty air of self-satisfaction, went on, "and
     this dust-like one has experience. She will see the female relation to-night after approved
     custom, and, since this is after the habits of the <t:hi>sahib-logue</t:hi>, she would perhaps see
     the--the Nawab-<t:hi>sahib</t:hi> tomorrow."</t:p>
<t:p>Roshan wheeled again in his walk at both the title and the suggestion, half indignantly, yet
     with a reluctant eagerness. "See--see me! Did she say aught of it?"</t:p>
<t:p>"A woman's wishes for a lover go not near her tongue, <t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi>; they keep to her
     heart," replied Akbar, still with his jaunty craft; "but if this visit of the female relation
     be auspicious, as God send it, then there would be no hindrance to the asking; and even if she
     said nay--"</t:p>
<t:p>Something in his hearer's face warned the old sinner he had to do with some novel code of
     conduct, and he paused, while Roshan continued his pacing.</t:p>
<t:p>He was disturbed beyond bounds. The foolish dream of a foolish old woman had come to be so
     far a reality, that the jealousy which had blazed up instinctively at the sight of Laila in
     that dress--so like a woman of his race--alone with a strange man, had come to be deliberate.
     More than once he had felt inclined to tell Pidar Narâyan what he had seen, even to write an
     anonymous letter of warning. He would have done so had he seen any subsequent hint of intimacy
     between these two. But he saw none; on the contrary, they seemed to avoid each other in public;
     and though this might be a blind, on the other hand Roshan had seen too much of some English
     women's ways not to know how trivial an offence against the proprieties it was to sit out
     dances in a balcony! Undoubtedly, however, this girl, who had taken his presents on the sly,
     who would receive his ambassadress on the sly, was not one whom it was necessary to treat with
     great ceremony. She was what the English language called a flirt; his own a stronger term. Not
     that it mattered, since no wife of his would have a chance of amusing herself.</t:p>
<t:p>So, after a while, he paused to say--with a scowl for the toothless grinning survival of a
     past society--"I would I knew if it were wise to trust thee? Why shouldst thou take the trouble
     thou dost? What is the affair to thee?"</t:p>
<t:p>Akbar's face was a study in sheer dignity. "'Tis but my duty, Cherisher of the Poor!" he
     said, almost pathetically. "For what other service were such as I am created?"</t:p>
<t:p>The hateful tragedy of this confession of degradation passed Roshan by; he saw nothing in it
     but an appeal to facts which gave him confidence.</t:p>
<t:p>"Yea!" he said, "I was forgetting. Such arrangings are meat and drink to thy sort. So take
     thy price. It shall be trebled if she bids me see her to-morrow, but--" here he laughed, half
     at himself,--"thou must needs work miracles for such favour to come so soon!"</t:p>
<t:p>Akbar, as he capered off, the rupees jingling in his pocket, to more legitimate and less
     lucrative pursuits, winked and leered to himself over his own surpassing wickedness and wisdom.
     Miracles! Ay; but it was nature worked them, not he. Given youth, proximity, a touch of
     surprise, a flavour of the forbidden, and the result, in his evil experience, was sure. In the
     meantime his part was to keep the ball from falling until the players took to playing the game
     for themselves; then the fun was over for the true go-between. He had to take a back seat and
     watch--he! he! he!--the miracle! A pretty miracle, indeed! The idea tickled him so that he
     could not keep it to himself, and as he passed through the bazaar, doing his daily marketing,
     he used his new avocation of miracle-monger as a reason for good bargains. The shop-keepers,
     however, shook their heads. Miracles paid the priests, and might suit such as he, but for their
     part they considered that there were too many miracles in Eshwara. What was the good of the
     pilgrims coming at all if all their money went to the temples, and they had not a pice left for
     a relic, or even a toy to take home to the toddlers whose feet were not yet strong enough for
     pilgrimage? Whereupon they would look discontentedly round the baskets of Brummagen brass gods,
     the Belgian-made rosaries, the patent Swedish self-lighting joss sticks, the machine-cut
     oblation cups, with which almost every other shop sought to attract custom. Baskets where a
     pious pilgrim could purchase a whole pantheon, and secure a modicum of divine favour--all duly
     trade-marked by Christians--for a few farthings.</t:p>
<t:p>"'Tis not our fault, brother," suggested a decrepit old Brahmin, with a wrinkled forehead all
     seamed with white markings, who--squatted in the gutter--was extolling the virtue of the sacred
      <t:hi>sâlig râmas</t:hi>, made unblushingly out of the ball stoppers of soda-water bottles, which
     lay exposed for sale on a handkerchief in front of him; a Manchester-made handkerchief, printed
     in the best style with the loves of Krishna. "We get no more than in the old days; nay, less.
     For, see you, the third-class ticket takes so much. And that is the <t:hi>Huzoors'</t:hi> fee. They
     send it all over the black water to make a mountain of silver in the streets of their big city,
     London. Oh, pious ones! Buy! Buy a sacred sin-expeller!"</t:p>
<t:p>The monotonous cry was caused by the appearance of a priest-led band of pilgrims; for, as
     yet, the great throng was not, when the whole narrow street would be a sea of heads, when even
     the saffron robes would be lost to sight, and the only thing visible would be the patient,
     anxious faces seeking redemption. That would come on the morrow,--the great day.</t:p>
<t:p>Meanwhile, reverent eyes turned to the bottle-stoppers, and one or two hands wandered to the
     little hoard set aside for regeneration, which was diminishing so rapidly under the claims of
     chaplets, lights, caste-markings, sprinkling, and miracles.</t:p>
<t:p>"There be too many, I say," reiterated a radical seller of drugs. "If the <t:hi>Sirkar</t:hi>
     puts a tax on my medicine for the body, why not on thine for the soul?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Nay, <t:hi>pinsari-jee!</t:hi>" chuckled the privileged wit and gossip of the bazaar, a cobbler
     who sat--by reason of his low caste--at a decent distance even from the crowd of customers
     which was awaiting a patch on the coverings of feet already worn and weary with their search
     after righteousness; "'tis a miracle when folk buy of you; and that comes not too often."</t:p>
<t:p>Even the pilgrims laughed; for laughter at a ready gibe comes easily in India. Yet they, too,
     felt inclined to agree with the drug-seller. One can get <t:hi>blasé</t:hi> even in miracles.</t:p>
<t:p>Therefore, naturally enough, when there was a choice, they chose the newest ones. And the
     newest of all was <t:hi>jogi</t:hi> Gorakh-nâth's promise of defying tampions, and locks, and
     chains, and, as in other years, blessing the crowd of worshippers from his self-inflicted
     penitentiary, inside the "<t:hi>Teacher of Religion</t:hi>."</t:p>
<t:p>And what was more, he had kept his promise. That very dawn, as a kind of walk over the
     course, he had performed the miracle before a select band of pilgrims, mostly <t:hi>jogies</t:hi>
     of his own sect who were now engaged in telling the tale to all and sundry in the city. What
     had occurred was briefly this. He had received his followers squatted on the stone steps in
     front of the gun, and had treated them to a dissertation on the mysteries of Yoga. Other less
     eminent practitioners in the art of miracles, he said, might have found it necessary to
     withhold the sight of the sacred person from devoted eyes. He, however, meant to show them his
     absolute independence of the body. He would leave it lying there, dead, while his soul went
     inside the gun, and blessed the pious ones. Accordingly his jaw had dropped; he had become
     rigid, callous apparently to the prickings of pins with which his assistants strove to make him
     wince, and, just as one of them withdrew a dagger, covered, of course, with gore from his very
     heart, a muffled voice of blessing had come from the very bowels of the gun.</t:p>
<t:p>If that was not a miracle, what was?</t:p>
<t:p>Anyhow, it caught on, so that as the day grew, the growing tide of pilgrims passed by the
     side-shows run in connection with the Pool of Immortality by its priests, and drifted off to
     the opposition show, leaving the <t:hi>impresarios</t:hi> behind them in a state of rage and
     despair. Rage, for if this sort of thing continued on the morrow they would lose their year's
     harvest, since the Host of God-seekers were ever the natural prey of priests; despair, because
     exposure of what experience told them <t:hi>must</t:hi> be a fraud, would only result in counter
     exposure. There must be honour among thieves to make the profession a lucrative one.</t:p>
<t:p>So they met in conclave, each with his miserable earnings in his hand, to point the dire
     urgency of action, and agreed on the wisdom of finding a cat's-paw to filch their chestnuts
     from the fire.</t:p>
<t:p>Thus it happened that Vincent Dering came over to Lance Carlyon's quarters half an hour
     before the time they had settled to start for the mission house, and asked him to look sharp,
     and send round to Roshan Khân to come along also, as he had private information--here, with a
     laugh, he threw a letter on the table--that miracles were being illegally performed in
     cantonments, and he expected some fun. Lance laughed also as he read the following:--</t:p>
<t:p>"To the Major General commanding. This is to give notice to all concerned that illegible
     miracles is now being performed by bare men in belly of great gun, contrary to astringent
     orders issued by my lord god. Therefore your petitioners pray for correct diagnosis of same,
     and removal from Cantonment boundaries with exhibitions not to miracle any more."</t:p>
<t:p>"By Jove!" he said, "our petitioner is a medical man--hospital dresser, I expect. Not to
     miracle any more!--h'm." His tone changed, his honest blue eyes clouded, for, ever since Erda
     Shepherd had told him what her future life was to be, the young fellow had been painfully aware
     that Eshwara had wrought a miracle on him; that he was no longer content to take life as he
     found it; that already he had begun to look forward and think of what life would be by and by.
     "I expect that would be a difficulty in Eshwara," he went on; "it's an awful place for
     upsetting the proper odds. Seems to me impossible to--to make a safe book on anything."</t:p>
<t:p>Vincent Dering shrugged his shoulders. He had been in the highest spirits for the last few
     days. "A safe book! The dullest thing in creation. That's why I like Eshwara. As I remember
     telling you, one can't count upon anything in the topsy-turvy place--not even one's self. They
     talk of the mystery of the East! By George! one is in grips with it here; so come along, Lance!
     and remove miracles from Cantonment boundaries at any rate!"</t:p>
<t:p>They found the union-jack of paths obliterated by an orderly crowd; for every hour, almost
     every minute, of the day had brought fresh units to that weary-footed, eager-eyed host of
     pilgrims. Here and there amongst them was to be seen the high-twined, badge-set turban of a
     policeman, ready, truncheon in hand, to assert the rights of law, but not many; since the rush
     of bathers had not yet come, and there was small danger to be feared from anything save that
     keen desire to be cleansed, which showed on almost every face. As the two Englishmen entered,
     however, followed by Roshan Khân, on whose features that fierce intolerance of his race for
     idolaters was written clearly, a murmur of tense anticipation ran through the packed courtyard.
     The miracle turn was evidently on.</t:p>
<t:p>It was. <t:hi>Jogi</t:hi> Gorakh-nâth lay as if dead on the raised stone platform in front of the
     gun, and two assistants were prodding him with pins.</t:p>
<t:p>"I've seen that in London," said Vincent, forcing his way rapidly through the yielding crowd,
     "so I can hardly object to it here; but if there is hanky-panky with my gun--"</t:p>
<t:p>At that instant, a bloody dagger, fresh apparently from the <t:hi>jogi's</t:hi> heart, was held
     up, and a curious hush fell on the courtyard. It was broken by a muffled voice, unmistakably
     from within the gun, and that was lost in a great roar of applause.</t:p>
<t:p>"A miracle! a miracle of the gods!"</t:p>
<t:p>Captain Dering, who with the others had now reached the centre, waited for the roar to
     subside a little, and then his voice rose and seemed to crush it.</t:p>
<t:p>"<t:hi>Risaldar-sahib</t:hi> You have the key of the padlock. Take out the tampion, and see who
     is inside."</t:p>
<t:p>As he spoke, his eyes were on the assistants, and something in their defiant assurance warned
     him that he was on the wrong tack, and made him cover possible discomfiture with the
     words,--"If there is no one, then someone here has the art of throwing his voice where he
     will."</t:p>
<t:p>As if in assent, the muffled blessing came, louder, this time, from the now un-tampioned gun,
     so that Roshan's face showed somewhat scared, as, with a salute, he announced as the result of
     his inspection, "There is no one, sir, I can see clear down the metal, but--but the voice is
     there."</t:p>
<t:p>A sound of such fierce approval ran through the crowd who were within hearing, that Captain
     Dering saw instantly that it would not be wise to court another failure.</t:p>
<t:p>"Close up the gun again," he said loudly. "So long as my orders are not disobeyed, and people
     keep their bodies out of my gun, their voices are welcome to it! Come along, Carlyon," he
     added, in English, "it's ventriloquism, of course, and I'd dearly like to catch the beast who
     does it, but we had better leave it alone for the present."</t:p>
<t:p>Lance, who, in sudden remembrance of the sound he had heard as he drifted past the
     bathing-steps in his canoe on the night of the dance, had been vainly overhauling the padlock
     and chain for signs of their having been tampered with, nodded his head, and let the chain
     swing back on its staple. The sudden jerk threw a new light on the matter. For the staple came
     out, disclosing the fact that it had been neatly filed through at the shank, and then replaced
     by means of a drilled hole and a pin.</t:p>
<t:p>The proof of tampering was clear, but nothing else.</t:p>
<t:p>"I have it," said Lance suddenly coming up with a red but triumphant face from a prolonged
     inspection down the huge muzzle, "they've shoved in a false end, and there's someone behind.
     Roshan! go back and fetch me my long gaff, and Roshan--my cleaning rod."</t:p>
<t:p>"And tell the guard to come out at once," added Captain Dering, heedful of the rising note of
     movement amongst the crowd, sign that it was growing restless.</t:p>
<t:p>"Stay! I've got a ripping idea!" cried Lance again, his face all abeam with delight--delight
     so catching that the crowd stilled as he turned to it. "Look here," he said confidentially, in
     Hindustani, "there's a boy in this gun. It must be a boy, and rather a small one, for there
     isn't room for anything big. Now isn't there a boy anywhere about the same size who'd like to
     come and draw him? He will be heads this way, and you will be able to get a good grip of his
     hair, and he will get a grip of your's, and--and it will be--be jolly!" The untranslatable word
     needed no translation. That something in the perfection of careless youth which touches the
     hearts of all mankind, put Lance and his audience in touch instantly.</t:p>
<t:p>A group of tall, grave-eyed Sikhs laughed uproariously, and nudged a lad beside them. "Go on,
     brotherling," they said, "thou art the best wrestler of the school. Go! show the
      <t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi> how thou canst hold thine own."</t:p>
<t:p>It needed no more. "Yea! try thy luck, brotherling," said a dozen voices, "and if thou canst
     not we will find a champion!"</t:p>
<t:p>That settled it. Five minutes afterwards Lance Carlyon found himself arranging the conditions
     of the draw, surrounded by half a dozen lads, each backed by eager supporters. By this time
     Roshan had returned, and with the aid of the gaff and one of the smallest of the guard, Lance's
     guess had been proved to be true. A neatly fitting disc of metal, cup-shaped to increase the
     resemblance to the end of the barrel had been withdrawn, leaving a head visible.</t:p>
<t:p>"It is beautifully tousled, and you'll get a good grip," said Lance, regretfully, as he
     helped the Sikh champion into the gun, "but it is bigger than I thought for, and you'll have
     your work cut out for you."</t:p>
<t:p>Then ensued the quaintest scene imaginable. The whole crowd, but five minutes before ready,
     almost, to fight for the truth of their miracle, were swaying breathless, excited, in sheer
     childish delight over the tussle to expose it.</t:p>
<t:p>"Lo! he comes--I see his toes--bravo, Gurdit! Nay, the other hath strength left! Sho!
     sonling, let not go for thy life! That is well done--Bravo! Bravo!"</t:p>
<t:p>So backwards and forwards, like a terrier and a badger, the draw wavered, Lance, watch in
     hand, calling time.</t:p>
<t:p>"Half a minute more! Go it, Gurdit!" he shouted. The encouragement had its effect. Gurdit's
     toes, his ankles, his calves showed beyond the gun; only his knees remained, giving him grip
     still.</t:p>
<t:p>"Wait for his knees. Wait till he loses grip!" shouted Lance--"twenty seconds more--fifteen,
     ten--f--there you are! that's it, fair!!"</t:p>
<t:p>Fair it was; the knees, pressing outwards steadily, every bronze muscle of them showing the
     strength of the drag, lost grip, and with a great yell of delight, half-a-dozen bearded Sikhs
     had hold of Gurdit's feet with such a vigorous pull, that Lance had to shove his knee forward,
     in a hurry, to prevent the boy from falling on his face; since both his hands were locked
     desperately in the tangled hair of a disciple so big that he came out of the gun with a cloop
     like a cork!</t:p>
<t:p>"It was the most sporting draw I've seen for years," said Lance enthusiastically, when, after
     much laughter and congratulation, the crowd parted with smiles to let the Englishmen pass, "and
     I'm glad you let the beggar off, Dering. It wasn't his fault, and he must have been beastly
     uncomfortable. Now, if you could have quodded the <t:hi>jogi</t:hi>--"</t:p>
<t:p>"I hope to do that by and by," replied Vincent significantly, "but it was just as well the
     crowd should laugh to-day. These religious gatherings are always a bit risky--and, as you know,
     Dillon is having trouble over at the gaol. 'Pon my soul, I don't know which is worst to
     manage--fifteen hundred scoundrels, or a hundred and fifty thousand saints."</t:p>
<t:p>"A hundred and fifty!" echoed Lance, "will there be as many as that?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Quite. So it is as well they should laugh; for even with the extra contingent of police we
     should find it a bit hard to manage them if they didn't."</t:p>
<t:p>True; but unfortunately the laughter of the many involves the discomfiture of the few; and in
     this case, these were the most unscrupulous men in Eshwara.</t:p>
