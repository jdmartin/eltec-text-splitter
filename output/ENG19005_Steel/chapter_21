<t:head>MARGHERITA</t:head>
<t:p>Father Ninian had been awake all night. He had been vaguely uneasy all day, conscious, with
     that fine perception of his, that something was amiss. But it was no fear of what
      <t:hi>might</t:hi> happen which had kept him watching when others slept. It was the memory of
     something which <t:hi>had</t:hi> happened; for, by a coincidence that for more than fifty years had
     never lost its mystical significance for Ninian Bruce--sentimentalist as he was to his finger
     tips--the night of the <t:hi>Vaisakh</t:hi> festival, when the pilgrims watched for the dawn to
     guide them on their way to the 'Cradle of the Gods,' was to him, personally, the saddest and
     gladdest of the whole year. Since it was the night on which he had sinned the great sin of his
     life, and repented of it, even in the sinning.</t:p>
<t:p>And that sinning, that repenting, was no slight thing to him. It was the man himself; for the
     passion that was in him in his youth was in him in his old age. It had only changed its
     dwelling-place. It had fled from the senses, and found refuge in the emotions. In a way,
     indeed, by thus seeking freedom from it, he had fallen into a greater thraldom, so that his
     whole life had been as much swayed by this renunciation of a woman as it would have been by her
     possession.</t:p>
<t:p>Old as he was, this very night had brought him--with the thought that Death could not delay
     much longer, and that next <t:hi>Vaisakh</t:hi> festival might find him no lonely watcher--that
     thrill of self-absorption in another self, that claim for all, which is the essence of passion.
     For this woman, waiting for him in the land where there is no marrying or giving in marriage,
     was still a woman; still the one of all God's creatures whom he claimed, and who claimed him,
     even as the first woman claimed the first man in Paradise.</t:p>
<t:p>So he had passed the night watches of the Festival of Spring: as he had always passed them.
     Partly in his room, that room made holy by her presence in his heart, partly in the chapel,
     made holy by the Bodily Presence of Him for Whose sake he had renounced her. The two holinesses
     were inextricably mixed in Pidar Narâyan's mind.</t:p>
<t:p>He had finished one of the masses for the repose of a sinning yet sainted soul, and, before
     repeating the next, was confessing his own repentance in his room, when that hasty footstep
     along the passage, which alarmed those two lovers in the balcony nearer the garden, had
     resounded through the arches. It had disturbed, but not startled him, its very boldness
     reassuring him of its right to be there. Probably it was some messenger from the police camp or
     the Fort. So he had risen from his knees calmly and passed into the chapel, which lay between
     his room and the balcony, in order to see who it could be. For the candles were lit on the
     Altar and sent a faint light into the vaulted passage beyond.</t:p>
<t:p>It was as he paused, in passing, to do homage to that Bodily Presence upon the Altar, which
     was ready--as he was in his robes--for the service of love which was to him, as a priest, his
     duty, as a man a joy unspeakable, that the pistol-shot came clamouring through the arches,
     followed by those despairing cries.</t:p>
<t:p>What they were he could not distinguish, but that they were urgent was unmistakable, and had
     he been young as he had been on that night long years ago in the balcony above the pale flood
     of the Tiber, he could not have been quicker to reach the armoury, seize the long rapier, which
     he had not used, save in play, since those ruffling days in Rome, and run out into the wide,
     dim passage whence the sound had reached him.</t:p>
<t:p>None too soon! Someone was already flying down it. He pulled himself up for attack, but the
     figure ere he could lunge at it was past him, desperate, indifferent, flinging him against the
     wall as it continued its reckless way to the outer door, where, with swift opening and closing,
     it disappeared into the crowded courtyard, out of sight--beyond recall!</t:p>
<t:p>He stood for a moment, stupefied. What was Roshan Khân doing there? For that faint light from
     the Altar had given him a glimpse of a familiar, dark face, Roshan Khân's without a doubt!</t:p>
<t:p>"Laila! Laila!"</t:p>
<t:p>The cry was clearer this time and the blood left his fine old face in sudden doubt as he
     turned swiftly to his left. Turned, and saw a faint red glow through an arch far down the
     passage.</t:p>
<t:p>That was the arch leading down into the balcony that was never lit up--that was never to be
     lit up because of something that had happened there long ago--because of the something which
     had <t:hi>begun</t:hi> a tragedy.</t:p>
<t:p>Why was it lit up? A stronger fear caught at his heart. Could Laila?--No!--impossible!</t:p>
<t:p>He ran on, and the next moment was realizing that some tragedy had <t:hi>ended</t:hi> in that
     balcony.</t:p>
<t:p>But what?</t:p>
<t:p>Who was the woman in native dress who stood with a man's arm around her--a man in a scarlet
     and gold mess jacket? Ah!--that was Captain Dering, undoubtedly. But the woman? The woman in
     scarlet and gold also--God in Heaven!--had the dead--</t:p>
<t:p>As he stared, the long, supple limbs, so clearly outlined under their cunningly contrived
     draperies, seemed to lose themselves in the colour, the glitter of rich stuff; one white arm,
     losing its hold on a cuff of scarlet and gold, swung back helplessly, and Vincent Dering, with
     a passionate entreaty to his darling not to be afraid, to look up, and tell him where she was
     hurt, sank to one knee the better to support what he held.</t:p>
<t:p>And so the face, tilted backwards over his shoulder, came in view.</t:p>
<t:p><t:hi>Laila!</t:hi></t:p>
<t:p>For an instant Ninian Bruce stood bewildered. Then all his youth, the pride of birth, the
     dash, and the fire which had made that youth what it had been, rose up in him. The blood surged
     back to his face in wild anger, in savage sense of insult, and desire for revenge.</t:p>
<t:p>"How dare you!" he cried, clenching his hand on his sword. "You shall answer for this, sir!
     How do you come to be here, at this time of night, and why?"</t:p>
<t:p>Vincent, who at the first word had given a hurried glance to see who the speaker was, then
     returned to his task with the indifference of one absolutely preoccupied, held up his hand
     passionately against more.</t:p>
<t:p>"Don't--and don't preach, for God's sake, old man!" he cried recklessly. "Come and help, if
     you like. Some brute--Oh, curse him! curse him!"</t:p>
<t:p>His one trembling hand, for the other was round her, supporting her, was busy with the
     quaint, jewelled clasps of the scented corselet, which was crimsoning deeper with another dye.
     "It's too late for preaching," he muttered, half to himself,--"too late! too late!"</t:p>
<t:p>The words seemed to stun his hearer into silence. He stood bewildered. Too late for what?</t:p>
<t:p>And now, roused by that pistol-shot also, another old man, who had carefully hidden himself
     away from the possibility of being found by Roshan Khân, on the rage for an impossible
     interview; who had counted, with malicious cunning, on the cooling effect of a useless waiting
     in the garden till dawn should make it necessary for hot-blooded lovers to return to the Fort,
     stole like a thief to the balcony. What could have happened? The only likely trouble which had
     occurred to his vast experience had been the possibility of Roshan Khân seeking the interview
     upstairs. And for that very reason had not he, Akbar Khân, felt it his duty to sleep outside
     his mistress's door? What more could faithful servitude be expected to do?</t:p>
<t:p>But this! What was this? His charge had stolen a march upon him. Old as he was in the care of
     frail womanhood, he had been imposed upon! Then, as he crept round a pillar craftily, the sight
     of Pidar Narâyan, in his priestly robes, made the old sinner throw up his hands and grovel in
     the dust.</t:p>
<t:p>"This slave knew nothing!" he mumbled, gasping. "This was unknown. And for the other, I told
     him it was too soon, too soon,--far too soon."</t:p>
<t:p>Too soon, and too late! What did it all mean? Father Ninian stood helpless, paralyzed; but
     Vincent caught at the words.</t:p>
<t:p>"The other!" he echoed. "You black devil! who was the other? Who was that man? Curse him!" He
     paused, for Laila opened her eyes.</t:p>
<t:p>"It was Roshan Khân," she said, with a smile, that half-amused, half-mysterious smile. "He
     gave me the dress, you know, and I think he wanted me--to marry him. Hush! what's the use of
     being angry--now?" She checked his incredulous outcry, and her hand hesitated up to his
     trembling fingers, and held them back from their task. "Don't," she went on; "I'd rather--you
     didn't waste time. I want you to look at me--only me--me, myself. Ah! that's nice!"</t:p>
<t:p>There was an instant's silence; then her eyes wandered to his cuff as it rested on her
     corselet, and she smiled again. "We match, don't we? I'm glad. Besides, it won't stain much. I
     expect--that's why soldiers wear red, isn't it?"</t:p>
<t:p>The deadly realism roused Vincent to a sort of fury at his own helplessness. But what could a
     man do, caught in a second by Fate to be chief actor in a scene like this, where he was
     lost,--lost utterly? And those two fools looking on--doing nothing!</t:p>
<t:p>"At least, in common charity, you might help. You're something of a doctor!" he cried
     passionately. "We can settle scores afterwards, you and I, can't we? But now you might help
      <t:hi>her</t:hi>."</t:p>
<t:p>"What did she say?" asked Father Ninian, tonelessly. He had caught a word or two, and their
     triviality, in the face of what had happened--a triviality common in those who have been struck
     down as she had been, almost painlessly--had but increased his bewilderment. "What does it
     mean? How do you come here? I must know, first."</t:p>
<t:p>The girl had turned her face quickly to the new voice; and, after vainly trying to rise, lay
     back breathlessly. "Tell him, Vincent; he's Father Laurence. Remember--he must know--and--and
     I--can't--"</t:p>
<t:p>"Then here it is, sir!" broke in Vincent, brutally. "If you will wait to know, when every
     moment is precious. We love each other--you've done it in your time, I'm told! I've been coming
     here, night after night, to see her; she wears that dress to please me--there! Now you've got
     it! And to-night, some devil--she says Roshan Khân, but she's dreaming; what can he have to do
     with it?--stood there and fired--at me, I think; but she flung herself--Ah! Laila, my darling,
     why did you? Now, will that satisfy you--you--you--"</t:p>
<t:p>"Hush!" came Laila's voice--"there is no use in being angry. Besides, he understands; he
     knows what it is to be in love quite well. Don't you, guardian? You loved her, didn't you?
     Margherita, I mean--"</t:p>
<t:p>She wandered off into Italian--the language they always spoke, and her rich voice dulled,
     died away, as the faintness returned.</t:p>
<t:p>"For God's sake, sir, bring the light, if you won't do anything else!" cried Vincent, wildly.
     "She has fainted, I think--I can't see--it is so dark. For God's sake, sir, the light at
     least!"</t:p>
<t:p>The light at least! As Father Ninian mechanically took the red lamp from its niche he felt
     that he needed no more light than those words, "he understands," had sent into his very soul.
     Yes, he knew what love was. But he knew also--it came home to him in a second--that his love,
     even after all these years, differed not at all from this girl's. He heard it in her
     voice--that voice so strangely like that other voice--which he remembered--oh! so well!</t:p>
<t:p>"Take off the shade," said Vincent, "it makes everything so--so red--you--you can't see the
     truth." He shivered as he spoke.</t:p>
<t:p>But that first look at the girl had been enough for Pidar Narâyan. It had roused him, his
     apathy was gone. He thrust the lamp into Vincent's trembling hands without a word, and his own
     steady ones--the hands which had not touched their kind, except to heal body or soul, since
     they had said farewell to a woman--took up the task.</t:p>
<t:p>So for a few minutes there was silence, but for the old pantaloon's ceaseless mumblings as he
     rocked himself backwards and forwards. He had meant no harm, he protested--he had conducted
     more affairs of the kind to a decent ending than he could well remember--no one could be more
     discreet--accidents would happen--</t:p>
<t:p>"She is shot through the lungs," said Father Ninian, breaking the silence. "There is very
     little to be done--I--I--" He would have said "<t:hi>fear</t:hi>," but for Vincent's face of
     anguish. What right had he to feel sorrow?--he, the man who had brought this about. "Still, I
     will try. Akbar! bring the candles from the altar. Stay! she had better go there. It will save
     time. You two can carry her."</t:p>
<t:p>But Vincent had her in his arms, with a brief "Where?"</t:p>
<t:p>"The chapel--the lights are lit. Lay her on the cushions before the altar. I will be with you
     again directly."</t:p>
<t:p>When he returned from his room with lint and bandages she was lying there as he had directed,
     her long red skirt trailing down the white steps.</t:p>
<t:p>"The candles, please,--the smaller ones, Akbar,--and place them at her head. They will give
     me a better light."</t:p>
<t:p>Vincent shivered again at the sight; she looked already dead, with those tall tapers about
     her. Ah! what did it all mean? Was he dreaming? How was it possible? The wild improbability of
     it stunned him; when not three hours ago he had had a sherry-and-bitters before dinner! The
     curious irrelevance of his thoughts made him feel as if he must wake soon. Yet there she lay.
     Laila, whom he loved!</t:p>
<t:p>"Is she--is she--" he began.</t:p>
<t:p>"Not dead, if you mean that," replied Father Ninian quietly. "But she will not live an
     hour."</t:p>
<t:p>There was no mincing matters between these two men--nothing but the brutal truth; yet this
     time it was the old priest who held up his hand against a passionate outcry. "Don't make a
     fuss. Be brave, at least, and don't disturb her. She is coming to herself again."</t:p>
<t:p>To herself certainly. To the old half-amused, half-mysterious smile, as her eyes caught the
     tapers, the lighted altar beyond, her lover kneeling at her side. "It is the wedding, I
     suppose," she said--there was a catch in her breath now--"but why have they put the candles
     like a bier? To save time, I suppose. But it mixes things up; and--" she gave a little
     impatient sigh--"Oh! tell him to be quick, Romeo, for--for we always meant to be married in the
     end--didn't we?"</t:p>
<t:p>The words cut Vincent like a knife. Yes! He had meant it. Not always. Not till, even to one
     with his past, the perfection of this idyll in the garden would have suffered without that
     promise to himself. And now, death should not cheat him, should not leave a stain, a regret, on
     the one perfect romance of his life. He stooped suddenly and kissed her; kissed her with more
     passion than he had ever kissed her before.</t:p>
<t:p>"It won't be long, Juliet; he is just going to begin," he whispered, then rose to his feet
     unsteadily.</t:p>
<t:p>This at least he could do for himself. And for her? A sob, almost of gratitude, of
     admiration, came to his eyes as he realized that it would never, never--even if she had
     lived--have mattered to her really. But it had been a part of the play; part of her as Juliet.
     So it should be. His wild revolt at the sequence of improbabilities--for after all that idyll
     in the garden had been, bar its environments, commonplace enough--which had landed him
      in--<t:hi>in an Adelphi drama!</t:hi>--(he could not help the thought, though he despised
     it)--should give way to this. The play should end with a wedding. Juliet should have the
      '<t:hi>statue of pure gold</t:hi>' in the eyes of the world. He could ensure this by a word; and
     the word should be spoken.</t:p>
<t:p>He touched Father Ninian peremptorily on the shoulder, as he bent, busy with his
     instruments.</t:p>
<t:p>"I want to speak to you. Hush! she must not hear. Father, you say she is dying. Well, I claim
     my right. I am a Catholic--I have sinned--we will say nothing about her--that lies between us.
     I wish to marry her while I can. I ask it as my right, of you, a priest. Do you understand? I
     ask you to marry us."</t:p>
<t:p>Ninian Bruce looked for an instant as if he could have killed the man who stood before him;
     then he drew himself up, priest utterly.</t:p>
<t:p>"Have you the right to claim it?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I claim it as a right," replied Vincent, fiercely. "That is enough, surely."</t:p>
<t:p>"It is not enough. I will ask her." And Pidar Narâyan knelt down beside the girl. "My
     daughter," he began, "Captain Dering tells me--" Then he gave way--"<t:hi>Cara mia</t:hi>," he
     whispered, laying his hand on hers, "tell me--I have never been unkind, surely--tell me--your
     old guardian, who has loved, who loves--must I marry you to--to <t:hi>him?</t:hi>"</t:p>
<t:p>Laila looked into his face with a faintly-wondering reply. "Must!" she echoed dreamily. "It's
     just as he likes, of course. I don't mind. I only want him--where is he?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I'm here, sweetheart." Vincent knelt down again and took her in his arms.</t:p>
<t:p>The faint querulousness left her voice. "That's nice," she murmured. "Tell him to begin
     quickly, Vincent, for I don't want to waste time. I want you--you, yourself, and me--me,
     myself--nothing else."</t:p>
<t:p>Father Ninian gave a sort of cry, and turned blindly to the altar. If this was not Love, what
     was?</t:p>
<t:p>Then, monotonously, his voice began the marriage service.</t:p>
<t:p>"Have you a ring?" he asked, when he came to stand by those two, the girl supported in
     Vincent's arms. The latter shook his head. "Go on without it," he said sternly; "she is failing
     fast."</t:p>
<t:p>But there was one on the old man's finger; one that had never left it since it had been put
     there by a saint in Paradise. He took it off now, and gave it to the man whom at that moment he
     hated and despised more than any man on earth.</t:p>
<t:p>So, swiftly, the prayers went on, and old Akbar paused in his rockings to say "Amen" with the
     others. He had learnt <t:hi>thus</t:hi> much in these latter days of grace.</t:p>
<t:p>The last one came as a step resounded down the passage; Lance Carlyon's step as he sought the
     light he had seen--sought his Captain. He seemed to bring a breath of fresh air into the
     passion-laden atmosphere, a solid reality into the shadows.</t:p>
<t:p>"Vincent!" he cried, as he caught sight of the scarlet and gold. "Thank God! you're here. The
     troopers have seized the Fort--" He paused suddenly, horror-struck at what had caught his eye.
     "I beg your pardon--I didn't know--is she--is she--hurt?--"</t:p>
<t:p>Vincent stood up suddenly. "Hush! that has nothing to do with it. Leave that to me. The
     troopers have risen? When?"</t:p>
<t:p>Lance, with his eyes still on that pitiful sight, shook his head.</t:p>
<t:p>"There was a pistol-shot--you must have heard it!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Heard it!" echoed Vincent, wildly. "Yes! I heard it. Go on! What then?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I don't know--I know nothing in this infernal nightmare that's got hold of us all!" cried
     Lance. "I only know that if we don't get to the gaol before they do--they've gone to set the
     prisoners free--there will be the devil of a row. So you must come at once, Vincent--you must
     come at once!"</t:p>
<t:p>Captain Dering gave an irresolute look at the dying girl. She had saved his life--he loved
     her--could he leave her? Was anything worth that sacrifice?</t:p>
<t:p>"You <t:hi>must</t:hi> go!" said a stern voice. It was Father Ninian's, who had taken Vincent's
     place and was now holding Laila in his arms. "You must go, Captain Dering, and prevent worse
     from befalling; if you can--if you can!" There was almost a triumph in his voice.</t:p>
<t:p>Lance looked from one to the other in sheer despair. "Well! if you won't come, I'm off--oh!
     come along, Vincent, and don't be a fool! It--it isn't worth it; it never is!"</t:p>
<t:p>Vincent Dering stood still irresolute. "You'll stay, sir," he said, "and--and look
     after--"</t:p>
<t:p>Father Ninian drew the unconscious girl closer to him. "I will look
      after--<t:hi>Margherita</t:hi>."</t:p>
<t:p>The last word came in a half whisper to himself and his eyes met Vincent's with a curious
     dazed defiance. The latter gave the defiance back, as their owner stooped for a second over
     Laila's indifferent face, and kissed it.</t:p>
<t:p>"Good-by, <t:hi>Juliet</t:hi>," he said; and the last word came also in a half whisper to
     himself.</t:p>
<t:p>The next moment he was following Lance down the dim passage, full of a vague relief, and
     realizing for the first time that the mist, which for the last half hour had dimmed the reality
     of all things, was due, not to any aberration of his brain, but to the simple fact that an
     electrical dust-storm was in full blast.</t:p>
<t:p>He realized it with relief. That was at least real, tangible.</t:p>
<t:p>Almost too much so; and as the hot wind, charged with those aspiring atoms of earth, met him
     fiercely, he realized also that the storm would fight against him in his efforts to prevent
     worse from happening. If, indeed, anything could be worse than what had happened; worse than
     Laila's--</t:p>
<t:p>He broke off in his thought, incredulous. It could not be true. He would come back to find
     her better--well!--</t:p>
<t:p>But that other dream was true. His men had risen. The one thing necessary, therefore, was to
     get to the gaol before any decided action took place; and this he realised still more clearly
     from Lance's curt explanation as they ran down the river steps. Once there, the sight of the
     canoe he had left suggested the feasibility of getting to the gaol in it. His personal
     influence might avail. If that failed, he would at least be able to save time by choosing a
     suitable place for the raft to come ashore. The great thing was to be on the spot, to be within
     reach of action at once; to wait for the raft meant needless delay.</t:p>
<t:p>So, a minute after, the faint splash of his paddle was lost in the rising hum of the storm,
     and Lance was left looking anxiously for sound or sight of the raft, which, if all had gone
     well, should by now have started.</t:p>
<t:p>But neither came, so, seeing from the light he had snatched up as he passed through the
     balcony that the air was growing darker, more impenetrable than ever, he shoved off his strange
     craft, to wait further out in the stream where there was less chance of the raft passing him
     unseen, unheard.</t:p>
<t:p>For this reason also, he paddled up along the wall a bit into the faint glow of light which
     showed still from the arches of the chapel. And as he lay in it, his ears and eyes strained for
     the least sound, he could hear as a kind of background to that muffled drumming of the storm,
     the sound of the pilgrims chanting as they waited for the dawn. The dawn which would
     bring--what? Who could tell?</t:p>
<t:p>The sound of other prayers, echoing from the chapel, made him shake his head, feeling that it
     was hopeless to look forward--or backward for that matter! Why had Roshan shot the girl--if he
     had! And why had Pidar Narâyan called her Margherita, and Vincent called her Juliet?</t:p>
<t:p>The whole thing was exactly as he had said--an infernal nightmare!</t:p>
<t:p>Then a faint sound in front of him made his strong arms sweep the paddle through the stream
     as he shot into the darkness in search of the raft; in search of Erda.</t:p>
<t:p>Not that she needed him, really. The memory of her in that red-and-gold mess jacket above her
     wedding dress, giving orders to the men squarely, came back to make him smile.</t:p>
<t:p>God bless her! She could do well enough without him. That was one comfort. And Dillon could
     hold his own too, without much help, for a time--that was another; for what with this and that,
     help was bound to be over-long in coming.</t:p>
</t:div>
