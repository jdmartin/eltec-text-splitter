<t:head>FOILED</t:head>
<t:p>On the gaol or the Pool of Immortality lay the hopes of those whom Pidar Narâyan had so far
     discomfited by his arrogant claim to stand between heaven and earth; in other words, to be in
     personal relations with the Great Awarder of gaols and immortalities, forgivenesses, and
     punishments.</t:p>
<t:p>But the stars in their courses, hidden though they had been by the storm-darkness, had used
     that very darkness to the due maintenance of law and order as they wheeled serenely to meet the
     coming dawn.</t:p>
<t:p>When Lance, for instance--his heart torn in twain by his desire to follow Erda's fate at all
     costs and his knowledge that, if he was to do the best for others he must leave her to face it
     alone--had struck down stream on Am-ma's strange craft, his sole intention had been to rouse
     the police camp, and secure what help he could for the gaol.</t:p>
<t:p>But the darkness set him another task. For, after drifting past the spit, whence he had meant
     to cut across by land to the bridge of boats, and so, creeping past the city, find the camp
     beyond it, he had lost himself absolutely in the maze of sand-banks and shallow channels which,
     when the river was low, as it was now, lay like a network between the deep stream of the Hara,
     and the deep stream of the Hari. Lost himself so utterly that, realizing his own bewilderment,
     he had called himself a fool for having lost himself!</t:p>
<t:p>A curious discouragement came to him. Yet it made him more dogged and persistent, even while
     the hopelessness of finding his way grew every second. Surely, thought he, he could not be such
     a fool as to fail!</t:p>
<t:p>Sometimes a sudden belief that he really had had some faint indication of his bearings would
     make him put all his young strength into the paddle, until once more a soft, yielding, yet
     irresistible, impact came to tell him that he had failed again, that he was on another
     sandbank, and another, and another! The dull concussion of them seemed to pass into his brain;
     he found himself fumbling on almost aimlessly, despite his doggedness, his mind busy with
     imagining the things which might be happening in the dark around him.</t:p>
<t:p>For all he knew close by--</t:p>
<t:p>There lay the sting! It was suffocating to be set, as it were, in the solid darkness like--he
     thought of a fly in amber, the birds he had limed in his boyhood, finally of a death mask. That
     was more like it--he felt as the corpse must feel--clogged, hampered, helpless!</t:p>
<t:p>In such conditions minutes seem hours; and Lance, in reality, had not been drifting about for
     half of one before the certainty that his mission must inevitably be useless unless he could
     fulfil it more expeditiously, made him resolve on trying conclusions with the river at first
     hand. He was a good swimmer. As he told himself this, the first pulse of gratitude he had ever
     felt for the big bully who had chucked him, a small boy in his first term at Harrow, into
     "Ducker" to take his chance, came to him; for those few minutes of despairing effort had taught
     him more than mere swimming; they had taught him to trust himself in water.</t:p>
<t:p>More, at any rate, than in a beastly contrivance made of beds and footballs, with no stem, no
     stern, and a devilish habit of spinning in every eddy like a teetotum!</t:p>
<t:p>The mere condemnation of Am-ma's craft, being a prelude to better things, raised his spirits.
     He flung off his clothes, and, knowing he could not hope to keep his revolver dry, improvised a
     waistcloth out of the silk sash he wore instead of a waistcoat, in which to stick the
     hunting-knife that was his only other weapon. As he did so, he thought of the deer the knife
     had killed; as men think idly, irrelevantly, of such trivialities when their attention is
     really concentrated on something that is, as yet, outside experience. And Lance, as he slipped
     into the water, knew himself prepared to swim or wade, but knew nothing else.</t:p>
<t:p>So, doggedly as before, and infinitely quicker, he went on through the darkness; sometimes
     feeling himself in the cool water, sometimes finding his feet on warm sand, sometimes parting a
     way, he knew not where, through the low tamarisk and high grass marking an island. If he could
     have guessed which island, or even known which way his face was set, these light swishing
     touches might have been guides; but he knew nothing.</t:p>
<t:p>Until, after a time, a faint far glow, a mere suspicion of something not outer darkness,
     showed on his left. Even so, he could not guess whether that meant the gaol side, or the city
     side of the rivers. If the former, could the gaol have been fired by those devils?</t:p>
<t:p>The thought made him set his teeth, and, dry sand being beneath his feet, run on recklessly
     towards the glow.</t:p>
<t:p>Only for a yard or two, however; then he pulled up short, amazed to find that it was not far,
     but near; that it came from the ground, from a leaping fire of tamarisk branches within a
     stone's throw of him. A step or two more, in fact, showed him a cooking-pot, the remains of
     some food, a familiar fishing-net, and a chrysalis-looking figure wrapped in a blanket and
     half-buried in the sand. One of the fisher folk, by all that was lucky! If anyone could tell,
     they could.</t:p>
<t:p>It was only a slender stem of tiger-grass which snapped under his feet, but the noise was
     sufficient. The sleeper sprang to his like a wild animal, the blanket falling from him, one
     lithe arm making for the long spear stuck in the sand beside him.</t:p>
<t:p>Gu-gu! The missing Gu-gu!</t:p>
<t:p>Lance had him back in his sand-bed before hand and spear met. There was no struggle. Gu-gu,
     knowing himself helpless, lay limp, slack, every muscle proclaiming capitulation; in so far
     showing himself something less than a wild animal, which struggles till it dies, reckless of
     odds. But, in truth, Gu-gu, with the certainty of speedy extinction before him, due to that
     cursed ghost, had given in to fate utterly, all round. Death would come when it came. All that
     remained, therefore, was to make others suffer if he could. Especially those who were
     responsible for altering the currents of the river. With one of these on top of you, this was
     impossible; but time might bring opportunity.</t:p>
<t:p>"You devil!" cried Lance, throttling the abject jelly by way of emphasis, "you know all about
     this business, of course; but now I've found you, you'll have to do mine,--or I'll kill you. Do
     you understand? Now, which way is the town?"</t:p>
<t:p>Gu-gu pointed in the direction whence Lance had come. The latter frowned, realizing that it
     was impossible to know if the brute spoke truth, but that, unfortunately, he must be
     trusted.</t:p>
<t:p>"Then get up," he said curtly, taking care to keep the jelly within reach of his knife, "and
     show me the way there. I'll give you a hundred rupees if you do; and if you don't--" He gave
     the yielding flesh an explanatory prick.</t:p>
<t:p>"Does the <t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi> mean the Pool of Immortality?" asked Gu-gu, affably; and the words
     made Lance remember that fruitless waiting for the water.</t:p>
<t:p>"Ah! you <t:hi>did</t:hi> manage that swindle, did you?" he replied savagely, "and of course you
     were camping out of the way. I see! No! I don't want to go there yet. To the bridge! So quick,
     march! or swim; you can tell me about the other as we go along. It may be useful."</t:p>
<t:p>Another prick with the knife he held in one hand, while his other clutched firmly on Gu-gu's
     hemp-strung waist-belt of blue beads, started them. So they went on till the sand grew colder,
     less resistant, changed to water beneath their feet; then Lance's two hands--and the
     knife--came down on Gu-gu's bare back. "Strike out," he said briefly; "I'll help."</t:p>
<t:p>The two pair of legs and the one pair of hands forged ahead into the darkness none the less
     rapidly because the second pair of hands were resting,--with something in them--on yielding
     flesh. The fact indeed, or something else, seemed to make Gu-gu confidential. If the
      <t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi>, he said, with a shameless comprehension which made Lance inclined to use the
     knife then and there, wanted to give the alarm at the police camp, he was taking a long road to
     it. He, Gu-gu, could show him a shorter, if the <t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi> would trust him.</t:p>
<t:p>For a second Lance hesitated. He could not see the man's face; but there was a sort of
     cunning anxiety in the tone which was doubtful. Then, remembering that, short or long, he was
     equally at the man's mercy if he <t:hi>chose to brave results</t:hi>--though there seemed to be no
     reason why he should--he said quietly,--</t:p>
<t:p>"I told you to take the shortest."</t:p>
<t:p>"The <t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi> can dive?" asked Gu-gu. "He should, since he swims so strong."</t:p>
<t:p>"Dive!" echoed Lance. "Yes, why?"</t:p>
<t:p>Because the short way, Gu-gu explained, was by an underground passage which could be only
     reached from the river. Undoubtedly the <t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi> was right, the passage had to do with
     the miracle; but there must have been more than one miracle in the old days, since there was
     quite a network of canals and caves, which could be more or less flooded at will. All the river
     people knew of them, but few ventured in; there was nothing to be gained by doing so, <t:hi>as a
      rule!</t:hi> And the dive to reach the passage was long and awkward. But if the <t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi>
     would trust--</t:p>
<t:p>"Go ahead!" broke in Lance, sharply. He <t:hi>had</t:hi> to trust; and time meant everything.
     Besides, even in diving, he could have his revenge on that sleek, yielding back!</t:p>
<t:p>For answer, Gu-gu altered his course with almost suspicious alacrity; though, once more,
     Lance could see no reason for treachery. A hundred rupees was a big bribe to a man who
     evidently had no personal interest in the matter; else, why should he have been on the island
     instead of in the row. But then Lance did not know of that call to death.</t:p>
<t:p>So, through the dark, the one pair of hands and two pairs of legs forged ahead till a sudden
     arrest of the former gave Lance a dull shock once more. But this time Gu-gu's voice came quite
     cheerfully: "The city wall, <t:hi>Huzoor</t:hi> This slave must feel if he goes up or down."</t:p>
<t:p>Apparently it was up, and after a few minutes of crablike edging Gu-gu's voice came
     again:--</t:p>
<t:p>"The tunnel is below, Protector of the Poor. Let the most noble take the longest breath he
     ever breathed, then strike down till this mean one's legs cease moving. The most noble one's
     must cease also. The rest will this dust-like one accomplish. Save the breath. <t:hi>That</t:hi> is
     in the <t:hi>Huzoors</t:hi> own keeping. Therefore let him take time for filling; and when he is
     ready let him signal this slave with--with a knife-prick if he chooses!"</t:p>
<t:p>The cool grasp of the position made Lance smile, though the situation, he knew, was grave
     enough. That breath to be drawn might be his last; all the more reason why he could have wished
     it less full of sand!</t:p>
<t:p>For the storm was now at its fiercest. Even here out on the river, over the water, the air
     seemed solid. And it had a vibration that could be felt on the bare skin. As he drew in that
     long breath before trusting himself to the unseen man whom he held within reach of the grim
     signal--and something sharper should there be sign of treachery--Lance told himself that the
     water could scarcely be more suffocating than the air. Then--the sleek skin under his hand
     shrinking from the knife-prick--the two pairs of legs and the one pair of arms struck down.</t:p>
<t:p>It was almost a relief at first to get rid of the stinging dust in one's face; almost a
     relief not to breathe. But when, after a few seconds, the legs in front of him grew rigid, and
     nothing was left to be done save to hold on desperately to a waist-belt of blue beads and one's
     own breath at the same time, the sense of suffocation returned, and the question, "How much
     longer?" seemed to throb in his brain.</t:p>
<t:p>He gripped everything he had to grip tighter. But his own body seemed to grip his mind
     tighter still. He could feel the clutch of his veins--a whole corded network of them--could see
     them! A corded, pulsing network edged with prismatic light, sending stars into the darkness,
     beating time to the singing in his ears, to the fierce duel between the desire to gasp and the
     determination to hold on,--beating time to the confused rush of thoughts which ended in
     one--"This is drowning!"</t:p>
<t:p>It made his clutch tighter. Gu-gu, at least, should drown too. That was the last conscious
     thought. It merged into a frantic, insistent clamour for air! air! air! till something cold hit
     him full on the face and forced him into a quick, gasping cry, that left him senseless.</t:p>
<t:p>When he came to himself, as he did a moment or two afterwards, he was still clutching the
     waist-belt of blue beads, and the touch of it lulled him to an instant's sheer relief. The dive
     was over; they must be in the cave; the cold that had hit him in the face must have been the
     air.</t:p>
<t:p>But what was he lying upon? Surely rock! And the hand he moved to feel it brought the blue
     beads with it unresistingly.</t:p>
<t:p>Gu-gu! where was Gu-gu?</t:p>
<t:p>Gone! And the knife too. It had been used to sever the hempen string of the belt.</t:p>
<t:p>Curious. It might have been used for a different and more deadly purpose; but you could never
     count on what fellows would do--even when they were treacherous.</t:p>
<t:p>Lance thought this dreamily, before he realized more than the fact that he was alive; not
     drowned.</t:p>
<t:p>Then he sat up hastily and faced the truth that he was alone once more; alone in that network
     of underground passages and caves of which Gu-gu had spoken.</t:p>
<t:p>Was there any chance of his getting out of it? Not by the dive, certainly. Without help that
     was impossible. He set himself to remember what his guide had said in reply to the questions
     with which he had been purposely plied.</t:p>
<t:p>First, as to light. If Gu-gu was to be trusted the materials for this must be close at hand.
     Lance rose cautiously and felt about the ledge on which he lay and the walls of rock about him,
     and ere long came on what he sought. Flint and steel, a box of tinder, a bottle of oil, and a
     rag torch hung in an old bit of fishing-net to a peg that was driven into a crevice.</t:p>
<t:p>So far, good; and after a minute these enabled him to see that he was in a sort of vaulted
     well, half hewn out of rock, half built in with brick. It was filled to some three feet or so
     with water, except in one corner, where the flooring shelved down to an archway. There it was
     deeper. This must be the opening of the tunnel through which they had dived, and through which,
     doubtless, Gu-gu had escaped; for he was not likely to have braved the intricate passages
     without a light. This thought made Lance look to see how much oil the bottle contained.</t:p>
<t:p>There was only a mere driblet at the bottom. Plainly, therefore, he could pause no longer;
     so, instantly, without further thought, he waded across the pool and ran along the only passage
     which led from it. He had to stoop as he ran, and from the feel to his feet he guessed that the
     passage led upwards first, then downwards; apparently, too, in a perfectly straight line. The
     river, therefore, must be behind him, and he tried to make this point a fixed one, so as to
     give him some notion of his bearings.</t:p>
<t:p>After a hundred yards or so he emerged into a second cave or chamber, also nearly waist-deep
     in water. From this several passages opened, some too small to admit of a man passing through
     them. These, then, must be the canals of which Gu-gu had spoken; one of them, possibly, that
     which should have supplied the Pool with Immortality. The memory of that crowd of eager,
     patient faces, disappointed by such a miserable trick, made Lance feel pitiful; then his pity
     brought a sudden practical suggestion. Why not open the sluice, or whatever it was, now, and
     give the miracle? It would at least keep <t:hi>some</t:hi> of the crew quiet when it came, at dawn;
     the dawn which might be so fatal to quiet--the dawn which must, surely, be close at hand.</t:p>
<t:p>He raised the torch and saw, close beside him, a foot or two above the present level of the
     water, a clumsy closed stone conduit with an iron handle. It was a rude primitive tap, no
     doubt, by which the levels could be raised. Without further thought, he turned it, and smiled
     to find himself right, as water poured out, filling the vaulted chamber with sound. Then,
     without further pause, he passed on down the biggest of the passages leading from the chamber;
     since that seemed the most likely one. After a while, however, the passage narrowed, seemed in
     danger of ending altogether; so he harked back.</t:p>
<t:p>There was no longer any sound in the chamber when he returned to it, and the level of the
     water had risen almost to the floor of the passage in which he stood, wondering which of the
     other outlets he had best try. The choice was a case of sheer chance, of course, he told
     himself; a mere backing of one's luck. But, as he paused to make it, something cold struck on
     his feet, causing him to look down in sudden surprise.</t:p>
<t:p>The water was still rising. That must be stopped, anyhow, unless he was to be drowned out
     like a sewer rat.</t:p>
<t:p>He stuck the torch into a cleft in the rock beside him, hung the net to it, and swam over to
     the conduit, which was already submerged. But the handle which had turned so easily was stiff
     now; possibly because of the pressure of the water, possibly because there was some other rude
     mechanism of which he was unaware. Anyhow, after a few trials he realized that he was helpless
     until the water had found its own level.</t:p>
<t:p>But what was that? Who could tell? Would it rise, and rise, and rise, till it filled the
     whole place?</t:p>
<t:p>Who could tell?</t:p>
<t:p>It was not fear which clutched at his heart--only a vague self-pity; almost an amused wonder
     that this Immortality for others might bring Death to him.</t:p>
<t:p>He looked up into the vaulted arch above him, then to the, as yet, dry passages which he
     could just see, as darker arches of shadow.</t:p>
<t:p>Unless one of them rose abruptly to a higher level--and the chance that one did, or that he
     should find it, was remote--he would be wiser to stay here, and see what happened. The roof was
     at least higher.</t:p>
<t:p>He swam back to the torch and, holding on to the crevices of the wall, waited.</t:p>
<t:p>Still rising. He shifted the torch to a higher crevice and waited again, a dull curiosity
     taking possession of him.</t:p>
<t:p>Still rising. He wondered, suddenly, whether it would not have been better for him to have
     gone back the way he had come. The passage had certainly seemed to ascend, and it was a
     question of levels. That was all. A mere question of levels.</t:p>
<t:p>He shifted the torch again. It was dying down now, the rags showing charred, cindery. But as
     he fed it with oil and it flared up and smoked, the thought came to him that it was using air
     needlessly, making suffocation more imminent.</t:p>
<t:p>He blew it out deliberately. If a man had to die, he might as well die in the dark. He was
     glad, a moment later, of the darkness. It shut out reality and left him to dreams; to vague
     hopes, to kindly forgetfulness, to Erda's face. How plucky she had been! Well! even if he
      <t:hi>had</t:hi> to be drowned like a rat in a sewer, he must not be behind her. The pathetic
     comfort of kindly memory, which with strange unreason--since it enhances the value of the life
     that is being left--makes the face of death seem less stern to poor humanity, came to him and
     absorbed him. If he died and she lived, she would not forget him; he knew that.</t:p>
<t:p>And still the water rose.</t:p>
<t:p>It must be rising now, he thought, in the Pool of Immortality, and the eager, patient faces
     that had been waiting for it so long must be showing glad in the grey light of the dawn.</t:p>
<t:p>For the dawn was coming to the world, though he would not see it. Strange, incomprehensible
     thought, even though the reality of it was so certain, so close. Incomprehensible? Say rather,
     impossible; frankly impossible! He could not be going to die!</t:p>
<t:p>He shifted the unlit torch to a still higher crevice--almost a ledge in the rock--and waited
     incredulously for the water to rise.</t:p>
<t:p>And as he waited in the dark, someone else in the grey dawn, to whom death was more familiar,
     to whom, in a way, it was the one great certainty of Life, was feeling the same frank
     incredulity at the thought of the immediate future.</t:p>
<t:p>For Dr. Dillon, when he found himself alone on the roof of the gaol gate with an unconscious
     woman and a child, knew that the end could not be far off. With Vincent dead, and Eugene cut
     off by the stern necessity for keeping that door shut, he could not hope for more than a brief,
     savage resistance--and then? Failure, inevitable failure, unless help came; and that seemed far
     as ever.</t:p>
<t:p>As yet, dazed by that closing of the door, that desperate, triumphant death of the man with
     his back to it--a death which had gained them nothing--the prisoners were still huddled
     together, crushed out of further action, at the far end of the alley. So the courtyard was
     clear, free from assailants. But that could only be for a minute or two. There was an ominous
     rending and hewing at the gate below; ere long those outside would be inside, and with a leader
     who would know what to do. So life could only be an affair of moments; yet it seemed
     incredible, more than incredible, that all his strong will and determination would not avail
     even to save those helpless creatures in his charge. He stooped hurriedly and lifted the still
     unconscious woman in his arms, carried her into the turret, closed the door on her and the
     child--frightened now for the first time at her mother's silence--and returned to wait and
     watch. It was all he could do for them, unless fate gave him a chance of appealing for them to
     Roshan Khân. But even then there could be no bargaining, no compromise, no surrender!</t:p>
<t:p>A sharp crash, a sudden rise in the babel of voices below, warned him that the gate had
     given, partially at least. The next instant a soldier or two, ignorant of that dead man with
     his back against the closed gate, ran lightly down the alley calling on the prisoners to make
     way. One of them was Roshan Khân; but George Dillon did not waste a cartridge even on him. He
     was reserving his fire for that storming of the broken stairs which must come when the
     assailants found themselves still foiled.</t:p>
<t:p>In truth Roshan Khân had this same storming in his mind as all he cared for, since it would
     pit him against his rival, against Vincent Dering, who he knew was on the roof. And so, with
     that odd acquired sense of honour, fair play, God knows what, he had been planning, as his men
     battered down the gate, how best to compass those fair odds which were necessary alike to his
     sense of justice and injustice--for the injustice of his own position cried aloud for proof
     that he was worth a better one. So he had settled to complete that liberating of the prisoners
     which, with the help of the keys, ought already to be in hand. This done, the general rabble
     would be eager for freedom, eager for plunder, eager to get to the town and raise it, eager for
     all things for which he cared no jot. Then would be his time. Then--he did not even try to
     formulate how--he could find himself face to face, at fair odds, with Vincent Dering. Wild
     memories of duels he had read about in western books, duels with others, who had nothing to do
     with the quarrel, looking on, occurred to him.</t:p>
<t:p>Yes! that would satisfy him. To have it out, till death!</t:p>
<t:p>He set his teeth as he forced a peremptory way through the crowd at the end of the alley,
     which hid the closed door until one actually stood beside it.</t:p>
<t:p>Then he stood transfixed, for he saw Vincent Dering's dead body still backed by that closed
     door, still guarding it, unarmed. There was a curious look of content in the dead face, and
     Roshan, grasping its meaning by intuition, turned from it with a curse, knowing himself
     forestalled, cheated.</t:p>
<t:p>"'Twas not our fault, <t:hi>Khân-jee</t:hi>," protested a voice, quickly; "the swine fought till
     the other one had locked the door in our faces, and so--"</t:p>
<t:p>Roshan struck at the voice fiercely. Not forestalled, not cheated, only; but outdone,
     conquered! His rival had died a hero's death, and he--he might live to be hanged!</t:p>
<t:p>A rage of despair, of despite, seized on him. His one real object gone, the whole hideous
     folly of the rest made him fling up his hands passionately as he dashed back to the gate,
     neither knowing nor caring what he was going to do next.</t:p>
<t:p>Storm that feeble garrison on the roof? those broken stairs, every crevice, every foothold in
     which stood out clear, easy, in the light of the search-ray? Was that a man's task?</t:p>
<t:p>Confused, dazed, he ran on, followed instinctively by the crowd, wondering what he would be
     at.</t:p>
<t:p>George Dillon, seeing the rush, covered the first foothold of the broken stairs with his
     rifle, and waited for a man to show on it.</t:p>
<t:p>But none came.</t:p>
<t:p>Just as the rush reached the courtyard, Eugene Smith's search-ray, having exhausted itself,
     went out, leaving, not darkness, but the grey mystery of dawn, in which for an instant all
     sound, all movement, seemed arrested. There was one utterly peaceful second, and then, from
     behind the splintered gateway, from the shadows of the tunnel, came a breathless voice:--</t:p>
<t:p>"Close the outer gate, sergeant; if you can, you have them in a trap! a regular trap!"</t:p>
<t:p><t:hi>A trap!</t:hi></t:p>
<t:p>The word reached those who had followed Roshan in his causeless retreat. Had he foreseen
     this? Was he escaping from the trap? Their eyes flew to the tunnel, but the light which, till
     then, had lit up its darkness, the swinging lamp by which the batterers of the gate had worked,
     was dashed down by someone's hand--a small, white hand--and there was nothing to be seen. Only
     that voice to be heard repeating, "They're in a trap; keep them there!"</t:p>
<t:p>Keep them! Not if they could fight their way into the open! The cry rose in a second:--</t:p>
<t:p>"A trap. Yea! a trap! Out of it! Outside, brothers, outside, where we can fight free!"</t:p>
<t:p>Roshan, who would have paused at this chance of fair resistance, was caught in the rush from
     behind, and found himself through the gap in the gate fighting desperately in the crowd,
     calling on his men to rally. But they had construed his half-frenzied flight from that look on
     Vincent Dering's face into a lead, and they were mixed up inextricably with the horde of
     undisciplined conspirators who, having been till now safe under cover of the tunnelled archway,
     yelled for the open, not so much in which to fight, but in which to run away.</t:p>
<t:p>The mere handful of men, whose number was fortunately hidden by the darkness, could never
     have prevented the rush, but a quick wit amongst them seized on a possibility, and the
     breathless voice called, "Let them pass--let them pass!"</t:p>
<t:p>So, in a second or two, amid confused yells, and mad slashings at friends and foes alike, the
     positions were reversed. The inside was out, the outside in, like Brian O'Lynn's breeches; and
     Dr. Dillon's first hint at what the amazing turn of affairs below him meant came with the
     words:--</t:p>
<t:p>"Barricade that gate. Sharp as you know how. They won't give us long."</t:p>
<t:p>"Is that you, Carlyon?" he called doubtfully, leaning over the parapet and peering into that
     grey mystery of dawn.</t:p>
<t:p>The figure he saw, a woman in a white dress and a scarlet mess jacket, made him doubt the
     evidence of his own eyes. But the answer in a woman's voice, with a quick breath in it, sent
     his back in something between a laugh and a sob.</t:p>
<t:p>"Then he isn't here! Oh! what can have become of him?"</t:p>
<t:p>There was no doubt that this was a woman!</t:p>
