<head>CHAPTER XIV</head>
<p>Wogan closed the window cautiously. The snow had drifted through and lay melting in a heap
     beneath the sill. He drew the curtain across the embrasure, and then he crossed to the bedroom
     door.</p>
<p>"Jenny," he whispered, "are you in bed?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Lie close! Do not show your face nor speak. Only groan, and groan most delicately, or we are
     lost."</p>
<p>He closed the door upon Jenny, and turning about came face to face with the Princess-mother.
     She stood confronting him, a finger on her lips, and terror in her eyes; and he heard the
     street-door open and clang to below.</p>
<p>"The magistrate!" she whispered.</p>
<p>"Courage, your Highness. Keep them from the bed! Say that her eyes are weak and cannot bear
     the light."</p>
<p>He slipped behind the curtain into the embrasure, picturing to himself the disposition of the
     room, lest he should have left behind a trifle to betray him. He had in a supreme degree that
     gift of recollection which takes the form of a mental vision. He did not have to count over the
     details of the room; he
     <pb n="197"/> summoned a picture of it to his mind, and saw it and its contents from corner to
     corner. And thus while the footsteps yet sounded on the stair, he saw Clementina's bundle lying
     forgotten on a couch. He darted from his hiding-place, seized it, and ran back. He had just
     sufficient and not a second more time, for the curtain had not ceased to swing when the
     magistrate knocked, and without waiting for an answer entered. He was followed by two soldiers,
     and these he ordered to wait without the door.</p>
<p>"Your Highness," he said in a polite voice, and stopped abruptly. It seemed to Wogan behind
     the curtain that his heart stopped at the same moment and with no less abruptness. There was no
     evidence of Clementina's flight to justify that sudden silence. Then he grew faint, as it
     occurred to him that he had made Lady Featherstone's mistake,—that his boot protruded into the
     room. He clenched his teeth, expecting a swift step and the curtain to be torn aside. The
     window was shut; he would never have time to open it and leap out and take his chance with the
     sentry underneath. He was caught in a trap, and Clementina waited for him in the avenue, under
     the fourth tree. All was lost, it seemed, and by his own folly, his own confidence. Had he only
     told her of the tavern under the city wall, where the carriage stood with its horses harnessed
     in the shafts, she might still have escaped, though he was trapped. The sweat passed down his
     face. Yet no swift step was taken, nor was the curtain torn aside.</p>
<pb n="198"/>
<p>For within the room the magistrate, a kindly citizen of Innspruck who had no liking for this
     addition to his duties, stood gazing at the Princess-mother with a respectful pity. It was the
     sight of her tear-stained face which had checked his words. For two days Clementina had kept
     her bed, and the mother's tears alarmed him.</p>
<p>"Her Highness, your daughter, suffers so much?" said he.</p>
<p>"Sir, it is little to be wondered at."</p>
<p>The magistrate bowed. That question was not one with which he had a mind to meddle.</p>
<p>"She still lies in bed?" said he, and he crossed to the door. The mother flung herself in the
     way.</p>
<p>"She lies in pain, and you would disturb her; you would flash your lanterns in her eyes, that
     if perchance she sleeps, she may wake into a world of pain. Sir, you will not."</p>
<p>"Your Highness—"</p>
<p>"It is the mother who beseeches you. Sir, would you have me on my knees?"</p>
<p>Wogan, but this moment recovered from his alarm, became again uneasy. Her Highness protested
     too much; she played her part in the comedy too strenuously. He judged by the ear; the
     magistrate had the quivering, terror-stricken face before his eyes, and his pity deepened.</p>
<p>"Your Highness," he said, "I must pray you to let me pass. I have General Heister's orders to
     obey."</p>
<p>The Princess-mother now gave Wogan reason to
     <pb n="199"/> applaud her. She saw that the magistrate, for all his politeness, was quite
     inflexible.</p>
<p>"Go, then," she said with a quiet dignity which once before she had shown that evening.
     "Since there is no humiliation to be spared us, take a candle, sir, and count the marks of
     suffering in my daughter's face;" and with her own hand she opened the bedroom door and stood
     aside.</p>
<p>"Madam, I would not press my duty an inch beyond its limits," said the magistrate. "I will
     stand in the doorway, and do you bid your daughter speak."</p>
<p>The Princess-mother did not move from her position.</p>
<p>"My child," she said.</p>
<p>Jenny in the bedroom groaned and turned from one side to the other.</p>
<p>"You are in pain?"</p>
<p>Jenny groaned again. The magistrate himself closed the door.</p>
<p>"Believe me," said he, "no one could more regret than I the incivilities to which I am
     compelled."</p>
<p>He crossed the room. Wogan heard him and his men descending the stairs. He heard the door
     open and shut; he heard Chateaudoux draw the bolts. Then he stepped out from the curtain.</p>
<p>"Your Highness, that was bravely done," said he, and kneeling he kissed her hand. He went
     back into the embrasure, slipped the bundle over his arm, and opened the window very silently.
     He saw the snow was still falling, the wind still moaning
     <pb n="200"/> about the crannies and roaring along the streets. He set his knee upon the
     window-ledge, climbed out, and drew the window to behind him.</p>
<p>The Princess-mother waited in the room with her hand upon her heart. She waited, it seemed to
     her, for an eternity. Then she heard the sound of a heavy fall, and the clang of a musket
     against the wall of the villa. But she heard no cry. She ran to the window and looked out. But
     strain her eyes as she might, she could distinguish nothing in that blinding storm. She could
     not see the sentinel; nor was this strange, for the sentinel lay senseless on the snow against
     the house-wall, and Mr. Wogan was already running down the avenue.</p>
<p>Under the fourth tree he found Clementina; she took his arm, and they set off together,
     wrestling with the wind, wading through the snow. It seemed to Clementina that her companion
     was possessed by some new fear. He said no single word to her; he dragged her with a fierce
     grip upon her wrist; if she stumbled, he jerked her roughly to her feet. She set her teeth and
     kept pace with him. Only once did she speak. They had come to a depression in the road where
     the melted snow had made a wide pool. Wogan leaped across it and said,—</p>
<p>"Give me your hand! There's a white stone midway where you can set your foot."</p>
<p>The Princess stepped as he bade her. The stone yielded beneath her tread and she stood
     ankle-deep in the water. Wogan sprang to her side and lifted her out. She had uttered no cry,
     and now she only
     <pb n="201"/> laughed as she stood shivering on the further edge. It was that low musical,
     good-humoured laugh to which Wogan had never listened without a thrill of gladness, but it
     waked no response in him now.</p>
<p>"You told me of a white stone on which I might safely set my foot," she said. "Well, sir,
     your white stone was straw."</p>
<p>They were both to remember these words afterwards and to make of them a parable, but it
     seemed that Wogan barely heard them now. "Come!" he said, and taking her arm he set off running
     again.</p>
<p>Clementina understood that something inopportune, something terrible, had happened since she
     had left the villa. She asked no questions; she trusted herself without reserve to these true
     friends who had striven at such risks for her, she desired to prove to them that she was what
     they would have her be,—a girl who did not pester them with inconvenient chatter, but who could
     keep silence when silence was helpful, and face hardships with a buoyant heart.</p>
<p>They crossed the bridge and stopped before a pair of high folding doors. They were the doors
     of the tavern. Wogan drew a breath of relief, pulled the bobbin, and pushed the doors open.
     Clementina slipped through, and in darkness she took a step forward and bruised herself against
     the wheels of a carriage. Wogan closed the door and ran to her side.</p>
<p>"This way," said he, and held out his hand. He guided Clementina round the carriage to a
     steep
     <pb n="202"/> narrow stairway—it was more a ladder than a stair—fixed against the inner wall.
     At the top of this stairway shone a horizontal line of yellow light. Wogan led the Princess up
     the stairs. The line of light shone out beneath a door. Wogan opened the door and stood aside.
     Clementina passed into a small bare room lighted by a single candle, where Mrs. Misset, Gaydon,
     and O'Toole waited for her coming. Not a word was said; but their eyes spoke their admiration
     of the woman, their knees expressed their homage to the Queen. There was a fire blazing on the
     hearth, Mrs. Misset had a dry change of clothes ready and warm. Wogan laid the Princess's
     bundle on a chair, and with Gaydon and O'Toole went down the stairs.</p>
<p>"The horses?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I have ordered them," said Gaydon, "at the post-house. I will fetch them;" and he hurried
     off upon his errand.</p>
<p>Wogan turned to O'Toole.</p>
<p>"And the bill?"</p>
<p>"I have paid it."</p>
<p>"There is no one awake in the house?"</p>
<p>"No one but the landlady."</p>
<p>"Good! Can you keep her engaged until we are ready?"</p>
<p>"To be sure I can. She shall never give a thought to any man of you but myself."</p>
<p>O'Toole passed through a door at the bottom of the staircase into the common-room of the inn.
     Wogan gently opened the big doors and dragged
     <pb n="203"/> the carriage out into the road. Gaydon with the horses galloped silently up
     through the snow, and together the two men feverishly harnessed them to the carriage. There
     were six for the carriage, and a seventh for O'Toole to ride. The expedition which Wogan and
     Gaydon showed was matched by the Princess. For while they were fastening the last buckles, the
     door at the top of the stairs opened, and again that night Clementina whispered,—</p>
<p>"I am ready."</p>
<p>"Come!" replied Wogan. She wore a scarlet cloak upon her shoulders, and muffling it about her
     head she ran down with Mrs. Misset. Wogan opened the lower door of the inn and called for
     O'Toole. O'Toole came running out before Wogan had ended his words, and sprang into his saddle.
     Gaydon was already on the box with the reins gathered in his hand. Wogan had the carriage door
     open before Clementina had reached the foot of the stairs; it was shut upon her and her
     companion almost before they were aware they were within it; the carriage started almost before
     the door was shut. Yet when it did start, Wogan was beside Gaydon upon the box. Their
     movements, indeed, occurred with so exact a rapidity, that though the hostess at once followed
     O'Toole to bid her guests farewell, when she reached the big doors she saw only the back of the
     carriage lurching through the ruts of snow.</p>
<p>"Quick!" cried Wogan; "we have lost too much time."</p>
<pb n="204"/>
<p>"A bare twenty minutes," said Gaydon.</p>
<p>"A good twelve hours," said Wogan.</p>
<p>Gaydon lashed the horses into a gallop, the horses strained at their collars, the carriage
     raced out of the town and up the slopes of the Brenner. The princess Clementina had been
     rescued from her prison.</p>
<p>"But we must keep her free!" cried Wogan, as he blew through his gloves upon his frozen
     fingers. "Faster! Faster!"</p>
<p>The incline was steep, the snow clogged the wheels, the horses sank deep in it. Gaydon might
     ply his whip as he would, the carriage might lurch and leap from side to side; the pace was all
     too slow for Wogan.</p>
<p>"We have lost twelve hours," he cried. "Oh, would to God we were come to Italy!" And turning
     backwards he strained his eyes down through the darkness and snow to the hidden roofs of
     Innspruck, almost fearing to see the windows from one end of the town to the other leap to a
     blaze of light, and to hear a roar of many voices warn him that the escape was discovered. But
     the only cry that he heard came from the lips of Mrs. Misset, who put her head from the
     carriage and bade him stop.</p>
<p>Gaydon brought the horses to a standstill three miles out of Innspruck.</p>
