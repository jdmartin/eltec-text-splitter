<head>CHAPTER XVII</head>
<p>But Gaydon was out of his reckoning. There were no fairy tales told for Misset to overhear,
     and the Princess Clementina slept in her corner of the carriage. If a jolt upon a stone wakened
     her, a movement opposite told her that her sentinel was watchful and alert. Three times the
     berlin stopped for a change of horses; and on each occasion Wogan was out of the door and
     hurrying the ostlers before the wheels had ceased to revolve.</p>
<p>"You should sleep, my friend," said she.</p>
<p>"Not till we reach Italy," he replied; and with the confidence of a child she nestled warmly
     in her cloak again and closed her eyes. This feeling of security was a new luxury to her after
     the months of anxiety and prison. The grey light of the morning stole into the berlin and
     revealed to her the erect and tireless figure of her saviour. The sun leaped down the
     mountain-peaks, and the grey of the light was now a sparkling gold. Wogan bade her Highness
     look from the carriage window, and she could not restrain a cry of delight. On her left,
     mountain-ridge rose behind mountain-ridge, away to the towering limestone cliffs of Monte
     Scanupia;
     <pb n="239"/> on her right, the white peaks of the Orto d'Abram flashed to the sun; and between
     the hills the broad valley of the Adige rolled southwards,—a summer country of villages and
     vines, of mulberry-trees and fields of maize, in the midst of which rose the belfries of an
     Italian town.</p>
<p>"This is Italy," she cried.</p>
<p>"But the Emperor's Italy," answered Wogan; and at half-past nine that morning the carriage
     stopped in the public square of Trent. As Wogan stepped onto the ground, he saw a cloud of dust
     at the opposite side of the square, and wrapped in that cloud men on horseback like soldiers in
     the smoke of battle; he heard, too, the sound of wheels. The Prince of Baden had that instant
     driven away, and he had taken every procurable horse in the town. Wogan's own horses could go
     no further. He came back to the door of the carriage.</p>
<p>"I must search through Trent," said he, "on the mere chance of finding what will serve us.
     Your Highness must wait in the inn;" and Clementina, muffling her face, said to him,—</p>
<p>"I dare not. My face is known in Trent, though this is the first time ever I saw it. But many
     gentlemen from Trent came to the Innspruck carnival, and of these a good number were kind
     enough to offer me their hearts. They were allowed to besiege me to their content. I must needs
     remain in the shelter of the carriage."</p>
<p>Wogan left Misset to stand sentinel, and hurried off upon his business. He ran from stable to
     stable,
     <pb n="240"/> from inn to inn. The Prince of Baden had hired thirty-six horses; six more were
     nowhere to be found. Wogan would be content with four; he ended in a prayer for two. At each
     house the door was shut in his face. Wogan was in despair; nowhere could delay be so dangerous
     as at Trent, where there were soldiers, and a Governor who would not hesitate to act without
     orders if he suspected the Princess Clementina was escaping through his town. Two hours had
     passed in Wogan's vain search,—two hours of daylight, during which Clementina had sat in an
     unharnessed carriage in the market square. Wogan ran back to the square, half expecting to find
     that she had been recognised and arrested. As he reached the square, he saw that curious people
     were loitering about the carriage; as he pushed through them, he heard them questioning why
     travellers should on so hot a morning of spring sit muffled up in a close, dark carriage when
     they could take their ease beneath trees in the inn-garden. One man laughed out at the Princess
     and the comical figure she made with her scarlet cloak drawn tight about her face. Wogan
     himself had bought that cloak in Strasbourg to guard his Princess from the cold of the Brenner,
     and guessed what discomfort its ermine lining must now be costing her. And this lout dared to
     laugh and make her, this incomparable woman, a butt for his ridicule! Wogan took a step towards
     the fellow with his fists clenched, but thought the better of his impulse, and turning away ran
     to the palace of Prince Taxis.</p>
<pb n="241"/>
<p>This desperate course alone remained to him; he must have speech with the Prince-bishop
     himself. At the palace, however, he was informed that the Prince was in bed with the gout. Mr.
     Wogan, however, insisted.</p>
<p>"You will present my duties to the Prince; you will show him my passport; you will say that
     the Count of Cernes has business of the last importance in Italy, and begs permission, since
     the Prince of Baden has hired every post-horse in the town, to requisition half a dozen
     farm-horses from the fields."</p>
<p>Mr. Wogan kicked his heels in the courtyard while the message was taken. At any moment some
     rumour of the curious spectacle in the square might be brought to the palace and excite
     inquiry. There might be another courier in pursuit besides the man whom Gaydon kept a prisoner.
     Wogan was devoured with a fever of impatience. It seemed to him hours before the Prince's
     secretary returned to him. The secretary handed him back his passport, and on the part of the
     Prince made a speech full of civilities.</p>
<p>"Here's a great deal of jam, sir," said Wogan. "I misdoubt me but what there's a most
     unpalatable pill hidden away in it."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said the secretary, "the Prince begs you to be content and to wait for the
     post-horses to return."</p>
<p>"Ah, ah!" cried Wogan, "but that's the one thing I cannot do. I must speak plainly, it
     appears." He drew the secretary out of ear-shot, and resumed:
     <pb n="242"/> "My particular business is to catch up the Prince of Baden. He is summoned back
     to Innspruck. Do you understand?" he asked significantly.</p>
<p>"Sir, we are well informed in Trent as to the Emperor's wishes," said the secretary, with a
     great deal of dignity.</p>
<p>"No, no, my friend," said Wogan. "It is not by the Emperor the Prince of Baden is summoned,
     though I have no doubt the summons is much to his taste."</p>
<p>The secretary stepped back in surprise.</p>
<p>"By her Highness the Princess?" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"She changes her mind; she is willing where before she was obdurate. To tell you the truth,
     the Prince plied her too hard, and she would have none of him. Now that he turns his back and
     puts the miles as fast as he can between himself and her, she cannot sleep for want of
     him."</p>
<p>The secretary nodded his head sagaciously.</p>
<p>"Her Highness is a woman," said he, "and that explains all. But it will do her no harm to
     suffer a little longer for her obstinacy, and, to tell you the truth, the Prince Taxis is so
     tormented with the gout that—"</p>
<p>"That you are unwilling to approach him a second time," interrupted Wogan. "I have no doubt
     of it. I have myself seen prelates in a most unprelatical mood. But here is a case where needs
     must. I have not told you all. There is a devil of a fellow called Charles Wogan."</p>
<p>The secretary nodded his head.</p>
<pb n="243"/>
<p>"A mad Irishman who has vowed to free her Highness."</p>
<p>"He has set out from Strasbourg with that aim."</p>
<p>"He will hang for it, then, but he will never rescue her;" and the secretary began to laugh.
     "I cannot upon my honour vex the Prince again because a gallows-bird has prated in his
     cups."</p>
<p>"No, no," said Wogan; "you do not follow me. Charles Wogan will come to the gallows over this
     adventure. For my part, I would have him broken on the wheel and tortured in many uncomfortable
     ways. These Irishmen all the world over are pestilent fellows. But the trouble is this: If her
     Highness hears of his attempt, she is, as you sagely discovered, a woman, a trivial, trifling
     thing. She will be absurd enough to imagine her rescue possible; she will again change her
     mind, and it is precisely that which General Heister fears. He would have her formally
     betrothed to the Prince of Baden before Charles Wogan is caught and hanged sky-high. Therefore,
     since I was pressing into Italy, he charged me with this message to the Prince of Baden. Now
     observe this, if you please. Suppose that I do not overtake the Prince; suppose that her
     Highness hears of Wogan's coming and again changes her mind,—who will be to blame? Not I, for I
     have done my best, not Prince Taxis, for he is not informed, but Prince Taxis's secretary."</p>
<p>The secretary yielded to Wogan's argument. He might be in a great fear of Prince Taxis, but
     he was in a greater of the Emperor's wrath. He left Wogan
     <pb n="244"/> again, and in a little while came back with the written permission which Wogan
     desired. Wogan wasted no time in unnecessary civilities; the morning had already been wasted.
     The clocks were striking one as he hurried away from the palace, and before two the Princess
     Clementina was able to throw back her cloak from about her face and take the air; for the
     berlin was on the road from Trent to Roveredo.</p>
<p>"Those were the four worst hours since we left Innspruck," she said. "I thought I should
     suffocate." The revulsion from despair, the knowledge that each beat of the hoofs brought them
     nearer to safety, the glow of the sun upon a country which was Italy in all but name, raised
     them all to the top of their spirits. Clementina was in her gayest mood; she lavished caresses
     upon her "little woman," as she called Mrs. Misset; she would have Wogan give her an account of
     his interview with Prince Taxis's secretary; she laughed with the merriest enjoyment over his
     abuse of Charles Wogan.</p>
<p>"But it was not myself alone whom I slandered," said he. "Your Highness had a share of our
     abuse. Our heads wagged gravely over woman's inconstancies. It was not in nature but you must
     change your mind. Indeed, your Highness would have laughed."</p>
<p>But at all events her Highness did not laugh now. On the contrary, her eyes lost all their
     merriment, and her blood rushed hotly into her cheeks. She became for that afternoon a creature
     of moods, now talking quickly and perhaps a trifle wildly,
     <pb n="245"/> now relapsing into long silences. Wogan was troubled by a thought that the strain
     of her journey was telling its tale even upon her vigorous youth. It may be that she noted his
     look of anxiety, but she said to him abruptly and with a sort of rebellion,—</p>
<p>"You would despise any woman who had the temerity to change her mind."</p>
<p>"Nay; I do not say that."</p>
<p>"But it is merely politeness that restrains you. You would despise her, judging her by men.
     When a man changes his mind, why, it is so, he changes his mind. But when a girl does, it may
     well be that for the first time she is seriously exercising her judgment. For her upbringing
     renders it natural that she should allow others to make up her mind for her at the first."</p>
<p>"That I think is very true," said Wogan.</p>
<p>Clementina, however, was not satisfied with his assent. She attacked him again and almost
     vindictively.</p>
<p>"You of course would never change your mind for any reason, once it was fixed. You are
     resolute. You are quite, quite perfect."</p>
<p>Mr. Wogan could not imagine what he had done thus to provoke her irony.</p>
<p>"Madam," he pleaded, "I am not in truth so obstinate a fellow as you make me out. I have
     often changed my mind. I take some pride in it on occasion."</p>
<p>Her Highness inclined to a greater graciousness.</p>
<p>"I am glad to know it. You shall give me
     <pb n="246"/> examples. One may have a stiff neck and yet no cause for pride."</p>
<p>Wogan looked so woe-begone under this reproof that Clementina suddenly broke out into a
     laugh, and so showed herself in a fresh and more familiar mood. The good-humour continued; she
     sat opposite to Mr. Wogan; if she moved, her hand, her knee, her foot, must needs touch his;
     she made him tell her stories of his campaigns; and so the evening came upon them,—an evening
     of stars and mysterious quiet and a clear, dark sky.</p>
<p>They passed Roveredo; they drew near to Ala, the last village in the Emperor's territories.
     Five miles beyond Ala they would be on Venetian soil, and already they saw the lights of the
     village twinkling like so many golden candles. But the berlin, which had drawn them so stoutly
     over these rugged mountain-roads, failed them at the last. One of the hind wheels jolted
     violently upon a great stone, there was a sudden cracking of wood, and the carriage lurched
     over, throwing its occupants one against the other.</p>
<p>Wogan disentangled himself, opened the door, and sprang out. He sprang out into a pool of
     water. One glance at the carriage, dark though the night was, told him surely what had
     happened. The axle-tree was broken. He saw that Clementina was about to follow him.</p>
<p>"There is water," said he. "It is ankle-deep."</p>
<p>"And no white stone," she answered with a laugh, "whereon I can safely set my foot?"</p>
<pb n="247"/>
<p>"No," said he, "but you can trust without fear to my arms;" and he reached them out to
     her.</p>
<p>"Can I?" said she, in a curious voice; and when he had lifted her from the carriage, she was
     aware that she could not. He lifted her daintily, like a piece of porcelain; but to lift her
     was not enough, he must carry her. His arms tightened about her waist, hers in spite of herself
     about his shoulders. He took a step or two from the carriage, with the water washing over his
     boots, and the respectful support of a servant became the warm grip of a man. He no longer held
     her daintily; he clipped her close to him, straining her breasts against his chest; he was on
     fire with her. She could not but know it; his arms shook, his bosom heaved; she felt the quick
     hammering of his heart; and a murmur, an inarticulate murmur, of infinite longing trembled from
     his throat. And something of his madness passed into her and made a sweet tumult in her blood.
     He stopped still holding her; he felt her fingers clasp tighter; he looked downwards into her
     face upturned to his. They were alone for a moment, these two, alone in an uninhabited world.
     The broken carriage, the busy fingers about it, the smoking horses, the lights of Ala twinkling
     in the valley, had not even the substance of shadows. They simply were not, and they never had
     been. There were just two people alive between the Poles,—not princess and servant, but man and
     woman in the primitive relationship of rescuer and rescued; and they stood in the dark of a
     translucent night of spring, with
     <pb n="248"/> the stars throbbing above them to the time of their passionate hearts, and the
     earth stretching about them rich as black velvet. He looked down into her eyes as once in the
     night-time he had done before; and again he marvelled at their steadiness and their mysterious
     depths. Her eyes were fixed on his and did not flinch; her arms were close about his neck; he
     bent his head towards her, and she said in a queer, toneless voice, low but as steady as her
     eyes,—</p>
<p>"I know. Ah, but well I know. Last night I dreamed; I rode on your black horse into your city
     of dreams;" and the moment of passion ended in farce. For Wogan, startled by the words, set her
     down there and then into the pool. She stood over her ankles in water. She uttered a little cry
     and shivered. Then she laughed and sprang lightly onto dry soil, making much of her companion's
     awkwardness. Wogan joined in the laughter, finding therein as she did a cover and a cloak.</p>
<p>"We must walk to Ala," said he.</p>
<p>"It is as well," said she. "There was a time when cavaliers laid their cloaks in the mud to
     save a lady's shoe-sole."</p>
<p>"Madam," said Wogan, "the chivalry of to-day has the same intention."</p>
<p>"But in its effect," said she, "it is more rheumatical."</p>
<p>Wogan searched in the carriage and drew out a coil of rope which he slung across his
     shoulders like a bandolier. Clementina laughed at him for his precautions,
     <pb n="249"/> but Wogan was very serious. "I would not part with it," said he. "I never
     travelled for four days without being put to it for a piece of rope."</p>
<p>They left the postillion to make what he could of the berlin and walked forward in the clear
     night to Ala. The shock of the tumble had alarmed Mrs. Misset; the fatigue of the journey had
     strained her endurance to the utmost. She made no complaint, but she could walk but slowly and
     with many rests by the way. It took a long while for them to reach the village. They saw the
     lights diminish in the houses; the stars grew pale; there came a hint of morning in the air.
     The laughter at Wogan's awkwardness had long since died away, and they walked in silence.</p>
<p>Forty-eight hours had passed since the berlin left Innspruck. Twenty-four hours ago
     Clementina knew Wogan's secret. Now he was aware that she knew it. They could not look into
     each other's faces, but their eyes conversed of it. If they turned their heads sharply away,
     that aversion of their gaze spoke no less clearly. There was a link between them now, and a
     secret link, the sweeter on that account, perhaps,—certainly the more dangerous. The cloud had
     grown much bigger than a man's hand. Moreover, she had never seen James Stuart; she had his
     picture, it is true, but the picture could not recall. It must create, not revivify his image
     to her thoughts, and that it could not do; so that he remained a shadowy figure to her, a mere
     number of
     <pb n="250"/> features, almost an abstraction. On the other hand the King's emissary walked by
     her side, sat sleepless before her, had held her in his arms, had talked with her, had risked
     his life for her; she knew him. What she knew of James Stuart, she knew chiefly from the lips
     of this emissary. On this walk to Ala he spoke of his master, and remorsefully in the highest
     praise. But she knew his secret, she knew that he loved her, and therefore every remorseful,
     loyal word he spoke praised him more than it praised his master. And it happened that just as
     they came to the outskirts of the village, she dropped a handkerchief which hung loosely about
     her neck. For a moment she did not remark her loss; when she did and turned, she saw that her
     companion was rising from the ground on which no handkerchief longer lay, and that he had his
     right hand in his breast. She turned again without a word, and walked forward. But she knew
     that kerchief was against his heart, and the cloud still grew.</p>
