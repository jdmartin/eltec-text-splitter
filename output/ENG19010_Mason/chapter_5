<head>CHAPTER V</head>
<p>Wogan, however, was not immediately benefited by his discovery. He knew that if a single
     whisper of it reached the Prince's ear there would be at once an end to his small chances. The
     old man would take alarm; he might punish the offender, but he would none the less surely
     refuse his consent to Wogan's project. Wogan must keep his lips quite closed and let his
     antagonists do boldly what they would.</p>
<p>And that they were active he found a way to discover. The Countess from this time plied him
     with kindness. He must play cards with her and Prince Constantine in the evening; he must take
     his coffee in her private apartments in the morning. So upon one of these occasions he spoke of
     his departure from Ohlau.</p>
<p>"I shall go by way of Prague;" and he stopped in confusion and corrected himself quickly. "At
     least, I am not sure. There are other ways into Italy."</p>
<p>The Countess showed no more concern than she had shown over her harp-string. She talked
     indifferently of other matters as though she had barely heard his remark; but she fell into the
     trap. Wogan was aware that the Governor of Prague
     <pb n="54"/> was her kinsman; and that afternoon he left the castle alone, and taking the road
     to Vienna, turned as soon as he was out of sight and hurried round the town until he came out
     upon the road to Prague. He hid himself behind a hedge a mile from Ohlau, and had not waited
     half an hour before a man came riding by in hot haste. The man wore the Countess's livery of
     green and scarlet; Wogan decided not to travel by way of Prague, and returned to the castle
     content with his afternoon's work. He had indeed more reason to be content with it than he
     knew, for he happened to have remarked the servant's face as well as his livery, and so at a
     later time was able to recognise it again. He had no longer any doubt that a servant in the
     same livery was well upon his way to Vienna. The roads were bad, it was true, and the journey
     long; but Wogan had not the Prince's consent, and could not tell when he would obtain it. The
     servant might return with the Emperor's order for his arrest before he had obtained it. Wogan
     was powerless. He sent his list of names to Gaydon in Schlestadt, but that was the only
     precaution he could take. The days passed; Wogan spent them in unavailing persuasions, and New
     Year's Day came and found him still at Ohlau and in a great agitation and distress.</p>
<p>Upon that morning, however, while he was dressing, there came a rap upon his door, and when
     he opened it he saw the Prince's treasurer, a foppish gentleman, very dainty in his words.</p>
<pb n="55"/>
<p>"Mr. Warner," said the treasurer, "his Highness has hinted to me his desires; he has moulded
     them into the shape of a prayer or a request."</p>
<p>"In a word, he has bidden you," said Wogan.</p>
<p>"Fie, sir! There's a barbarous and improper word, an ill-sounding word; upon my honour, a
     word without dignity or merit and banishable from polite speech. His Highness did most prettily
     entreat me with a fine gentleness of condescension befitting a Sunday or a New Year's Day to
     bring and present and communicate from hand to hand a gift,—a most incomparable proper gift,
     the mirror and image of his most incomparable proper friendship."</p>
<p>Wogan bowed, and requested the treasurer to enter and be seated the while he recovered his
     breath.</p>
<p>"Nay, Mr. Warner, I must be concise, puritanical, and unadorned in my language as any
     raw-head or bloody-bones. The cruel, irrevocable moments pass. I could consume an hour, sir,
     before I touched as I may say the hem of the reason of my coming."</p>
<p>"Sir, I do not doubt it," said Wogan.</p>
<p>"But I will not hinder you from forthwith immediately and at once incorporating with your
     most particular and inestimable treasures this jewel, this turquoise of heaven's own charming
     blue, encased and decorated with gold."</p>
<p>The treasurer drew the turquoise from his pocket. It was of the size of an egg. He placed it
     in Wogan's hand, who gently returned it.</p>
<pb n="56"/>
<p>"I cannot take it," said he.</p>
<p>"Gemini!" cried the treasurer. "But it is more than a turquoise, Mr. Warner. Jewellers have
     delved in it. It has become subservient to man's necessities. It is a snuff-box."</p>
<p>"I cannot take it."</p>
<p>"King John of Poland, he whom the vulgar call Glorious John, did rescue and enlarge it from
     its slavery to the Grand Vizier of Turkey at the great battle of Vienna. There is no other in
     the world—"</p>
<p>Wogan cut the treasurer short.</p>
<p>"You will take it again to his Highness. You will express to him my gratitude for his
     kindness, and you will say furthermore these words: 'Mr. Warner cannot carry back into Italy a
     present for himself and a refusal for his Prince.'"</p>
<p>Wogan spoke with so much dignity that the treasurer had no words to answer him. He stood
     utterly bewildered; he stared at the jewel.</p>
<p>"Here is a quandary!" he exclaimed. "I do declare every circumstance of me trembles," and
     shaking his head he went away. But in a little he came again.</p>
<p>"His Highness distinguishes you, Mr. Warner, with imperishable honours. His Highness solicits
     your company to a solitary dinner. You shall dine with him alone. His presence and unfettered
     conversation shall season your soup and be the condiments of your meat."</p>
<p>Wogan's heart jumped. There could be only one
     <pb n="57"/> reason for so unusual an invitation on such a day, and he was not mistaken; for as
     soon as the Prince was served in a little room, he dismissed the lackeys and presented again
     the turquoise snuff-box with his own hands.</p>
<p>"See, Mr. Wogan, your persuasions and your conduct have gained me over," said he. "Your
     refusal of this bagatelle assures me of your honour. I trust myself entirely to your
     discretion; I confide my beloved daughter to your care. Take from my hands the gift you refused
     this morning, and be assured that no prince ever gave to any man such full powers as I will
     give to you to-night."</p>
<p>Wogan's gratitude wellnigh overcame him. The thing that he had worked for and almost
     despaired of had come to pass. For a while he could not speak; he flung himself upon his knees
     and kissed the Prince's hand. That very night he received the letter giving him full powers,
     and the next morning he drove off in a carriage of his Highness drawn by six Polish horses
     towards the town of Strahlen on the road to Prague. At Strahlen he stayed a day, feigning a
     malady, and sent the carriage back. The following day, however, he took horse, and riding along
     by-roads and lanes avoided Prague and hurried towards Schlestadt.</p>
<p>He rode watchfully, avoiding towns, and with an eye alert for every passer-by. That he was
     ahead of any courier from the Emperor at Vienna he did not doubt, but, on the other hand, the
     Countess of Berg and Lady Featherstone had the advantage of
     <pb n="58"/> him by some four days. There would be no lack of money to hinder him; there would
     be no scruple as to the means. Wogan remembered the moment in his bedroom when he had seen the
     dagger bright in the moon's rays. If he could not be arrested, there were other ways to stop
     him. Accidents may happen to any man.</p>
<p>However, he rode unhindered with the Prince's commission safe against his breast. He felt the
     paper a hundred times a day to make sure that it was not stolen nor lost, nor reduced to powder
     by a miracle. Day by day his fears diminished, since day by day he drew a day's journey nearer
     to Schlestadt. The paper became a talisman in his thoughts,—a thing endowed with magic
     properties to make him invisible like the cloak or cap of the fairy tales. Those few lines in
     writing not a week back had seemed an unattainable prize, yet he had them; and so now they
     promised him that other unattainable thing, the enlargement of the Princess. It was in his
     nature, too, to grow buoyant in proportion to the difficulties of his task. He rode forward,
     therefore, with a good heart, and one sombre evening of rain came to a village some miles
     beyond Augsburg.</p>
<p>The village was a straggling half-mile of low cottages, lost as it were on the level of a
     wide plain. Across this plain, bare but for a few lines of poplars and stunted willow-trees,
     Wogan had ridden all the afternoon; and so little did the thatched cottages break the monotony
     of the plain's appearance, that
     <pb n="59"/> though he had had the village within his vision all that while, he came upon it
     unawares. The dusk was gathering, and already through the tiny windows the meagre lights
     gleamed upon the road and gave to the falling raindrops the look of steel beads. Four days
     would now bring Wogan to Schlestadt. The road was bad and full of holes. He determined to go no
     farther that night if he could find a lodging in the village, and coming upon a man who stood
     in his path he stopped his horse.</p>
<p>"Is there an inn where a traveller may sleep?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Assuredly," replied the man, "and find forage for his horse. The last house—but I will
     myself show your Honour the way."</p>
<p>"There is no need, my friend, that you should take a colic," said Wogan.</p>
<p>"I shall earn enough drink to correct the colic," said the man. He had a sack over his head
     and shoulders to protect him from the rain, and stepped out in front of Wogan's horse. They
     came to the end of the street and passed on into the open darkness. About twenty yards farther
     a house stood by itself at the roadside, but there were only lights in one or two of the upper
     windows, and it held out no promise of hospitality. In front of it, however, the man stopped;
     he opened the door and halloaed into the passage. Wogan stopped too, and above his head
     something creaked and groaned like a gibbet in the wind. He looked up and saw a sign-board
     glimmering in the dusk with a new coat
     <pb n="60"/> of white paint. He had undoubtedly come to the inn, and he dismounted.</p>
<p>The landlord advanced at that moment to the door.</p>
<p>"My man," said he, "will take your horse to the stable;" and the fellow who had guided Wogan
     led the horse off.</p>
<p>"Oh, is he your man?" said Wogan. "Ah!" And he followed the landlord into the house.</p>
<p>It was not only the sign-board which had been newly painted, for in the narrow passage the
     landlord stopped Wogan.</p>
<p>"Have a care, sir," said he; "the walls are wet. It will be best if you stand still while I
     go forward and bring a light."</p>
<p>He went forward in the dark and opened a door at the end of the passage. A glow of ruddy
     light came through the doorway, and Wogan caught a glimpse of a brick-floored kitchen and a
     great open chimney and one or two men on a bench before the fire. Then the door was again
     closed. The closing of the door seemed to Wogan a churlish act.</p>
<p>"The hospitality," said he to himself, "which plants a man in the road so that a traveller on
     a rainy night may not miss his bed should at least leave the kitchen door open. Why should I
     stay here in the dark?"</p>
<p>Wogan went forward, and from the careful way in which he walked,—a way so careful and
     stealthy indeed that his footsteps made no sound,—it might have been inferred that he believed
     the
     <pb n="61"/> floor to be newly painted too. He had, at all events, no such scruples about the
     kitchen door, for he seized the handle and flung it open quickly. He was met at once by a cold
     draught of wind. A door opposite and giving onto a yard at the back had been opened at
     precisely the same moment; and as Wogan stepped quickly in at his door a man stepped quickly
     out by the door opposite and was lost in the darkness.</p>
<p>"What! Are you going?" the landlord cried after him as he turned from the fire at which he
     was lighting a candle.</p>
<p>"Wilhelm has a wife and needs must," at once said a woman who was reaching down some plates
     from a dresser.</p>
<p>The landlord turned towards the passage and saw Wogan in the doorway.</p>
<p>"You found your way, sir," said he, looking at Wogan anxiously.</p>
<p>"Nor are your walls any poorer of paint on that account," said Wogan as he took his wet cloak
     and flung it over a chair.</p>
<p>The landlord blew out his candle and busied himself about laying the table. A great iron pot
     swung over the fire by a chain, and the lid danced on the top and allowed a savoury odour to
     escape. Wogan sat himself down before the fire and his clothes began to steam.</p>
<p>"You laugh at my paint, sir," said the landlord. He was a fat, good-humoured-looking man,
     communicative in his manner as a Boniface should be,
     <pb n="62"/> and his wife was his very complement. "You laugh at my paint, but it is, after
     all, a very important thing. What is a great lady without her rouge-pot, when you come to think
     of it? It is the same with an inn. It must wear paint if it is to attract attention and make a
     profit."</p>
<p>"There is philosophy in the comparison," said Wogan.</p>
<p>"Sir, an innkeeper cannot fail of philosophy if he has his eyes and a spark of intelligence.
     The man who took refuge in a tub because the follies of his fellows so angered him was the
     greatest fool of them all. He should have kept an inn on the road to Athens, for then the
     follies would have put money into his pocket and made him laugh instead of growl."</p>
<p>His wife came over to the fireplace and lifted the lid of the pot.</p>
<p>"The supper is ready," said she.</p>
<p>"And perhaps, sir, while you are eating it you can think of a name for my inn."</p>
<p>"Why, it has a sign-board already," said Wogan, "and a name, too, I suppose."</p>
<p>"It has a sign-board, but without a device," said the landlord, and while Wogan drew a chair
     to the table he explained his predicament.</p>
<p>"There is another inn five miles along the road, and travellers prefer to make their halt
     there. They will not stop here. My father, sir, set it all down to paint. It was his dream,
     sir, to paint the house from floor to ceiling; his last words bade
     <pb n="63"/> me pinch and save until I could paint. Well, here is the house painted, and I am
     anxious for a new device and name which shall obliterate the memory of the other. 'The Black
     Eagle' is its old name. Ask any traveller familiar with the road between Augsburg and
     Schlestadt, and he will counsel you to avoid 'The Black Eagle.' You are travelling to
     Schlestadt, perhaps."</p>
<p>Wogan had started ever so slightly.</p>
<p>"To Strasbourg," he said, and thereafter ate his supper in silence, taking count with
     himself. "My friend," so his thoughts ran, "the sooner you reach Schlestadt the better. Here
     are you bleating like a sheep at a mere chance mention of your destination. You have lived too
     close with this fine scheme of yours. You need your friends."</p>
<p>Wogan began to be conscious of an unfamiliar sense of loneliness. It grew upon him that
     evening while he sat at the table; it accompanied him up the stairs to bed. Other men of his
     age were now seated comfortably by their own hearths, while he was hurrying about Europe, a
     vagabond adventurer, risking his life for—and at once the reason why he was risking his life
     rose up to convict him a grumbler.</p>
<p>The landlord led him into a room in the front of the house which held a great canopied bed
     and little other furniture. There was not even a curtain to the window. Wogan raised his candle
     and surveyed the dingy walls.</p>
<p>"You have not spent much of your new paint on your guest-room, my friend."</p>
<pb n="64"/>
<p>"Sir, you have not marked the door," said his host, reproachfully.</p>
<p>"True," said Wogan, with a yawn; "the door is admirably white."</p>
<p>"The frame of the door does not suffer in a comparison." The landlord raised and lowered his
     candle that Wogan might see.</p>
<p>"I do not wish to be unjust to the frame of the door," said Wogan, and he drew off his boots.
     The landlord bade his guest good-night and descended the stairs.</p>
<p>Wogan, being a campaigner, was methodical even though lost in reflection. He was reflecting
     now why in the world he should lately have become sensible of loneliness; but at the same time
     he put the Prince's letter beneath his pillow and a sheathed hunting-knife beside the letter.
     He had always been lonely, and the fact had never troubled him; he placed a chair on the left
     of the bed and his candle on the chair. Besides, he was not really lonely, having a host of
     friends whom he had merely to seek out; he took the charges from his pistol lest they should be
     damp, and renewed them and placed the pistols by the candle. He had even begun to pity himself
     for his loneliness, and pity of that sort, he recognised, was a discreditable quality; the
     matter was altogether very disquieting. He propped his sword against the chair and undressed.
     Wogan cast back in his memories for the first sensations of loneliness. They were recent, since
     he had left Ohlau, indeed. He opened the window;
     <pb n="65"/> the rain splashed in on the sill, pattered in the street puddles below, and fell
     across the country with a continuous roar as though the level plain was a stretched drum. No;
     he had only felt lonely since he had come near to Schlestadt, since, in a word, he had deemed
     himself to have outstripped pursuit. He got into his bed and blew out the candle.</p>
<p>For a moment the room was black as pitch, then on his left side the darkness thinned at one
     point and a barred square of grey became visible; the square of grey was the window. Wogan
     understood that his loneliness came upon him with the respite from his difficulties, and
     concluded that, after all, it was as well that he had not a comfortable fireside whereby to sun
     himself. He turned over on his right side and saw the white door and its white frame. The rain
     made a dreary sound outside the window, but in three days he would be at Schlestadt. Besides he
     fell asleep.</p>
<p>And in a little he dreamed. He dreamed that he was swinging on a gibbet before the whole
     populace of Innspruck, that he died to his bewilderment without any pain whatever, but that
     pain came to him after he was quite dead,—not bodily pain at all, but an anguish of mind
     because the chains by which he was hanged would groan and creak, and the populace, mistaking
     that groaning for his cries, scoffed at him and ridiculed his King for sending to rescue the
     Princess Clementina a marrowless thing that could not die like a man. Wogan stirred in his
     sleep and waked up. The rain had ceased,
     <pb n="66"/> and a light wind blew across the country. Outside the sign-board creaked and
     groaned upon its stanchion. Once he became aware of that sound he could no longer sleep for
     listening to it; and at last he sprang out of bed, and leaning out of the window lifted the
     sign-board off the stanchion and into his bedroom.</p>
<p>It was a plain white board without any device on it. "True," thought Wogan, "the man wants a
     new name for his inn." He propped the board against the left side of his bed, since that was
     nearest to the window, got between the sheets, and began to think over names. He turned on his
     right side and fell asleep again.</p>
<p>He was not to sleep restfully that night. He waked again, but very slowly, and without any
     movement of his body. He lay with his face towards the door, dreamily considering that the
     landlord, for all his pride in his new paint, had employed a bad workman who had left a black
     strip of the door unpainted,—a fairly wide strip, too, which his host should never have
     overlooked.</p>
<p>Wogan was lazily determining to speak to the landlord about it when his half-awakened mind
     was diverted by a curious phenomenon, a delusion of the eyes such as he had known to have
     befallen him before when he had stared for a long while on any particular object: the strip of
     black widened and widened. Wogan waited for it to contract, as it would be sure to do. But it
     did not contract, and—so Wogan waked up completely.</p>
<pb n="67"/>
<p>He waked up with a shock of the heart, with all his senses startled and strained. But he had
     been gradually waking before, and so by neither movement nor cry did he betray that he was
     awake. He had not locked the door of his room; that widening strip of black ran vertically down
     from the lintel to the ground and between the white door and the white door frame. The door was
     being cautiously pushed open; the strip of black was the darkness of the passage coming
     through.</p>
<p>Wogan slid his hand beneath his pillow, and drew the knife from its sheath as silently as the
     door opened. The strip of black ceased to widen, there was a slight scuffling sound upon the
     floor which Wogan was at no loss to understand. It was the sound of a man crawling into the
     room upon his hands and knees.</p>
<p>Wogan lay on his side and felt grateful to his host,—an admirable man,—for he had painted his
     door white, and now he crawled through it on his hands and knees. No doubt he would crawl to
     the side of the bed; he did. To feel, no doubt, for Mr. Wogan's coat and breeches and any
     little letter which might be hiding in the pockets. But here Wogan was wrong. For he saw a dark
     thing suddenly on the counterpane at the edge of the bed. The dark thing travelled upwards very
     softly; it had four fingers and a thumb. It was, no doubt, travelling towards the pillow, and
     as soon as it got there—but Wogan watching that hand beneath his dosed eyelids had again to
     admit that he was wrong.
     <pb n="68"/> It did not travel towards the pillow; to his astonishment it stole across towards
     him, it touched his chest very gently, and then he understood. The hand was creeping upwards
     towards his throat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Wogan had seen no face, though the face must be just below the level of the bed. He
     only saw the hand and the arm behind it. He moved as if in his sleep, and the hand disappeared.
     As if in his sleep, he flung out his left arm and felt for the sign-board standing beside his
     bed. The bed was soft. Wogan wanted something hard, and it had occurred to him that the
     sign-board would very well serve his turn. An idea, too, which seemed to him diverting, had
     presented itself to his mind.</p>
<p>With a loud sigh and a noisy movement such as a man halfway between wakefulness and sleep may
     make he flung himself over onto his left side. At the same moment he lifted the white
     sign-board onto the bed. It seemed that he could not rest on his left side, for he flung over
     again to his right and pulled the bedclothes over as he turned. The sign-board now lay flat
     upon the bed, but on the right side between himself and the man upon the floor. His mouth
     uttered a little murmur of contentment, he drew down the hand beneath the pillow, and in a
     second was breathing regularly and peacefully.</p>
<gap unit="graphic"/>
<p>The hand crept onto the bed again and upwards, and suddenly lay spread out upon the board and
     quite still. Just for a second the owner of that hand had been surprised and paralysed by the
     unexpected.
     <pb n="69"/> It was only that second which Wogan needed. He sat up, and with his right arm he
     drove his hunting knife down into the back of the hand and pinned it fast to the board; with
     his left he felt for, found, and gripped a mouth already open to cry out. He dropped his
     hunting knife, caught the intruder round the waist, lifted him onto the bed, and setting a knee
     upon his chest gagged him with an end of the sheet. The man fought wildly with his free hand,
     beating the air. Wogan knelt upon that arm with his other knee.</p>
<p>Wogan needed a rope, but since he had none he used the sheets and bound his prisoner to the
     bed. Then he got up and went to the door. The house was quite silent, quite dark. Wogan shut
     the door gently—there was no key in the lock—and bending over the bed looked into the face of
     his assailant. The face was twisted with pain, the whites of the eyes glared horribly, but
     Wogan could see that the man was his landlord.</p>
<p>He stood up and thought. There was another man who had met him in the village and had guided
     him to the inn; there was still a third who had gone out of the kitchen as Wogan had entered
     it; there was the wife, too, who might be awake.</p>
<p>Wogan crossed to the window and looked out. The window was perhaps twenty feet from the
     ground, but the stanchion was three feet below the window. He quickly put on his clothes,
     slipped the letter from under his pillow into a pocket, strapped his saddle-bag and lowered it
     from the
     <pb n="70"/> window by a blanket. He had already one leg on the sill when a convulsive movement
     of the man on the bed made him stop. He climbed back into the room, drew the knife out of the
     board and out of the hand pinned to the board, and making a bandage wrapped the wound up.</p>
<p>"You must lie there till morning, my friend," Wogan whispered in his ear, "but here's a thing
     to console you. I have found a name for your inn; I have painted the device upon your
     sign-board. The 'Inn of the Five Red Fingers.' There's never a passer-by but will stop to
     inquire the reason of so conspicuous a sign;" and Wogan climbed out of the window, lowered
     himself till he hung at the full length of his arms from the stanchion, and dropped on the
     ground. He picked up his saddle-bag and crept round the house to the stable. The door needed
     only a push to open it. In the hay-loft above he heard a man snoring. Mr. Wogan did not think
     it worth while to disturb him. He saddled his horse, walked it out into the yard, mounted, and
     rode quietly away.</p>
<p>He had escaped, but without much credit to himself.</p>
<p>"There was no key in the door," he thought. "I should have noticed it. Misset, the man of
     resources, would have tilted a chair backwards against that door with its top bar wedged
     beneath the door handle." Certainly Wogan needed Misset if he was to succeed in his endeavour.
     He was sunk in humiliation; his very promise to rescue
     <pb n="71"/> the Princess shrank from its grandeur and became a mere piece of impertinence. But
     he still had his letter in his pocket, and in time that served to enhearten him. Only two more
     days, he thought. On the third night he would sleep in Schlestadt.</p>
