<head>III</head>
<p>For days Lucian lay in a swoon of pleasure, smiling when he was addressed, sauntering happily
     in the sunlight, hugging recollection warm to his heart. Annie had told him that she was going
     on a visit to her married sister, and said, with a caress, that he must be patient. He
     protested against her absence, but she fondled him, whispering her charms in his ear till he
     gave in and then they said good-bye, Lucian adoring on his knees. The parting was as strange as
     the meeting, and that night when he laid his work aside, and let himself sink deep into the
     joys of memory, all the encounter seemed as wonderful and impossible as magic.</p>
<p>"And you really don't mean to do anything about those rascals?" said his father.</p>
<p>"Rascals? Which rascals? Oh, you mean Beit. I had forgotten all about it. No; I don't think I
     shall trouble. They're not worth powder and shot." </p>
<p>And he returned to his dream, pacing slowly from the medlar to the quince and back again. It
     seemed trivial to be interrupted by such questions; he had not even time to think of the book
     he had recommenced so eagerly, much less of this labor of long ago. He recollected without
     interest that it cost him many pains, that it was pretty good here and there, and that it had
     been stolen, and it seemed that there was nothing more to be said on the matter. He wished to
     think of the darkness in the lane, of the kind voice that spoke to him, of the kind hand that
     sought his own, as he stumbled on the rough way. So far, it was wonderful. Since he had left
     school and lost the company of the worthy barbarians who had befriended him there, he had
     almost lost the sense of kinship with humanity; he had come to dread the human form as men
     dread the hood of the cobra. To Lucian a man or a woman meant something that stung, that spoke
     words that rankled, and poisoned his life with scorn. At first such malignity shocked him: he
     would ponder over words and glances and wonder if he were not mistaken, and he still sought now
     and then for sympathy. The poor boy had romantic ideas about women; he believed they were
     merciful and pitiful, very kind to the unlucky and helpless. Men perhaps had to be different;
     after all, the duty of a man was to get on in the world, or, in plain language, to make money,
     to be successful; to cheat rather than to be cheated, but always to be successful; and he could
     understand that one who fell below this high standard must expect to be severely judged by his
     fellows. For example, there was young Bennett, Miss Spurry's nephew. Lucian had met him once or
     twice when he was spending his holidays with Miss Spurry, and the two young fellows compared
     literary notes together. Bennett showed some beautiful things he had written, over which Lucian
     had grown both sad and enthusiastic. It was such exquisite magic verse, and so much better than
     anything he ever hoped to write, that there was a touch of anguish in his congratulations. But
     when Bennett, after many vain prayers to his aunt, threw up a safe position in the bank, and
     betook himself to a London garret, Lucian was not surprised at the general verdict.</p>
<p>Mr. Dixon, as a clergyman, viewed the question from a high standpoint and found it all
     deplorable, but the general opinion was that Bennett was a hopeless young lunatic. Old Mr.
     Gervase went purple when his name was mentioned, and the young Dixons sneered very merrily over
     the adventure.</p>
<p>"I always thought he was a beastly young ass," said Edward Dixon, "but I didn't think he'd
     chuck away his chances like that. Said he couldn't stand a bank! I hope he'll be able to stand
     bread and water. That's all those littery fellows get, I believe, except Tennyson and Mark
     Twain and those sort of people."</p>
<p>Lucian of course sympathized with the unfortunate Bennett, but such judgments were after all
     only natural. The young man might have stayed in the bank and succeeded to his aunt's thousand
     a year, and everybody would have called him a very nice young fellowâ€”"clever, too." But he
     had deliberately chosen, as Edward Dixon had said, to chuck his chances away for the sake of
     literature; piety and a sense of the main chance had alike pointed the way to a delicate course
     of wheedling, to a little harmless practicing on Miss Spurry's infirmities, to frequent
     compliances of a soothing nature, and the "young ass" had been blind to the direction of one
     and the other. It seemed almost right that the vicar should moralize, that Edward Dixon should
     sneer, and that Mr. Gervase should grow purple with contempt. Men, Lucian thought, were like
     judges, who may pity the criminal in their hearts, but are forced to vindicate the outraged
     majesty of the law by a severe sentence. He felt the same considerations applied to his own
     case; he knew that his father should have had more money, that his clothes should be newer and
     of a better cut, that he should have gone to the university and made good friends. If such had
     been his fortune he could have looked his fellow-men proudly in the face, upright and
     unashamed. Having put on the whole armor of a first-rate West End tailor, with money in his
     purse, having taken anxious thought for the morrow, and having some useful friends and good
     prospects; in such a case he might have held his head high in a gentlemanly and Christian
     community. As it was he had usually avoided the reproachful glance of his fellows, feeling that
     he deserved their condemnation. But he had cherished for a long time his romantic
     sentimentalities about women; literary conventions borrowed from the minor poets and
     pseudo-medievalists, or so he thought afterwards. But, fresh from school, wearied a little with
     the perpetual society of barbarian though worthy boys, he had in his soul a charming image of
     womanhood, before which he worshipped with mingled passion and devotion. It was a nude figure,
     perhaps, but the shining arms were to be wound about the neck of a vanquished knight; there was
     rest for the head of a wounded lover; the hands were stretched forth to do works of pity, and
     the smiling lips were to murmur not love alone, but consolation in defeat. Here was the refuge
     for a broken heart; here the scorn of men would but make tenderness increase; here was all pity
     and all charity with loving-kindness. It was a delightful picture, conceived in the "come rest
     on this bosom," and "a ministering angel thou" manner, with touches of allurement that made
     devotion all the sweeter. He soon found that he had idealized a little; in the affair of young
     Bennett, while the men were contemptuous the women were virulent. He had been rather fond of
     Agatha Gervase, and she, so other ladies said, had "set her cap" at him. Now, when he rebelled,
     and lost the goodwill of his aunt, dear Miss Spurry, Agatha insulted him with all conceivable
     rapidity. "After all, Mr. Bennett," she said, "you will be nothing better than a beggar; now,
     will you? You mustn't think me cruel, but I can't help speaking the truth. <hi>Write
      books!</hi>" Her expression filled up the incomplete sentence; she waggled with indignant
     emotion. These passages came to Lucian's ears, and indeed the Gervases boasted of "how well
     poor Agatha had behaved."</p>
<p>"Never mind, Gathy," old Gervase had observed. "If the impudent young puppy comes here again,
     we'll see what Thomas can do with the horse-whip."</p>
<p>"Poor dear child," Mrs. Gervase added in telling the tale, "and she was so fond of him too.
     But of course it couldn't go on after his shameful behavior."</p>
<p>But Lucian was troubled; he sought vainly for the ideal womanly, the tender note of "come
     rest on this bosom." Ministering angels, he felt convinced, do not rub red pepper and sulfuric
     acid into the wounds of suffering mortals.</p>
<p>Then there was the case of Mr. Vaughan, a squire in the neighborhood, at whose board all the
     aristocracy of Caermaen had feasted for years. Mr. Vaughan had a first-rate cook, and his
     cellar was rare, and he was never so happy as when he shared his good things with his friends.
     His mother kept his house, and they delighted all the girls with frequent dances, while the men
     sighed over the amazing champagne. Investments proved disastrous, and Mr. Vaughan had to sell
     the grey manor-house by the river. He and his mother took a little modern stucco villa in
     Caermaen, wishing to be near their dear friends. But the men were "very sorry; rough on you,
     Vaughan. Always thought those Patagonians were risky, but you wouldn't hear of it. Hope we
     shall see you before very long; you and Mrs. Vaughan must come to tea some day after
     Christmas."</p>
<p>"Of course we are all very sorry for them," said Henrietta Dixon. "No, we haven't called on
     Mrs. Vaughan yet. They have no regular servant, you know; only a woman in the morning. I hear
     old mother Vaughan, as Edward will call her, does nearly everything. And their house is
     absurdly small; it's little more than a cottage. One really can't call it a gentleman's
     house."</p>
<p>Then Mr. Vaughan, his heart in the dust, went to the Gervases and tried to borrow five pounds
     of Mr. Gervase. He had to be ordered out of the house, and, as Edith Gervase said, it was all
     very painful; "he went out in such a funny way," she added, "just like the dog when he's had a
     whipping. Of course it's sad, even if it is all his own fault, as everybody says, but he looked
     so ridiculous as he was going down the steps that I couldn't help laughing." Mr. Vaughan heard
     the ringing, youthful laughter as he crossed the lawn.</p>
<p>Young girls like Henrietta Dixon and Edith Gervase naturally viewed the Vaughans' comical
     position with all the high spirits of their age, but the elder ladies could not look at matters
     in this frivolous light.</p>
<p>"Hush, dear, hush," said Mrs. Gervase, "it's all too shocking to be a laughing matter. Don't
     you agree with me, Mrs. Dixon? The sinful extravagance that went on at Pentre always
      <hi>frightened</hi> me. You remember that ball they gave last year? Mr. Gervase assured me
     that the champagne must have cost <hi>at least</hi> a hundred and fifty shillings the
     dozen."</p>
<p>"It's dreadful, isn't it," said Mrs. Dixon, "when one thinks of how many poor people there
     are who would be thankful for a crust of bread?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mrs. Dixon," Agatha joined in, "and you know how absurdly the Vaughans spoilt the
     cottagers. Oh, it was really wicked; one would think Mr. Vaughan wished to make them above
     their station. Edith and I went for a walk one day nearly as far as Pentre, and we begged a
     glass of water of old Mrs. Jones who lives in that pretty cottage near the brook. She began
     praising the Vaughans in the most fulsome manner, and showed us some flannel things they had
     given her at Christmas. I assure you, my dear Mrs. Dixon, the flannel was the very best
     quality; no lady could wish for better. It couldn't have cost less than half-a-crown a
     yard."</p>
<p>"I know, my dear, I know. Mr. Dixon always said it couldn't last. How often I have heard him
     say that the Vaughans were pauperizing all the common people about Pentre, and putting every
     one else in a most unpleasant position. Even from a worldly point of view it was very poor
     taste on their part. So different from the <hi>true</hi> charity that Paul speaks of."</p>
<p>"I only wish they had given away nothing worse than flannel," said Miss Colley, a young lady
     of very strict views. "But I assure you there was a perfect orgy, I can call it nothing else,
     every Christmas. Great joints of prime beef, and barrels of strong beer, and snuff and tobacco
     distributed wholesale; as if the poor wanted to be encouraged in their disgusting habits. It
     was really impossible to go through the village for weeks after; the whole place was poisoned
     with the fumes of horrid tobacco pipes."</p>
<p>"Well, we see how that sort of thing ends," said Mrs. Dixon, summing up judicially. "We had
     intended to call, but I really think it would be impossible after what Mrs. Gervase has told
     us. The idea of Mr. Vaughan trying to sponge on poor Mr. Gervase in that shabby way! I think
     meanness of that kind is so hateful."</p>
<p>It was the practical side of all this that astonished Lucian. He saw that in reality there
     was no high-flown quixotism in a woman's nature; the smooth arms, made he had thought for
     caressing, seemed muscular; the hands meant for the doing of works of pity in his system,
     appeared dexterous in the giving of "stingers," as Barnes might say, and the smiling lips could
     sneer with great ease. Nor was he more fortunate in his personal experiences. As has been told,
     Mrs. Dixon spoke of him in connection with "judgments," and the younger ladies did not exactly
     cultivate his acquaintance. Theoretically they "adored" books and thought poetry "too sweet,"
     but in practice they preferred talking about mares and fox-terriers and their neighbors.</p>
<p>They were nice girls enough, very like other young ladies in other country towns, content
     with the teaching of their parents, reading the Bible every morning in their bedrooms, and
     sitting every Sunday in church amongst the well-dressed "sheep" on the right hand. It was not
     their fault if they failed to satisfy the ideal of an enthusiastic dreamy boy, and indeed, they
     would have thought his feigned woman immodest, absurdly sentimental, a fright ("never wears
     stays, my dear") and <hi>horrid</hi>.</p>
<p>At first he was a good deal grieved at the loss of that charming tender woman, the work of
     his brain. When the Miss Dixons went haughtily by with a scornful waggle, when the Miss
     Gervases passed in the wagonette laughing as the mud splashed him, the poor fellow would look
     up with a face of grief that must have been very comic; "like a dying duck," as Edith Gervase
     said. Edith was really very pretty, and he would have liked to talk to her, even about
     fox-terriers, if she would have listened. One afternoon at the Dixons' he really forced himself
     upon her, and with all the obtuseness of an enthusiastic boy tried to discuss the <hi>Lotus
      Eaters</hi> of Tennyson. It was too absurd. Captain Kempton was making signals to Edith all
     the time, and Lieutenant Gatwick had gone off in disgust, and he had promised to bring her a
     puppy "by Vick out of Wasp." At last the poor girl could bear it no longer:</p>
<p>"Yes, it's very sweet," she said at last. "When did you say you were going to London, Mr.
     Taylor?"</p>
<p>It was about the time that his disappointment became known to everybody, and the shot told.
     He gave her a piteous look and slunk off, "just like the dog when he's had a whipping," to use
     Edith's own expression. Two or three lessons of this description produced their due effect; and
     when he saw a male Dixon or Gervase approaching him he bit his lip and summoned up his courage.
     But when he descried a "ministering angel" he made haste and hid behind a hedge or took to the
     woods. In course of time the desire to escape became an instinct, to be followed as a matter of
     course; in the same way he avoided the adders on the mountain. His old ideals were almost if
     not quite forgotten; he knew that the female of the <hi>bête humaine</hi>, like the adder,
     would in all probability sting, and he therefore shrank from its trail, but without any feeling
     of special resentment. The one had a poisoned tongue as the other had a poisoned fang, and it
     was well to leave them both alone. Then had come that sudden fury of rage against all humanity,
     as he went out of Caermaen carrying the book that had been stolen from him by the enterprising
     Beit. He shuddered as he though of how nearly he had approached the verge of madness, when his
     eyes filled with blood and the earth seemed to burn with fire. He remembered how he had looked
     up to the horizon and the sky was blotched with scarlet; and the earth was deep red, with red
     woods and red fields. There was something of horror in the memory, and in the vision of that
     wild night walk through dim country, when every shadow seemed a symbol of some terrible
     impending doom. The murmur of the brook, the wind shrilling through the wood, the pale light
     flowing from the moldered trunks, and the picture of his own figure fleeing and fleeting
     through the shades; all these seemed unhappy things that told a story in fatal hieroglyphics.
     And then the life and laws of the sunlight had passed away, and the resurrection and kingdom of
     the dead began. Though his limbs were weary, he had felt his muscles grow strong as steel; a
     woman, one of the hated race, was beside him in the darkness, and the wild beast woke within
     him, ravening for blood and brutal lust; all the raging desires of the dim race from which he
     came assailed his heart. The ghosts issued out from the weird wood and from the caves in the
     hills, besieging him, as he had imagined the spiritual legion besieging Caermaen, beckoning him
     to a hideous battle and a victory that he had never imagined in his wildest dreams. And then
     out of the darkness the kind voice spoke again, and the kind hand was stretched out to draw him
     up from the pit. It was sweet to think of that which he had found at last; the boy's picture
     incarnate, all the passion and compassion of his longing, all the pity and love and
     consolation. She, that beautiful passionate woman offering up her beauty in sacrifice to him,
     she was worthy indeed of his worship. He remembered how his tears had fallen upon her breast,
     and how tenderly she had soothed him, whispering those wonderful unknown words that sang to his
     heart. And she had made herself defenseless before him, caressing and fondling the body that
     had been so despised. He exulted in the happy thought that he had knelt down on the ground
     before her, and had embraced her knees and worshipped. The woman's body had become his
     religion; he lay awake at night looking into the darkness with hungry eyes; wishing for a
     miracle, that the appearance of the so-desired form might be shaped before him. And when he was
     alone in quiet places in the wood, he fell down again on his knees, and even on his face,
     stretching out vain hands in the air, as if they would feel her flesh. His father noticed in
     those days that the inner pocket of his coat was stuffed with papers; he would see Lucian
     walking up and down in a secret shady place at the bottom of the orchard, reading from his
     sheaf of manuscript, replacing the leaves, and again drawing them out. He would walk a few
     quick steps, and pause as if enraptured, gazing in the air as if he looked through the shadows
     of the world into some sphere of glory, feigned by his thought. Mr. Taylor was almost alarmed
     at the sight; he concluded of course that Lucian was writing a book. In the first place, there
     seemed something immodest in seeing the operation performed under one's eyes; it was as if the
     "make-up" of a beautiful actress were done on the stage, in full audience; as if one saw the
     rounded calves fixed in position, the fleshings drawn on, the voluptuous outlines of the figure
     produced by means purely mechanical, blushes mantling from the paint-pot, and the golden
     tresses well secured by the wigmaker. Books, Mr. Taylor thought, should swim into one's ken
     mysteriously; they should appear all printed and bound, without apparent genesis; just as
     children are suddenly told that they have a little sister, found by mamma in the garden. But
     Lucian was not only engaged in composition; he was plainly rapturous, enthusiastic; Mr. Taylor
     saw him throw up his hands, and bow his head with strange gesture. The parson began to fear
     that his son was like some of those mad Frenchmen of whom he had read, young fellows who had a
     sort of fury of literature, and gave their whole lives to it, spending days over a page, and
     years over a book, pursuing art as Englishmen pursue money, building up a romance as if it were
     a business. Now Mr. Taylor held firmly by the "walking-stick" theory; he believed that a man of
     letters should have a real profession, some solid employment in life. "Get something to do," he
     would have liked to say, "and then you can write as much as you please. Look at Scott, look at
     Dickens and Trollope." And then there was the social point of view; it might be right, or it
     might be wrong, but there could be no doubt that the literary man, as such, was not thought
     much of in English society. Mr. Taylor knew his Thackeray, and he remembered that old Major
     Pendennis, society personified, did not exactly boast of his nephew's occupation. Even
     Warrington was rather ashamed to own his connection with journalism, and Pendennis himself
     laughed openly at his novel-writing as an agreeable way of making money, a useful appendage to
     the cultivation of dukes, his true business in life. This was the plain English view, and Mr.
     Taylor was no doubt right enough in thinking it good, practical common sense. Therefore when he
     saw Lucian loitering and sauntering, musing amorously over his manuscript, exhibiting manifest
     signs of that fine fury which Britons have ever found absurd, he felt grieved at heart, and
     more than ever sorry that he had not been able to send the boy to Oxford.</p>
<p>"B.N.C. would have knocked all this nonsense out of him," he thought. "He would have taken a
     double First like my poor father and made something of a figure in the world. However, it can't
     be helped." The poor man sighed, and lit his pipe, and walked in another part of the
     garden.</p>
<p>But he was mistaken in his diagnosis of the symptoms. The book that Lucian had begun lay
     unheeded in the drawer; it was a secret work that he was engaged on, and the manuscripts that
     he took out of that inner pocket never left him day or night. He slept with them next to his
     heart, and he would kiss them when he was quite alone, and pay them such devotion as he would
     have paid to her whom they symbolized. He wrote on these leaves a wonderful ritual of praise
     and devotion; it was the liturgy of his religion. Again and again he copied and recopied this
     madness of a lover; dallying all days over the choice of a word, searching for more exquisite
     phrases. No common words, no such phrases as he might use in a tale would suffice; the
     sentences of worship must stir and be quickened, they must glow and burn, and be decked out as
     with rare work of jewelry. Every part of that holy and beautiful body must be adored; he sought
     for terms of extravagant praise, he bent his soul and mind low before her, licking the dust
     under her feet, abased and yet rejoicing as a Templar before the image of Baphomet. He exulted
     more especially in the knowledge that there was nothing of the conventional or common in his
     ecstasy; he was not the fervent, adoring lover of Tennyson's poems, who loves with passion and
     yet with a proud respect, with the love always of a gentleman for a lady. Annie was not a lady;
     the Morgans had farmed their land for hundreds of years; they were what Miss Gervase and Miss
     Colley and the rest of them called common people. Tennyson's noble gentleman thought of their
     ladies with something of reticence; they imagined them dressed in flowing and courtly robes,
     walking with slow dignity; they dreamed of them as always stately, the future mistresses of
     their houses, mothers of their heirs. Such lovers bowed, but not too low, remembering their own
     honor, before those who were to be equal companions and friends as well as wives. It was not
     such conceptions as these that he embodied in the amazing emblems of his ritual; he was not, he
     told himself, a young officer, "something in the city," or a rising barrister engaged to a Miss
     Dixon or a Miss Gervase. He had not thought of looking out for a nice little house in a good
     residential suburb where they would have pleasant society; there were to be no consultations
     about wall-papers, or jocose whispers from friends as to the necessity of having a room that
     would do for a nursery. No glad young thing had leant on his arm while they chose the suite in
     white enamel, and china for "our bedroom," the modest salesman doing his best to spare their
     blushes. When Edith Gervase married she would get mamma to look out for two really good
     servants, "as we must begin quietly," and mamma would make sure that the drains and everything
     were right. Then her "girl friends" would come on a certain solemn day to see all her "lovely
     things." "Two dozen of everything!" "Look, Ethel, did you ever see such ducky frills?" "And
     that insertion, isn't it quite too sweet?" "My dear Edith, you are a lucky girl." "All the
     underlinen specially made by Madame Lulu!" "What delicious things!" "I hope he knows what a
     prize he is winning." "Oh! do look at those lovely ribbon-bows!" "You darling, how happy you
     must be." "Real Valenciennes!" Then a whisper in the lady's ear, and her reply, "Oh, don't,
     Nelly!" So they would chirp over their treasures, as in Rabelais they chirped over their cups;
     and every thing would be done in due order till the wedding-day, when mamma, who had strained
     her sinews and the commandments to bring the match about, would weep and look indignantly at
     the unhappy bridegroom. "I <hi>hope</hi> you'll be kind to her, Robert." Then in a rapid
     whisper to the bride: "Mind, you <hi>insist</hi> on Wyman's flushing the drains when you come
     back; servants are so careless and dirty too. Don't let him go about by himself in Paris. Men
     are so <hi>queer</hi>, one never knows. You <hi>have</hi> got the pills?" And aloud, after
     these <hi>secreta</hi>, "God bless you, my dear; good-bye! <hi>cluck</hi>, <hi>cluck</hi>,
     good-bye!"</p>
<p>There were stranger things written in the manuscript pages that Lucian cherished, sentences
     that burnt and glowed like "coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame." There were phrases
     that stung and tingled as he wrote them, and sonorous words poured out in ecstasy and rapture,
     as in some of the old litanies. He hugged the thought that a great part of what he had invented
     was in the true sense of the word occult: page after page might have been read aloud to the
     uninitiated without betraying the inner meaning. He dreamed night and day over these symbols,
     he copied and recopied the manuscript nine times before he wrote it out fairly in a little book
     which he made himself of a skin of creamy vellum. In his mania for acquirements that should be
     entirely useless he had gained some skill in illumination, or limning as he preferred to call
     it, always choosing the obscurer word as the obscurer arts. First he set himself to the severe
     practice of the text; he spent many hours and days of toil in struggling to fashion the serried
     columns of black letter, writing and rewriting till he could shape the massive character with
     firm true hand. He cut his quills with the patience of a monk in the scriptorium, shaving and
     altering the nib, lightening and increasing the pressure and flexibility of the points, till
     the pen satisfied him, and gave a stroke both broad and even. Then he made experiments in inks,
     searching for some medium that would rival the glossy black letter of the old manuscripts; and
     not till he could produce a fair page of text did he turn to the more entrancing labor of the
     capitals and borders and ornaments. He mused long over the Lombardic letters, as glorious in
     their way as a cathedral, and trained his hand to execute the bold and flowing lines; and then
     there was the art of the border, blossoming in fretted splendor all about the page. His cousin,
     Miss Deacon, called it all a great waste of time, and his father thought he would have done
     much better in trying to improve his ordinary handwriting, which was both ugly and illegible.
     Indeed, there seemed but a poor demand for the limner's art. He sent some specimens of his
     skill to an "artistic firm" in London; a verse of the "Maud," curiously emblazoned, and a Latin
     hymn with the notes pricked on a red stave. The firm wrote civilly, telling him that his work,
     though good, was not what they wanted, and enclosing an illuminated text. "We have great demand
     for this sort of thing," they concluded, "and if you care to attempt something in this style we
     should be pleased to look at it." The said text was "Thou, God, seest me." The letter was of a
     degraded form, bearing much the same relation to the true character as a "churchwarden gothic"
     building does to Canterbury Cathedral; the colours were varied. The initial was pale gold, the
      <hi>h</hi> pink, the <hi>o</hi> black, the <hi>u</hi> blue, and the first letter was somehow
     connected with a bird's nest containing the young of the pigeon, who were waited on by the
     female bird.</p>
<p>"What a pretty text," said Miss Deacon. "I should like to nail it up in my room. Why don't
     you try to do something like that, Lucian? You might make something by it."</p>
<p>"I sent them these," said Lucian, "but they don't like them much."</p>
<p>"My dear boy! I should think not! Like them! What were you thinking of to draw those queer
     stiff flowers all round the border? Roses? They don't look like roses at all events. Where do
     you get such ideas from?"</p>
<p>"But the design is appropriate; look at the words."</p>
<p>"My dear Lucian, I can't read the words; it's such a queer old-fashioned writing. Look how
     plain that text is; one can see what it's about. And this other one; I can't make it out at
     all."</p>
<p>"It's a Latin hymn."</p>
<p>"A Latin hymn? Is it a Protestant hymn? I may be old-fashioned, but <hi>Hymns Ancient and
      Modern</hi> is quite good enough for me. This is the music, I suppose? But, my dear boy, there
     are only four lines, and who ever heard of notes shaped like that: you have made some square
     and some diamond-shape? Why didn't you look in your poor mother's old music? It's in the
     ottoman in the drawing-room. I could have shown you how to make the notes; there are crotchets,
     you know, and quavers."</p>
<p>Miss Deacon laid down the illuminated <hi>Urbs Beata</hi> in despair; she felt convinced that
     her cousin was "next door to an idiot."</p>
<p>And he went out into the garden and raged behind a hedge. He broke two flower-pots and hit an
     apple-tree very hard with his stick, and then, feeling more calm, wondered what was the use in
     trying to do anything. He would not have put the thought into words, but in his heart he was
     aggrieved that his cousin liked the pigeons and the text, and did not like his emblematical
     roses and the Latin hymn. He knew he had taken great pains over the work, and that it was well
     done, and being still a young man he expected praise. He found that in this hard world there
     was a lack of appreciation; a critical spirit seemed abroad. If he could have been
     scientifically observed as he writhed and smarted under the strictures of "the old fool," as he
     rudely called his cousin, the spectacle would have been extremely diverting. Little boys
     sometimes enjoy a very similar entertainment; either with their tiny fingers or with mamma's
     nail scissors they gradually deprive a fly of its wings and legs. The odd gyrations and queer
     thin buzzings of the creature as it spins comically round and round never fail to provide a
     fund of harmless amusement. Lucian, indeed, fancied himself a very ill-used individual; but he
     should have tried to imitate the nervous organization of the flies, which, as mamma says,
     "can't really feel."</p>
<p>But now, as he prepared the vellum leaves, he remembered his art with joy; he had not labored
     to do beautiful work in vain. He read over his manuscript once more, and thought of the
     designing of the pages. He made sketches on furtive sheets of paper, and hunted up books in his
     father's library for suggestions. There were books about architecture, and medieval iron work,
     and brasses which contributed hints for adornment; and not content with mere pictures he sought
     in the woods and hedges, scanning the strange forms of trees, and the poisonous growth of great
     water-plants, and the parasite twining of honeysuckle and briony. In one of these rambles he
     discovered a red earth which he made into a pigment, and he found in the unctuous juice of a
     certain fern an ingredient which he thought made his black ink still more glossy. His book was
     written all in symbols, and in the same spirit of symbolism he decorated it, causing wonderful
     foliage to creep about the text, and showing the blossom of certain mystical flowers, with
     emblems of strange creatures, caught and bound in rose thickets. All was dedicated to love and
     a lover's madness, and there were songs in it which haunted him with their lilt and refrain.
     When the book was finished it replaced the loose leaves as his constant companion by day and
     night. Three times a day he repeated his ritual to himself, seeking out the loneliest places in
     the woods, or going up to his room; and from the fixed intentness and rapture of his gaze, the
     father thought him still severely employed in the questionable process of composition. At night
     he contrived to wake for his strange courtship; and he had a peculiar ceremony when he got up
     in the dark and lit his candle. From a steep and wild hillside, not far from the house, he had
     cut from time to time five large boughs of spiked and prickly gorse. He had brought them into
     the house, one by one, and had hidden them in the big box that stood beside his bed. Often he
     woke up weeping and murmuring to himself the words of one of his songs, and then when he had
     lit the candle, he would draw out the gorse-boughs, and place them on the floor, and taking off
     his nightgown, gently lay himself down on the bed of thorns and spines. Lying on his face, with
     the candle and the book before him, he would softly and tenderly repeat the praises of his
     dear, dear Annie, and as he turned over page after page, and saw the raised gold of the
     majuscules glow and flame in the candle-light, he pressed the thorns into his flesh. At such
     moments he tasted in all its acute savor the joy of physical pain; and after two or three
     experiences of such delights he altered his book, making a curious sign in vermilion on the
     margin of the passages where he was to inflict on himself this sweet torture. Never did he fail
     to wake at the appointed hour, a strong effort of will broke through all the heaviness of
     sleep, and he would rise up, joyful though weeping, and reverently set his thorny bed upon the
     floor, offering his pain with his praise. When he had whispered the last word, and had risen
     from the ground, his body would be all freckled with drops of blood; he used to view the marks
     with pride. Here and there a spine would be left deep in the flesh, and he would pull these out
     roughly, tearing through the skin. On some nights when he had pressed with more fervor on the
     thorns his thighs would stream with blood, red beads standing out on the flesh, and trickling
     down to his feet. He had some difficulty in washing away the bloodstains so as not to leave any
     traces to attract the attention of the servant; and after a time he returned no more to his bed
     when his duty had been accomplished. For a coverlet he had a dark rug, a good deal worn, and in
     this he would wrap his naked bleeding body, and lie down on the hard floor, well content to add
     an aching rest to the account of his pleasures. He was covered with scars, and those that
     healed during the day were torn open afresh at night; the pale olive skin was red with the
     angry marks of blood, and the graceful form of the young man appeared like the body of a
     tortured martyr. He grew thinner and thinner every day, for he ate but little; the skin was
     stretched on the bones of his face, and the black eyes burnt in dark purple hollows. His
     relations noticed that he was not looking well.</p>
<p>"Now, Lucian, it's perfect madness of you to go on like this," said Miss Deacon, one morning
     at breakfast. "Look how your hand shakes; some people would say that you have been taking
     brandy. And all that you want is a little medicine, and yet you won't be advised. You know it's
     not my fault; I have asked you to try Dr. Jelly's Cooling Powders again and again."</p>
<p>He remembered the forcible exhibition of the powders when he was a boy, and felt thankful
     that those days were over. He only grinned at his cousin and swallowed a great cup of strong
     tea to steady his nerves, which were shaky enough. Mrs. Dixon saw him one day in Caermaen; it
     was very hot, and he had been walking rather fast. The scars on his body burnt and tingled, and
     he tottered as he raised his hat to the vicar's wife. She decided without further investigation
     that he must have been drinking in public-houses.</p>
<p>"It seems a mercy that poor Mrs. Taylor was taken," she said to her husband. "She has
     certainly been spared a great deal. That wretched young man passed me this afternoon; he was
     quite intoxicated."</p>
<p>"How very said," said Mr. Dixon. "A little port, my dear?"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Merivale, I will have another glass of sherry. Dr. Burrows is always scolding me
     and saying I <hi>must</hi> take something to keep up my energy, and this sherry is so
     weak."</p>
<p>The Dixons were not teetotalers. They regretted it deeply, and blamed the doctor, who
     "insisted on some stimulant." However, there was some consolation in trying to convert the
     parish to total abstinence, or, as they curiously called it, temperance. Old women were warned
     of the sin of taking a glass of beer for supper; aged laborers were urged to try Cork-ho, the
     new temperance drink; an uncouth beverage, styled coffee, was dispensed at the reading-room.
     Mr. Dixon preached an eloquent "temperance" sermon, soon after the above conversation, taking
     as his text: <hi>Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees</hi>. In his discourse he showed that
     fermented liquor and leaven had much in common, that beer was at the present day "put away"
     during Passover by the strict Jews; and in a moving peroration he urged his dear brethren, "and
     more especially those amongst us who are poor in this world's goods," to beware indeed of that
     evil leaven which was sapping the manhood of our nation. Mrs. Dixon cried after church:</p>
<p>"Oh, Merivale, what a beautiful sermon! How earnest you were. I hope it will do good."</p>
<p>Mr. Dixon swallowed his port with great decorum, but his wife fuddled herself every evening
     with cheap sherry. She was quite unaware of the fact, and sometimes wondered in a dim way why
     she always had to scold the children after dinner. And so strange things sometimes happened in
     the nursery, and now and then the children looked queerly at one another after a red-faced
     woman had gone out, panting.</p>
<p>Lucian knew nothing of his accuser's trials, but he was not long in hearing of his own
     intoxication. The next time he went down to Caermaen he was hailed by the doctor.</p>
<p>"Been drinking again today?"</p>
<p>"No," said Lucian in a puzzled voice. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Oh, well, if you haven't, that's all right, as you'll be able to take a drop with me. Come
     along in?"</p>
<p>Over the whisky and pipes Lucian heard of the evil rumors affecting his character.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Dixon assured me you were staggering from one side of the street to the other. You
     quite frightened her, she said. Then she asked me if I recommended her to take one or two
     ounces of spirit at bedtime for the palpitation; and of course I told her two would be better.
     I have my living to make here, you know. And upon my word, I think she wants it; she's always
     gurgling inside like waterworks. I wonder how old Dixon can stand it."</p>
<p>"I like 'ounces of spirit,'" said Lucian. "That's taking it medicinally, I suppose. I've
     often heard of ladies who have to 'take it medicinally'; and that's how it's done?"</p>
<p>"That's it. 'Dr Burrows won't <hi>listen</hi> to me': 'I tell him how I dislike the taste of
     spirits, but he says they are absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> for my constitution': 'my medical
     man <hi>insists</hi> on something at bedtime'; that's the style."</p>
<p>Lucian laughed gently; all these people had become indifferent to him; he could no longer
     feel savage indignation at their little hypocrisies and malignancies. Their voices uttering
     calumny, and morality, and futility had become like the thin shrill angry note of a gnat on a
     summer evening; he had his own thoughts and his own life, and he passed on without heeding.</p>
<p>"You come down to Caermaen pretty often, don't you?" said the doctor. "I've seen you two or
     three times in the last fortnight." </p>
<p>"Yes, I enjoy the walk."</p>
<p>"Well, look me up whenever you like, you know. I am often in just at this time, and a chat
     with a human being isn't bad, now and then. It's a change for me; I'm often afraid I shall lose
     my patients."</p>
<p>The doctor had the weakness of these terrible puns, dragged headlong into the conversation.
     He sometimes exhibited them before Mrs. Gervase, who would smile in a faint and dignified
     manner, and say:</p>
<p>"Ah, I see. Very amusing indeed. We had an old coachmen once who was very clever, I believe,
     at that sort of thing, but Mr. Gervase was obliged to send him away, the laughter of the other
     domestics was so very boisterous."</p>
<p>Lucian laughed, not boisterously, but good-humouredly, at the doctor's joke. He liked
     Burrows, feeling that he was a man and not an automatic gabbling machine.</p>
<p>"You look a little pulled down," said the doctor, when Lucian rose to go. "No, you don't want
     my medicine. Plenty of beef and beer will do you more good than drugs. I daresay it's the hot
     weather that has thinned you a bit. Oh, you'll be all right again in a month."</p>
<p>As Lucian strolled out of the town on his way home, he passed a small crowd of urchins
     assembled at the corner of an orchard. They were enjoying themselves immensely. The "healthy"
     boy, the same whom he had seen some weeks ago operating on a cat, seemed to have recognized his
     selfishness in keeping his amusements to himself. He had found a poor lost puppy, a little
     creature with bright pitiful eyes, almost human in their fond, friendly gaze. It was not a
     well-bred little dog; it was certainly not that famous puppy "by Vick out of Wasp"; it had
     rough hair and a foolish long tail which it wagged beseechingly, at once deprecating severity
     and asking kindness. The poor animal had evidently been used to gentle treatment; it would look
     up in a boy's face, and give a leap, fawning on him, and then bark in a small doubtful voice,
     and cower a moment on the ground, astonished perhaps at the strangeness, the bustle and
     animation. The boys were beside themselves with eagerness; there was quite a babble of voices,
     arguing, discussing, suggesting. Each one had a plan of his own which he brought before the
     leader, a stout and sturdy youth.</p>
<p>"Drown him! What be you thinkin' of, mun?" he was saying. "'Tain't no sport at all. You shut
     your mouth, gwaes. Be you goin' to ask your mother for the boiling-water? Is, Bob Williams, I
     do know all that: but where be you a-going to get the fire from? Be quiet, mun, can't you?
     Thomas Trevor, be this dog yourn or mine? Now, look you, if you don't all of you shut your
     bloody mouths, I'll take the dog 'ome and keep him. There now!"</p>
<p>He was a born leader of men. A singular depression and lowness of spirit showed itself on the
     boys' faces. They recognized that the threat might very possibly be executed, and their
     countenances were at once composed to humble attention. The puppy was still cowering on the
     ground in the midst of them: one or two tried to relieve the tension of their feelings by
     kicking him in the belly with their hobnail boots. It cried out with the pain and writhed a
     little, but the poor little beast did not attempt to bite or even snarl. It looked up with
     those beseeching friendly eyes at its persecutors, and fawned on them again, and tried to wag
     its tail and be merry, pretending to play with a straw on the road, hoping perhaps to win a
     little favor in that way.</p>
<p>The leader saw the moment for his master-stroke. He slowly drew a piece of rope from his
     pocket.</p>
<p>"What do you say to that, mun? Now, Thomas Trevor! We'll hang him over that there bough. Will
     that suit you, Bobby Williams?"</p>
<p>There was a great shriek of approval and delight. All was again bustle and animation. "I'll
     tie it round his neck?" "Get out, mun, you don't know how it be done." "Is, I do, Charley."
     "Now, let me, gwaes, now do let me." "You be sure he won't bite?" "He hain't mad, be he?"
     "Suppose we were to tie up his mouth first?"</p>
<p>The puppy still fawned and curried favor, and wagged that sorry tail, and lay down crouching
     on one side on the ground, sad and sorry in his heart, but still with a little gleam of hope;
     for now and again he tried to play, and put up his face, praying with those fond, friendly
     eyes. And then at last his gambols and poor efforts for mercy ceased, and he lifted up his
     wretched voice in one long dismal whine of despair. But he licked the hand of the boy that tied
     the noose.</p>
<p>He was slowly and gently swung into the air as Lucian went by unheeded; he struggled, and his
     legs twisted and writhed. The "healthy" boy pulled the rope, and his friends danced and shouted
     with glee. As Lucian turned the corner, the poor dangling body was swinging to and fro, the
     puppy was dying, but he still kicked a little.</p>
<p>Lucian went on his way hastily, and shuddering with disgust. The young of the human creature
     were really too horrible; they defiled the earth, and made existence unpleasant, as the pulpy
     growth of a noxious and obscene fungus spoils an agreeable walk. The sight of those malignant
     little animals with mouths that uttered cruelty and filthy, with hands dexterous in torture,
     and feet swift to run all evil errands, had given him a shock and broken up the world of
     strange thoughts in which he had been dwelling. Yet it was no good being angry with them: it
     was their nature to be very loathsome. Only he wished they would go about their hideous
     amusements in their own back gardens where nobody could see them at work; it was too bad that
     he should be interrupted and offended in a quiet country road. He tried to put the incident out
     of his mind, as if the whole thing had been a disagreeable story, and the visions amongst which
     he wished to move were beginning to return, when he was again rudely disturbed. A little girl,
     a pretty child of eight or nine, was coming along the lane to meet him. She was crying bitterly
     and looking to left and right, and calling out some word all the time.</p>
<p>"Jack, Jack, Jack! Little Jackie! Jack!"</p>
<p>Then she burst into tears afresh, and peered into the hedge, and tried to peep through a gate
     into a field.</p>
<p>"Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!"</p>
<p>She came up to Lucian, sobbing as if her heart would break, and dropped him an old-fashioned
     curtsy.</p>
<p>"Oh, please sir, have you seen my little Jackie?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" said Lucian. "What is it you've lost?"</p>
<p>"A little dog, please sir. A little terrier dog with white hair. Father gave me him a month
     ago, and said I might keep him. Someone did leave the garden gate open this afternoon, and he
     must 'a got away, sir, and I was so fond of him sir, he was so playful and loving, and I be
     afraid he be lost."</p>
<p>She began to call again, without waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>"Jack, Jack, Jack!"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid some boys have got your little dog," said Lucian. "They've killed him. You'd
     better go back home."</p>
<p>He went on, walking as fast as he could in his endeavor to get beyond the noise of the
     child's crying. It distressed him, and he wished to think of other things. He stamped his foot
     angrily on the ground as he recalled the annoyances of the afternoon, and longed for some
     hermitage on the mountains, far above the stench and the sound of humanity.</p>
<p>A little farther, and he came to Croeswen, where the road branched off to right and left.
     There was a triangular plot of grass between the two roads; there the cross had once stood,
     "the goodly and famous roode" of the old local chronicle. The words echoed in Lucian's ears as
     he went by on the right hand. "There were five steps that did go up to the first pace, and
     seven steps to the second pace, all of clene hewn ashler. And all above it was most curiously
     and gloriously wrought with thorowgh carved work; in the highest place was the Holy Roode with
     Christ upon the Cross having Marie on the one syde and John on the other. And below were six
     splendent and glisteringe archaungels that bore up the roode, and beneath them in their stories
     were the most fair and noble images of the xii Apostles and of divers other Saints and Martirs.
     And in the lowest storie there was a marvelous imagerie of divers Beasts, such as oxen and
     horses and swine, and little dogs and peacocks, all done in the finest and most curious wise,
     so that they all seemed as they were caught in a Wood of Thorns, the which is their torment of
     this life. And here once in the year was a marvelous solemn service, when the parson of
     Caermaen came out with the singers and all the people, singing the psalm <hi>Benedicite omnia
      opera</hi> as they passed along the road in their procession. And when they stood at the roode
     the priest did there his service, making certain prayers for the beasts, and then he went up to
     the first pace and preached a sermon to the people, shewing them that as our lord Jhu dyed upon
     the Tree of his deare mercy for us, so we too owe mercy to the beasts his Creatures, for that
     they are all his poor lieges and silly servants. And that like as the Holy Aungells do their
     suit to him on high, and the Blessed xii Apostles and the Martirs, and all the Blissful Saints
     served him aforetime on earth and now praise him in heaven, so also do the beasts serve him,
     though they be in torment of life and below men. For their spirit goeth downward, as Holy Writ
     teacheth us."</p>
<p>It was a quaint old record, a curious relic of what the modern inhabitants of Caermaen called
     the Dark Ages. A few of the stones that had formed the base of the cross still remained in
     position, grey with age, blotched with black lichen and green moss. The remainder of the famous
     rood had been used to mend the roads, to build pigsties and domestic offices; it had turned
     Protestant, in fact. Indeed, if it had remained, the parson of Caermaen would have had no time
     for the service; the coffee-stall, the Portuguese Missions, the Society for the Conversion of
     the Jews, and important social duties took up all his leisure. Besides, he thought the whole
     ceremony unscriptural.</p>
<p>Lucian passed on his way, wondering at the strange contrasts of the Middle Ages. How was it
     that people who could devise so beautiful a service believed in witchcraft, demoniacal
     possession and obsession, in the incubus and succubus, and in the Sabbath an in many other
     horrible absurdities? It seemed astonishing that anybody could even pretend to credit such
     monstrous tales, but there could be no doubt that the dread of old women who rode on
     broomsticks and liked black cats was once a very genuine terror.</p>
<p>A cold wind blew up from the river at sunset, and the scars on his body began to burn and
     tingle. The pain recalled his ritual to him, and he began to recite it as he walked along. He
     had cut a branch of thorn from the hedge and placed it next to his skin, pressing the spikes
     into the flesh with his hand till the warm blood ran down. He felt it was an exquisite and
     sweet observance for her sake; and then he thought of the secret golden palace he was building
     for her, the rare and wonderful city rising in his imagination. As the solemn night began to
     close about the earth, and the last glimmer of the sun faded from the hills, he gave himself
     anew to the woman, his body and his mind, all that he was, and all that he had.</p>
