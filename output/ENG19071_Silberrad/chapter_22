<head>CHAPTER XXI</head>
<head>THE GOING OF THE GOOD COMRADE</head>
<p>The cottage was very quiet. Although it was not late, both Captain Polkington and Johnny had
     gone to bed, the one to suit himself, the other to oblige Julia; she was in the kitchen now, as
     completely alone as she could wish. And certainly she did wish it; by the hard light in her
     eyes and the grim look about her mouth it was clear she was in no mood for company. She had got
     at the truth that evening, or most of it; the whole affair, with the exception of one point
     only, was quite plain to her; not by her father's wish or intention, but plain none the less.
     Subterfuge was an art the Polkingtons understood so well that it was exceedingly difficult to
     deceive them; Julia was the most difficult of them all to deceive, and the Captain was least
     clever at subterfuge; it was not wonderful, therefore, that she knew nearly all there was to
     know. Her heart was bitter within her, but against herself as well as against her father—after
     all he had but done what she had once thought to do. She had stayed her hand because the one
     who owned the daffodil was a child to her. Her father had had no such reason for staying his;
     the one who owned this daffodil was as cunning as he. He had done what he had, badly of course
     he could not do otherwise—a foredained failure such as he—bungled it hopelessly; but the idea
     was the same—a bad travesty of a bad idea, badly worked out. For a
     <pb n="326"/> moment her mind glanced aside from the main issue in disgust and contempt for the
     method. It was sin without genius, a puerile theft without adequate return, a miserable fall,
     and for such a purpose! To expect to find the streaked daffodil unguarded in an outhouse! To
     sell it for five pounds and think to spend the money on creature comforts! It is hard to say
     which of the three was the worst. The really good have little idea how such fool's knavery
     looks to the shadily clever; it brings home to them the wrongness of wrong, disgusting them
     with it and with themselves, as no preaching in the world can.</p>
<p>The moon had risen by this time; its first beams shone in at the unshuttered window. Julia
     went to the door and, opening it, looked out. There was a little mist about and the moon, quite
     a young one, was struggling through it, shining with a soft, diffused light that made the
     landscape very unearthly.</p>
<p>It was wonderfully still out of doors, quiet and damp with belts of unexplained shadow here
     and there, and a sense of illimitable space and silence. Julia sat down on the door steps and
     smelt the good smell of the earth and felt the nearness of it. But it did not comfort her; she
     was not in tune with the night; she had neither part nor lot with these things. "Thief, and
     daughter of a thief;" the words kept coming to her—and he, the man whom she never named to
     herself, had called her his good comrade! She bowed her face to her knees and sat
     motionless.</p>
<p>She had told him the truth about herself; she had not been ashamed; she would not have been
     even if she had taken the daffodil. But her father! She was ashamed for him with a bitter
     shame; ashamed of herself and him too, in thought and intention at least they were one,
     <pb n="327"/>double-dealers. "Two grubby little people," as she had seen them long ago when
     they first stood in company with that man.</p>
<p>"But you don't know; you have not our temptations." She almost spoke aloud, unconsciously
     addressing the dewy silence as her mind called the man plainly before her. "You have never
     wanted money as I wanted it, or wanted things as father wanted them. Oh, you would despise the
     things he wanted—so do I; they are miserable and mean and sordid; you couldn't want whisky and
     comfort as he wanted them, but you can't think how he did! He would have justified it to
     himself too; you wouldn't, couldn't do that, while we—we could justify the devil if we tried.
     It is not right, any the more for that, I know it is not; it is dishonest and disgraceful, I
     know that as well as you; but I know how it came about and you—you can never understand!" Her
     voice sank away. That was the great difference between herself and this man; it did not lie in
     what she did; that was a remedial matter—but rather in what she knew and felt. Things that did
     not exist for him were not only possible but sometimes almost necessary to her and hers. The
     gulf between them which had almost seemed bridged in the early summer was suddenly opened again
     by the day's work; opened beyond all passage for her—thief, and daughter of a thief.</p>
<p>She sat on the doorstone looking out with unseeing eyes while the moon rose higher and the
     light grew so that the belts of shadow melted and the misty land was all silver, a world of
     dreams, very pure and still. But neither her dreams nor her thoughts were pure and still; they
     were full of passion and pain, longing and regret and shame, and yet an underlying hopeless
     desire that all could be known and understood.</p>
<p>
<pb n="328"/></p>
<p>At last she rose and went in. The pink woolly thing Captain Polkington had bought her lay on
     the kitchen-table, half out of its paper wrappings, a silly, useless thing. As her eyes fell on
     it they grew dim and hot while the colour crept up in her cheek. Her father had bought it for
     her; he had thought to please her with the foolish thing; it was like a child's or a fool's
     gift; she hated herself for hating it. But he had deceived himself into thinking he was
     generous to make it with his illgotten gains; he had salved conscience with it—it was a liar's
     gift, a self-deceiver's, a thief's. There was no kindness, no generosity in it, and she
     despised him—and he was her father!</p>
<p>She picked up the thing, paper and all, and crammed it into the dying fire. Then suddenly she
     burst into tears. The world was all wrong, justice was wrong and suffering was wrong and
     mankind wrong, all was wrong and inexplicable and pitiful too.</p>
<p>For a minute she sobbed chokingly, then she forced back the tears with the angry impatience
     of a hurt animal, and fetching a sheet of paper and pencil, sat down to write. He was her
     father and he was a man with a warped idea of honour, one whose self-respect had been taken
     away; it was too late to teach him, one could only safeguard him now. Opportunity did not make
     thieves of such as her, but it did of such as him, and she had left the opportunity—or what he
     took to be it—open. She would close it now for ever; she would be rid of the bulb, the cause of
     so much trouble. So she wrote hurriedly, a mere scrawl, while the passion was still upon her,
     and her eyes were still dim with tears—</p>
<p>"Joost, if you have ever cared for me, take back the daffodil; take it back and don't ask me
     why."</p>
<p>The next morning Julia posted a small parcel, and
     <pb n="329"/> at dinner time told Johnny and her father that she had sent the famous daffodil
     back to its native land.</p>
<p>Johnny looked up in mild surprise; he had been to the outhouse that morning to see if the
     bulbs were keeping dry. "Why," he said, "it's in the shed!"</p>
<p>"No, it is not," Julia answered, "and it never was. The one you think it is one of the large
     double pale ones; I told you at the time we put them away, but you have got mixed, I
     expect."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, of course," Mr. Gillat said; "I remember now; of course, I remember."</p>
<p>The Captain swallowed something, but contrived to keep quiet, and only darted a glance at
     Johnny, the muddler, whose information could never be depended on.</p>
<p>When the meal was over and Mr. Gillat in the back kitchen, Captain Polkington spoke to his
     daughter.</p>
<p>"Julia," he said, moistening his dry lips, "that man Cross thought it was the streaked
     daffodil that I, that—"</p>
<p>His voice tailed away, but Julia only said, "Well?"</p>
<p>"I pledged by word of honour that it was the true one."</p>
<p>Again Julia said, "Well?"</p>
<p>"What is to be done?" the Captain asked.</p>
<p>She showed no signs of grasping his meaning or at all events of helping him out. He burst out
     irritably, "What on earth have you sold it for? Nothing would induce you to do so before when I
     asked you to; now, all at once you have taken a freak and parted with it without any
     consideration whatever. I never saw anything like women, so utterly irrational!"</p>
<p>"I have not sold it," Julia told him; "only sent it away."
     <pb n="330"/></p>
<p>"What for? It is perfectly absurd! I suppose you can get it back? You must get it back."</p>
<p>Julia asked "What for?" in her turn.</p>
<p>The Captain enlightened her. "There is Cross," he said; "I told him that was the daffodil,
     and it is not. Something must be done; we can't cheat him; we must send him the daffodil, or
     else refund the five pounds. We should have to do that—and we can't."</p>
<p>"No," Julia agreed grimly; "and we would not if we could."</p>
<p>"But what are you going to do?" her father asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Nothing! But I pledged my word! You don't understand, I am in honour bound."</p>
<p>Julia forbore to make and comment on her father's notion of honour; indeed, it struck her as
     almost pathetic in its grotesqueness and certainly very characteristic of the Polkingtons.</p>
<p>"Cross paid five pounds for the streaked daffodil," the Captain went on to say, believing
     that he was stating the case with incontrovertible plainness, "and if he does not have the true
     bulb he must have the money back; otherwise he will, with justice, say he has been cheated, for
     I guaranteed the thing."</p>
<p>"He paid five pounds for a speculation," Julia said; "your guarantee was nothing, and though
     he may have asked for it, it was just a form and did not count one way or the other. He knew
     there was a chance that you had come by the true bulb somehow and so had it to sell; he risked
     five pounds on that—and lost it."</p>
<p>Captain Polkington looked bewildered. "He paid five pounds for the bulb," he persisted; "he
     said it was worth no more to him."</p>
<p>"Very likely not, if he could get it for that," Julia
     <pb n="331"/> said; "but if he could have been sure of it, it would have been worth two hundred
     pounds."</p>
<p>"Two hundred!" Captain Polkington gasped, turning rather white.</p>
<p>Julia nodded. "With my guarantee," she said. "You had not got that; I suppose you let him see
     it when you wrote first so he knew that, though you might have the real bulb, you were not in a
     position to sell it well."</p>
<p>The Captain flushed as suddenly as he had paled. "You think he thought I had not come by it
     honestly, that I had no right in my daughter's affairs?"</p>
<p>"I don't see it matters what he thought," Julia answered, taking up the dishes. "He risked
     his money, and lost it, knowing very well what he did; he does not mind doing business in that
     way; I don't admire it myself, but I guessed he would do it when I first made his
     acquaintance."</p>
<p>"You ——" the Captain said.</p>
<p>"I have nothing to do with it, and shall have nothing."</p>
<p>"But the money must be paid; it is a debt of honour; I must clear myself."</p>
<p>Julia shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>"You do not wish me cleared?" her father demanded haughtily.</p>
<p>"Paying the five pounds would not clear you," she said; "neither that nor anything else. No,
     I am not going to pay it; I don't feel any obligation in the matter. If Mr. Cross goes in for
     those sort of dealings he must put up with the consequence, and I am afraid you must, too." And
     with that she went away.</p>
<p>This was the last reference that was made to the sale of the daffodil and the expedition to
     town; after that the matter was left out of conversation and Julia behaved as if it had never
     existed. But Captain Polkington was
     <pb n="332"/> very unhappy; he could not get over the affair and his own failure; he brooded
     over it in silence, feeling and resenting that he could not speak to either Johnny or Julia,
     they being quite unable to understand his emotions. Once or twice he raged weakly against
     Cross, who had given him five pounds when he had asked twenty for a thing worth two hundred;
     who had doubted his word, who had behaved as if he were a common thief—who would, doubtless,
     think him one. More often his indignation burnt up against Julia who would do nothing to remedy
     this last catastrophe, and clear him and reinstate his honour in the eyes of this man and
     himself. Most often of all his quarrel was with fate, and then his anger broke down into
     self-pity as he thought of all the troubles that were crowding about his later years; of his
     lost reputation, his lack of sympathy and comprehension; the failure of all his plans and
     hopes, the poverty and feeble health that oppressed him. In these gloomy days he had one ray of
     comfort only; it lay in the purchase he had made on that day that he went shopping. That whisky
     was the solitary thing in the day's adventure about which Julia had not heard; everything else
     she had been told, but somehow that had escaped. One reason of this, no doubt, lay in the fact
     that Captain Polkington had not brought his purchase home with him that evening. He had meant
     to; when the carrier set him and his property down just outside Halgrave, he had fully meant to
     carry it to the cottage. But he found it so heavy and cumbersome in his weak and dejected state
     that he had to give it up. So he found a suitable hiding-place in the deep overgrown ditch
     beside the road, and, thrusting it as much out of sight as he could, left it there and went
     home unburdened. He meant to tell Julia and Johnny about it, they of course were to have
     shared, and one or
     <pb n="333"/> both of them would go with him to fetch it home in the morning. But he did not
     tell them; it did not seem suitable at first; they, each in a different way, were too
     unsympathetic about the expedition to town; he determined to wait for a fitting opportunity.
     The opportunity did not come; but in course of time the whisky was moved and gave comfort of
     sorts during the autumn days to the Captain's drooping spirits, if it had a less beneficial
     effect on his failing health.</p>
<p>In the meantime the daffodil, "The Good Comrade," had gone back to its native land, and with
     it an appeal, written in English, badly written, scrawled almost—but not likely to be refused.
     Joost read it through once, twice, more times than that; it said little, only, take back the
     bulb and ask no questions, yet he felt he had been honoured by Julia's confidence. The very
     style and haste of the letter seemed an honour to him; it showed him she had need and had
     turned to him in it. Of course he would do as she asked; he would have done things far harder
     than that. He folded the slip of paper and put it away where he kept some few treasures, and
     for a time he put with it the bulb she had sent; and sometimes when he went to bed of a
     night—he had no other free time—he took both out and looked at them.</p>
<p>But "The Good Comrade" did not remain locked away from the light of day. Joost was a
     sentimentalist, it is true, and the bulb had come from Julia, winged by an appeal from her. But
     he was also a bulb grower, and he was that before he was anything else and afterwards too, and
     the daffodil was a marvel of nature, a novelty, a thing beyond words to a connoisseur. The
     lover asked that the token should be kept hidden from the eyes of men; but the grower cried
     that the flower should be given to the light of heaven and should grow and bloom accord
     <pb n="334"/>ing to Nature's plan. For days the lover was uppermost and the old pain back. But
     in time the bitter-sweet madness died down again and, in the atmosphere which was saturated
     with the beloved work, the old love, the first and last and soundly abiding one, reasserted
     itself. The daffodil must bloom, the little brown bulb must go back to the brown earth, the
     strange flower must unfold itself to the sun and wind and rain.</p>
<p>So he went to his father. "My father," he said, and it is to be feared he had learnt
     something of guile from the source of his bitter-sweet madness. "My father, I have heard from
     Miss Julia; she would wish us to have the narcissus 'The Good Comrade.'"</p>
<p>Mijnheer was pleased. "That is as it should be," he said; he had felt strongly about the gift
     of the bulb in the first instance, but that was an affair over and done with long ago between
     him and his son. He did not reopen it now, he was only gratified to think there was a
     likelihood of the daffodil coming back to its birthplace, where it certainly ought to be. "How
     much does Miss Julia ask for it?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"Nothing," Joost answered; "she does not wish to sell it; she wishes to give it back."</p>
<p>"But, but!" Mijnheer exclaimed, pushing up his spectacles in astonishment; he knew the value
     of the thing and the offers that must have been made for it; this way was not at all his notion
     of doing business; also he found it hard to reconcile with the Julia he remembered. He
     recollected talk he had had with her when she had proved herself an apt pupil in trade and
     trade dealings, and shown, not only a very good comprehension of such things, but also an eye
     to the main chance. "This is nonsense," he said; "it is not business."</p>
<p>Joost looked distressed. "I gave her the bulb," he ventured; "she does not want to sell me
     back my present."
     <pb n="335"/></p>
<p>Mijnheer did not recognise any such distinction in business transactions, and for a little it
     looked as if "The Good Comrade" would be sent wandering again, sacrificed to his old-fashioned
     notions of integrity. Joost should not have it unless he paid for it, he said so with decision.
     He himself would buy it if Joost would not, and if she would not sell it to him then neither of
     them should have it.</p>
<p>And Joost could not, even if he would, explain why and how the paying was so difficult. He
     used all the arguments he could; indeed, for one of his nature, he spoke with considerable
     diplomacy.</p>
<p>"Supposing," he said at last, "that it was only a sport, and that next year it reverts and is
     blue as are the others, the parent bulbs? Miss Julia thinks of that—she would not like to be
     paid for it now in case of such a thing, will you not at least wait until the spring? She has
     given nothing for it herself; it is not as if she had sunk money and wants an immediate
     return."</p>
<p>Mijnheer did not consider that made any difference and he said so, reading his son a lecture
     on business morality according to his standard, of a very severe order. Joost listened with
     meekness to the entirely undeserved reproof for meanness and dishonourable views; then the old
     man announced finally what he should do. He should write to Julia and offer her a smallish sum
     down in case the bulb proved to be of no great worth, and a promise of a proportional
     percentage afterwards if it proved valuable. This idea pleased him very well; it satisfied his
     notions of integrity and fair dealing and also his thrifty soul, which found trying the
     otherwise unavoidable duty of paying a long price for what had been freely given. From this
     Joost could not move him, so there was nothing for him to do but write distressfully to Julia
     and explain and apologise.</p>
