<head>CHAPTER XI</head>
<head>THE CRIMINALS CHASE THE POLICE</head>
<p>SYME put the field‑glasses from his eyes with an almost ghastly relief.</p>
<p>“The President is not with them, anyhow,” he said, and wiped his forehead.</p>
<p>“But surely they are right away on the horizon,” said the bewildered Colonel, blinking and
     but half recovered from Bull’s hasty though polite explanation. “Could you possibly know your
     President among all those people?”</p>
<p>“Could I know a white elephant among all those people!” answered Syme somewhat irritably. “As
     you very truly say, they are on the horizon; but if he were walking with them . . . by God! I
     believe this ground would shake.”</p>
<p>After an instant’s pause the new man called Ratcliffe said with gloomy decision—</p>
<p>“Of course the President isn’t with them. I wish to Gemini he were. Much more likely the
     President is riding in triumph through Paris, or sitting on the ruins of St. Paul’s
     Cathedral.”</p>
<p>“This is absurd!” said Syme. “Something may have happened in our absence; but he cannot have
     carried the world with a rush like that. It is quite true,” he added, frowning dubiously at the
     distant fields that lay towards the little station, “it is certainly true that there seems to
     be a crowd coming this way; but they are not all the army that you make out.”</p>
<p>“Oh, they,” said the new detective contemptuously; “no they are not a very valuable force.
     But let me tell you frankly that they are precisely calculated to our value—we are not much, my
     boy, in Sunday’s universe. He has got hold of all the cables and telegraphs himself. But to
     kill the Supreme Council he regards as a trivial matter, like a post card; it may be left to
     his private secretary,” and he spat on the grass.</p>
<p>Then he turned to the others and said somewhat austerely—</p>
<p>“There is a great deal to be said for death; but if anyone has any preference for the other
     alternative, I strongly advise him to walk after me.”</p>
<p>With these words, he turned his broad back and strode with silent energy towards the wood.
     The others gave one glance over their shoulders, and saw that the dark cloud of men had
     detached itself from the station and was moving with a mysterious discipline across the plain.
     They saw already, even with the naked eye, black blots on the foremost faces, which marked the
     masks they wore. They turned and followed their leader, who had already struck the wood, and
     disappeared among the twinkling trees.</p>
<p>The sun on the grass was dry and hot. So in plunging into the wood they had a cool shock of
     shadow, as of divers who plunge into a dim pool. The inside of the wood was full of shattered
     sunlight and shaken shadows. They made a sort of shuddering veil, almost recalling the
     dizziness of a cinematograph. Even the solid figures walking with him Syme could hardly see for
     the patterns of sun and shade that danced upon them. Now a man’s head was lit as with a light
     of Rembrandt, leaving all else obliterated; now again he had strong and staring white hands
     with the face of a negro. The ex‑Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes, and the
     black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the
     black half-masks of their pursuers. The fancy tinted Syme’s overwhelming sense of wonder. Was
     he wearing a mask? Was anyone wearing a mask? Was anyone anything? This wood of witchery, in
     which men’s faces turned black and white by turns, in which their figures first swelled into
     sunlight and then faded into formless night, this mere chaos of chiaroscuro (after the clear
     daylight outside), seemed to Syme a perfect symbol of the world in which he had been moving for
     three days, this world where men took off their beards and their spectacles and their noses,
     and turned into other people. That tragic self‑confidence which he had felt when he believed
     that the Marquis was a devil had strangely disappeared now that he knew that the Marquis was a
     friend. He felt almost inclined to ask after all these bewilderments what was a friend and what
     an enemy. Was there anything that was apart from what it seemed? The Marquis had taken off his
     nose and turned out to be a detective. Might he not just as well take off his head and turn out
     to be a hobgoblin? Was not everything, after all, like this bewildering woodland, this dance of
     dark and light? Everything only a glimpse, the glimpse always unforeseen, and always forgotten.
     For Gabriel Syme had found in the heart of that sun-splashed wood what many modern painters had
     found there. He had found the thing which the modern people call Impressionism, which is
     another name for that final scepticism which can find no floor to the universe.</p>
<p>As a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake, Syme strove with a sudden
     effort to fling off this last and worst of his fancies. With two impatient strides he overtook
     the man in the Marquis’s straw hat, the man whom he had come to address as Ratcliffe. In a
     voice exaggeratively loud and cheerful, he broke the bottomless silence and made
     conversation.</p>
<p>“May I ask,” he said, “where on earth we are all going to? ”</p>
<p>So genuine had been the doubts of his soul, that he was quite glad to hear his companion
     speak in an easy, human voice.</p>
<p>“We must get down through the town of Lancy to the sea,” he said. “I think that part of the
     country is least likely to be with them.”</p>
<p>“What can you mean by all this?” cried Syme. “They can’t be running the real world in that
     way. Surely not many working men are anarchists, and surely if they were, mere mobs could not
     beat modern armies and police.”</p>
<p>“Mere mobs!” repeated his new friend with a snort of scorn. “So you talk about mobs and the
     working classes as if they were the question. You’ve got that eternal idiotic idea that if
     anarchy came it would come from the poor. Why should it? The poor have been rebels, but they
     have never been anarchists; they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent
     government. The poor man really has a stake in the country. The rich man hasn’t; he can go away
     to New Guinea in a yacht. The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly; the rich
     have always objected to being governed at all. Aristocrats were always anarchists, as you can
     see from the barons’ wars.”</p>
<p>“As a lecture on English history for the little ones,” said Syme, “this is all very nice; but
     I have not yet grasped its application.”</p>
<p>“Its application is,” said his informant, “that most of old Sunday’s right‑hand men are South
     African and American millionaires. That is why he has got hold of all the communications; and
     that is why the last four champions of the anti‑anarchist police force are running through a
     wood like rabbits.”</p>
<p>“Millionaires I can understand,” said Syme thoughtfully, “they are nearly all mad. But
     getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with hobbies is one thing; getting hold of great
     Christian nations is another. I would bet the nose off my face (forgive the allusion) that
     Sunday would stand perfectly helpless before the task of converting any ordinary healthy person
     anywhere.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said the other, “it rather depends what sort of person you mean.”</p>
<p>“Well, for instance,” said Syme, “he could never convert that person,” and he pointed
     straight in front of him.</p>
<p>They had come to an open space of sunlight, which seemed to express to Syme the final return
     of his own good sense; and in the middle of this forest clearing was a figure that might well
     stand for that common sense in an almost awful actuality. Burnt by the sun and stained with
     perspiration, and grave with the bottomless gravity of small necessary toils, a heavy French
     peasant was cutting wood with a hatchet. His cart stood a few yards off, already half full of
     timber; and the horse that cropped the grass was, like his master, valorous but not desperate;
     like his master, he was even prosperous, but yet was almost sad. The man was a Norman, taller
     than the average of the French and very angular; and his swarthy figure stood dark against a
     square of sunlight, almost like some allegoric figure of labour frescoed on a ground of
     gold.</p>
<p>“Mr. Syme is saying,” called out Ratcliffe to the French Colonel, “that this man, at least,
     will never be an anarchist.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Syme is right enough there,” answered Colonel Ducroix, laughing, “if only for the reason
     that he has plenty of property to defend. But I forgot that in your country you are not used to
     peasants being wealthy.”</p>
<p>“He looks poor,” said Dr. Bull doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Quite so,” said the Colonel; “that is why he is rich.”</p>
<p>“I have an idea,” called out Dr. Bull suddenly; “how much would he take to give us a lift in
     his cart? Those dogs are all on foot, and we could soon leave them behind.”</p>
<p>“Oh, give him anything! ” said Syme eagerly. “I have piles of money on me.”</p>
<p>“That will never do,” said the Colonel; “he will never have any respect for you unless you
     drive a bargain.”</p>
<p>“Oh, if he haggles!” began Bull impatiently.</p>
<p>“Erie haggles because he is a free man,” said the other. “You do not understand; he would not
     see the meaning of generosity. He is not being tipped.”</p>
<p>And even while they seemed to hear the heavy feet of their strange pursuers behind them, they
     had to stand and stamp while the French Colonel talked to the French wood‑cutter with all the
     leisurely badinage and bickering of market‑day. At the end of the four minutes, however, they
     saw that the Colonel was right, for the wood‑cutter entered into their plans, not with the
     vague servility of a tout too‑well paid, but with the seriousness of a solicitor who had been
     paid the proper fee. He told them that the best thing they could do was to make their way down
     to the little inn on the hills above Lancy, where the innkeeper, an old soldier who had become
      <hi>dévot</hi> in his latter years, would be certain to sympathise with them, and even to take
     risks in their support. The whole company, therefore, piled themselves on top of the stacks of
     wood, and went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side of the woodland. Heavy
     and ramshackle as was the vehicle, it was driven quickly enough, and they soon had the
     exhilarating impression of distancing altogether those, whoever they were, who were hunting
     them. For, after all, the riddle as to where the anarchists had got all these followers was
     still unsolved. One man’s presence had sufficed for them; they had fled at the first sight of
     the deformed smile of the Secretary. Syme every now and then looked back over his shoulder at
     the army on their track.</p>
<p>As the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distance, he could see the sunlit slopes
     beyond it and above it; and across these was still moving the square black mob like one
     monstrous beetle. In the very strong sunlight and with his own very strong eyes, which were
     almost telescopic, Syme could see this mass of men quite plainly. He could see them as separate
     human figures; but he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved as one man.
     They seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain hats, like any common crowd out of the
     streets; but they did not spread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack, as would
     be natural in an ordinary mob. They moved with a sort of dreadful and wicked woodenness, like a
     staring army of automatons.</p>
<p>Syme pointed this out to Ratcliffe.</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied the policeman, “that’s discipline. That’s Sunday. He is perhaps five hundred
     miles off, but the fear of him is on all of them, like the finger of God. Yes, they are walking
     regularly; and you bet your boots that they are talking regularly, yes, and thinking regularly.
     But the one important thing for us is that they are disappearing regularly.”</p>
<p>Syme nodded. It was true that the black patch of the pursuing men was growing smaller and
     smaller as the peasant belaboured his horse.</p>
<p>The level of the sunlit landscape, though flat as a whole, fell away on the farther side of
     the wood in billows of heavy slope towards the sea, in a way not unlike the lower slopes of the
     Sussex downs. The only difference was that in Sussex the road would have been broken and
     angular like a little brook, but here the white French road fell sheer in front of them like a
     waterfall. Down this direct descent the cart clattered at a considerable angle, and in a few
     minutes, the road growing yet steeper, they saw below them the little harbour of Lancy and a
     great blue arc of the sea. The travelling cloud of their enemies had wholly disappeared from
     the horizon.</p>
<p>The horse and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elms, and the horse’s nose nearly
     struck the face of an old gentleman who was sitting on the benches outside the little café of
     “Le Soleil d’Or.” The peasant grunted an apology, and got down from his seat. The others also
     descended one by one, and spoke to the old gentleman with fragmentary phrases of courtesy, for
     it was quite evident from his expansive manner that he was the owner of the little tavern.</p>
<p>He was a white‑haired, apple‑faced old boy, with sleepy eyes and a grey moustache; stout,
     sedentary, and very innocent, of a type that may often be found in France, but is still
     commoner in Catholic Germany. Everything about him, his pipe, his pot of beer, his flowers, and
     his beehive, suggested an ancestral peace; only when his visitors looked up as they entered the
     inn-­parlour, they saw the sword upon the wall.</p>
<p>The Colonel, who greeted the innkeeper as an old friend, passed rapidly into the inn‑parlour,
     and sat down ordering some ritual refreshment. The military decision of his action interested
     Syme, who sat next to him, and he took the opportunity when the old innkeeper had gone out of
     satisfying his curiosity.</p>
<p>“May I ask you, Colonel,” he said in a low voice, “why we have come here?”</p>
<p>Colonel Ducroix smiled behind his bristly white moustache.</p>
<p>“For two reasons, sir,” he said; “and I will give first, not the most important, but the most
     utilitarian. We came here because this is the only place within twenty miles in which we can
     get horses.”</p>
<p>“Horses!” repeated Syme, looking up quickly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied the other; “if you people are really to distance your enemies it is horses or
     nothing for you, unless of course you have bicycles and motor‑cars in your pocket.”</p>
<p>“And where do you advise us to make for?” asked Syme doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Beyond question,” replied the Colonel, “you had better make all haste to the police station
     beyond the town. My friend, whom I seconded under somewhat deceptive circumstances, seems to me
     to exaggerate very much the possibilities of a general rising; but even he would hardly
     maintain, I suppose, that you were not safe with the gendarmes.”</p>
<p>Syme nodded gravely; then he said abruptly—</p>
<p>“And your other reason for coming here?”</p>
<p>“My other reason for coming here,” said Ducroix soberly, “is that it is just as well to see a
     good man or two when one is possibly near to death.”</p>
<p>Syme looked up at the wall, and saw a crudely-painted and pathetic religious picture. Then he
     said—</p>
<p>“You are right,” and then almost immediately afterwards, “Has anyone seen about the
     horses?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered Ducroix, “you may be quite certain that I gave orders the moment I came in.
     Those enemies of yours gave no impression of hurry, but they were really moving wonderfully
     fast, like a well‑trained army. I had no idea that the anarchists had so much discipline. You
     have not a moment to waste.”</p>
<p>Almost as he spoke, the old innkeeper with the blue eyes and white hair came ambling into the
     room, and announced that six horses were saddled outside.</p>
<p>By Ducroix’s advice the five others equipped themselves with some portable form of food and
     wine, and keeping their duelling swords as the only weapons available, they clattered away down
     the steep, white road. The two servants, who had carried the Marquis’s luggage when he was a
     marquis, were left behind to drink at the café by common consent, and not at all against their
     own inclination.</p>
<p>By this time the afternoon sun was slanting westward, and by its rays Syme could see the
     sturdy figure of the old innkeeper growing smaller and smaller, but still standing and looking
     after them quite silently, the sunshine in his silver hair. Syme had a fixed, superstitious
     fancy, left in his mind by the chance phrase of the Colonel, that this was indeed, perhaps, the
     last honest stranger whom he should ever see upon the earth.</p>
<p>He was still looking at this dwindling figure, which stood as a mere grey blot touched with a
     white flame against the great green wall of the steep down behind him. And as he stared over
     the top of the down behind the innkeeper, there appeared an army of black‑clad and marching
     men. They seemed to hang above the good man and his house like a black cloud of locusts. The
     horses had been saddled none too soon.</p>
