<head>A CONSCIENTIOUS ASS</head>
<p> Pocket Upton had come down late and panting, in spite of his daily exemption from first
     school, and the postcard on his plate had taken away his remaining modicum of breath. He could
     have wept over it in open hall, and would probably have done so in the subsequent seclusion of
     his own study, had not an obvious way out of his difficulty been bothering him by that time
     almost as much as the difficulty itself. For it was not a very honest way, and the unfortunate
     Pocket had been called “a conscientious ass” by some of the nicest fellows in his house.
     Perhaps he deserved the epithet for going even as straight as he did to his house-master, who
     was discovered correcting proses with a blue pencil and a briar pipe. </p>
<p> “Please, sir, Mr. Coverley can't have me, sir. He's got a case of chicken-pox, sir.” </p>
<p>
<pb n="4"/> The boy produced the actual intimation in a few strokes of an honoured but laconic
     pen. The man poised his pencil and puffed his pipe. </p>
<p> “Then you must come back to-night, and I'm just as glad. It's all nonsense your staying the
     night whenever you go up to see that doctor of yours.” </p>
<p> “He makes a great point of it, sir. He likes to try some fresh stuff on me, and then see
     what sort of night I have.” </p>
<p> “You could go up again to-morrow.” </p>
<p> “Of course I could, sir,” replied Pocket Upton, with a delicate emphasis on his penultimate.
     At the moment he was perhaps neither so acutely conscientious nor such an ass as his critics
     considered him. </p>
<p> “What else do you propose?” inquired Mr. Spearman. </p>
<p> “Well, sir, I have plenty of other friends in town, sir. Either the Knaggses or Miss
     Harbottle would put me up in a minute, sir.” </p>
<p> “Who are the Knaggses?” </p>
<p> “The boys were with me at Mr. Coverley's, sir; they go to Westminster now. One of them
     stayed with us last holidays. They live in St. John's Wood Park.” </p>
<p> “And the lady you mentioned?” </p>
<p> “Miss Harbottle, sir, an old friend of my
     <pb n="5"/> mother's; it was through her I went to Mr. Coverley's, and I've often stayed there.
     She's in the Wellington Road, sir, quite close to Lord's.” </p>
<p> Mr. Spearman smiled at the gratuitous explanation of an eagerness that other lads might have
     taken more trouble to conceal. But there was no guile in any Upton; in that one respect the
     third and last of them resembled the great twin brethren of whom he had been prematurely voted
     a “pocket edition” on his arrival in the school. He had few of their other merits, though he
     took a morbid interest in the games they played by light of nature, as well as in things both
     beyond and beneath his brothers and the average boy. You cannot sit up half your nights with
     asthma and be an average boy. This was obvious even to Mr. Spearman, who was an average man. He
     had never disguised his own disappointment in the youngest Upton, but had often made him the
     butt of outspoken and disastrous comparisons. Yet in his softer moments he had some sympathy
     with the failure of an otherwise worthy family; this fine June morning he seemed even to
     understand the joy of a jaunt to London for a boy who was getting very little out of his school
     life. He made a note of the two names and addresses. </p>
<p> “You're quite sure they'll put you up, are you?” “Absolutely certain, sir.” </p>
<p>
<pb n="6"/> “But you'll come straight back if they can't?” </p>
<p> “Rather, sir!” </p>
<p> “Then run away, and don't miss your train.” </p>
<p> Pocket interpreted the first part of the injunction so literally as to arrive very
     breathless in his study. That diminutive cell was garnished with more ambitious pictures than
     the generality of its order; but the best of them was framed in the ivy round the lattice
     window, and its foreground was the nasturtiums in the flower-box. Pocket glanced down into the
     quad, where the fellows were preparing construes for second school in sunlit groups on garden
     seats. At that moment the bell began. And by the time Pocket had changed his black tie for a
     green one with red spots, in which he had come back after the Easter holidays, the bell had
     stopped and the quad was empty; before it filled again he would be up in town and on his way to
     Welbeck Street in a hansom. </p>
<p> The very journey was a joy. It was such sport to be flying through a world of buttercups and
     daisies in a train again, so refreshing to feel as good as anybody else in the third smoker;
     for even the grown men in the corner seats did not dream of calling the youth an “old ass,”
     much less a young one, to his face. His friends and contemporaries at school were in the habit
     of employing the ameliorating adjective, but there were still a few fellows
     <pb n="7"/> in Pocket's house who made an insulting point of the other. All, however, seemed
     agreed as to the noun; and it was pleasant to cast off friend and foe for a change, to sit
     comfortably unknown and unsuspected of one's foibles in the train. It made Pocket feel a bit of
     a man; but then he really was almost seventeen, and in the Middle Fifth, and allowed to smoke
     asthma cigarettes in bed. He took one out of a cardboard box in his bag, and thought it might
     do him good to smoke it now. But an adult tobacco-smoker looked so curiously at the little thin
     cross between cigar and cigarette, that it was transferred to a pocket unlit, and the coward
     hid himself behind his paper, in which there were several items of immediate interest to him.
     Would the match hold out at Lord's? If not, which was the best of the Wednesday
      <foreign>matinees?</foreign> Pocket had received a pound from home for his expenses, so that
     these questions took an adventitious precedence over even such attractive topics as an
     execution and a murder that bade fair to lead to one. But the horrors had their turn, and
     having supped on the newspaper supply, he continued the feast in <hi>Henry Dunbar,</hi> the
     novel he had brought with him in his bag. There was something like a murder! It was so exciting
     as to detach Pocket Upton from the flying buttercups and daisies, from the reek of the smoking
     carriage, the real crimes
     <pb n="8"/> in the paper, and all thoughts of London until he found himself there too soon. </p>
<p> The asthma specialist was one of those enterprising practitioners whose professional
     standing is never quite on a par with their material success. The injurious discrepancy may
     have spoilt his temper, or it may be that his temper was at the root of the prejudice against
     him. He was never very amiable with Pocket Upton, a casual patient in every sense; but this
     morning Dr. Bompas had some call to complain. </p>
<p> “You mean to tell me,” he expostulated, “that you've gone back to the cigarettes in spite of
     what I said last time? If you weren't a stupid schoolboy I should throw up your case!” </p>
<p> Pocket did not wish to have his case thrown up; it would mean no more days and nights in
     town. So he accepted his rebuke without visible resentment. </p>
<p> “It's the only way I can stop an attack,” he mumbled. </p>
<p> “Nonsense!” snapped the specialist. “You can make yourself coffee in the night, as you've
     done before.” </p>
<p> “I can't at school. They draw the line at that.” </p>
<p> “Then a public school is no place for you. I've said so from the first. Your people should
     have listened to me, and sent you on a long sea voyage
     <pb n="9"/> under the man I recommended, in the ship I told them about. She sails the day after
     to-morrow, and you should have sailed in her.” </p>
<p> The patient made no remark; but he felt as sore as his physician on the subject of that long
     sea voyage. It would have meant a premature end to his undistinguished schooldays, and goodbye
     to all thought of following in his brothers' steps on the field of schoolboy glory. But he
     might have had adventures beyond the pale of that circumscribed arena, he might have been
     shipwrecked on a desert island, and lived to tell a tale beyond the dreams of envious athletes,
     if his people had but taken kindly to the scheme. But they had been so very far from taking to
     it at all, with the single exception of his only sister, that the boy had not the heart to
     discuss it now. </p>
<p> “If only there were some medicine one could take to stop an attack!” he sighed. “But there
     doesn't seem to be any.” </p>
<p> “There are plenty of preventives,” returned the doctor. “That's what we want. Smoking and
     inhaling all sorts of rubbish is merely a palliative that does more harm than good in the long
     run.” </p>
<p> “But it does you good when the preventives fail. If I could get a good night without smoking
     I should be thankful.” </p>
<p>
<pb n="10"/> “If I promise you a good night will you give me your cigarettes to keep until
     to-morrow?” </p>
<p> “If you like.” </p>
<p> The doctor wrote a prescription while the boy produced the cardboard box from his bag. </p>
<p> “Thank you,” said Bompas, as they made an exchange. “I don't want you even to be tempted to
     smoke to-night, because I know what the temptation must be when you can't get your breath. You
     will get this prescription made up in two bottles; take the first before you go to bed
     to-night, and the second if you wake with an attack before five in the morning. You say you are
     staying the night with friends; better give me the name and let me see if they're on the
     telephone before you go. I want you to go to bed early, tell them not to call you in the
     morning, and come back to me the moment you've had your breakfast.” </p>
<p> They parted amicably after all, and Pocket went off only wondering whether he ought to have
     said positively that he was staying with friends when he might be going back to school. But Dr.
     Bompas had been so short with him at first as to discourage unnecessary explanations; besides,
     there could be no question of his going back that night. And the difficulty of the morning,
     which he had quite forgotten in the train, was not allowed to mar a moment of his day in town. </p>
<p>
<pb n="11"/> The time-table of that boy's day must speak for itself. It was already one
     o'clock, and he was naturally hungry, especially after the way his breakfast had been spoilt by
     Coverley's card. At 1.15 he was munching a sausage roll and sipping chocolate at a
     pastry-cook's in Oxford Street. The sausage roll, like the cup of chocolate, was soon followed
     by another; and a big Bath bun completed a debauch of which Dr. Bompas would undoubtedly have
     disapproved. </p>
<p> At 1.45, from the top of an Atlas omnibus in Baker Street, he espied a placard with
     “Collapse of Middlesex” in appalling capitals. And at the station he got down to learn the
     worst before going on to Lord's for nothing. </p>
<p> The worst was so hopelessly bad that Pocket wished himself nearer the theatres, and then it
     was that the terra-cotta pile of Madame Tussaud's thrust itself seductively upon his vision. He
     had not been there for years. He had often wanted to go again, and go alone. He remembered
     being taken by his sister when a little boy at Coverley's, but she had refused to go into the
     Chamber of Horrors, and he had been relieved at the time but sorry ever afterwards, because so
     many of the boys of those days had seen everything and seemed none the worse for the adventure.
     It was one of the things he had always wanted not so much to
     <pb n="12"/> do as to have done. The very name of the Chamber of Horrors had frozen his infant
     blood when he first heard it on the lips of a criminological governess. On the brink of
     seventeen there was something of the budding criminologist about Pocket Upton himself; had not
     a real murder and <hi>Henry Dunbar</hi> formed his staple reading in the train? And yet the boy
     had other sensibilities which made him hesitate outside the building, and enter eventually with
     quite a nutter under the waistcoat. </p>
<p> A band in fantastic livery was playing away in the marble hall; but Pocket had no ear for
     their music, though he was fond enough of a band. And though history was one of his few strong
     points at school, the glittering galaxy of kings and queens appealed to him no more than the
     great writers at their little desks and the great cricketers in their unconvincing flannels.
     They were waxworks one and all. But when the extra sixpence had been paid at the inner
     turnstile, and he had passed down a dungeon stair into the dim vaults below, his imagination
     was at work upon the dreadful faces in the docks before he had brought his catalogue to bear on
     one of them. </p>
<p> Here were wretches whose vile deeds had long been familiar to the schoolboy through a work
     on his father's shelves called <hi>Annals of Our Time.</hi> He recalled bad nights when certain
     of those annals
     <pb n="13"/> had kept him awake long after his attack; and here were the actual monsters, not
     scowling and ferocious as he had always pictured them, but far more horribly demure and plump.
     Here were immortal malefactors like the Mannings; here were Rush and Greenacre cheek by jowl,
     looking as though they had stepped out of Dickens in their obsolete raiment, looking anything
     but what they had been. Some wore the very clothes their quick bodies had filled; here and
     there were authentic tools of death, rusty pistols, phials of poison with the seals still
     bright, and a smug face smirking over all in self-conscious infamy. There was not enough of the
     waxwork about these creatures; in the poor light, and their own clothes, and the veritable dock
     in which many of them had heard their doom, they looked hideously human and alive. One, a
     little old man, sat not in the dock but on the drop itself, the noose dangling in front of him;
     and the schoolboy felt sorry for him, for his silver bristles, for the broad arrows on his poor
     legs, until he found out who it was. Then he shuddered. It was Charles Peace. He had first
     heard of Charles Peace from the nice governess aforesaid; and here under his nose were the old
     ruffian's revolver, and the strap that strapped it to his wrist, with the very spectacles he
     had wiped and worn. The hobbledehoy was almost as timorously
     <pb n="14"/> entranced as he had been in infancy by untimely tale of crime. He stood gloating
     over the gruesome relics, over ropes which had hanged men whose trials he had read for himself
     in later days, and yet wondering with it all whether he would ever get these things out of his
     mind again. They filled it to overflowing. He might have had the horrid place to himself. Yet
     he had entered it with much amusement at the heels of a whole family in deep mourning, a
     bereaved family drowning their sorrow in a sea of gore, their pilot through the catalogue a
     conscientious orphan with a monotonous voice and a genius for mis-pronunciation. Pocket had
     soon ceased to see or hear him or any other being not made of wax. And it was only when he was
     trying to place a nice-looking murderer in a straw hat, who suddenly moved into a real
     sightseer like himself, that the unwholesome spell was broken. </p>
<p> Pocket was not sorry to be back in the adulterated sunshine and the comparatively fresh air
     of the Marylebone Road. He was ashamed to find that it was after four o'clock. Guy and Vivian
     Knaggs would be home from Westminster in another hour. Still it was no use getting there before
     them, and he might as well walk as not; it was pleasant to rub shoulders with flesh and blood
     once more, and to look in faces not made of wax in the devil's image. His way, which he knew of
     old, would
     <pb n="15"/> naturally have led him past Miss Harbottle's door; but, as she was only to be his
     second string for the night, he preferred not to be seen by that old lady yet. Such was the
     tiny spring of an important action; it led the wanderer into Circus Road and a quite unforeseen
     temptation. </p>
<p> In the Circus Road there happens to be a highly respectable pawnbroker's shop; in the
     pawnbroker's window the chances are that you might still find a motley collection of umbrellas,
     mandolines, family Bibles, ornaments and clocks, strings of watches, trays of purses,
     opera-glasses, biscuit-boxes, photograph frames and cheap jewellery, all of which could not
     tempt you less than they did Pocket Upton the other June. There were only two things in the
     window that interested him at all, and they were not both temptations. One was an old rosewood
     camera, and Pocket was interested in cameras old and new; but the thing that tempted him was a
     little revolver at five-and-six, with what looked like a box of cartridges beside it,
     apparently thrown in for the price. A revolver to take back to school! A revolver to fire in
     picked places on the slow walks with a slow companion which were all the exercise this
     unfortunate fellow could take! A revolver and cartridges complete, so that one could try it
     now, in no time, with Guy and Vivian at the end of their garden in
     <pb n="16"/> St. John's Wood Park! And all very likely for five bob if one bargained a bit! </p>
<p> Pocket took out his purse and saw what a hole the expenditure of any such sum would make.
     But what was that if it filled a gap in his life? Of coure it would have been breaking a school
     rule, but he was prepared to take the consequences if found out; it need not involve his notion
     of dishonour. Still, it must be recorded that the young or old as was conscientious enough to
     hesitate before making his fatal plunge into the pawnbroker's shop. </p>
