<head>CHAPTER THE THIRD</head>
<head>The New Phase</head>
<milestone n="1" unit="subsection"/>
<p>In the course of the next six months the child of the
      <pb n="272"/> ages became an almost ordinary healthy baby, and Trafford began to think
      consecutively about his scientific work again—in the intervals of effort of a more immediately
      practical sort.</p>
<p>The recall of molecular physics and particularly of the internal condition of colloids to
      something like their old importance in his life was greatly accelerated by the fact that a
      young Oxford don named Behrens was showing extraordinary energy in what had been for a time
      Trafford's distinctive and undisputed field. Behrens was one of those vividly clever energetic
      people who are the despair of originative men. He had begun as Trafford's pupil and sedulous
      ape; he had gone on to work that imitated Trafford's in everything except its continual
      freshness, and now he was ransacking every scrap of suggestion to be found in Trafford's work,
      and developing it with an intensity of uninspired intelligence that most marvellously
      simulated originality. He was already being noted as an authority; sometimes in an article his
      name would be quoted and Trafford's omitted in relation to Trafford's ideas, and in every way
      his emergence and the manner of his emergence threatened and stimulated his model and master.
      A great effort had to be made. Trafford revived the drooping spirits of Durgan by a renewed
      punctuality in the laboratory. He began to stay away from home at night and work late again,
      now, however, under no imperative inspiration, but simply because it was
      <pb n="273"/> only by such an invasion of the evening and night that it would be possible to
      make headway against Behren's unremitting industry. And this new demand upon Trafford's
      already strained mental and nervous equipment began very speedily to have its effect upon his
      domestic life.</p>
<p>It is only in romantic fiction that a man can work strenuously to the limit of his power and
      come home to be sweet, sunny and entertaining. Trafford's preoccupation involved a certain
      negligence of Marjorie, a certain indisposition to be amused or interested by trifling things,
      a certain irritability....</p>
<milestone n="2" unit="subsection"/>
<p>And now, indeed, the Traffords were coming to the most difficult and fatal phase in
      marriage. They had had that taste of defiant adventure which is the crown of a spirited love
      affair, they had known the sweetness of a maiden passion for a maid, and they had felt all
      those rich and solemn emotions, those splendid fears and terrible hopes that weave themselves
      about the great partnership in parentage. And now, so far as sex was concerned, there might be
      much joy and delight still, but no more wonder, no fresh discoveries of incredible new worlds
      and unsuspected stars. Love, which had been a new garden, an unknown land, a sunlit sea to
      launch upon, was now a rich treasure-house of memories. And memories, although they afford a
      perpetually increasing enrichment to emotion, are not sufficient in themselves for the daily
      needs of life.</p>
<p>For this, indeed, is the truth of passionate love, that it works outs its purpose and comes
      to an end. A day arrives in every marriage when the lovers must face each other,
      disillusioned, stripped of the last
      <pb n="274"/> shred of excitement—undisguisedly themselves. And our two were married; they had
      bound themselves together under a penalty of scandalous disgrace, to take the life-long
      consequences of their passionate association.</p>
<p>It was upon Trafford that this exhaustion of the sustaining magic of love pressed most
      severely, because it was he who had made the greatest adaptations to the exigencies of their
      union. He had crippled, he perceived more and more clearly, the research work upon which his
      whole being had once been set, and his hours were full of tiresome and trivial duties and his
      mind engaged and worried by growing financial anxieties. He had made these abandonments in a
      phase of exalted passion for the one woman in the world and her unprecedented child, and now
      he saw, in spite of all his desire not to see, that she was just a weak human being among
      human beings, and neither she nor little Margharita so very marvellous.</p>
<p>But while Marjorie shrank to the dimensions of reality, research remained still a luminous
      and commanding dream. In love one fails or one wins home, but the lure of research is for ever
      beyond the hills, every victory is a new desire. Science has inexhaustibly fresh worlds to
      conquer....</p>
<p>He was beginning now to realize the dilemma of his life, the reality of the opposition
      between Marjorie and child and home on the one hand and on the other this big wider thing,
      this remoter, severer demand upon his being. He had long perceived these were distinct and
      different things, but now it appeared more and more inevitable that they should be
      antagonistic and mutually disregardful things. Each claimed him altogether, it seemed, and
      suffered compromise impatiently. And this is where the particular
      <pb n="275"/> stress of his situation came in. Hitherto he had believed that nothing of any
      importance was secret or inexplicable between himself and Marjorie. His ideal of his
      relationship had assumed a complete sympathy of feeling, an almost instinctive identity of
      outlook. And now it was manifest they were living in a state of inadequate understanding, that
      she knew only in the most general and opaque forms, the things that interested him so
      profoundly, and had but the most superficial interest in his impassioned curiosities. And
      missing as she did the strength of his intellectual purpose she missed too, she had no inkling
      of, the way in which her careless expansiveness pressed upon him. She was unaware that she was
      destroying an essential thing in his life.</p>
<p>He could not tell how far this antagonism was due to inalterable discords of character, how
      far it might not be an ineradicable sex difference, a necessary aspect of marriage. The talk
      of old Sir Roderick Dover at the Winton Club germinated in his mind, a branching and
      permeating suggestion. And then would come a phase of keen sympathy with Marjorie; she would
      say brilliant and penetrating things, display a swift cleverness that drove all these
      intimations of incurable divergence clean out of his head again. Then he would find
      explanations in the differences between his and Marjorie's training and early associations. He
      perceived his own upbringing had had a steadfastness and consistency that had been altogether
      lacking in hers. He had had the rare advantage of perfect honesty in the teaching and
      tradition of his home. There had never been any shams or sentimentalities for him to find out
      and abandon. From boyhood his mother's hand had pointed steadily to the search for truth as
      the supreme ennobling fact in life. She had never
      <pb n="276"/> preached this to him, never delivered discourses upon his father's virtues, but
      all her conversation and life was saturated with this idea. Compared with this atmosphere of
      high and sustained direction, the intellectual and moral quality of the Popes, he saw, was the
      quality of an agitated rag bag. They had thought nothing out, joined nothing together, they
      seemed to believe everything and nothing, they were neither religious nor irreligious, neither
      moral nor adventurous. In the place of a religion, and tainting their entire atmosphere, they
      had the decaying remains of a dead Anglicanism; it was clear they did not believe in its
      creed, and as clear that they did not want to get rid of it; it afforded them no guidance, but
      only vague pretensions, and the dismal exercises of Silas Root flourished in its shadows, a
      fungus, a post-mortem activity of the soul. None of them had any idea of what they were for or
      what their lives as a whole might mean; they had no standards, but only instincts and an
      instinctive fear of instincts; Pope wanted to be tremendously respected and complimented by
      everybody and get six per cent. for his money; Mrs. Pope wanted things to go smoothly; the
      young people had a general indisposition to do anything that might "look bad," and otherwise
      "have a good time." But neither Marjorie nor any of them had any test for a good time, and so
      they fluctuated in their conceptions of what they wanted from day to day. Now it was
      Plessingtonian standards, now Carmel standards, now the standards of Agatha Alimony; now it
      was a stimulating novel, now a gleam of æsthetic imaginativeness come, Heaven knows whence,
      that dominated her mood. He was beginning to understand all this at last, and to see the need
      of coherence in Marjorie's mood.</p>
<p>He realized the unfairness of keeping his thoughts
      <pb n="277"/> to himself, the need of putting his case before her, and making her realize
      their fatal and widening divergence. He wanted to infect her with his scientific passion, to
      give her his sense of the gravity of their practical difficulties. He would sit amidst his
      neglected work in his laboratory framing explanatory phrases. He would prepare the most lucid
      and complete statements, and go about with these in his mind for days waiting for an
      opportunity of saying what he felt so urgently had to be said.</p>
<p>But the things that seemed so luminous and effective in the laboratory had a curious way of
      fading and shrinking beside the bright colours of Marjorie's Bokhara hangings, in the presence
      of little Margharita pink and warm and entertaining in her bath, or amidst the fluttering
      rustle of the afternoon tea-parties that were now becoming frequent in his house. And when he
      was alone with her he discovered they didn't talk now any more—except in terms of a
      constrained and formal affection.</p>
<p>What had happened to them? What was the matter between himself and Marjorie that he couldn't
      even intimate his sense of their divergence? He would have liked to discuss the whole thing
      with his mother, but somehow that seemed disloyal to Marjorie....</p>
<p>One day they quarrelled.</p>
<p>He came in about six in the afternoon, jaded from the delivery of a suburban lecture, and
      the consequent tedium of suburban travel, and discovered Marjorie examining the effect of a
      new picture which had replaced the German print of sunlit waves over the dining-room
      mantelpiece. It was a painting in the post-impressionist manner, and it had arrived after the
      close of the exhibition in Weldon Street, at which Marjorie had bought it. She had bought it
      <pb n="278"/> in obedience to a sudden impulse, and its imminence had long weighed upon her
      conscience. She had gone to the show with Sydney Flor and old Mrs. Flor, Sydney's mother, and
      a kind of excitement had come upon them at the idea of possessing this particular picture.
      Mrs. Flor had already bought three Herbins, and her daughter wanted to dissuade her from more.
      "But they're so delightful," said Mrs. Flor. "You're overrunning your allowance," said Sydney.
      Disputing the point, they made inquiries for the price, and learnt that this bright epigram in
      colour was going begging—was even offered at a reduction from the catalogue price. A reduced
      price always had a strong appeal nowadays to Marjorie's mind. "If you don't get it," she said
      abruptly, "I shall."</p>
<p>The transition from that attitude to ownership was amazingly rapid. Then nothing remained
      but to wait for the picture. She had dreaded a mistake, a blundering discord, but now with the
      thing hung she could see her quick eye had not betrayed her. It was a mass of reds, browns,
      purples, and vivid greens and greys; an effect of roof and brick house facing upon a Dutch
      canal, and it lit up the room and was echoed and reflected by all the rest of her courageous
      colour scheme, like a coal-fire amidst mahogany and metal. It justified itself to her
      completely, and she faced her husband with a certain confidence.</p>
<p>"Hullo!" he cried.</p>
<p>"A new picture," she said. "What do you think of it?"</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"A town or something—never mind. Look at the colour. It heartens everything."</p>
<p>Trafford looked at the painting with a reluctant
      <pb n="279"/> admiration.</p>
<p>"It's brilliant—and impudent. He's an artist—whoever he is. He hits the thing. But—I say—how
      did you get it?"</p>
<p>"I bought it."</p>
<p>"Bought it! Good Lord! How much?"</p>
<p>"Oh! ten guineas," said Marjorie, with an affectation of ease; "it will be worth thirty in
      ten years' time."</p>
<p>Trafford's reply was to repeat: "Ten guineas!"</p>
<p>Their eyes met, and there was singularly little tenderness in their eyes.</p>
<p>"It was priced at thirteen," said Marjorie, ending a pause, and with a sinking heart.</p>
<p>Trafford had left her side. He walked to the window and sat down in a chair.</p>
<p>"I think this is too much," he said, and his voice had disagreeable notes in it she had
      never heard before. "I have just been earning two guineas at Croydon, of all places,
      administering comminuted science to fools—and here I find—this exploit! Ten guineas' worth of
      picture. To say we can't afford it is just to waste a mild expression. It's—mad extravagance.
      It's waste of money—it's—oh!—monstrous disloyalty. Disloyalty!" He stared resentful at the
      cheerful, unhesitating daubs of the picture for a moment. Its affected carelessness goaded him
      to fresh words. He spoke in a tone of absolute hostility. "I think this winds me up to
      something," he said. "You'll have to give up your cheque-book, Marjorie."</p>
<p>"Give up my cheque-book!"</p>
<p>He looked up at her and nodded. There was a warm flush in her cheeks, her lips panted apart,
      and tears of disappointment and vexation were shining beautifully in her eyes. She mingled the
      quality of an
      <pb n="280"/> indignant woman with the distress and unreasonable resentment of a child.</p>
<p>"Because I've bought this picture?"</p>
<p>"Can we go on like this?" he asked, and felt how miserably he had bungled in opening this
      question that had been in his mind so long.</p>
<p>"But it's <hi>beautiful!</hi>" she said.</p>
<p>He disregarded that. He felt now that he had to go on with these long-premeditated
      expostulations. He was tired and dusty from his third-class carriage, his spirit was tired and
      dusty, and he said what he had to say without either breadth or power, an undignified
      statement of personal grievances, a mere complaint of the burthen of work that falls upon a
      man. That she missed the high aim in him, and all sense of the greatness they were losing had
      vanished from his thoughts. He had too heavy a share of the common burthen, and she pressed
      upon him unthinkingly; that was all he could say. He girded at her with a bitter and loveless
      truth; it was none the less cruel that in her heart she knew these things he said were true.
      But he went beyond justice—as every quarrelling human being does; he called the things she had
      bought and the harmonies she had created, "this litter and rubbish for which I am wasting my
      life." That stabbed into her pride acutely and deeply. She knew anyhow that it wasn't so
      simple and crude as that. It was not mere witlessness she contributed to their trouble. She
      tried to indicate her sense of that. But she had no power of ordered reasoning, she made
      futile interruptions, she was inexpressive of anything but emotion, she felt gagged against
      his flow of indignant, hostile words. They blistered her.</p>
<p>Suddenly she went to her little desk in the corner,
      <pb n="281"/> unlocked it with trembling hands, snatched her cheque-book out of a heap of
      still unsettled bills, and having locked that anti-climax safe away again, turned upon him.
      "Here it is," she said, and stood poised for a moment. Then she flung down the little narrow
      grey cover—nearly empty, it was, of cheques, on the floor before him.</p>
<p>"Take it," she cried, "take it. I never asked you to give it me."</p>
<p>A memory of Orta and its reeds and sunshine and love rose like a luminous mist between
      them....</p>
<p>She ran weeping from the room.</p>
<p>He leapt to his feet as the door closed. "Marjorie!" he cried.</p>
<p>But she did not hear him....</p>
<milestone n="3" unit="subsection"/>
<p>The disillusionment about marriage which had discovered Trafford a thwarted, overworked, and
      worried man, had revealed Marjorie with time on her hands, superabundant imaginative energy,
      and no clear intimation of any occupation. With them, as with thousands of young couples in
      London to-day, the breadwinner was overworked, and the spending partner's duty was chiefly the
      negative one of not spending. You cannot consume your energies merely in not spending money.
      Do what she could, Marjorie could not contrive to make house and child fill the waking hours.
      She was far too active and irritable a being to be beneficial company all day for genial,
      bubble-blowing little Margharita; she could play with that young lady and lead her into
      ecstasies of excitement and delight, and she could see with an almost instinctive certainty
      when anything was going wrong; but for the rest that little life reposed far
      <pb n="282"/> more beneficially upon the passive acquiescence of May, her pink and wholesome
      nurse. And the household generally was in the hands of a trustworthy cook-general, who
      maintained a tolerable routine. Marjorie did not dare to have an idea about food or domestic
      arrangements; if she touched that routine so much as with her little finger it sent up the
      bills. She could knock off butcher and greengrocer and do every scrap of household work that
      she could touch, in a couple of hours a day. She tried to find some work to fill her leisure;
      she suggested to Trafford that she might help him by writing up his Science Notes from rough
      pencil memoranda, but when it became clear that the first step to her doing this would be the
      purchase of a Remington typewriter and a special low table to carry it, he became bluntly
      discouraging. She thought of literary work, and sat down one day to write a short story and
      earn guineas, and was surprised to find that she knew nothing of any sort of human being about
      whom she could invent a story. She tried a cheap subscription at Mudie's and novels, and they
      filled her with a thirst for events; she tried needlework, and found her best efforts
      aesthetically feeble and despicable, and that her mind prowled above the silks and colours
      like a hungry wolf.</p>
<p>The early afternoons were the worst time, from two to four, before calling began. The devil
      was given great power over Marjorie's early afternoon. She could even envy her former home
      life then, and reflect that there, at any rate, one had a chance of a game or a quarrel with
      Daffy or Syd or Rom or Theodore. She would pull herself together and go out for a walk, and
      whichever way she went there were shops and shops and shops, a glittering array of tempting
      opportunities for spending money.
      <pb n="283"/> Sometimes she would give way to spending exactly as a struggling drunkard
      decides to tipple. She would fix on some object, some object trivial and a little rare and not
      too costly, as being needed—when she knew perfectly well it wasn't needed—and choose the most
      remotest shops and display the exactest insistence upon her requirements. Sometimes she would
      get home from these raids without buying at all. After four the worst of the day was over; one
      could call on people or people might telephone and follow up with a call; and there was a
      chance of Trafford coming home....</p>
<p>One day at the Carmels' she found herself engaged in a vigorous flirtation with young
      Carmel. She hadn't noticed it coming on, but there she was in a windowseat talking quite
      closely to him. He said he was writing a play, a wonderful passionate play about St. Francis,
      and only she could inspire and advise him. Wasn't there some afternoon in the week when she
      sat and sewed, so that he might come and sit by her and read to her and talk to her? He made
      his request with a certain confidence, but it filled her with a righteous panic; she pulled
      him up with an abruptness that was almost inartistic. On her way home she was acutely ashamed
      of herself; this was the first time she had let any man but Trafford think he might be
      interesting to her, but once or twice on former occasions she had been on the verge of such
      provocative intimations. This sort of thing anyhow mustn't happen.</p>
<p>But if she didn't dress with any distinction—because of the cost—and didn't flirt and trail
      men in her wake, what was she to do at the afternoon gatherings which were now her chief form
      of social contact? What was going to bring people to her house? She knew that she was more
      than ordinarily beautiful
      <pb n="284"/> and that she could talk well, but that does not count for much if you are rather
      dowdy, and quite uneventfully virtuous.</p>
<p>It became the refrain of all her thoughts that she must find something to do.</p>
<p>There remained "Movements."</p>
<p>She might take up a movement. She was a rather exceptionally good public speaker. Only her
      elopement and marriage had prevented her being president of her college Debating Society. If
      she devoted herself to some movement she would be free to devise an ostentatiously simple
      dress for herself and stick to it, and she would be able to give her little house a
      significance of her own, and present herself publicly against what is perhaps quite the best
      of all backgrounds for a good-looking, clear-voiced, self-possessed woman, a platform. Yes;
      she had to go in for a Movement.</p>
<p>She reviewed the chief contemporary Movements much as she might have turned over dress
      fabrics in a draper's shop, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each....</p>
<p>London, of course, is always full of Movements. Essentially they are absorbents of
      superfluous feminine energy. They have a common flavour of progress and revolutionary purpose,
      and common features in abundant meetings, officials, and organization generally. Few are
      expensive, and still fewer produce any tangible results in the world. They direct themselves
      at the most various ends; the Poor, that favourite butt, either as a whole or in such typical
      sections as the indigent invalid or the indigent aged, the young, public health, the woman's
      cause, the prevention of animal food, anti-vivisection, the gratuitous advertisement of
      Shakespear (that neglected poet), novel but genteel modifications of medical or
      <pb n="285"/> religious practice, dress reform, the politer aspects of socialism, the
      encouragement of æronautics, universal military service, garden suburbs, domestic arts,
      proportional representation, duodecimal arithmetic, and the liberation of the drama. They
      range in size and importance from campaigns on a Plessingtonian scale to sober little
      intellectual Beckingham things that arrange to meet half-yearly, and die quietly before the
      second assembly. If Heaven by some miracle suddenly gave every Movement in London all it
      professed to want, our world would be standing on its head and everything would be extremely
      unfamiliar and disconcerting. But, as Mr. Roosevelt once remarked, the justifying thing about
      life is the effort and not the goal, and few Movements involve any real and impassioned
      struggle to get to the ostensible object. They exist as an occupation; they exercise the
      intellectual and moral activities without undue disturbance of the normal routines of life. In
      the days when everybody was bicycling an ingenious mechanism called Hacker's Home Bicycle used
      to be advertised. Hacker's Home Bicycle was a stand bearing small rubber wheels upon which one
      placed one's bicycle (properly equipped with a cyclometer) in such a way that it could be
      mounted and ridden without any sensible forward movement whatever. In bad weather, or when the
      state of the roads made cycling abroad disagreeable Hacker's Home Bicycle could be placed in
      front of an open window and ridden furiously for any length of time. Whenever the rider tired,
      he could descend—comfortably at home again—and examine the cyclometer to see how far he had
      been. In exactly the same way the ordinary London Movement gives scope for the restless and
      progressive impulse in human nature without the risk of personal entanglements
      <pb n="286"/> or any inconvenient disturbance of the milieu.</p>
<p>Marjorie considered the Movements about her. She surveyed the accessible aspects of
      socialism, but that old treasure-house of constructive suggestion had an effect like a rich
      château which had been stormed and looted by a mob. For a time the proposition that "we are
      all Socialists nowadays" had prevailed. The blackened and discredited frame remained, the
      contents were scattered; Aunt Plessington had a few pieces, the Tory Democrats had taken
      freely, the Liberals were in possession of a hastily compiled collection. There wasn't, she
      perceived, and there never had been a Socialist Movement; the socialist idea which had now
      become part of the general consciousness, had always been too big for polite domestication.
      She weighed Aunt Plessington, too, in the balance, and found her not so much wanting indeed as
      excessive. She felt that a Movement with Aunt Plessington in it couldn't possibly offer even
      elbow-room for anybody else. Philanthropy generally she shunned. The movements that aim at
      getting poor people into rooms and shouting at them in an improving, authoritative way,
      aroused an instinctive dislike in her. Her sense of humour, again, would not let her patronize
      Shakespear or the stage, or raise the artistic level of the country by means of green-dyed
      deal, and the influence of Trafford on her mind debarred her from attempting the physical and
      moral regeneration of humanity by means of beans and nut butter. It was indeed rather by the
      elimination of competing movements than by any positive preference that she found herself
      declining at last towards Agatha Alimony's section of the suffrage movement.... It was one of
      the less militant sections, but it held more meetings and passed more resolutions than any
      <pb n="287"/> two others.</p>
<p>One day Trafford, returning from an afternoon of forced and disappointing work in his
      laboratory,—his mind had been steadfastly sluggish and inelastic,—discovered Marjorie's dining
      room crowded with hats and all the rustle and colour which plays so large a part in
      constituting contemporary feminine personality. Buzard, the feminist writer, and a young man
      just down from Cambridge who had written a decadent poem, were the only men present. The
      chairs were arranged meeting-fashion, but a little irregularly to suggest informality; the
      post-impressionist picture was a rosy benediction on the gathering, and at a table in the
      window sat Mrs. Pope in the chair, looking quietly tactful in an unusually becoming bonnet,
      supported by her daughter and Agatha Alimony. Marjorie was in a simple gown of blueish-grey,
      hatless amidst a froth of foolish bows and feathers, and she looked not only beautiful and
      dignified but deliberately and conscientiously patient until she perceived the new arrival.
      Then he noted she was a little concerned for him, and made some futile sign he did not
      comprehend. The meeting was debating the behaviour of women at the approaching census, and a
      small, earnest, pale-faced lady with glasses was standing against the fireplace with a
      crumpled envelope covered with pencil notes in her hand, and making a speech. Trafford wanted
      his tea badly, but he had not the wit to realize that his study had been converted into a
      refreshment room for the occasion; he hesitated, and seated himself near the doorway, and so
      he was caught; he couldn't, he felt, get away and seem to slight a woman who was giving
      herself the pains of addressing him.</p>
<p>The small lady in glasses was giving a fancy picture
      <pb n="288"/> of the mind of Mr. Asquith and its attitude to the suffrage movement, and
      telling with a sort of inspired intimacy just how Mr. Asquith had hoped to "bully women down,"
      and just how their various attempts to bring home to him the eminent reasonableness of their
      sex by breaking his windows, interrupting his meetings, booing at him in the streets and
      threatening his life, had time after time baffled this arrogant hope. There had been many
      signs lately that Mr. Asquith's heart was failing him. Now here was a new thing to fill him
      with despair. When Mr. Asquith learnt that women refused to be counted in the census, then at
      least she was convinced he must give in. When he gave in it would not be long—she had her
      information upon good authority—before they got the Vote. So what they had to do was not to be
      counted in the census. That was their paramount duty at the present time. The women of England
      had to say quietly but firmly to the census man when he came round: "No, we don't count in an
      election, and we won't count now. Thank you." No one could force a woman to fill in a census
      paper she didn't want to, and for her own part, said the little woman with the glasses, she'd
      starve first. (Applause.) For her own part she was a householder with a census paper of her
      own, and across that she was going to write quite plainly and simply what she thought of Mr.
      Asquith. Some of those present wouldn't have census papers to fill up; they would be sent to
      the man, the so-called Head of the House. But the W.S.P.U. had foreseen that. Each householder
      had to write down the particulars of the people who slept in his house on Sunday night, or who
      arrived home before mid-day on Monday; the reply of the women of England must be not to sleep
      in a house that night where census papers were properly
      <pb n="289"/> filled, and not to go home until the following afternoon. All through that night
      the women of England must be abroad. She herself was prepared, and her house would be ready.
      There would be coffee and refreshments enough for an unlimited number of refugees, there would
      be twenty or thirty sofas and mattresses and piles of blankets for those who chose to sleep
      safe from all counting. In every quarter of London there would be houses of refuge like hers.
      And so they would make Mr. Asquith's census fail, as it deserved to fail, as every census
      would fail until women managed these affairs in a sensible way. For she supposed they were all
      agreed that only women could manage these things in a sensible way. That was <hi>her</hi>
      contribution to this great and important question. (Applause, amidst which the small lady with
      the glasses resumed her seat.)</p>
<p>Trafford glanced doorward, but before he could move another speaker was in possession of the
      room. This was a very young, tall, fair, round-shouldered girl who held herself with an
      unnatural rigidity, fixed her eyes on the floor just in front of the chairwoman, and spoke
      with knitted brows and an effect of extreme strain. She remarked that some people did not
      approve of this proposed boycott of the census. She hung silent for a moment, as if ransacking
      her mind for something mislaid, and then proceeded to remark that she proposed to occupy a few
      moments in answering that objection—if it could be called an objection. They said that
      spoiling the census was an illegitimate extension of the woman movement. Well, she
      objected—she objected fiercely—to every word of that phrase. Nothing was an illegitimate
      extension of the woman movement. Nothing could be. (Applause.) That was the very principle
      they had been fighting for all along. So that, examined
      <pb n="290"/> in this way, this so-called objection resolved itself into a mere question
      begging phrase. Nothing more. And her reply therefore to those who made it was that they were
      begging the question, and however well that might do for men, it would certainly not do, they
      would find, for women. (Applause.) For the freshly awakened consciousness of women. (Further
      applause.) This was a war in which quarter was neither asked nor given; if it were not so
      things might be different. She remained silent after that for the space of twenty seconds
      perhaps, and then remarked that that seemed to be all she had to say, and sat down amidst loud
      encouragement.</p>
<p>Then with a certain dismay Trafford saw his wife upon her feet. He was afraid of the effect
      upon himself of what she was going to say, but he need have had no reason for his fear.
      Marjorie was a seasoned debater, self-possessed, with a voice very well controlled and a
      complete mastery of that elaborate appearance of reasonableness which is so essential to good
      public speaking. She could speak far better than she could talk. And she startled the meeting
      in her opening sentence by declaring that she meant to stay at home on the census night, and
      supply her husband with every scrap of information he hadn't got already that might be needed
      to make the return an entirely perfect return. (Marked absence of applause.)</p>
<p>She proceeded to avow her passionate interest in the feminist movement of which this
      agitation for the vote was merely the symbol. (A voice: "No!") No one could be more aware of
      the falsity of woman's position at the present time than she was—she seemed to be speaking
      right across the room to Trafford—they were neither pets nor partners, but something between
      the two; now indulged like spoilt children,
      <pb n="291"/> now blamed like defaulting partners; constantly provoked to use the arts of
      their sex, constantly mischievous because of that provocation. She caught her breath and
      stopped for a moment, as if she had suddenly remembered the meeting intervening between
      herself and Trafford. No, she said, there was no more ardent feminist and suffragist than
      herself in the room. She wanted the vote and everything it implied with all her heart. With
      all her heart. But every way to get a thing wasn't the right way, and she felt with every
      fibre of her being that this petulant hostility to the census was a wrong way and an
      inconsistent way, and likely to be an unsuccessful way—one that would lose them the sympathy
      and help of just that class of men they should look to for support, the cultivated and
      scientific men. (A voice: "<hi>Do</hi> we want them?") What was the commonest charge made by
      the man in the street against women?—that they were unreasonable and unmanageable, that it was
      their way to get things by crying and making an irrelevant fuss. And here they were, as a
      body, doing that very thing! Let them think what the census and all that modern organization
      of vital statistics of which it was the central feature stood for. It stood for order, for the
      replacement of guesses and emotional generalization by a clear knowledge of facts, for the
      replacement of instinctive and violent methods, by which women had everything to lose (a
      voice: "No!") by reason and knowledge and self-restraint, by which women had everything to
      gain. To her the advancement of science, the progress of civilization, and the emancipation of
      womanhood were nearly synonymous terms. At any rate, they were different phases of one thing.
      They were different aspects of one wider purpose. When they struck at the census, she felt,
      they struck at
      <pb n="292"/> themselves. She glanced at Trafford as if she would convince him that this was
      the real voice of the suffrage movement, and sat down amidst a brief, polite applause, that
      warmed to rapture as Agatha Alimony, the deep-voiced, stirring Agatha, rose to reply.</p>
<p>Miss Alimony, who was wearing an enormous hat with three nodding ostrich feathers, a purple
      bow, a gold buckle and numerous minor ornaments of various origin and substance, said they had
      all of them listened with the greatest appreciation and sympathy to the speech of their
      hostess. Their hostess was a newcomer to the movement, she knew she might say this without
      offence, and was passing through a phase, an early phase, through which many of them had
      passed. This was the phase of trying to take a reasonable view of an unreasonable situation.
      (Applause.) Their hostess had spoken of science, and no doubt science was a great thing; but
      there was something greater than science, and that was the ideal. It was woman's place to
      idealize. Sooner or later their hostess would discover, as they had all discovered, that it
      was not to science but the ideal that women must look for freedom. Consider, she said, the
      scientific men of to-day. Consider, for example, Sir James Crichton-Browne, the physiologist.
      Was he on their side? On the contrary, he said the most unpleasant things about them on every
      occasion. He went out of his way to say them. Or consider Sir Almroth Wright, did he speak
      well of women? Or Sir Ray Lankester, the biologist, who was the chief ornament of the
      Anti-Suffrage Society. Or Sir Roderick Dover, the physicist, who—forgetting Madame Curie, a
      far more celebrated physicist than himself, she ventured to say (Applause.) had recently gone
      outside his province altogether to
      <pb n="293"/> abuse feminine research. There were your scientific men. Mrs. Trafford had said
      their anti-census campaign would annoy scientific men; well, under the circumstances, she
      wanted to annoy scientific men. (Applause.) She wanted to annoy everybody. Until women got the
      vote (loud applause) the more annoying they were the better. When the whole world was
      impressed by the idea that voteless women were an intolerable nuisance, then there would cease
      to be voteless women. (Enthusiasm.) Mr. Asquith had said—</p>
<p>And so on for quite a long time....</p>
<p>Buzard rose out of waves of subsiding emotion. Buzard was a slender, long-necked,
      stalk-shaped man with gilt glasses, uneasy movements and a hypersensitive manner. He didn't so
      much speak as thrill with thought vibrations; he spoke like an entranced but still quite
      gentlemanly sibyl. After Agatha's deep trumpet calls, he sounded like a solo on the piccolo.
      He picked out all his more important words with a little stress as though he gave them
      capitals. He said their hostess's remarks had set him thinking. He thought it was possible to
      stew the Scientific Argument in its own Juice. There was something he might call the
      Factuarial Estimate of Values. Well, it was a High Factuarial Value on their side, in his
      opinion at any rate, when Anthropologists came and told him that the Primitive Human Society
      was a Matriarchate. ("But it wasn't!" said Trafford to himself.) It had a High Factuarial
      Value when they assured him that Every One of the Great Primitive Inventions was made by a
      Woman, and that it was to Women they owed Fire and the early Epics and Sagas. ("Good Lord!"
      said Trafford.) It had a High Factuarial Value when they not only asserted but proved that for
      Thousands of Years, and perhaps
      <pb n="294"/> for Hundreds of Thousands of Years, Women had been in possession of Articulate
      Speech before men rose to that Level of Intelligence....</p>
<p>It occurred suddenly to Trafford that he could go now; that it would be better to go; that
      indeed he <hi>must</hi> go; it was no doubt necessary that his mind should have to work in the
      same world as Buzard's mental processes, but at any rate those two sets of unsympathetic
      functions need not go on in the same room. Something might give way. He got up, and with those
      elaborate efforts to be silent that lead to the violent upsetting of chairs, got himself out
      of the room and into the passage, and was at once rescued by the sympathetic cook-general, in
      her most generalized form, and given fresh tea in his study—which impressed him as being
      catastrophically disarranged....</p>
<milestone n="4" unit="subsection"/>
<p>When Marjorie was at last alone with him she found him in a state of extreme mental
      stimulation. "Your speech," he said, "was all right. I didn't know you could speak like that,
      Marjorie. But it soared like the dove above the waters. Waters! I never heard such a flood of
      rubbish.... You know, it's a mistake to <hi>mass</hi> women. It brings out something silly....
      It affected Buzard as badly as any one. The extraordinary thing is they have a case, if only
      they'd be quiet. Why did you get them together?"</p>
<p>"It's our local branch."</p>
<p>"Yes, but <hi>why?</hi>"</p>
<p>"Well, if they talk about things—Discussions like this clear up their minds."</p>
<p>"Discussion! It wasn't discussion."
      <pb n="295"/></p>
<p>"Oh! it was a beginning."</p>
<p>"Chatter of that sort isn't the beginning of discussion, it's the end. It's the
      death-rattle. Nobody was meeting the thoughts of any one. I admit Buzard, who's a man, talked
      the worst rubbish of all. That Primitive Matriarchate of his! So it isn't sex. I've noticed
      before that the men in this movement of yours are worse than the women. It isn't sex. It's
      something else. It's a foolishness. It's a sort of irresponsible looseness." He turned on her
      gravely. "You ought not to get all these people here. It's contagious. Before you know it
      you'll find your own mind liquefy and become enthusiastic and slop about. You'll begin to talk
      monomania about Mr. Asquith."</p>
<p>"But it's a great movement, Rag, even if incidentally they say and do silly things!"</p>
<p>"My dear! aren't I feminist? Don't I want women fine and sane and responsible? Don't I want
      them to have education, to handle things, to vote like men and bear themselves with the
      gravity of men? And these meetings—all hat and flutter! These displays of weak, untrained,
      hysterical vehemence! These gatherings of open-mouthed impressionable young girls to be
      trained in incoherence! You can't go on with it!"</p>
<p>Marjorie regarded him quietly for a moment. "I must go on with something," she said.</p>
<p>"Well, not this."</p>
<p>"Then <hi>what?</hi>"</p>
<p>"Something sane."</p>
<p>"Tell me what."</p>
<p>"It must come out of yourself."</p>
<p>Marjorie thought sullenly for a moment. "Nothing comes out of myself," she said.</p>
<p>"I don't think you realize a bit what my life has become," she went on; "how much I'm like
      some one
      <pb n="296"/> who's been put in a pleasant, high-class prison."</p>
<p>"This house! It's your own!"</p>
<p>"It doesn't give me an hour's mental occupation in the day. It's all very well to say I
      might do more in it. I can't—without absurdity. Or expenditure. I can't send the girl away and
      start scrubbing. I can't make jam or do ornamental needlework. The shops do it better and
      cheaper, and I haven't been trained to it. I've been trained <hi>not</hi> to do it. I've been
      brought up on games and school-books, and fed on mixed ideas. I can't sit down and pacify
      myself with a needle as women used to do. Besides, I not only detest doing needlework but I
      hate it—the sort of thing a woman of my kind does anyhow—when it's done. I'm no artist. I'm
      not sufficiently interested in outside things to spend my time in serious systematic reading,
      and after four or five novels—oh, these meetings are better than that! You see, you've got a
      life—too much of it—<hi>I</hi> haven't got enough. I wish almost I could sleep away half the
      day. Oh! I want something <hi>real</hi>, Rag; something more than I've got." A sudden
      inspiration came to her. "Will you let me come to your laboratory and work with you?"</p>
<p>She stopped abruptly. She caught up her own chance question and pointed it at him, a vitally
      important challenge. "Will you let me come to your laboratory and work?" she repeated.</p>
<p>Trafford thought. "No," he said.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because I'm in love with you. I can't think of my work when you're about.... And you're too
      much behind. Oh my dear! don't you see how you're behind?" He paused. "I've been soaking in
      this stuff of mine for ten long years."</p>
<p>"Yes," assented Marjorie flatly.</p>
<p>He watched her downcast face, and then it lifted
      <pb n="297"/> to him with a helpless appeal in her eyes, and lift in her voice. "But look
      here, Rag!" she cried—"what on earth am I to <hi>DO?</hi>"</p>
<milestone n="5" unit="subsection"/>
<p>At least there came out of these discussions one thing, a phrase, a purpose, which was to
      rule the lives of the Traffords for some years. It expressed their realization that instinct
      and impulse had so far played them false, that life for all its rich gifts of mutual happiness
      wasn't adjusted between them. "We've got," they said, "to talk all this out between us. We've
      got to work this out." They didn't mean to leave things at a misfit, and that was certainly
      their present relation. They were already at the problem of their joint lives, like a tailor
      with his pins and chalk. Marjorie hadn't rejected a humorist and all his works in order to
      decline at last to the humorous view of life, that rather stupid, rather pathetic,
      grin-and-bear-it attitude compounded in incalculable proportions of goodwill, evasion,
      indolence, slovenliness, and (nevertheless) spite (masquerading indeed as jesting comment),
      which supplies the fabric of everyday life for untold thousands of educated middle-class
      people. She hated the misfit. She didn't for a moment propose to pretend that the ungainly
      twisted sleeve, the puckered back, was extremely jolly and funny. She had married with a
      passionate anticipation of things fitting and fine, and it was her nature, in great matters as
      in small, to get what she wanted strenuously before she counted the cost. About both their
      minds there was something sharp and unrelenting, and if Marjorie had been disposed to take
      refuge from facts in swathings of aesthetic romanticism, whatever covering she contrived would
      have been torn to rags very speedily
      <pb n="298"/> by that fierce and steely veracity which swung down out of the laboratory into
      her home.</p>
<p>One may want to talk things out long before one hits upon the phrases that will open up the
      matter.</p>
<p>There were two chief facts in the case between them and so far they had looked only one in
      the face, the fact that Marjorie was unemployed to a troublesome and distressing extent, and
      that there was nothing in her nature or training to supply, and something in their
      circumstances and relations to prevent any adequate use of her energies. With the second fact
      neither of them cared to come to close quarters as yet, and neither as yet saw very distinctly
      how it was linked to the first, and that was the steady excess of her expenditure over their
      restricted means. She was secretly surprised at her own weakness. Week by week and month by
      month, they were spending all his income and eating into that little accumulation of capital
      that had once seemed so sufficient against the world....</p>
<p>And here it has to be told that although Trafford knew that Marjorie had been spending too
      much money, he still had no idea of just how much money she had spent. She was doing her
      utmost to come to an understanding with him, and at the same time—I don't explain it, I don't
      excuse it—she was keeping back her bills from him, keeping back urgent second and third and
      fourth demands, that she had no cheque-book now to stave off even by the most partial
      satisfaction. It kept her awake at nights, that catastrophic explanation, that all unsuspected
      by Trafford hung over their attempts at mutual elucidation; it kept her awake but she could
      not bring it to the speaking point, and she clung, in spite of her own intelligence, to a
      persuasion that <hi>after</hi> they had got something really settled and defined then it would
      be
      <pb n="299"/> time enough to broach the particulars of this second divergence....</p>
<p>Talking one's relations over isn't particularly easy between husband and wife at any time;
      we are none of us so sure of one another as to risk loose phrases or make experiments in
      expression in matters so vital; there is inevitably an excessive caution on the one hand and
      an abnormal sensitiveness to hints and implications on the other. Marjorie's bills were only
      an extreme instance of these unavoidable suppressions that always occur. Moreover, when two
      people are continuously together, it is amazingly hard to know when and where to begin; where
      intercourse is unbroken it is as a matter of routine being constantly interrupted. You cannot
      broach these broad personalities while you are getting up in the morning, or over the
      breakfast-table while you make the coffee, or when you meet again after a multitude of small
      events at tea, or in the evening when one is rather tired and trivial after the work of the
      day. Then Miss Margharita Trafford permitted no sustained analysis of life in her presence.
      She synthesized things fallaciously, but for the time convincingly; she insisted that life
      wasn't a thing you discussed, but pink and soft and jolly, which you crowed at and laughed at
      and addressed as "Goo." Even without Margharita there were occasions when the Traffords were a
      forgetfulness to one another. After an ear has been pinched or a hand has been run through a
      man's hair, or a pretty bare shoulder kissed, all sorts of broader interests lapse into a
      temporary oblivion. They found discussion much more possible when they walked together. A walk
      seemed to take them out of the everyday sequence, isolate them from their household, abstract
      them a little from one another. They set out one extravagant spring Sunday to Great Missenden,
      <pb n="300"/> and once in spring also they discovered the Waterlow Park. On each occasion they
      seemed to get through an enormous amount of talking. But the Great Missenden walk was all
      mixed up with a sweet keen wind, and beechwoods just shot with spring green and bursting
      hedges and the extreme earliness of honeysuckle, which Trafford noted for the first time, and
      a clamorous rejoicing of birds. And in the Waterlow Park there was a great discussion of why
      the yellow crocus comes before white and purple, and the closest examination of the manner in
      which daffodils and narcissi thrust their green noses out of the garden beds. Also they found
      the ugly, ill-served, aggressively propagandist non-alcoholic refreshment-room in that
      gracious old house a scandal and disappointment, and Trafford scolded at the stupidity of
      officialdom that can control so fine a thing so ill.</p>
<p>Though they talked on these walks they were still curiously evasive. Indeed, they were
      afraid of each other. They kept falling away from their private thoughts and intentions. They
      generalized, they discussed Marriage and George Gissing and Bernard Shaw and the suffrage
      movement and the agitation for the reform of the divorce laws. They pursued imaginary cases
      into distant thickets of contingency remotely far from the personal issues between
      them....</p>
<milestone n="6" unit="subsection"/>
<p>One day came an incident that Marjorie found wonderfully illuminating. Trafford had a fit of
      rage. Stung by an unexpected irritation, he forgot himself, as people say, and swore, and was
      almost physically violent, and the curious thing was that so he lit
      <pb n="301"/> up things for her as no premeditated attempt of his had ever done.</p>
<p>A copy of the <hi>Scientific Bulletin</hi> fired the explosion. He sat down at the
      breakfast-table with the heaviness of a rather overworked and worried man, tasted his coffee,
      tore open a letter and crumpled it with his hand, turned to the <hi>Bulletin</hi>, regarded
      its list of contents with a start, opened it, read for a minute, and expressed himself with an
      extraordinary heat of manner in these amazing and unprecedented words:</p>
<p>"Oh! Damnation and damnation!"</p>
<p>Then he shied the paper into the corner of the room and pushed his plate from him.</p>
<p>"Damn the whole scheme of things!" he said, and met the blank amazement of Marjorie's
      eye.</p>
<p>"Behrens!" he said with an air of explanation.</p>
<p>"Behrens?" she echoed with a note of inquiry.</p>
<p>"He's doing my stuff!"</p>
<p>He sat darkling for a time and then hit the table with his fist so hard that the breakfast
      things seemed to jump together—to Marjorie's infinite amazement. "I can't <hi>stand</hi> it!"
      he said.</p>
<p>She waited some moments. "I don't understand," she began. "What has he done?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" was Trafford's answer. He got up, recovered the crumpled paper and stood reading.
      "Fool and thief," he said.</p>
<p>Marjorie was amazed beyond measure. She felt as though she had been effaced from Trafford's
      life. "Ugh!" he cried and slapped back the <hi>Bulletin</hi> into the corner with quite
      needless violence. He became aware of Marjorie again.</p>
<p>"He's doing my work," he said.</p>
<p>And then as if he completed the explanation:
      <pb n="302"/> "And I've got to be in Croydon by half-past ten to lecture to a pack of
      spinsters and duffers, because they're too stupid to get the stuff from books. It's all in
      books,—every bit of it."</p>
<p>He paused and went on in tones of unendurable wrong. "It isn't as though he was doing it
      right. He isn't. He can't. He's a fool. He's a clever, greedy, dishonest fool with a twist.
      Oh! the pile, the big Pile of silly muddled technicalities he's invented already! The solemn
      mess he's making of it! And there he is, I can't get ahead of him, I can't get at him. I've
      got no time. I've got no room or leisure to swing my mind in! Oh, curse these engagements,
      curse all these silly fretting entanglements of lecture and article! I never get the time, I
      can't get the time, I can't get my mind clear! I'm worried! I'm badgered! And meanwhile
      Behrens——!"</p>
<p>"Is he discovering what you want to discover?"</p>
<p>"Behrens! <hi>No!</hi> He's going through the breaches I made. He's guessing out what I
      meant to do. And he's getting it set out all wrong,—misleading terminology,—distinctions made
      in the wrong place. Oh, the fool he is!"</p>
<p>"But afterwards——"</p>
<p>"Afterwards I may spend my life—removing the obstacles he's made. He'll be established and I
      shan't. You don't know anything of these things. You don't understand."</p>
<p>She didn't. Her next question showed as much. "Will it affect your F.R.S.?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Oh! <hi>that's</hi> safe enough, and it doesn't matter anyhow. The F.R.S.! Confound the
      silly little F.R.S.! As if that mattered. It's seeing all my great openings—misused. It's
      seeing all I might be doing. This brings it all home to me. Don't you understand, Marjorie?
      Will you never understand? I'm getting
      <pb n="303"/> away from all <hi>that!</hi> I'm being hustled away by all this work, this silly
      everyday work to get money. Don't you see that unless I can have time for thought and
      research, life is just darkness to me? I've made myself master of that stuff. I had at any
      rate. No one can do what I can do there. And when I find myself—oh, shut out, shut out! I come
      near raving. As I think of it I want to rave again." He paused. Then with a swift transition:
      "I suppose I'd better eat some breakfast. Is that egg boiled?"</p>
<p>She gave him an egg, brought his coffee, put things before him, seated herself at the table.
      For a little while he ate in silence. Then he cursed Behrens.</p>
<p>"Look here!" she said. "Bad as I am, you've got to reason with me, Rag. I didn't know all
      this. I didn't understand... I don't know what to do."</p>
<p>"What <hi>is</hi> there to do?"</p>
<p>"I've got to do something. I'm beginning to see things. It's just as though everything had
      become clear suddenly." She was weeping. "Oh, my dear! I want to help you. I have so wanted to
      help you. Always. And it's come to this!"</p>
<p>"But it's not <hi>your</hi> fault. I didn't mean that. It's—it's in the nature of
      things."</p>
<p>"It's my fault."</p>
<p>"It's not your fault."</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>"Confound it, Marjorie. When I swear at Behrens I'm not swearing at you."</p>
<p>"It's my fault. All this is my fault. I'm eating you up. What's the good of your pretending,
      Rag. You know it is. Oh! When I married you I meant to make you happy, I had no thought but to
      make you happy, to give myself to you, my body, my brains, everything, to make life beautiful
      for you——"</p>
<p>"Well, <hi>haven't</hi> you?" He thrust out a hand she
      <pb n="304"/> did not take.</p>
<p>"I've broken your back," she said.</p>
<p>An unwonted resolution came into her face. Her lips whitened. "Don't you know, Rag," she
      said, forcing herself to speak——"Don't you guess? You don't know half! In that bureau
      there——In there! It's stuffed with bills. Unpaid bills."</p>
<p>She was weeping, with no attempt to wipe the streaming tears away; terror made the
      expression of her wet face almost fierce. "Bills," she repeated. "More than a hundred pounds
      still. Yes! Now. <hi>Now!</hi>"</p>
<p>He drew back, stared at her and with no trace of personal animus, like one who hears of a
      common disaster, remarked with a quiet emphasis: "Oh, <hi>damn!</hi>"</p>
<p>"I know," she said, "Damn!" and met his eyes. There was a long silence between them. She
      produced a handkerchief and wiped her eyes. "That's what I amount to," she said.</p>
<p>"It's your silly upbringing," he said after a long pause.</p>
<p>"And my silly self."</p>
<p>She stood up, unlocked and opened her littered desk, turned and held out the key to him.</p>
<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Take it. You gave me a cheque-book of my own and a corner of my own, and they—they are just
      ambushes—against you."</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"Take it," said Marjorie with quiet insistence.</p>
<p>He obeyed. She stood with her eyes on the crumpled heap of bills. They were not even tidily
      arranged. That seemed to her now an extreme aggravation of her offence.</p>
<p>"I ought to be sent to the chemist's," she remarked,
      <pb n="305"/> "as one sends a worthless cat."</p>
<p>Trafford weighed this proposition soberly for some moments. "You're a bother, Marjorie," he
      said with his eyes on the desk; "no end of a bother. I'd better have those bills."</p>
<p>He looked at her, stood up, put his hands on her shoulders, drew her to him and kissed her
      forehead. He did it without passion, without tenderness, with something like resignation in
      his manner. She clung to him tightly, as though by clinging she could warm and soften him.</p>
<p>"Rag," she whispered; "all my heart is yours.... I want to help you.... And this is what I
      have done."</p>
<p>"I know," he said—almost grimly.</p>
<p>He repeated his kiss.</p>
<p>Then he seemed to explode again. "Gods!" he cried, "look at the clock. I shall miss that
      Croydon lecture!" He pushed her from him. "Where are my boots?..."</p>
<milestone n="7" unit="subsection"/>
<p>Marjorie spent the forenoon and the earlier part of the afternoon repeating and reviewing
      this conversation. Her mind was full of the long disregarded problem of her husband's state of
      mind. She thought with a sympathetic astonishment of his swearing, of his startling blow upon
      the table. She hadn't so far known he could swear. But this was the real thing, the relief of
      vehement and destructive words. His voice, saying "damnation and damnation," echoed and
      re-echoed in her ears. Somehow she understood that as she had never understood any sober
      statement of his case. Such women as Marjorie, I think, have an altogether keener
      understanding of people who have lost control of themselves than they
      <pb n="306"/> have of reasoned cases. Perhaps that is because they themselves always reserve
      something when they state a reasoned case.</p>
<p>She went on to the apprehension of a change in him that hitherto she had not permitted
      herself to see—a change in his attitude to her. There had been a time when she had seemed able
      without an effort to nestle inside his heart. Now she felt distinctly for the first time that
      that hadn't happened. She had instead a sense of her embrace sliding over a rather
      deliberately contracted exterior.... Of course he had been in a hurry....</p>
<p>She tried to follow him on his journey to Croydon. Now he'd have just passed out of London
      Bridge. What was he thinking and feeling about her in the train? Now he would be going into
      the place, wherever it was, where he gave his lecture. Did he think of Behrens and curse her
      under his breath as he entered that tiresome room?...</p>
<p>It seemed part of the prevailing inconvenience of life that Daffy should see fit to pay an
      afternoon call.</p>
<p>Marjorie heard the sobs and uproar of an arrested motor, and glanced discreetly from the
      window to discover the dark green car with its green-clad chauffeur which now adorned her
      sister's life, and which might under different circumstances, have adorned her own.
      Wilkins—his name was Wilkins, his hair was sandy and his expression discreet, and he afforded
      material for much quiet humorous observation—descended smartly and opened the door. Daffy
      appeared in black velvet, with a huge black fur muff, and an air of being unaware that there
      were such things as windows in the world.</p>
<p>It was just four, and the cook-general, who ought to have been now in her housemaid's phase,
      was still upstairs divesting herself of her more culinary characteristics.
      <pb n="307"/> Marjorie opened the door.</p>
<p>"Hullo, old Daffy!" she said.</p>
<p>"Hullo, old Madge!" and there was an exchange of sisterly kisses and a mutual
      inspection.</p>
<p>"Nothing wrong?" asked Daffy, surveying her.</p>
<p>"<hi>Wrong?</hi>"</p>
<p>"You look pale and—tired about the eyes," said Daffy, leading the way into the drawing-room.
      "Thought you might be a bit off it, that's all. No offence, Madge."</p>
<p>"I'm all right," said Marjorie, getting her back to the light. "Want a holiday, perhaps.
      How's every one?"</p>
<p>"All right. <hi>We're</hi> off to Lake Garda next week. This new play has taken it out of
      Will tremendously. He wants a rest and fresh surroundings. It's to be the biggest piece of
      work he's done—so far, and it's straining him. And people worry him here; receptions, first
      nights, dinners, speeches. He's so neat, you know, in his speeches.... But it wastes him. He
      wants to get away. How's Rag?"</p>
<p>"Busy."</p>
<p>"Lecturing?"</p>
<p>"And his Research of course."</p>
<p>"Oh! of course. How's the Babe?"</p>
<p>"Just in. Come up and see the little beast, Daffy! It is getting so pretty, and it
      talks——"</p>
<p>Margharita dominated intercourse for a time. She was one of those tactful infants who
      exactly resemble their fathers and exactly resemble their mothers, and have a charm and
      individuality quite distinctly their own, and she was now beginning to converse with startling
      enterprise and intelligence.</p>
<p>"Big, big, bog," she said at the sight of Daffy.</p>
<p>"Remembers you," said Marjorie.</p>
<p>"Bog! Go ta-ta!" said Margharita.
      <pb n="308"/></p>
<p>"There!" said Marjorie, and May, the nurse in the background, smiled unlimited
      appreciation.</p>
<p>"Bably," said Margharita.</p>
<p>"That's herself!" said Marjorie, falling on her knees. "She talks like this all day. Oh de
      sweetums, den!" <hi>Was</hi> it?</p>
<p>Daffy made amiable gestures and canary-like noises with her lips, and Margharita responded
      jovially.</p>
<p>"You darling!" cried Marjorie, "you delight of life," kneeling by the cot and giving the
      crowing, healthy little mite a passionate hug.</p>
<p>"It's really the nicest of babies," Daffy conceded, and reflected....</p>
<p>"I don't know what I should do with a kiddy," said Daffy, as the infant worship came to an
      end; "I'm really glad we haven't one—yet. He'd love it, I know. But it would be a burthen in
      some ways. They <hi>are</hi> a tie. As he says, the next few years means so much for him. Of
      course, here his reputation is immense, and he's known in Germany, and there are translations
      into Russian; but he's still got to conquer America, and he isn't really well known yet in
      France. They read him, of course, and buy him in America, but they're—<hi>restive</hi>. Oh! I
      do so wish they'd give him the Nobel prize, Madge, and have done with it! It would settle
      everything. Still, as he says, we mustn't think of that—yet, anyhow. He isn't venerable
      enough. It's doubtful, he thinks, that they would give the Nobel prize to any humorist now
      that Mark Twain is dead. Mark Twain was different, you see, because of the German Emperor and
      all that white hair and everything."</p>
<p>At this point Margharita discovered that the conversation had drifted away from herself, and
      it was only when they got downstairs again that Daffy
      <pb n="309"/> could resume the thread of Magnet's career, which had evidently become the
      predominant interest in her life. She brought out all the worst elements of Marjorie's nature
      and their sisterly relationship. There were moments when it became nakedly apparent that she
      was magnifying Magnet to belittle Trafford. Marjorie did her best to counter-brag. She played
      her chief card in the F. R. S.</p>
<p>"They always ask Will to the Royal Society Dinner," threw out Daffy; "but of course he can't
      always go. He's asked to so many things."</p>
<p>Five years earlier Marjorie would have kicked her shins for that.</p>
<p>Instead she asked pointedly, offensively, if Magnet was any balder.</p>
<p>"He's not really bald," said Daffy unruffled, and went on to discuss the advisability of a
      second motor car—purely for town use. "I tell him I don't want it," said Daffy, "but he's
      frightfully keen upon getting one."</p>
<milestone n="8" unit="subsection"/>
<p>When Daffy had at last gone Marjorie went back into Trafford's study and stood on the
      hearthrug regarding its appointments, with something of the air of one who awakens from a
      dream. She had developed a new, appalling thought. Was Daffy really a better wife than
      herself? It was dawning upon Marjorie that she hadn't been doing the right thing by her
      husband, and she was as surprised as if it had been suddenly brought home to her that she was
      neglecting Margharita. This was her husband's study—and it showed just a little dusty in the
      afternoon sunshine, and everything about it denied the pretensions of serene sustained work
      that she had always made to herself. Here were the crumpled galley proofs of his
      <pb n="310"/> science notes; here were unanswered letters. There, she dare not touch them,
      were computations, under a glass paper-weight. What did they amount to now? On the table under
      the window were back numbers of the <hi>Scientific Bulletin</hi> in a rather untidy pile, and
      on the footstool by the arm-chair she had been accustomed to sit at his feet when he stayed at
      home to work, and look into the fire, and watch him furtively, and sometimes give way to an
      overmastering tenderness and make love to him. The thought of Magnet, pampered, fenced around,
      revered in his industrious tiresome repetitions, variations, dramatizations and so forth of
      the half-dozen dry little old jokes which the British public accepted as his characteristic
      offering and rewarded him for so highly, contrasted vividly with her new realization of
      Trafford's thankless work and worried face.</p>
<p>And she loved him, she loved him—<hi>so</hi>. She told herself in the presence of all these
      facts, and without a shadow of doubt in her mind that all she wanted in the world was to make
      him happy.</p>
<p>It occurred to her as a rather drastic means to this end that she might commit suicide.</p>
<p>She had already gone some way in the composition of a touching letter of farewell to him,
      containing a luminous analysis of her own defects, before her common-sense swept away this
      imaginative exercise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as if it had been working at her problem all the time that this exciting farewell
      epistle had occupied the foreground of her thoughts, her natural lucidity emerged with the
      manifest conclusion that she had to alter her way of living. She had been extraordinarily
      regardless of him, she only began to see that, and now she had to take up the problem of his
      necessities. Her self-examination now that it had begun was thorough. She had always told
      herself
      <pb n="311"/> before that she had made a most wonderful and beautiful little home for him. But
      had she made it for him? Had he as a matter of fact ever wanted it, except that he was glad to
      have it through her? No doubt it had given him delight and happiness, it had been a marvellous
      little casket of love for them, but how far did that outweigh the burthen and limitation it
      had imposed upon him? She had always assumed he was beyond measure grateful to her for his
      home, in spite of all her bills, but was he? It was like sticking a knife into herself to ask
      that, but she was now in a phase heroic enough for the task—was he? She had always seen
      herself as the giver of bounties; greatest bounty of all was Margharita. She had faced pains
      and terrors and the shadow of death to give him Margharita. Now with Daffy's illuminating
      conversation in her mind, she could turn the light upon a haunting doubt that had been lurking
      in the darkness for a long time. Had he really so greatly wanted Margharita? Had she ever
      troubled to get to the bottom of that before? Hadn't she as a matter of fact wanted Margharita
      ten thousand times more than he had done? Hadn't she in effect imposed Margharita upon him, as
      she had imposed her distinctive and delightful home upon him, regardlessly, because these
      things were the natural and legitimate developments of herself?</p>
<p>These things were not his ends.</p>
<p>Had she hitherto ever really cared what his ends might be?</p>
<p>A phrase she had heard abundantly enough in current feminist discussion recurred to her
      mind, "the economic dependence of women," and now for the first time it was charged with
      meaning. She had imposed these things upon him not because she loved him, but because these
      things that were the expansions
      <pb n="312"/> and consequences of her love for him were only obtainable through him. A woman
      gives herself to a man out of love, and remains clinging parasitically to him out of
      necessity. Was there no way of evading that necessity?</p>
<p>For a time she entertained dreams of marvellous social reconstructions. Suppose the
      community kept all its women, suppose all property in homes and furnishings and children
      vested in them! That was Marjorie's version of that idea of the Endowment of Womanhood which
      has been creeping into contemporary thought during the last two decades. Then every woman
      would be a Princess to the man she loved.... He became more definitely personal. Suppose she
      herself was rich, then she could play the Princess to Trafford; she could have him free,
      unencumbered, happy and her lover! Then, indeed, her gifts would be gifts, and all her
      instincts and motives would but crown his unhampered life! She could not go on from that idea,
      she lapsed into a golden reverie, from which she was roused by the clock striking five.</p>
<p>In half an hour perhaps Trafford would be home again. She could at least be so much of a
      princess as to make his home sweet for his home-coming. There should be tea in here, where
      callers did not trouble. She glanced at an empty copper vase. It ached. There was no light in
      the room. There would be just time to dash out into High Street and buy some flowers for it
      before he came....</p>
<milestone n="9" unit="subsection"/>
<p>Spring and a renewed and deepened love for her husband were in Marjorie's blood. Her mind
      worked rapidly during the next few days, and presently she found herself clearly decided upon
      her course of
      <pb n="313"/> action. She had to pull herself together and help him, and if that meant a
      Spartan and strenuous way of living, then manifestly she must be Spartan and strenuous. She
      must put an end once for all to her recurrent domestic deficits, and since this could only be
      done by getting rid of May, she must get rid of May and mind the child herself. (Every day,
      thank Heaven! Margharita became more intelligent, more manageable, and more interesting.) Then
      she must also make a far more systematic and thorough study of domestic economy than she had
      hitherto done, and run the shopping and housekeeping on severer lines; she bought fruit
      carelessly, they had far too many joints; she never seemed able to restrain herself when it
      came to flowers. And in the evenings, which would necessarily be very frequently lonely
      evenings if Trafford's researches were to go on, she would typewrite, and either acquire great
      speed at that or learn shorthand, and so save Trafford's present expenditure on a typist. That
      unfortunately would mean buying a typewriter.</p>
<p>She found one afternoon in a twopenny book-box, with which she was trying to allay her
      craving for purchases, a tattered little pamphlet entitled: "Proposals for the Establishment
      of an Order of Samurai," which fell in very exactly with her mood. The title "dated"; it
      carried her mind back to her middle girlhood and the defeats of Kuropatki and the futile
      earnest phase in English thought which followed the Boer War. The order was to be a sort of
      self-appointed nobility serving the world. It shone with the light of a generous dawn, but
      cast, I fear, the shadow of the prig. Its end was the Agenda Club.... She read and ceased to
      read—and dreamt.</p>
<p>The project unfolded the picture of a new method
      <pb n="314"/> of conduct to her, austere, yet picturesque and richly noble. These Samurai, it
      was intimated, were to lead lives of hard discipline and high effort, under self-imposed rule
      and restraint. They were to stand a little apart from the excitements and temptations of
      everyday life, to eat sparingly, drink water, resort greatly to self-criticism and
      self-examination, and harden their spirits by severe and dangerous exercises. They were to
      dress simply, work hard, and be the conscious and deliberate salt of the world. They were to
      walk among mountains. Incidentally, great power was to be given them. Such systematic effort
      and self-control as this, seemed to Marjorie to give just all she wasn't and needed to be, to
      save her life and Trafford's from a common disaster....</p>
<p>It particularly appealed to her that they were to walk among mountains....</p>
<p>But it is hard to make a change in the colour of one's life amidst the routine one has
      already established about oneself, in the house that is grooved by one's weaknesses, amidst
      hangings and ornaments living and breathing with the life of an antagonistic and yet
      insidiously congenial ideal. A great desire came upon Marjorie to go away with Trafford for a
      time, out of their everyday life into strange and cool and spacious surroundings. She wanted
      to leave London and its shops, and the home and the movements and the callers and rivalries,
      and even dimpled little Margharita's insistent claims, and get free and think. It was the
      first invasion of their lives by this conception, a conception that was ever afterwards to
      leave them altogether, of retreat and reconstruction. She knelt upon the white sheepskin
      hearthrug at Trafford's feet one night, and told him of her desire. He, too, was tired of his
      work and his vexations, and ripe for this suggestion of an altered life. The Easter
      <pb n="315"/> holiday was approaching, and nearly twenty unencumbered days. Mrs. Trafford,
      they knew, would come into the house, meanwhile, and care for Margharita. They would go away
      somewhere together and walk, no luggage but a couple of knapsacks, no hotel but some homely
      village inn. They would be in the air all day, until they were saturated with sweet air and
      spirit of clean restraints. They would plan out their new rule, concentrate their aims. "And I
      could think," said Trafford, "of this new work I can't begin here. I might make some notes."
      Presently came the question of where the great walk should be. Manifestly, it must be among
      mountains, manifestly, and Marjorie's eye saw those mountains with snow upon their summits and
      cold glaciers on their flanks. Could they get to Switzerland? If they travelled second class
      throughout, and took the cheaper way, as Samurai should?...</p>
<milestone n="10" unit="subsection"/>
<p>That holiday seemed to Marjorie as if they had found a lost and forgotten piece of
      honeymoon. She had that same sense of fresh beginnings that had made their first walk in
      Italian Switzerland so unforgettable. She was filled with the happiness of recovering Trafford
      when he had seemed to be slipping from her. All day they talked of their outlook, and how they
      might economise away the need of his extra work, and so release him for his search again. For
      the first time he talked of his work to her, and gave her some intimation of its scope and
      quality. He became enthusiastic with the sudden invention of experimental devices, so that it
      seemed to her almost worth while if instead of going on they bolted back, he to his laboratory
      and she to her nursery, and so at once inaugurated
      <pb n="316"/> the new régime. But they went on, to finish the holiday out. And the delight of
      being together again with unfettered hours of association! They rediscovered each other, the
      same—and a little changed. If their emotions were less bright and intense, their interest was
      far wider and deeper.</p>
<p>The season was too early for high passes, and the weather was changeable. They started from
      Fribourg and walked to Thun and then back to Bulle, and so to Bultigen, Saanen, Montbovon and
      the Lake of Geneva. They had rain several days, the sweet, soft, windless mountain rain that
      seemed so tolerable to those who are accustomed to the hard and driven downpours of England,
      and in places they found mud and receding snow; the inns were at their homeliest, and none the
      worse for that, and there were days of spring sunshine when a multitude of minute and
      delightful flowers came out as it seemed to meet them—it was impossible to suppose so great a
      concourse universal—and spread in a scented carpet before their straying feet. The fruit trees
      in the valleys were powdered with blossom, and the new grass seemed rather green-tinted
      sunlight than merely green. And they walked with a sort of stout leisureliness, knapsacks
      well-hung and cloaks about them, with their faces fresh and bright under the bracing weather,
      and their lungs deep charged with mountain air, talking of the new austerer life that was now
      beginning. With great snow-capped mountains in the background, streaming precipices overhead,
      and a sward of flowers to go upon, that strenuous prospect was altogether delightful. They
      went as it pleased them, making detours into valleys, coming back upon their steps. The
      interludes of hot, bright April sunshine made them indolent, and they would loiter and halt
      where some rock or wall invited, and sit basking like
      <pb n="317"/> happy, animals, talking very little, for long hours together. Trafford seemed to
      have forgotten all the strain and disappointment of the past two years, to be amazed but in no
      wise incredulous at this enormous change in her and in their outlook; it filled her with a
      passion of pride and high resolve to think that so she could recover and uplift him.</p>
<p>He was now very deeply in love with her again. He talked indeed of his research, but so that
      it might interest her, and when he thought alone, he thought, not of it, but of her, making
      again the old discoveries, his intense delight in the quality of her voice, his joy in a
      certain indescribable gallantry in her bearing. He pitied all men whose wives could not carry
      themselves, and whose voices failed and broke under the things they had to say. And then again
      there was the way she moved her arms, the way her hands took hold of things, the alert
      lucidity of her eyes, and then that faint, soft shadow of a smile upon her lips when she
      walked thinking or observant, all unaware that he was watching her.</p>
<p>It rained in the morning of their eleventh day and then gave way to warmth and sunshine, so
      that they arrived at Les Avants in the afternoon a little muddy and rather hot. At one of the
      tables under the trees outside the Grand Hotel was a small group of people dressed in the
      remarkable and imposing costume which still in those days distinguished the motorist. They
      turned from their tea to a more or less frank inspection of the Traffords, and suddenly broke
      out into cries of recognition and welcome. Solomonson—for the most part brown leather—emerged
      with extended hands, and behind him, nestling in the midst of immense and costly furs,
      appeared the kindly salience and brightness of his Lady's face. "Good luck!" cried Solomonson.
      "Good luck! Come and have tea
      <pb n="318"/> with us! But this is a happy encounter!"</p>
<p>"We're dirty—but so healthy!" cried Marjorie, saluting Lady Solomonson.</p>
<p>"You look, oh!—splendidly well," that Lady responded.</p>
<p>"We've been walking."</p>
<p>"With just that knapsack!"</p>
<p>"It's been glorious."</p>
<p>"But the courage!" said Lady Solomonson, and did not add, "the tragic hardship!" though her
      tone conveyed it. She had all the unquestioning belief of her race in the sanity of comfort.
      She had ingrained in her the most definite ideas of man's position and woman's, and that any
      one, man or woman, should walk in mud except under dire necessity, was outside the range of
      her philosophy. She thought Marjorie's thick boots and short skirts quite the most appalling
      feminine costume she had ever seen. She saw only a ruined complexion and damaged womanhood in
      Marjorie's rain-washed, sun-bit cheek. Her benevolent heart rebelled at the spectacle. It was
      dreadful, she thought, that nice young people like the Traffords should have come to this.</p>
<p>The rest of the party were now informally introduced. They were all very splendid and
      disconcertingly free from mud. One was Christabel Morrison, the actress, a graceful figure in
      a green baize coat and brown fur, who looked ever so much more charming than her innumerable
      postcards and illustrated-paper portraits would have led one to expect; her neighbour was
      Solomonson's cousin Lee, the organizer of the Theatre Syndicate, a brown-eyed, attenuated,
      quick-minded little man with an accent that struck Trafford as being on the whole rather
      Dutch, and the third lady was Lady Solomonson's sister, Mrs. Lee. It appeared they were all
      staying at Lee's villa above
      <pb n="319"/> Vevey, part of an amusing assembly of people who were either vividly rich or
      even more vividly clever, an accumulation which the Traffords in the course of the next twenty
      minutes were three times invited, with an increasing appreciation and earnestness, to
      join.</p>
<p>From the first our two young people were not indisposed to do so. For eleven days they had
      maintained their duologue at the very highest level; seven days remained to them before they
      must go back to begin the hard new life in England, and there was something very
      attractive—they did not for a moment seek to discover the elements of that attractiveness—in
      this proposal of five or six days of luxurious indolence above the lake, a sort of farewell to
      the worldly side of worldly things, before they set forth upon the high and narrow path they
      had resolved to tread.</p>
<p>"But we've got no clothes," cried Marjorie, "no clothes at all! We've these hobnail boots
      and a pair each of heelless slippers."</p>
<p>"My dear!" cried Lady Solomonson in real distress, and as much aside as circumstances
      permitted, "my dear! My sister can manage all that!" Her voice fell to earnest undertones. "We
      can really manage all that. The house is packed with things. We'll come to dinner in fancy
      dress. And Scott, my maid, is so clever."</p>
<p>"But really!" said Marjorie.</p>
<p>"My dear!" said Lady Solomonson. "Everything." And she changed places with Lee in order to
      be perfectly confidential and explicit. "Rachel!" she cried, and summoned her sister for
      confirmatory assurances....</p>
<p>"But my husband!" Marjorie became audible.</p>
<p>"We've long Persian robes," said Mrs. Lee, with a glance of undisguised appraisement. "He'll
      be
      <pb n="320"/> splendid. He'll look like a Soldan...."</p>
<p>The rest of the company forced a hectic conversation in order not to seem to listen, and
      presently Lady Solomonson and her sister were triumphant. They packed Marjorie into the motor
      car, and Trafford and Solomonson returned to Vevey by train and thence up to the villa by a
      hired automobile.</p>
<milestone n="11" unit="subsection"/>
<p>They didn't go outside the magic confines of the Lees' villa for three days, and when they
      did they were still surrounded by their host's service and possessions; they made an excursion
      to Chillon in his motor-cars, and went in his motor-boat to lunch with the Maynards in their
      lake-side villa close to Geneva. During all that time they seemed lifted off the common earth
      into a world of fine fabrics, agreeable sounds, noiseless unlimited service, and ample
      untroubled living. It had an effect of enchantment, and the long healthy arduous journey
      thither seemed a tale of incredible effort amidst these sunny excesses. The weather had the
      whim to be serenely fine, sunshine like summer and the bluest of skies shone above the white
      wall and the ilex thickets and cypresses that bounded them in from the great world of crowded
      homes and sous and small necessities. And through the texture of it all for Trafford ran a
      thread of curious new suggestion. An intermittent discussion of economics and socialism was
      going on between himself and Solomonson and an agreeable little stammering man in brown named
      Minter, who walked up in the afternoon from Vevey,—he professed to be writing a novel—during
      the earlier half of the day. Minter displayed the keenest appreciation of everything in his
      entertainment, and blinked cheerfully
      <pb n="321"/> and expressed opinions of the extremest socialistic and anarchistic flavour to
      an accompaniment of grateful self-indulgence. "Your port-wine is wonderful, Lee," he would
      say, sipping it. "A terrible retribution will fall upon you some day for all this."</p>
<p>The villa had been designed by Lee to please his wife, and if it was neither very beautiful
      nor very dignified, it was at any rate very pretty and amusing. It might have been built by a
      Parisian dressmaker—in the châteauesque style. It was of greyish-white stone, with a roof of
      tiles. It had little balconies and acutely roofed turrets, and almost burlesque buttresses,
      pierced by doors and gates; and sun-trap loggias, as pleasantly casual as the bows and
      embroideries of a woman's dress; and its central hall, with an impluvium that had nothing to
      do with rain-water, and its dining-room, to which one ascended from this hall between pillars
      up five broad steps, were entirely irrelevant to all its exterior features. Unobtrusive
      men-servants in grey with scarlet facings hovered serviceably.</p>
<p>From the little terrace, all set with orange-trees in tubs, one could see, through the
      branches and stems of evergreens and over a foreground of budding, starting vineyard, the
      clustering roofs of Vevey below, an agglomeration veiled ever so thinly in the morning by a
      cobweb of wood smoke, against the blue background of lake with its winged sailing-boats, and
      sombre Alpine distances. Minter made it all significant by a wave of the hand. "All this," he
      said, and of the crowded work-a-day life below, "all that."</p>
<p>"All this," with its rich litter of stuffs and ornaments, its fine profusion, its delicacies
      of flower and food and furniture, its frequent inconsecutive pleasures, its noiseless, ready
      service, was remarkably novel and yet remarkably familiar to Trafford. For
      <pb n="322"/> a time he could not understand this undertone of familiarity, and then a sunlit
      group of hangings in one of the small rooms that looked out upon the lake took his mind back
      to his own dining-room, and the little inadequate, but decidedly good, Bokhara embroidery that
      dominated it like a flag, that lit it, and now lit his understanding, like a confessed desire.
      Of course, Mrs. Lee—happy woman!—was doing just everything that Marjorie would have loved to
      do. Marjorie had never confessed as much, perhaps she had never understood as much, but now in
      the presence of Mrs. Lee's æsthetic exuberances, Trafford at least understood. He surveyed the
      little room, whose harmonies he had at first simply taken for granted, noted the lustre-ware
      that answered to the gleaming Persian tiles, the inspiration of a metallic thread in the
      hangings, and the exquisite choice of the deadened paint upon the woodwork, and realized for
      the first time how little aimless extravagance can be, and all the timid, obstinately
      insurgent artistry that troubled his wife. He stepped through the open window into a little
      loggia, and stared unseeingly over glittering, dark-green leaves to the mysteries of distance
      in the great masses above St. Gingolph, and it seemed for the first time that perhaps in his
      thoughts he had done his wife a wrong. He had judged her fickle, impulsive, erratic, perhaps
      merely because her mind followed a different process from his, because while he went upon the
      lines of constructive truth, her guide was a more immediate and instinctive sense of
      beauty.</p>
<p>He was very much alive to her now, and deeply in love with her. He had reached Les Avants
      with all his sense of their discordance clean washed and walked out of his mind, by rain and
      sun and a flow of high resolutions, and the brotherly swing of their
      <pb n="323"/> strides together. They had come to the Lee's villa, mud-splashed, air-sweet
      comrades, all unaware of the subtle differences of atmosphere they had to encounter. They had
      no suspicion that it was only about half of each other that had fraternized. Now here they
      were in a company that was not only altogether alien to their former mood, but extremely
      interesting and exciting and closely akin to the latent factors in Marjorie's composition.
      Their hostess and her sister had the keen, quick æsthetic sensibilities of their race, with
      all that freedom of reading and enfranchisement of mind which is the lot of the Western women.
      Lee had an immense indulgent affection for his wife, he regarded her arrangements and exploits
      with an admiration that was almost American. And Mrs. Lee's imagination had run loose in
      pursuit of beautiful and remarkable people and splendours rather than harmonies of line and
      colour. Lee, like Solomonson, had that inexplicable alchemy of mind which distils gold from
      the commerce of the world ("All this," said Minter to Trafford, "is an exhalation from all
      that"); he accumulated wealth as one grows a beard, and found his interest in his uxorious
      satisfactions, and so Mrs. Lee, with her bright watchful eyes, quick impulsive movements and
      instinctive command had the utmost freedom to realize her ideals.</p>
<p>In the world at large Lee and Solomonson seemed both a little short and a little stout, and
      a little too black and bright for their entirely conventional clothing, but for the dinner and
      evening of the villa they were now, out of consideration for Trafford, at their ease, and far
      more dignified in Oriental robes. Trafford was accommodated with a long, black, delicately
      embroidered garment that reached to his feet, and suited something upstanding and fine in his
      bearing;
      <pb n="324"/> Minter, who had stayed on from an afternoon call, was gorgeous in Chinese
      embroidery. The rest of the men clung boldly or bashfully to evening dress....</p>
<p>On the evening of his arrival Trafford, bathed and robed, found the rest of the men
      assembling about an open wood fire in the smaller hall at the foot of the main staircase. Lee
      was still upstairs, and Solomonson, with a new grace of gesture begotten by his costume, made
      the necessary introductions; a little man with fine-cut features and a Galway accent was Rex
      the playwright; a tall, grey-haired, clean-shaven man was Bright from the New York Central
      Museum; and a bearded giant with a roof of red hair and a remote eye was Radlett Barns, the
      great portrait-painter, who consents to paint your portrait for posterity as the King confers
      a knighthood. These were presently joined by Lee and Pacey, the blond-haired musician, and
      Mottersham, whose patents and inventions control electric lighting and heating all over the
      world, and then, with the men duly gathered and expectant, the women came down the wide
      staircase.</p>
<p>The staircase had been planned and lit for these effects, and Mrs. Lee meant to make the
      most of her new discovery. Her voice could be heard in the unseen corridor above arranging the
      descent: "You go first, dear. Will you go with Christabel?" The conversation about the fire
      checked and ceased with the sound of voices above and the faint rustle of skirts. Then came
      Christabel Morrison, her slender grace beautifully contrasted with the fuller beauties of that
      great lady of the stage, Marion Rufus. Lady Solomonson descended confidently in a group of
      three, with Lady Mottersham and sharp-tongued little Mrs. Rex, all very rich and splendid.
      After a brief interval their hostess preceded Marjorie, and was so much of an artist that she
      had dressed herself merely as a foil
      <pb n="325"/> to this new creation. She wore black and scarlet, that made the white face and
      bright eyes under her sombre hair seem the face of an inspiring spirit. A step behind her and
      to the right of her came Marjorie, tall and wonderful, as if she were the queen of earth and
      sunshine, swathed barbarically in gold and ruddy brown, and with her abundant hair bound back
      by a fillet of bloodstones and gold. Radlett Barns exclaimed at the sight of her. She was full
      of the manifest consciousness of dignity as she descended, quite conscious and quite
      unembarrassed; two borrowed golden circlets glittered on her shining arm, and a thin chain of
      gold and garnets broke the contrast of the warm, sun-touched neck above, with the unsullied
      skin below.</p>
<p>She sought and met her husband's astonishment with the faintest, remotest of smiles. It
      seemed to him that never before had he appreciated her beauty. His daily companion had become
      this splendour in the sky. She came close by him with hand extended to greet Sir Philip
      Mottersham. He was sensible of the glow of her, as it were of a scented aura about her. He had
      a first full intimation of the cult and worship of woman and the magnificence of women, old as
      the Mediterranean and its goddesses, and altogether novel to his mind....</p>
<p>Christabel Morrison found him a pleasant but not very entertaining or exciting neighbor at
      the dinner-table, and was relieved when the time came for her to turn an ear to the artistic
      compliments of Radlett Barns. But Trafford was too interested and amused by the general effect
      of the dinner to devote himself to the rather heavy business of really exhilarating
      Christabel. He didn't give his mind to her. He found the transformation of Sir Rupert into a
      turbanned Oriental who might have come out of a picture by
      <pb n="326"/> Carpaccio, gently stimulating and altogether delightful. His attention returned
      again and again to that genial swarthiness. Mrs. Lee on his left lived in her eyes, and didn't
      so much talk to him as rattle her mind at him almost absent-mindedly, as one might dangle keys
      at a baby while one talked to its mother. Yet it was evident she liked the look of him. Her
      glance went from his face to his robe, and up and down the table, at the bright dresses, the
      shining arms, the glass and light and silver. She asked him to tell her just where he had
      tramped and just what he had seen, and he had scarcely begun answering her question before her
      thoughts flew off to three trophies of china and silver, struggling groups of china boys
      bearing up great silver shells of fruit and flowers that stood down the centre of the table.
      "What do you think of my chubby boys?" she asked. "They're German work. They came from a show
      at Düsseldorf last week. Ben saw I liked them, and sent back for them secretly, and here they,
      are! I thought they might be too colourless. But are they?"</p>
<p>"No," said Trafford, "they're just cool. Under that glow of fruit. Is this salt-cellar
      English cut glass?"</p>
<p>"Old Dutch," said Mrs. Lee. "Isn't it jolly?" She embarked with a roving eye upon the story
      of her Dutch glass, which was abundant and admirable, and broke off abruptly to say, "Your
      wife is wonderful."</p>
<p>"Her hair goes back," she said, "like music. You know what I mean—a sort of easy rhythm. You
      don't mind my praising your wife?"</p>
<p>Trafford said he didn't.</p>
<p>"And there's a sort of dignity about her. All my life, Mr. Trafford, I've wanted to be tall.
      It stopped my growth."</p>
<p>She glanced off at a tangent. "Tell me, Mr.
      <pb n="327"/> Trafford," she asked, "was your wife beautiful like this when you married her? I
      mean—of course she was a beautiful girl and adorable and all that; but wasn't she just a
      slender thing?"</p>
<p>She paused, but if she had a habit of asking disconcerting questions she did not at any rate
      insist upon answers, and she went on to confess that she believed she would be a happier woman
      poor than rich—"not that Ben isn't all he should be"—but that then she would have been a
      fashionable dressmaker. "People want help," she said, "so much more help than they get. They
      go about with themselves—what was it Mr. Radlett Barns said the other night—oh!—like people
      leading horses they daren't ride. I think he says such good things at times, don't you? So
      wonderful to be clever in two ways like that. Just look <hi>now</hi> at your wife—now I mean,
      that they've drawn that peacock-coloured curtain behind her. My brother-in-law has been
      telling me you keep the most wonderful and precious secrets locked up in your breast, that you
      know how to make gold and diamonds and all sorts of things. If I did,—I should make them."</p>
<p>She pounced suddenly upon Rex at her left with questions about the Keltic Renascence, was it
      still going on—or what? and Trafford was at liberty for a time to enjoy the bright effects
      about him, the shadowed profile and black hair of Christabel to the right of him, and the
      coruscating refractions and reflections of Lady Solomonson across the white and silver and
      ivory and blossom of the table. Then Mrs. Lee dragged him into a sudden conflict with Rex, by
      saying abruptly—</p>
<p>"Of course, Mr. Trafford wouldn't believe that."</p>
<p>He looked perhaps a little lost.</p>
<p>"I was telling Mrs. Lee," said Rex, "that I don't
      <pb n="328"/> believe there's any economy of human toil in machinery whatever. I mean that the
      machine itself really embodies all the toil it seems to save, toil that went to the making of
      it and preparing it and getting coal for it...."</p>
<milestone n="12" unit="subsection"/>
<p>Next morning they found their hostess at breakfast in the dining-room and now the sun was
      streaming through a high triple window that had been curtained overnight, and they looked out
      through clean, bright plate-glass upon mountains half-dissolved in a luminous mist, and a
      mist-veiled lake below. Great stone jars upon the terrace bore a blaze of urged and early
      blossom, and beyond were cypresses. Their hostess presided at one of two round tables, at a
      side table various breakfast dishes kept warm over spirit lamps, and two men servants
      dispensed tea and coffee. In the bay of the window was a fruit table, with piled fruit-plates
      and finger-bowls.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee waved a welcoming hand, and drew Marjorie to a seat beside her. Rex was consuming
      trout and Christabel peaches, and Solomonson, all his overnight Orientalism abandoned, was in
      outspoken tweeds and quite under the impression that he was interested in golf. Trafford got
      frizzled bacon for Marjorie and himself, and dropped into a desultory conversation, chiefly
      sustained by Christabel, about the peculiarly exalting effect of beautiful scenery on
      Christabel's mind. Mrs. Lee was as usual distraught, and kept glancing towards the steps that
      led up from the hall. Lady Solomonson appeared with a rustle in a wrapper of pink Chinese
      silk. "I came down after all," she said. "I lay in bed weighing rolls and coffee and relaxed
      muscles against your
      <pb n="329"/> English breakfast downstairs. And suddenly I remembered your little
      sausages!"</p>
<p>She sat down with a distribution of handkerchief, bag, letters, a gold fountain pen and
      suchlike equipments, and Trafford got her some of the coveted delicacies. Mrs. Lee suddenly
      cried out, "<hi>Here</hi> they come! <hi>Here</hi> they come!" and simultaneously the hall
      resonated with children's voices and the yapping of a Skye terrier.</p>
<p>Then a gay little procession appeared ascending the steps. First came a small but princely
      little boy of three, with a ruddy face and curly black hair, behind him was a slender, rather
      awkward girl of perhaps eleven, and a sturdier daughter of Israel of nine. A nurse in artistic
      purple followed, listening inattentively to some private whisperings of a knickerbockered
      young man of five, and then came another purple-robed nurse against contingencies, and then a
      nurse of a different, white-clad, and more elaborately costumed sort, carrying a sumptuous
      baby of eight or nine months. "Ah! the <hi>darlings!</hi>" cried Christabel, springing up
      quite beautifully, and Lady Solomonson echoed the cry. The procession broke against the tables
      and split about the breakfast party. The small boy in petticoats made a confident rush for
      Marjorie, Christabel set herself to fascinate his elder brother, the young woman of eleven
      scrutinized Trafford with speculative interest and edged towards him coyly, and Mrs. Lee
      interviewed her youngest born. The amiable inanities suitable to the occasion had scarcely
      begun before a violent clapping of hands announced the appearance of Lee.</p>
<p>It was Lee's custom, Mrs. Lee told Marjorie over her massively robed baby, to get up very
      early and work on rolls and coffee; he never breakfasted nor
      <pb n="330"/> joined them until the children came. All of them rushed to him for their morning
      kiss, and it seemed to Trafford that Lee at least was an altogether happy creature as he
      accepted the demonstrative salutations of this struggling, elbowing armful of offspring, and
      emerged at last like a man from a dive, flushed and ruffled and smiling, to wish his adult
      guests good morning.</p>
<p>"Come upstairs with us, daddy," cried the children, tugging at him. "Come upstairs!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee ran her eye about her table and rose. "It's the children's hour," she said to
      Marjorie. "You don't I hope, mind children?"</p>
<p>"But," said Trafford incredulous, and with a friendly arm about his admirer, "is this tall
      young woman yours?"</p>
<p>The child shot him a glance of passionate appreciation for this scrap of flattery.</p>
<p>"We began young," said Mrs. Lee, with eyes of uncritical pride for the ungainly one, and
      smiled at her husband.</p>
<p>"Upstairs," cried the boy of five and the girl of nine. "Upstairs."</p>
<p>"May we come?" asked Marjorie.</p>
<p>"May we all come?" asked Christabel, determined to be in the movement.</p>
<p>Rex strolled towards the cigars, with disentanglement obviously in his mind.</p>
<p>"Do you really care?" asked Mrs. Lee. "You know, I'm so proud of their nursery. Would you
      care——? Always I go up at this time."</p>
<p>"I've my little nursery, too," said Marjorie.</p>
<p>"Of course!" cried Mrs. Lee, "I forgot. Of course;" and overwhelmed Marjorie with inquiries
      as she followed her husband. Every one joined the nurseryward procession except Rex, who left
      himself
      <pb n="331"/> behind with an air of inadvertency, and escaped to the terrace and a
      cigar....</p>
<p>It was a wonderful nursery, a suite of three bedrooms, a green and white, well-lit
      schoolroom and a vast playroom, and hovering about the passage Trafford remarked a third
      purple nurse and a very efficient and serious-looking Swiss governess. The schoolroom and the
      nursery displayed a triumph of judicious shopping and arrangement, the best of German and
      French and English things had been blended into a harmony at once hygienic and pedagogic and
      humanly charming. For once Marjorie had to admire the spending of another woman, and admit to
      herself that even she could not have done better with the money.</p>
<p>There were clever little desks for the elder children to work at, adjustable desks
      scientifically lit so that they benefited hands and shoulders and eyes; there were
      artistically coloured and artistically arranged pictures, and a little library held all the
      best of Lang and Lucas, rare good things like "Uncle Lubin," Maurice Baring's story of
      "Forget-me-not," "Johnny Crow's Garden," "The Bad Child's Book of Beasts," animal books and
      bird books, costume books and story books, colour books and rhyme books, abundant, yet every
      one intelligently chosen, no costly meretricious printed rubbish such as silly Gentile mothers
      buy. Then in the great nursery, with its cork carpet on which any toy would stand or run, was
      an abundance of admirable possessions and shelving for everything, and great fat cloth
      elephants to ride, and go-carts, and hooks for a swing. Marjorie's quick eye saw, and she
      admired effusively and envied secretly, and Mrs. Lee appreciated her appreciation. A
      skirmishing romp of the middle children and Lee went on about the two of them, and
      <pb n="332"/> Trafford was led off by his admirer into a cubby-house in one corner (with real
      glass windows made to open) and the muslin curtains were drawn while he was shown a secret
      under vows. Lady Solomonson discovered some soldiers, and was presently on her knees in a
      corner with the five-year old boy.</p>
<p>"These are like my Teddy's," she was saying. "My Billy has some of these."</p>
<p>Trafford emerged from the cubby-house, which was perhaps a little cramped for him, and
      surveyed the room, with his admirer lugging at his arm unheeded, and whispering: "Come back
      with me."</p>
<p>Of course this was the clue to Lee and Solomonson. How extremely happy Lee appeared to be!
      Enormous vistas of dark philoprogenitive parents and healthy little Jews and Jewesses seemed
      to open out to Trafford, hygienically reared, exquisitely trained and educated. And he and
      Marjorie had just one little daughter—with a much poorer educational outlook. She had no cloth
      elephant to ride, no elaborate cubby-house to get into, only a half-dozen picture books or so,
      and later she wouldn't when she needed it get that linguistic Swiss.</p>
<p>He wasn't above the normal human vanity of esteeming his own race and type the best, and
      certain vulgar aspects of what nowadays one calls Eugenics crossed his mind.</p>
<milestone n="13" unit="subsection"/>
<p>During those few crowded days of unfamiliar living Trafford accumulated a vast confused mass
      of thoughts and impressions. He realized acutely the enormous gulf between his attitudes
      towards women and those of his host and Solomonson—and indeed of all the other men. It had
      never occurred to him before that there was any other relationship
      <pb n="333"/> possible between a modern woman and a modern man but a frank comradeship and
      perfect knowledge, helpfulness, and honesty. That had been the continual implication of his
      mother's life, and of all that he had respected in the thought and writing of his time. But
      not one of these men in their place—with the possible exception of Minter, who remained
      brilliant but ambiguous—believed anything of the sort. It necessarily involved in practice a
      share of hardship for women, and it seemed fundamental to them that women should have no
      hardship. He sought for a word, and hung between chivalry and orientalism. He inclined towards
      chivalry. Their women were lifted a little off the cold ground of responsibility. Charm was
      their obligation. "A beautiful woman should be beautifully dressed," said Radlett Barns in the
      course of the discussion of a contemporary portrait painter. Lee nodded to endorse an obvious
      truth. "But she ought to dress herself," said Barns. "It ought to be herself to the points of
      the old lace—chosen and assimilated. It's just through not being that, that so many rich women
      are—detestable. Heaps of acquisition. Caddis-women...."</p>
<p>Trafford ceased to listen, he helped himself to a cigar and pinched its end and lit it,
      while his mind went off to gnaw at: "A beautiful woman should be beautifully dressed," as a
      dog retires with a bone. He couldn't escape from its shining truth, and withal it was
      devastating to all the purposes of his life.</p>
<p>He rejected the word orientalism; what he was dealing with here was chivalry. "All this,"
      was indeed, under the thinnest of disguises, the castle and the pavilion, and Lee and
      Solomonson were valiant knights, who entered the lists not indeed with spear and shield but
      with prospectus and ingenious enterprise, who drew cheques instead of swords for their
      <pb n="334"/> ladies' honour, who held "all that" in fee and subjection that these exquisite
      and wonderful beings should flower in rich perfection. All these women lived in a magic
      security and abundance, far above the mire and adventure of the world; their knights went upon
      quests for them and returned with villas and pictures and diamonds and historical pearls. And
      not one of them all was so beautiful a being as his Marjorie, whom he made his squaw, whom he
      expected to aid and follow him, and suffer uncomplainingly the rough services of the common
      life. Not one was half so beautiful as Marjorie, nor half so sweet and wonderful....</p>
<p>If such thoughts came in Lee's villa, they returned with redoubled force when Trafford found
      himself packed painfully with Marjorie in the night train to Paris. His head ached with the
      rattle and suffocation of the train, and he knew hers must ache more. The windows of the
      compartment and the door were all closed, the litigious little commercial traveller in shiny
      grey had insisted upon that, there was no corner seat either for Marjorie or himself, the dim
      big package over her head swayed threateningly. The green shade over the light kept opening
      with the vibration of the train, the pallid old gentleman with the beard had twisted himself
      into a ghastly resemblance to a broken-necked corpse, and pressed his knees hard and stiffly
      against Trafford, and the small, sniffing, bow-legged little boy beside the rusty widow woman
      in the corner smelt mysteriously and penetratingly of Roquefort cheese. For the seventeenth
      time the little commercial traveller jumped up with an unbecoming expletive, and pulled the
      shade over the light, and the silent young man in the fourth corner stirred and readjusted his
      legs.</p>
<p>For a time until the crack of light overhead had
      <pb n="335"/> widened again every one became a dark head-dangling outline....</p>
<p>He watched the dim shape before him and noted the weary droop of her pose. He wished he had
      brought water. He was intolerably thirsty, and his thirst gave him the measure of hers. This
      jolting fœtid compartment was a horrible place for her, an intolerably horrible place. And she
      was standing it, for all her manifest suffering, with infinite gallantry and patience. What a
      gallant soul indeed she was! Whatever else she did she never failed to rise to a challenge.
      Her very extravagance that had tried their lives so sorely was perhaps just one aspect of that
      same quality. It is so easy to be saving if one is timid; so hard if one is unaccustomed to
      fear. How beautiful she had shone at times in the lights and glitter of that house behind
      there, and now she was back in her weather-stained tweeds again, like a shining sword thrust
      back into a rusty old sheath.</p>
<p>Was it fair that she should come back into the sheath because of this passion of his for a
      vast inexhaustible research?</p>
<p>He had never asked himself before if it was fair to assume she would follow his purpose and
      his fortunes. He had taken that for granted. And she too had taken that for granted, which was
      so generously splendid of her. All her disloyalties had been unintentional, indeed almost
      instinctive, breaches of her subordination to this aim which was his alone. These breaches he
      realized had been the reality of her nature fighting against her profoundest resolutions.</p>
<p>He wondered what Lee must think of this sort of married life. How ugly and selfish it must
      seem from that point of view.</p>
<p>He perceived for the first time the fundamental
      <pb n="336"/> incongruity of Marjorie's position, she was made to shine, elaborately prepared
      and trained to shine, desiring keenly to shine, and then imprisoned and hidden in the faded
      obscurity of a small, poor home. How conspicuously, how extremely he must be wanting in just
      that sort of chivalry in which Lee excelled! Those business men lived for their women to an
      extent he had hitherto scarcely dreamt of doing....</p>
<p>His want of chivalry was beyond dispute. And was there not also an extraordinary egotism in
      this concentration upon his own purposes, a self-esteem, a vanity? Had her life no rights?
      Suppose now he were to give her—two years, three years perhaps of his life—altogether. Or even
      four. Was it too much to grudge her four? Solomonson had been at his old theme with him, a
      theme the little man had never relinquished since their friendship first began years ago,
      possibilities of a business alliance and the application of a mind of exceptional freshness
      and penetration to industrial development. Why shouldn't that be tried? Why not "make money"
      for a brief strenuous time, and then come back, when Marjorie's pride and comfort were
      secure?...</p>
<p>(Poor dear, how weary she looked!)</p>
<p>He wondered how much more remained of this appalling night. It would have made so little
      difference if they had taken the day train and travelled first-class. Wasn't she indeed
      entitled to travel first-class? Pictures of the immense spaciousness, the softness,
      cleanliness and dignity of first-class compartments appeared in his mind....</p>
<p>He would have looked at his watch, but to get at it would mean disturbing the silent young
      man on his left.</p>
<p>Outside in the corridor there broke out a noisy
      <pb n="337"/> dispute about a missing coupon, a dispute in that wonderful language that is
      known to the facetious as <hi>entente cordiale</hi>, between an Englishman and the conductor
      of the train....</p>
<milestone n="14" unit="subsection"/>
<p>In Paris there was a dispute with an extortionate cabman, and the crossing from Dieppe to
      Newhaven was rough and bitterly cold. They were both ill. They reached home very dirty and
      weary, and among the pile of letters and papers on Trafford's desk was a big bundle of Science
      Note proofs, and two letters from Croydon and Pinner to alter the hours of his lectures for
      various plausible and irritating reasons.</p>
<p>The little passage looked very small and rather bare as the door shut behind them, and the
      worn places that had begun to be conspicuous during the last six months, and which they had
      forgotten during the Swiss holiday, reasserted themselves. The dining-room, after spacious
      rooms flooded with sunshine, betrayed how dark it was, and how small. Those Bokhara
      embroideries that had once shone so splendid, now, after Mrs. Lee's rich and unlimited
      harmonies, seemed skimpy and insufficient, mere loin-cloths for the artistic nakedness of the
      home. They felt, too, they were beginning to find out their post-impressionist picture. They
      had not remembered it as nearly so crude as it now appeared. The hole a flying coal had burnt
      in the unevenly faded dark-blue carpet looked larger than it had ever done before, and was
      indeed the only thing that didn't appear faded and shrunken.</p>
<milestone n="15" unit="subsection"/>
<p>The atmosphere of the Lees' villa had disturbed
      <pb n="338"/> Marjorie's feelings and ideas even more than it had Trafford's. She came back
      struggling to recover those high resolves that had seemed so secure when they had walked down
      to Les Avantes. There was a curiously tormenting memory of that vast, admirable nursery, and
      the princely procession of children that would not leave her mind. No effort of her reason
      could reconcile her to the inferiority of Margharita's equipment. She had a detestable craving
      for a uniform for May. But May was going....</p>
<p>But indeed she was not so sure that May was going.</p>
<p>She was no longer buoyantly well, she was full of indefinable apprehensions of weakness and
      failure. She struggled to control an insurgence of emotions that rose out of the deeps of her
      being. She had now, she knew, to take on her share of the burden, to become one of the
      Samurai, to show her love no longer as a demand but as a service. Yet from day to day she
      procrastinated under the shadow of apprehended things; she forebore to dismiss May, to buy
      that second-hand typewriter she needed, to take any irrevocable step towards the realization
      of the new way of living. She tried to think away her fears, but they would not leave her. She
      felt that Trafford watched her pale face with a furtive solicitude and wondered at her
      hesitations; she tried in vain to seem cheerful and careless in his presence, with an anxiety,
      with premonitions that grew daily.</p>
<p>There was no need to worry him unduly....</p>
<p>But soon the matter was beyond all doubting. One night she gathered her courage together
      suddenly and came down into his study in her dressing-gown with her hair about her shoulders.
      She opened
      <pb n="339"/> the door and her heart failed her.</p>
<p>"Rag," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said busily from his desk, without looking round.</p>
<p>"I want to speak to you," she answered, and came slowly, and stood beside him silently.</p>
<p>"Well, old Marjorie?" he said presently, drawing a little intricate pattern in the corner of
      his blotting paper, and wondering whether this was a matter of five pounds or ten.</p>
<p>"I meant so well," she said and caught herself back into silence again.</p>
<p>He started at the thought, at a depth and meaning in her voice, turned his chair about to
      look at her, and discovered she was weeping and choking noiselessly. He stood up close to her,
      moving very slowly and silently, his eyes full of this new surmise, and now without word or
      gesture from her he knew his thought was right. "My dear," he whispered.</p>
<p>She turned her face from him. "I meant so well," she sobbed. "My dear! I meant so well."
      Still with an averted face her arms came out to him in a desperate, unreasoning appeal for
      love. He took her and held her close to him. "Never mind, dear," he said. "Don't mind." Her
      passion now was unconstrained. "I thought—" he began, and left the thing unsaid.</p>
<p>"But your work," she said; "your research?"</p>
<p>"I must give up research," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dearest!"</p>
<p>"I must give up research," he repeated. "I've been seeing it for days. Clearer and clearer.
       <hi>This</hi> dear, just settles things. Even—as we were coming home in the train—I was
      making up my mind. At
      <pb n="340"/> Vevey I was talking to Solomonson."</p>
<p>"My dear," she whispered, clinging to him.</p>
<p>"I talked to Solomonson. He had ideas—a proposal."</p>
<p>"No," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said. "I've left the thing too long."</p>
<p>He repeated. "I must give up research—for years. I ought to have done it long before."</p>
<p>"I had meant so well," she said. "I meant to work. I meant to deny myself...."</p>
<p>"I'm glad," he whispered. "Glad! Why should you weep?" It seemed nothing to him then, that
      so he should take a long farewell to the rare, sweet air of that wonderland his mind had loved
      so dearly. All he remembered was that Marjorie was very dear to him, very dear to him, and
      that all her being was now calling out for him and his strength. "I had thought anyhow of
      giving up research," he repeated. "This merely decides. It happens to decide. I love you,
      dear. I put my research at your feet. Gladly. This is the end, and I do not care, my dear, at
      all. I do not care at all—seeing I have you...."</p>
<p>He stood beside her for a moment, and then sat down again, sideways, upon his chair.</p>
<p>"It isn't you, my dear, or me," he said, "but life that beats us—that beautiful, irrational
      mother.... Life does not care for research or knowledge, but only for life. Oh! the world has
      to go on yet for tens of thousands of years before—before we are free for that. I've got to
      fight—as other men fight...."</p>
<p>He thought in silence for a time, oddly regardless of her. "But if it was not you," he said,
      staring at the fireplace with knitted brows, "if I did not love you.... Thank God, I love you,
      dear! Thank God, our children are love children! I want to live—to my finger-tips, but if I
      didn't love you—oh! love you!
      <pb n="341"/> then I think now—I'd be glad—I'd be glad, I think, to cheat life of her
      victory."</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear!" she cried, and clung weeping to him, and caught at him and sat herself upon
      his knees, and put her arms about his head, and kissed him passionately with tear-salt lips,
      with her hair falling upon his face.</p>
<p>"My dear," she whispered....</p>
<milestone n="16" unit="subsection"/>
<p>So soon as Trafford could spare an afternoon amidst his crowded engagements he went to talk
      to Solomonson, who was now back in London. "Solomonson," he said, "you were talking about
      rubber at Vevey."</p>
<p>"I remember," said Solomonson with a note of welcome.</p>
<p>"I've thought it over."</p>
<p>"I <hi>thought</hi> you would."</p>
<p>"I've thought things over. I'm going to give up my professorship—and science generally, and
      come into business—if that is what you are meaning."</p>
<p>Solomonson turned his paper-weight round very carefully before replying. Then he said: "You
      mustn't give up your professorship yet, Trafford. For the rest—I'm glad."</p>
<p>He reflected, and then his bright eyes glanced up at Trafford. "I knew," he said, "you
      would."</p>
<p>"I didn't," said Trafford. "Things have happened since."</p>
<p>"Something was bound to happen. You're too good—for what it gave you. I didn't talk to you
      out there for nothing. I saw things.... Let's go into the other room, and smoke and talk it
      over." He
      <pb n="342"/> stood up as he spoke.</p>
<p>"I thought you would," he repeated, leading the way. "I knew you would. You see,—one
       <hi>has</hi> to. You can't get out of it."</p>
<p>"It was all very well before you were married," said Solomonson, stopping short to say it,
      "but when a man's married he's got to think. He can't go on devoting himself to his art and
      his science and all that—not if he's married anything worth having. No. Oh, I understand. He's
      got to look about him, and forget the distant prospect for a bit. I saw you'd come to it.
       <hi>I</hi> came to it. Had to. I had ambitions—just as you have. I've always had an
      inclination to do a bit of research on my own. I <hi>like</hi> it, you know. Oh! I could have
      done things. I'm sure I could have done things. I'm not a born money-maker. But——." He became
      very close and confidential. "It's——<hi>them</hi>. You said good-bye to science for a bit when
      you flopped me down on that old croquet-lawn, Trafford." He went off to reminiscences. "Lord,
      how we went over! No more aviation for me, Trafford!"</p>
<p>He arranged chairs, and produced cigars. "After all—this of course—it's interesting. Once
      you get into the movement of it, it takes hold of you. It's a game."</p>
<p>"I've thought over all you said," Trafford began, using premeditated phrases. "Bluntly—I
      want three thousand a year, and I don't make eight hundred. It's come home to me. I'm going to
      have another child."</p>
<p>Solomonson gesticulated a congratulation.</p>
<p>"All the same, I hate dropping research. It's stuff I'm made to do. About that, Solomonson,
      I'm almost superstitious. I could say I had a call.... It's the maddest state of affairs! Now
      that I'm doing
      <pb n="343"/> absolutely my best work for mankind, work I firmly believe no one else can do, I
      just manage to get six hundred—nearly two hundred of my eight hundred is my own. What does the
      world think I could do better—that would be worth four times as much."</p>
<p>"The world doesn't think anything at all about it," said Solomonson.</p>
<p>"Suppose it did!"</p>
<p>The thought struck Sir Rupert. He knitted his brows and looked hard obliquely at the smoke
      of his cigar. "Oh, it won't," he said, rejecting a disagreeable idea. "There isn't any
      world—not in that sense. That's the mistake you make, Trafford."</p>
<p>"It's not what your work is worth," he explained. "It's what your advantages can get for
      you. People are always going about supposing—just what you suppose—that people ought to get
      paid in proportion to the good they do. It's forgetting what the world is, to do that. Very
      likely some day civilization will get to that, but it hasn't got to it yet. It isn't going to
      get to it for hundreds and hundreds of years."</p>
<p>His manner became confidential. "Civilization's just a fight, Trafford—just as savagery is a
      fight, and being a wild beast is a fight,—only you have paddeder gloves on and there's more
      rules. We aren't out for everybody, we're out for ourselves—and a few friends perhaps—within
      limits. It's no good hurrying ahead and pretending civilization's something else, when it
      isn't. That's where all these socialists and people come a howler. Oh, <hi>I</hi> know the
      Socialists. I see 'em at my wife's At Homes. They come along with the literary people and the
      artists' wives and the actors and actresses, and none of them take much account of me because
      I'm just a business man and
      <pb n="344"/> rather dark and short, and so I get a chance of looking at them from the side
      that isn't on show while the other's turned to the women, and they're just as fighting as the
      rest of us, only they humbug more and they don't seem to me to have a decent respect for any
      of the common rules. And that's about what it all comes to, Trafford."</p>
<p>Sir Rupert paused, and Trafford was about to speak when the former resumed again, his voice
      very earnest, his eyes shining with purpose. He liked Trafford, and he was doing his utmost to
      make a convincing confession of the faith that was in him. "It's when it comes to the women,"
      said Sir Rupert, "that one finds it out. That's where <hi>you've</hi> found it out. You say,
      I'm going to devote my life to the service of Humanity in general. You'll find Humanity in
      particular, in the shape of all the fine, beautiful, delightful and desirable women you come
      across, preferring a narrower turn of devotion. See? That's all. <hi>Caeteris paribus</hi>, of
      course. That's what I found out, and that's what you've found out, and that's what everybody
      with any sense in his head finds out, and there you are."</p>
<p>"You put it—graphically," said Trafford.</p>
<p>"I feel it graphically. I may be all sorts of things, but I do know a fact when I see it.
      I'm here with a few things I want and a woman or so I have and want to keep, and the kids
      upstairs, bless 'em! and I'm in league with all the others who want the same sort of things.
      Against any one or anything that upsets us. We stand by the law and each other, and that's
      what it all amounts to. That's as far as my patch of Humanity goes. Humanity at large!
      Humanity be blowed! <hi>Look</hi> at it! It isn't that I'm hostile to Humanity, mind you, but
      that I'm not disposed to go under as I should do if I didn't say that.
      <pb n="345"/> So I say it. And that's about all it is, and there you are."</p>
<p>He regarded Trafford over his cigar, drawing fiercely at it for some moments. Then seeing
      Trafford on the point of speaking, he snatched it from his lips, demanded silence by waving it
      at his hearer, and went on.</p>
<p>"I say all this in order to dispose of any idea that you can keep up the open-minded
      tell-everybody-every-thing scientific attitude if you come into business. You can't. Put
      business in two words and what is it? Keeping something from somebody else, and making him pay
      for it—"</p>
<p>"Oh, look here!" protested Trafford. "That's not the whole of business."</p>
<p>"There's making him want it, of course, advertisement and all that, but that falls under
      making him pay for it, really."</p>
<p>"But a business man organizes public services, consolidates, economizes."</p>
<p>Sir Rupert made his mouth look very wide by sucking in the corners. "Incidentally," he said,
      and added after a judicious pause: "Sometimes... I thought we were talking of making
      money."</p>
<p>"Go on," said Trafford.</p>
<p>"You set me thinking," said Solomonson. "It's the thing I always like about you. I tell you,
      Trafford, I don't believe that the majority of people who make money help civilization forward
      any more than the smoke that comes out of the engine helps the train forward. If you put it to
      me, I don't. I've got no illusions of that sort. They're about as much help as—fat. They
      accumulate because things happen to be arranged so."</p>
<p>"Things will be arranged better some day."
      <pb n="346"/></p>
<p>"They aren't arranged better now. Grip that! <hi>Now</hi>, it's a sort of paradox. If you've
      got big gifts and you choose to help forward the world, if you choose to tell all you know and
      give away everything you can do in the way of work, you've got to give up the ideas of wealth
      and security, and that means fine women and children. You've got to be a <hi>deprived</hi>
      sort of man. 'All right,' you say, 'That's me!' But how about your wife being a deprived sort
      of woman? Eh? That's where it gets you! And meanwhile, you know, while <hi>you</hi> make your
      sacrifices and do your researches, there'll be little mean sharp active beasts making money
      all over you like maggots on a cheese. And if everybody who'd got gifts and altruistic ideas
      gave themselves up to it, then evidently only the mean and greedy lot would breed and have the
      glory. They'd get everything. Every blessed thing. There wouldn't be an option they didn't
      hold. And the other chaps would produce the art and the science and the literature, as far as
      the men who'd got hold of things would let 'em, and perish out of the earth altogether....
      There you are! Still, that's how things are made...."</p>
<p>"But it isn't worth it. It isn't worth extinguishing oneself in order to make a world for
      those others, anyhow. Them and their children. Is it? Eh? It's like building a temple for
      flies to buzz in.... There is such a thing as a personal side to Eugenics, you know."</p>
<p>Solomonson reflected over the end of his cigar. "It isn't good enough," he concluded.</p>
<p>"You're infernally right," said Trafford.</p>
<p>"Very well," said Solomonson, "and now we can get to business."</p>
<milestone n="17" unit="subsection"/>
<p>The immediate business was the systematic exploitation
      <pb n="347"/> of the fact that Trafford had worked out the problem of synthesizing
      indiarubber. He had done so with an entire indifference to the commercial possibilities of the
      case, because he had been irritated by the enormous publicity given to Behrens' assertion that
      he had achieved this long-sought end. Of course the production of artificial rubbers and
      rubber-like substances had been one of the activities of the synthetic chemist for many years,
      from the appearance of Tilden's isoprene rubber onward, and there was already a formidable
      list of collaterals, dimethybutadiene, and so forth, by which the coveted goal could be
      approached. Behrens had boldly added to this list as his own a number of variations upon a
      theme of Trafford's, originally designed to settle certain curiosities about elasticity.
      Behrens' products were not only more massively rubber-like than anything that had gone before
      them, but also extremely cheap to produce, and his bold announcement of success had produced a
      check in rubber sales and widespread depression in the quiveringly sensitive market of
      plantation shares. Solomonson had consulted Trafford about this matter at Vevey, and had heard
      with infinite astonishment that Trafford had already roughly prepared and was proposing to
      complete and publish, unpatented and absolutely unprotected, first a smashing demonstration of
      the unsoundness of Behrens' claim and then a lucid exposition of just what had to be done and
      what could be done to make an indiarubber absolutely indistinguishable from the natural
      product. The business man could not believe his ears.</p>
<p>"My dear chap, positively—you mustn't," Solomonson had screamed, and he had opened his
      fingers
      <pb n="348"/> and humped his shoulders and for all his public school and university training
      lapsed undisguisedly into the Oriental. "Don't you <hi>see</hi> all you are throwing away?" he
      squealed.</p>
<p>"I suppose it's our quality to throw such things away," said Trafford, when at last
      Solomonson's point of view became clear to him. They had embarked upon a long rambling
      discussion of that issue of publication, a discussion they were now taking up again. "When men
      dropped that idea of concealing knowledge, alchemist gave place to chemist," said Trafford,
      "and all that is worth having in modern life, all that makes it better and safer and more
      hopeful than the ancient life, began."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," said Solomonson, "I know, I know. But to give away the synthesis of
      rubber! To just shove it out of the window into the street! <hi>Gare l'eau!</hi> O! And when
      you could do with so much too!"....</p>
<p>Now they resumed the divergent threads of that Vevey talk.</p>
<p>Solomonson had always entertained the warmest friendship and admiration for Trafford, and it
      was no new thing that he should desire a business co-operation. He had been working for that
      in the old days at Riplings; he had never altogether let the possibility drop out of sight
      between them in spite of Trafford's repudiations. He believed himself to be a scientific man
      turned to business, but indeed his whole passion was for organization and finance. He knew he
      could do everything but originate, and in Trafford he recognized just that rare combination of
      an obstinate and penetrating simplicity with constructive power which is the essential blend
      in the making of great intellectual initiatives. To Trafford belonged the secret of novel and
      unsuspected solutions;
      <pb n="349"/> what were fixed barriers and unsurmountable conditions to trained investigators
      and commonplace minds, would yield to his gift of magic inquiry. He could startle the accepted
      error into self-betrayal. Other men might play the game of business infinitely better than
      he—Solomonson knew, indeed, quite well that he himself could play the game infinitely better
      than Trafford—but it rested with Trafford by right divine of genius to alter the rules. If
      only he could be induced to alter the rules secretly, unostentatiously, on a business footing,
      instead of making catastrophic plunges into publicity! And everything that had made Trafford
      up to the day of his marriage was antagonistic to such strategic reservations. The servant of
      science has as such no concern with personal consequences; his business is the steady,
      relentless clarification of knowledge. The human affairs he changes, the wealth he makes or
      destroys, are no concern of his; once these things weigh with him, become primary, he has lost
      his honour as a scientific man.</p>
<p>"But you <hi>must</hi> think of consequences," Solomonson had cried during those
      intermittent talks at Vevey. "Here you are, shying this cheap synthetic rubber of yours into
      the world—for it's bound to be cheap! any one can see that—like a bomb into a market-place.
      What's the good of saying you don't care about the market-place, that <hi>your</hi> business
      is just to make bombs and drop them out of the window? You smash up things just the same. Why!
      you'll ruin hundreds and thousands of people, people living on rubber shares, people working
      in plantations, old, inadaptable workers in rubber works...."</p>
<p>Sir Rupert was now still a little incredulous of Trafford's change of purpose, and for a
      time argued conceded points. Then slowly he came to the conditions
      <pb n="350"/> and methods of the new relationship. He sketched out a scheme of co-operation
      and understandings between his firm and Trafford, between them both and his associated group
      in the city.</p>
<p>Behrens was to have rope and produce his slump in plantation shares, then Trafford was to
      publish his criticism of Behrens, reserving only that catalytic process which was his own
      originality, the process that was to convert the inert, theoretically correct synthetic
      rubber, with a mysterious difference in the quality of its phases, into the real right thing.
      With Behrens exploded, plantation shares would recover, and while their friends in the city
      manipulated that, Trafford would resign his professorship and engage himself to an
      ostentatious promotion syndicate for the investigation of synthetic rubber. His discovery
      would follow immediately the group had cleared itself of plantation shares; indeed he could
      begin planning the necessary works forthwith; the large scale operations in the process were
      to be protected as far as possible by patents, but its essential feature, the addition of a
      specific catalytic agent, could be safely dealt with as a secret process.</p>
<p>"I hate secrecy," said Trafford.</p>
<p>"Business," interjected Solomonson, and went on with his exposition of the relative
      advantages of secrecy and patent rights. It was all a matter of just how many people you had
      to trust. As that number increased, the more and more advisable did it become to put your
      cards on the table and risk the complex uncertain protection of the patent law. They went into
      elaborate calculations, clerks were called upon to hunt up facts and prices, and the table was
      presently littered with waste arithmetic.</p>
<p>"I believe we can do the stuff at tenpence a
      <pb n="351"/> pound," said Solomonson, leaning back in his chair at last, and rattling his
      fountain pen between his teeth, "so soon, that is, as we deal in quantity. Tenpence! We can
      lower the price and spread the market, sixpence by sixpence. In the end—there won't be any
      more plantations. Have to grow tea.... I say, let's have an invalid dinner of chicken and
      champagne, and go on with this. It's fascinating. You can telephone."</p>
<p>They dined together, and Solomonson on champagne rather than chicken. His mind, which had
      never shown an instant's fatigue, began to glow and sparkle. This enterprise, he declared, was
      to be only the first of a series of vigorous exploitations. The whole thing warmed him. He
      would rather make ten thousand by such developments, than a hundred thousand by mere
      speculation. Trafford had but scratched the surface of his mine of knowledge. "Let's think of
      other things," said Sir Rupert Solomonson. "Diamonds! No! They've got too many tons stowed
      away already. A diamond now—it's an absolutely artificial value. At any time a new discovery
      and one wild proprietor might bust that show. Lord!—diamonds! Metals? Of course you've worked
      the colloids chiefly. I suppose there's been more done in metals and alloys than anywhere.
      There's a lot of other substances. Business has hardly begun to touch substances yet, you
      know, Trafford—flexible glass, for example, and things like that. So far we've always taken
      substances for granted. On our side, I mean. It's extraordinary how narrow the outlook of
      business and finance is—still. It never seems to lead to things, never thinks ahead. In this
      case of rubber, for example——"</p>
<p>"When men fight for their own hands and for
      <pb n="352"/> profit and position in the next ten years or so, I suppose they tend to become
      narrow."</p>
<p>"I suppose they must." Sir Rupert's face glowed with a new idea, and his voice dropped a
      little lower. "But what a pull they get, Trafford, if perhaps—they don't, eh?"</p>
<p>"No," said Trafford with a smile and a sigh, "the other sort gets the pull."</p>
<p>"Not <hi>this</hi> time," said Solomonson; "not with you to spot processes and me to figure
      out the cost—" he waved his hands to the litter that had been removed to a side table—"and
      generally see how the business end of things is going...."</p>
