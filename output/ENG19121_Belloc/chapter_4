<t:head>CHAPTER IV</t:head>
<t:p>As the young man came into the dining-room he glanced over to where Mrs. Bailey was sitting
     and then he looked away, and, unfolding his table napkin, paid no more attention to the only
     other occupant of the room.</t:p>
<t:p>Now this was a very trifling fact, and yet it surprised our young Englishwoman; she had
     become accustomed to the way in which Frenchmen, or perhaps it would be more true to say
     Parisians, stare at a pretty woman in the streets, in omnibuses, and in shops. As for the
     dining-room of the Hôtel de l'Horloge, it always seemed full of eyes when she and Anna Wolsky
     were having lunch or dinner there.</t:p>
<t:p>Now, for the first time, she found herself close to a Frenchman without feeling either
     uncomfortably or amusingly aware of a steady, unwinking stare. It was quite an odd sensation to
     find herself thus neglected!</t:p>
<t:p>Without actually looking round, Sylvia, out of the corner of her blue eye, could see this
     exceptional Frenchman. He was dressed in white flannels, and he wore rather bright pink socks
     and a pink tie to match. He must be, she decided, something of a dandy. Though still a young
     man, he was rather bald, and he had a thick fair moustache. He looked bored and very grave; she
     could not help wondering why he was staying at Lacville.</t:p>
<t:p>M. Polperro suddenly appeared at the door. "Would M. le Comte prefer scrambled eggs or an
     omelette?" he asked obsequiously, and "M. le Comte" lifted his head and answered shortly, but
     with a smile, "Scrambled eggs, my good Polperro."</t:p>
<t:p>Doubtless this was the gentleman who was brother-in-law of the French Duke mentioned by M.
     Girard. He spoke to the chef with the kindly familiarity born of long knowledge.</t:p>
<t:p>After having given the Count his scrambled eggs, the young waitress came over to where Sylvia
     was sitting. "Would Madame like to have her coffee in the garden?" she asked; and Sylvia said
     that she would.</t:p>
<t:p>How enchanting was the garden of the Villa du Lac, and how unlike any hotel garden she had
     ever seen! The smooth, wide lawn was shaded with noble cedars and bright green chestnut trees;
     it was paradise compared with the rather stuffy little Hôtel de l'Horloge and the dusty Paris
     streets.</t:p>
<t:p>M. Polperro himself brought Sylvia's coffee. Then he stayed on talking to her, for like all
     clever hotel-keepers the Southerner had the gift of making those who were staying in his house
     feel as if they were indeed his guests rather than his clients.</t:p>
<t:p>"If Madame should ever care to make a little stay at Lacville, how happy Madame Polperro and
     I would be!" he exclaimed. "I have a beautiful room overlooking the lake which I could give
     Madame. It was reserved for a Russian Princess, but now she is not coming—"</t:p>
<t:p>"Perhaps I will come and stay here some day," said Sylvia, and she really felt as if she
     would like to come and stay in the Villa du Lac. "But I am going to Switzerland next week, so
     it will have to be the next time I come to France in the summer."</t:p>
<t:p>"Does Madame play?" asked M. Polperro, insinuatingly.</t:p>
<t:p>"I?" said Sylvia, laughing. "No, indeed! Of course, I play bridge—all English people play
     bridge—but I have never gambled, if you mean that, monsieur, in my life."</t:p>
<t:p>"I am delighted to hear Madame say so," said M. Polperro, heartily. "People now talk of
     Lacville as if there was only the Casino and the play. They forget the beautiful walks, the
     lovely lake, and the many other attractions we have to offer! Why, Madame, think of the Forest
     of Montmorency? In old days it was quite a drive from Lacville, but now a taxi or an automobile
     will get you there in a few minutes! Still the Casino is very attractive too; and all
      <t:hi>my</t:hi> clients belong to the Club!"</t:p>
<t:p>Sylvia stayed on for nearly an hour in the delightful, peaceful garden, and then, rather
     regretfully, she went up the lichen-covered steps which led into the hall. How deliciously cool
     and quiet it was there.</t:p>
<t:p>She paid her bill; it seemed very moderate considering how good her lunch had been, and then
     slowly made her way out of the Villa du Lac, down across the stone-flagged courtyard to the
     gate, and so into the sanded road.</t:p>
<t:p>Crossing over, she began walking by the edge of the lake; and once more loneliness fell upon
     her. The happy-looking people who passed her laughing and talking together, and the more silent
     couples who floated by on the water in the quaint miniature sailing boats with which the
     surface of the lake was now dotted, were none of them alone.</t:p>
<t:p>Suddenly the old parish church of Lacville chimed out the hour—it was only one
     o'clock—amazingly early still!</t:p>
<t:p>Someone coming across the road lifted his hat. Could it be to her? Yes, for it was the young
     man who had shared with her, for a time, the large dining-room of the Villa du Lac.</t:p>
<t:p>Again Sylvia was struck by what she could only suppose were the stranger's good manners, for
     instead of staring at her, as even the good-humoured bourgeois with whom she had travelled from
     Paris that morning had done, the Count—she remembered he was a Count—turned sharply to the
     right and walked briskly along to the turning which led to the Casino.</t:p>
<t:p>The Casino? Why, of course, it was there that she must look for Anna Wolsky. How stupid of
     her not to have thought of it! And so, after waiting a moment, she also joined the little
     string of people who were wending their way towards the great white building.</t:p>
<t:p>After having paid a franc for admission, Sylvia found herself in the hall of the Casino of
     Lacville. An eager attendant rushed forward to relieve her of the dust-cloak and parasol which
     she was carrying.</t:p>
<t:p>"Does Madame wish to go straight to the Room of the Games?" he inquired eagerly.</t:p>
<t:p>Sylvia bent her head. It was there, or so she supposed, that Anna would be.</t:p>
<t:p>Feeling a thrill of keen curiosity, she followed the man through a prettily-decorated
     vestibule, and so into a large room, overlooking the lake, where already a crowd of people were
     gathered round the green baize tables.</t:p>
<t:p>The Salle des Jeux at Lacville is a charming, conservatory-like apartment, looking, indeed,
     as if it were actually built out on the water.</t:p>
<t:p>But none of the people were looking at the beautiful scene outside. Instead, each group was
     intent on the table, and on the game being played thereon—a game, it may be mentioned, which
     has a certain affinity with Roulette and Petits Chevaux, though it is neither the one nor the
     other.</t:p>
<t:p>Sylvia looked about her timidly; but no one took the slightest notice of her, and this in
     itself was rather strange. She was used to exciting a good deal of attention wherever she went
     in France, but here, at Lacville, everyone seemed blind to her presence. It was almost as if
     she were invisible! In a way this was a relief to her; but at the same time, she found it
     curiously disconcerting.</t:p>
<t:p>She walked slowly round each gambling table, keeping well outside the various circles of
     people sitting and standing there.</t:p>
<t:p>Strange to say Anna Wolsky was not among them. Of that fact Sylvia soon became quite
     sure.</t:p>
<t:p>At last a servant in livery came up to her. "Does Madame want a seat?" he asked officiously.
     "If so, I can procure Madame a seat in a very few moments."</t:p>
<t:p>But Sylvia, blushing, shook her head. She certainly had no wish to sit down.</t:p>
<t:p>"I only came in to look for a friend," she said, hesitatingly; "but my friend is not
     here."</t:p>
<t:p>And she was making her way out of the Salle des Jeux, feeling rather disconsolate and
     disappointed, when suddenly, in the vestibule, she saw Madame Wolsky walking towards her in the
     company of a middle-aged man.</t:p>
<t:p>"Then that is settled?" Sylvia heard Anna say in her indifferent French. "You will fill up
     all the formalities, and by the time I arrive the card of membership will be ready for me? This
     kind of thing"—she waved her hand towards the large room Sylvia had just left—"is no use to me
     at all! I only like <t:hi>le Grand Jeu</t:hi>"; and a slight smile came over her dark face.</t:p>
<t:p>The man who was with her laughed as if she had made a good joke; then bowing, he left
     her.</t:p>
<t:p>"Sylvia!"</t:p>
<t:p>"Anna!"</t:p>
<t:p>Mrs. Bailey fancied that the other was not particularly sorry to have been followed.</t:p>
<t:p>"So you came after me? Well! Well! I never should have thought to have seen my dear Puritan,
     Sylvia Bailey, in such a place as the Casino of Lacville?" said the Polish lady laughing.
     "However, as you are here, let us enjoy ourselves. Would you like to risk a few francs?"</t:p>
<t:p>Together they had gone back into the Salle des Jeux, and Anna drew Sylvia towards the nearest
     table.</t:p>
<t:p>"This is a child's game!" she exclaimed, contemptuously. "I cannot understand how all these
     clever Parisians can care to come out here and lose their money every Saturday and Sunday, to
     say nothing of other days!"</t:p>
<t:p>"But I suppose some of these people make money?" questioned Sylvia. She thought she saw a
     great deal of money being won, as well as lost, on the green cloth of the table before her.</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh yes, no doubt a few may make money at this game! But I have just been arranging, with the
     aid of the owner of the Pension where I am going to stay when I come here, to join the
     Club."</t:p>
<t:p>And then, realising that Sylvia did not understand, she went on.</t:p>
<t:p>"You see, my dear child, there are two kinds of play here—as there are, indeed, at almost
     every Casino in France. There is <t:hi>this</t:hi> game, which is, as I say, a child's game—a game
     at which you can make or lose a few francs; and then there is Baccarat!"</t:p>
<t:p>She waited a moment.</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes?" said Sylvia questioningly.</t:p>
<t:p>"Baccarat is played here in what they call the Club, in another part of the building. As
     there is an entrance fee to the Club, there is never such a crowd in the Baccarat Room as there
     is here. And those who belong to the Club 'mean business,' as they say in your dear country.
     They come, that is, to play in the way that I understand and that I enjoy play!"</t:p>
<t:p>A little colour rose to Anna Wolsky's sallow cheeks; she looked exhilarated, excited at the
     thoughts and memories her words conjured up.</t:p>
<t:p>Sylvia also felt curiously excited. She found the scene strangely fascinating—the scene
     presented by this crowd of eager men and women, each and all absorbed in this mysterious game
     which looked anything but a child's game, though Anna had called it so.</t:p>
<t:p>But as they were trying to make their way through the now dense crowd of people, the
     middle-aged man who had been with Anna when Sylvia had first seen her just now hurried up to
     them.</t:p>
<t:p>"Everything is arranged, Madame!" he exclaimed. "Here is your membership card. May I have the
     pleasure of taking you myself to the Club? Your friend can come too. She does not want to play,
     does she?"</t:p>
<t:p>He looked inquisitively at Sylvia, and his hard face softened. He had your true Frenchman's
     pleasure in charm and beauty. "Madame, or is it Mademoiselle?—"</t:p>
<t:p>"Madame!" answered Anna, smiling.</t:p>
<t:p>"—Madame can certainly come in and look on for a few moments, even though she be not a member
     of the Club."</t:p>
<t:p>They turned and followed him up a broad, shallow staircase, into a part of the Casino where
     the very atmosphere seemed different from that surrounding the public gaming tables.</t:p>
<t:p>Here, in the Club, all was hushed and quiet, and underfoot was a thick carpet.</t:p>
<t:p>There were very few people in the Baccarat Room, some twelve men, and four or five ladies who
     were broken up into groups, and talking with one another in the intimate, desultory fashion in
     which people talk who meet daily in pursuit of some common interest or hobby.</t:p>
<t:p>And then, all at once, Sylvia Bailey saw that among them, but standing a little apart, was
     the Count—was not his name de Virieu?</t:p>
<t:p>He turned round, and as he saw her she thought that a look of surprise, almost of annoyance,
     flitted over his impassive face. Then he moved away from where he could see her.</t:p>
<t:p>A peculiar-looking old gentleman, who seemed on kindly terms with everyone in the room,
     pulled a large turnip watch out of his pocket. "It is nearly half-past one!" he exclaimed
     fussily. "Surely, it is time that we began! Who takes the Bank to-day?"</t:p>
<t:p>"I will," said the Comte de Virieu, coming forward.</t:p>
<t:p>Five minutes later play was in full swing. Sylvia did not in the least understand the game of
     Baccarat, and she would have been surprised indeed had she been told that the best account of
     it ever written is that which describes it as "neither a recreation nor an intellectual
     exercise, but simply a means for the rapid exchange of money well suited to persons of
     impatient temperament."</t:p>
<t:p>With fascinated eyes, Sylvia watched Anna put down her gold pieces on the green cloth. Then
     she noted the cards as they were dealt out, and listened, it must be admitted,
     uncomprehendingly, to the mysterious words which told how the game was going. Still she
     sympathised very heartily with her friend when Anna's gold pieces were swept away, and she
     rejoiced as heartily when gold was added to Anna's little pile.</t:p>
<t:p>They both stood, refusing the seats which were pressed upon them.</t:p>
<t:p>Suddenly Sylvia Bailey, looking up from the green cloth, saw the eyes of the man who held the
     Bank fixed full upon her.</t:p>
<t:p>The Comte de Virieu did not gaze at the young English woman with the bold, impersonal stare
     to which she had become accustomed—his glance was far more thoughtful, questioning, and in a
     sense kindly. But his eyes seemed to pierce her through and through, and suddenly her heart
     began to beat very fast. Yet no colour came into her face—indeed, Sylvia grew pale.</t:p>
<t:p>She looked down at the table, but even so she remained conscious of that piercing gaze turned
     on her, and with some surprise she found herself keenly visualising the young man's face.</t:p>
<t:p>Alone among all the people in the room, the Comte de Virieu looked as if he lived a more or
     less outdoor life; his face was tanned, his blue eyes were very bright, and the hands dealing
     out the cards were well-shaped and muscular. Somehow he looked very different, she could hardly
     explain how or why, from the men round him.</t:p>
<t:p>At last she moved round, so as to avoid being opposite to him.</t:p>
<t:p>Yes, she felt more comfortable now, and slowly, almost insensibly, the glamour of play began
     to steal over Sylvia Bailey's senses. She began to understand the at once very simple and, to
     the uninitiated, intricate game of Baccarat—to long, as Anna Wolsky longed, for the fateful
     nine, eight, five, and four to be turned up.</t:p>
<t:p>She had fifty francs in her purse, and she ached to risk a gold piece.</t:p>
<t:p>"Do you think I might put down ten francs?" she whispered to Anna.</t:p>
<t:p>And the other laughed, and exclaimed, "Yes, of course you can!"</t:p>
<t:p>Sylvia put down a ten-franc piece, and a moment later it had become twenty francs.</t:p>
<t:p>"Leave it on," murmured Anna, "and see what happens—"</t:p>
<t:p>Sylvia followed her friend's advice, and a larger gold piece was added to the two already
     there.</t:p>
<t:p>She took up the forty francs with a curious thrill of joy and fear.</t:p>
<t:p>But then an untoward little incident took place. One of the liveried men-servants stepped
     forward. "Has Madame got her card of membership?" he inquired smoothly.</t:p>
<t:p>Sylvia blushed painfully. No, she had not got a card of membership—and there had been an
     implied understanding that she was only to look on, not play.</t:p>
<t:p>She felt terribly ashamed—a very unusual feeling for Sylvia Bailey—and the gold pieces she
     held in her hand, for she had not yet put them in her purse, felt as if they burnt her.</t:p>
<t:p>But she found a friend, a defender in an unexpected quarter. The Count rose from the table.
     He said a few words in a low tone to the servant, and the man fell back.</t:p>
<t:p>"Of course, this young lady may play," he addressed Anna, "and as Banker I wish her all good
     luck! This is probably her first and her last visit to Lacville." He smiled pleasantly, and a
     little sadly. Sylvia noticed that he had a low, agreeable voice.</t:p>
<t:p>"Take her away, Madame, when she has won a little more! Do not give her time to lose what she
     has won."</t:p>
<t:p>He spoke exactly as if Sylvia was a child. She felt piqued, and Madame Wolsky stared at him
     rather haughtily. Still, she was grateful for his intervention.</t:p>
<t:p>"We thank you, Monsieur," she said stiffly. "But I think we have been here quite long
     enough."</t:p>
<t:p>He bowed, and again sat down.</t:p>
<t:p>"I will now take you a drive, Sylvia. We have had sufficient of this!"</t:p>
<t:p>Anna walked towards the door, and many were the curious glances now turned after the two
     friends.</t:p>
<t:p>"It will amuse you to see something of Lacville. As that gentleman said, I do not suppose you
     will ever come here again. And, as I shall spend most of my time in the Casino, I can very well
     afford to spare a little while out of it to-day!"</t:p>
<t:p>They made their way out of the great white building, Sylvia feeling oppressed, almost
     bewildered, by her first taste of gambling.</t:p>
<t:p>It was three o'clock, and very hot. They hailed one of the little open carriages which are
     among the innocent charms of Lacville.</t:p>
<t:p>"First you will go round the lake," said Madame Wolsky to the driver, "and then you will take
     us to the Pension Malfait, in l'Avenue des Acacias."</t:p>
<t:p>Under shady trees, bowling along sanded roads lined with pretty villas and châlets, they
     drove all round the lake, and more and more the place impressed Sylvia as might have done a
     charming piece of scene-painting.</t:p>
<t:p>All the people they passed on the road, in carriages, in motor-cars, and on foot, looked
     happy, prosperous, gay, and without a care in the world; and where in the morning there had
     been one boat, there were now five sailing on the blue, gleaming waters fringed with trees and
     flowering shrubs.</t:p>
<t:p>At last they once more found themselves close to the Casino. A steady stream of people was
     now pouring in through the great glass doors.</t:p>
<t:p>"This sort of thing will go on up till about nine this evening!" said Anna, smiling grimly.
     "Think, my dear—a hundred and twenty trains daily! That room in the Casino where I first saw
     you will be crammed to suffocation within an hour, and even the Club will be well filled,
     though I fancy the regular habitués of the club are rather apt to avoid Saturday and Sunday at
     Lacville. I myself, when living here, shall try to do something else on those two days. By the
     way—how dreadful that I should forget!—have you had a proper <t:hi>déjeuner</t:hi>?" she looked
     anxiously at Sylvia.</t:p>
<t:p>Sylvia laughed, and told something of her adventures at the Villa du Lac.</t:p>
<t:p>"The Villa du Lac? I have heard of it, but surely it's an extremely expensive hotel? The
     place I've chosen for myself is farther away from the Casino; but the distance will force me to
     take a walk every day, and that will be a very good thing. Last time I was at Monte Carlo I had
     a lodging right up in Monaco, and I found that a very much healthier plan than to live close to
     the Casino," Anna spoke quite seriously. "The Pension Malfait is really extraordinarily cheap
     for a place near Paris. I am only going to pay fifty-five francs a week, <t:hi>tout
     compris</t:hi>!"</t:p>
<t:p>They had now turned from the road encircling the lake, and were driving through leafy avenues
     which reminded Sylvia of a London suburb where she had once stayed.</t:p>
<t:p>The châlets and villas by which they passed were not so large nor so prosperous-looking as
     those that bordered the lake, but still many of them were pretty and fantastic-looking little
     houses, and the gardens were gay with flowers.</t:p>
<t:p>"I suppose no one lives here in the winter!" said Sylvia suddenly.</t:p>
<t:p>She had noticed, for in some ways she was very observant though in other ways strangely
     unseeing, that all the flowers were of the bedding-out varieties; there were luxuriant
     creepers, but not a single garden that she passed had that indefinable look of being an old or
     a well-tended garden.</t:p>
<t:p>"In the winter? Why, in the winter Lacville is an absolute desert," said Anna laughing. "You
     see, the Casino only has a summer Concession; it cannot open till April 15. Of course there are
     people who will tell you that Lacville is the plague-pit of Paris, but that's all nonsense!
     Lacville is neither better nor worse than other towns near the capital!"</t:p>
<t:p>The carriage had now drawn up before a large, plain, white house, across which was painted in
     huge, black letters, "Hôtel-Pension Malfait."</t:p>
<t:p>"This is the place I have found!" exclaimed Anna. "Would you care to come in and see the room
     I've engaged from next Monday week?"</t:p>
<t:p>Sylvia followed her into the house with curiosity and interest. Somehow she did not like the
     Pension Malfait, though it was clear that it had once been a handsome private mansion standing
     in large grounds of its own. The garden, however, had now been cut down to a small strip, and
     the whole place formed a great contrast to the gay and charming Villa du Lac.</t:p>
<t:p>What garden there was seemed uncared for, though an attempt had been made to make it look
     pretty with the aid of a few geraniums and marguerites.</t:p>
<t:p>M. Malfait, the proprietor of the Pension, whom Sylvia had already seen with Anna at the
     Casino, now came forward in the hall, and Sylvia compared him greatly to his disadvantage, to
     the merry M. Polperro.</t:p>
<t:p>"Madame has brought her friend?" he said eagerly, and staring at Sylvia as he spoke. "I hope
     that Madame's friend will come and stay with us too? I have a charming room which I could give
     this lady; but later on we shall be very full—full all the summer! The hot weather is a godsend
     for Lacville; for it drives the Parisians out from their unhealthy city."</t:p>
<t:p>He beckoned to his wife, a disagreeable-looking woman who was sitting in a little glass cage
     made in an angle of the square hall.</t:p>
<t:p>"Madame Wolsky has brought this good lady to see our Pension!" he exclaimed, "and perhaps she
     is also coming to stay with us—"</t:p>
<t:p>In vain Sylvia smilingly shook her head. She was made to go all over the large, rather gloomy
     house, and to peep into each of the bare, ugly bed-rooms.</t:p>
<t:p>That which Anna had engaged had a window looking over the back of the house; Sylvia thought
     it singularly cheerless. There was, however, a good arm-chair and a writing-table on which lay
     a new-looking blotter. It was the only bed-room containing such a luxury.</t:p>
<t:p>"An English lady was staying here not very long ago," observed M. Malfait, "and she bought
     that table and left it to me as a little gift when she went away. That was very gracious on her
     part!"</t:p>
<t:p>They glanced into the rather mournful-looking <t:hi>salon</t:hi>, of which the windows opened out
     on the tiny garden. And then M. Malfait led them proudly into the dining-room, with its one
     long table, running down the middle, on which at intervals were set dessert dishes filled with
     the nuts, grapes, and oranges of which Sylvia had already become so weary at the Hôtel de
     l'Horloge.</t:p>
<t:p>"My clientèle," said M. Malfait gravely, "is very select and <t:hi>chic</t:hi>. Those of my
     guests who frequent the Casino all belong to the Club!"</t:p>
<t:p>He stated the fact proudly, and Sylvia was amused to notice that in this matter he and mine
     host at the Villa du Lac apparently saw eye to eye. Both were eager to dissociate themselves
     from the ordinary gambler who lost or won a few francs in those of the gambling rooms open to
     the general public.</t:p>
<t:p>"Well," said Anna at last, "I suppose we had better leave now, but we might as well go on
     driving for about an hour, and then, when it is a little cooler, we will go back to Paris and
     be there in time for tea."</t:p>
<t:p>The driver was as good-natured as everyone else at Lacville seemed to be. He drove his fares
     away from the town, and so to the very outskirts of Lacville, where there were many charming
     bits of wild woodland and gardens up for sale.</t:p>
<t:p>"Even five years ago," he said, "much of this was forest, Mesdames; but now—well, Dame!—you
     can understand people are eager to sell. There are rumours that the Concession may be withdrawn
     from the Casino—that would be terrible, some say it would kill Lacville! It would be all the
     same to me, I should always find work elsewhere. But it makes everyone eager to sell—those, I
     mean, who have land at Lacville. There are others," continued the man—he had turned round on
     his seat, and the horse was going at a foot's pace—"who declare that it would be far better for
     the town—that there would be a more solid population established here—you understand, Mesdames,
     what I mean? The Lacville tradesmen would be as pleased, quite as pleased, or so some of them
     say; but, all the same, they are selling their land!"</t:p>
<t:p>When the two friends finally got back to the Hôtel de l'Horloge, Sylvia Bailey found that a
     letter, which had not been given to her that morning, contained the news that the English
     friends whom she had been expecting to join in Switzerland the following week had altered their
     plans, and were no longer going abroad.</t:p>
</t:div>
