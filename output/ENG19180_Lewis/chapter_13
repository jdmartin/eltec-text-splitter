<head>CHAPTER IX</head>
<p>Otto’s compatriots at the Berne were sober and thoughtful, with discipline in their
      idleness. Their monthly moneys flowed and ebbed, it was to be supposed, small regular tides
      frothing monotonously in form of beer. This rather desolate place of chatter, papers, and
      airy, speculative business had the charm of absence of gusto.</p>
<p>Kreisler was ingrainedly antiquated, purer German. He had experienced suddenly
      home-sickness, that often overtakes voluntary exiles at the turn of their life — <hi>his</hi>
      being, not for Germany, exactly, but for the romantic, stiff ideals of the German student of
      his generation. It was a home-sickness for his early self. Like knack of riding a bicycle or
      anything learnt in youth, this character was easily assumed. He was gradually discovering the
      foundations of his personality. Many previous moods and phases of his' nature were mounting to
      the surface.</p>
<p>Arrived in front of the Cafe Berne, he stood for fifteen minutes looking up and down the
      street, at the pavement, his watch, the passers-by. Then he chose the billiard-room door to
      avoid the principal one, where he usually entered.</p>
<p>All the ugly familiarity of this place, he hated with methodic, deliberate hatred; taking
      things one by one, as it were, persons and objects. "The <hi>garçon’s </hi>spasmodic running
      about was like a gnat’s energy over stagnation.</p>
<p>Passing from the billiard-room to a gangway with several tables, his dull, exasperated eye
      fell on something it did not understand. How could it be expected 
      <pb n="112"/> to understand ? It was an eye and it stuck. It was simple, though. It was amazed
      and did not understand.</p>
<p><hi>Anastasya.</hi></p>
<p>Set in the heart of this ennui, it arrested the mind like a brick wall some carter drowsed
      on his wagon. Stopping dead, Kreisler stared stupidly. Anastasya was sitting there with
      Soltyk. With Soltyk ! He seemed about to speak to them — they, at least, were under this
      impression. Quite naturally he was about to do this, like a child. As though in intense
      abstraction, he fixed his eyes on them. Then he took a step towards them, possibly with the
      idea of sitting down beside them. Consciousness set in, with a tropic tide of rage, and
      carried him at a brisk pace towards the door, corresponding to the billiard-room door, on the
      other side of the cafe. Yet in the midst of this he instinctively raised his hat a little, his
      eyes fixed now on his feet.</p>
<p>He was in a great hurry to get past the two people sitting there. This could not be done
      without discovering two inches of the scalp for a moment — as an impatient man in a crush,
      wishing to pass, pushes another aside, raising his hat at the same time to have the right to
      be rude.</p>
<p>Same table on <hi>terrasse</hi> as an hour before. But Kreisler seemed sitting on air, or
      one of those wooden whirling platforms in the fetes.</p>
<p>The <hi>garçon,</hi> with a femininely pink, virile face which, in a spirit of fun, he kept
      constantly wooden and solemn except when, having taken your order, he winked or smiled — came
      up hastily.</p>
<p>“Was wünschen Sie ?” he asked, wiping the table with a serviette. He had learned a few
      words of German from the customers. Supposing Kreisler rather a touchy man, he always
      attempted to put him at his ease, as the running of bills was valuable to him. He had
      confidence in this client, and wished the bill to assume vague and profitable proportions.</p>
<p>Kreisler’s thoughts dashed and stunned themselves against this waiter. His mind stood
      stock-still for
      <pb n="113"/>                several minutes. This pink wooden face paralysed everything. As
      its owner thought “the young man” was having a joke with him, it became still
      more humorously wooden. The more wooden it became, the more paralysed became Kreisler’s
      intelligence. He stared at him more and more oddly, till the <hi>garçon </hi>was forced to
      laugh. As a matter of fact, Kreisler mentally was steadying himself on this hard personality.
      As he had appeared to walk deliberately with hot intention to his seat, so he seemed
      gazing deliberately at the waiter and choosing his drink. Then the dam gave way. He hated this
      familiar face; his thought smashed and buffeted it. Such commercial modicum of astute good
      nature was too much. It was kindness that only equilibrium could ignore. The expression of his
      own face became distorted. The <hi>garçon</hi> fixed him with his eye and took a step back,
      with dog-like doubt, behind the next table.</p>
<p>Anastasya had smiled in a very encouraging way as he passed. This had offended him
      extremely. Soltyk — Anastasya ; Soltyk — Anastasya. That was a bad coupling ! His sort of
      persecution mania seized him by the throat. This had done it! Soltyk, who had got hold of
      Volker and was the something that had interfered between that borrowable quantity and himself,
      occupied a position not unsimilar to his stepmother. Volker and his father, who had kept him
      suspended in idleness, and who now both were withdrawing or had withdrawn like diminishing
      jets of water, did not attract the full force of his indolent, tragic grumpiness.</p>
<p>Behind Ernst and his parent Soltyk and his stepmother stood.</p>
<p>A certain lonely and comic ego all people carry about with them, who is always dumb except
      when they get drunk or become demented. It then talks, never sincerely, but in a sort of
      representative, pungent way. This ego in Kreisler’s case would not have been shameless and
      cynical if it had begun to grumble about Volker. It would have said, “Hang that little 
      <pb n="114"/> Ernst! I come to Paris, I am ashamed to say, partly for him. But the little
      swine-dog has given me the go-by. Hell take his impudence! I don’t like that swine-dog Soltyk
      !He’s a slimy Russian rascal!” It would not have said : “I’ve lost the access to Ernst’s
      pocket. The pig-dog Soltyk is sitting there!”</p>
<p>In any case his vanity too was hurt.</p>
<p>Anastasya now provided him with an acceptable platform from which his vexation might spring
      at Soltyk. There was no money or insignificant male liaison to stuff him down into grumpiness.
      “Das Weib” was there. All was in order for unbounded inflammation.</p>
<p>He wanted to bury his fear in her hot hair; he wanted to kiss her lips as he had never
      kissed any woman’s; all the things he wanted — ! But what would Soltyk be doing about it ? He
      had met her alone, and that was all right and not impossible with a world made by their
      solitary meeting in the restaurant. He had lived with her instinctively in this solitary world
      of he and she. It was quite changed at present. Soltyk had got into it. Soltyk, by
      implication, brought a host of others, even if he did not mean that he was a definite rival
      there himself. What was he saying to her now ? Sneers and ridicule, oceans of sneers directed
      at himself, more than ten thousand men could have discharged, he felt, certainly were
      inundating her ear. His stepmother-fiancée, other tales, were being retailed.
       <hi>Everything </hi> that would conceivably prejudice Anastasya, or would not, he accepted as
      already retailed. There he sat, like a coward. He was furious at their distant insulting
      equanimity.</p>
<p>A breath of violent excitement struck him, coming from within. He stirred dully beneath it.
      She was there; he had only put a thin partition between them. His heart beat slowly and
      ponderously. “On hearing what the swine Soltyk has to say she will remember my conduct in the
      restaurant and my appearance. She will make it all fit in. And, by 
      <pb n="115"/> God, it does fit in! Himmel! Himmel! there’s nothing to be done ! Anything I
      did, every movement, would only be filling out the figure my ass-tricks have cut for her !”</p>
<p>He was as conscious of the interior, which he could not see from his place on the street, as
      though, passing through, he had just found the walls, tables, chairs, painted bright scarlet.
      He felt he had left a wake of seething agitation in his passage of the café Passing the two
      people inside there had been the affair of a moment, not yet grasped. This experience,
      apparently of the past, was still going on. The sense’s picture, even, was not yet complete.
      New facts, details, were added every moment. He was still passing Anastasya and Soltyk. He sat
      on, trembling, at the door. There were other exits. She might be gone. But he forgot about
      them.</p>
<p>How he had worried himself about the pawned suit. Fate had directed him there to the café to
      save him the trouble of further racking his brains about it. Should he leave Paris? But he was
      mutinous. The occurrence of this idea filled him with suspicions.</p>
<p>The fit was over; reaction had set in. He was eyeing himself obliquely in the looking-glass
      behind his head.</p>
<p>He almost jumped away at two voices beside him, and the thrilling sound of a dress ; it was
      as though some one had spoken with his own voice. It seemed all round him, attacking him. The
      thin, ordinary brushing of a skirt was like the low breathing of a hidden animal to a man in
      the forest. He felt they were coming to speak to him — just as they had thought that he was.
      The nerves on that side of his head twitched as though shrinking from a touch.</p>
<p>They were crossing the <hi>terrasse</hi> to the street. His heart beat a slow march. Her
      image there had become used. The reality, in its lightning correction of this, dug into his
      mind. There once more the real figure had its separate and foreign life. He was disagreeably
      struck by a certain air of depression and cheerlessness in the two figures before him. This 
      <pb n="116"/> one thing that should have been pleasant, displeased him. He was angry as though
      she had been shamming melancholy.</p>
<p>They were not talking, the best proof of familiarity. A strange figure occurred to him ; he
      felt like a man, with all organs, bones, tissues complete, but made of cheap perishable stuff,
      who could only live for a day and then die of use.</p>
<p>This image, reality now before him, had drawn out all his energy, like a distinct being
      nourished by him. The image, intact in his mind, had returned him more or less the vigour
      spent. Her listlessness seemed a complement of the weakness he now felt. Energy was ebbing
      away from both.</p>
<p>He stared with bloodshot eyes. Then he got up and began walking after her. Soltyk, on
      hearing steps, turned round; but he made no remark to Anastasya. They crossed the street and
      got into a passing tram. Otto Kreisler went back to the café</p>
<p>It was like returning to some hall where there had been a banquet to find empty chairs,
      empty bottles, and disorder. The vacant seats around seemed to have been lately vacated. Then
      there was the sensation of being left behind. The Café Berne was a solitary and antediluvian
      place. Everything began to thrust itself upon him — the people, street, insignificant
      incidents — as though this indifferent life of facts, in the vanishing of the life of the
      imagination, had now become important, being the only thing left. Common life seemed rushing
      in and claiming him, and emphasizing his defeat and the new condition thus inaugurated. He
      went to Lejeune’s for dinner. During the whole day he had been in feverish hurry, constantly
      seeing time narrowing in upon him. Now he had a sensation of intolerable leisure.</p>
<p>The useless ennui of his life presented itself to him for the thousandth time, but now
      clearly. This fact seemed to have been waiting with irritating calm, as though to say, “As
      soon as you can give me your attention ? — Well, what are you going to do with me ?” For he
      had compromised himself irretrievably.</p>
<pb n="117"/>
<p>He knew that sooner or later he must marry and settle down with this stony fact, multiply
      its image. Things had gone too far.</p>
<p>And how about his father ? What was that letter going to contain ? His father had got a
      certain amount of pleasure out of him. Otto had satisfied in him in turn the desire of
      possession (that objects such as your watch, your house, which could equally well belong to
      anybody, do not satisfy), of authority (that servants do not satisfy), of self-complacency
      (that self does not): had been to him, later, a kind of living cinematograph and travel-book
      combined; and, finally, had inadvertently lured with his youth a handsome young woman into the
      paternal net. But he knew that he could procure no further satisfaction to this satiated
      parent. He could be henceforth a source only of irritation and expense.</p>
<p>After dinner he walked along the boulevard. The dark made him adventurous. He peered into
      cafés as he passed. He noticed it was already eight. Supposing he should meet some of the
      women on the way to Fraulein Lipmann’s ? He made a movement as though to turn down a
      side-street and hide himself at thought of possible confrontation. Next moment he was walking
      on obstinately in the direction of the Lipmann’s house. His weakness drew him on, back into
      the vortex. Anything, death, and annihilation, was better than going back into that terrible
      colourless mood. His room, the cafe, waited for him like executioners. He had escaped from it
      for a time. Late agitations had given him temporary freedom, to which he was now committed.
      Dressed as he was, extremely untidy, he would go to Fraulein Lipmann’s flat. Only humiliation
      he knew awaited him in that direction. If Anastasya were there (he would have it that she
      would be found wherever he least would care to see her) then anything might happen. But he
      wanted to suffer still more by her ; <hi>physically,</hi> as it were, under her eyes. That
      would be a relief from present suffering. He must look in her eyes ; he must excite in her the
      maximum of contempt and 
      <pb n="118"/> dislike. He wanted to be in her presence again, with full consciousness that his
      mechanical idyll was barred by Fate. Not strong enough to leave things as they were, he could
      not go away with this incomplete and, physically, uncertain picture behind him. It was as
      though a man had lost a prize and wanted written and stamped statement that he had lost it.
      He wished to shame her. If he did not directly insult her, he would at least insult her by
      thrusting himself on her. Then, at height of her disgust, he would pretend again to make
      advances.</p>
<p>As to the rest of the party, a sour glee possessed him at thought of <hi>their</hi> state by
      the time he had done with them. He already saw their faces in fancy when he should ring their
      bell and present himself, old morning suit, collar none too clean, dusty boots. All this
      self-humiliation and suffering he was preparing for himself was wedded with the thought of
      retaliation. Kreisler’s schooldays could have supplied him with a parallel if he could have
      thought just then. He saw a curious scene proceeding beneath a desk in class. The boy next to
      him had jabbed his neighbour in the hand with a penknife. The latter, pale with fury, held his
      hand out in sinister invitation, hissing, “Do it again ! do it again!” The boy next
      to Kreisler complied. “Do it again !” came still fiercer. He seemed to want to see his hand
      a mass of wounds and delect himself with the awful feeling of his own rage. Kreisler did not
      know how he should wipe out this debt with the world, but he wanted it bigger, more crushing.
      The bitter fascination of suffering drew him on to substitute real wounds for imaginary.</p>
<p>Near Fraulein Lipmann’s house he rubbed his shoulder against a piece of whitewashed wall
      with a grin. He went rapidly up the stairs leading to her flat on the entresol, considering a
      scheme for the commencement of the evening. This seemed so happy that he felt further
      resourcefulness in misconduct would not be wanting.</p>
