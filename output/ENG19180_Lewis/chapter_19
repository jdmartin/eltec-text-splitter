<head>     CHAPTER IV</head>
<p>Bertha’s friends looked for her elsewhere, nowadays, than at her rooms. Tarr was always
      likely to be found there in impolite possession. She made them come as often as she could ;
      her coquetry as regards her carefully arranged rooms needed satisfaction. She suffered in the
      midst of her lonely tastefulness. But Tarr had certainly made these rooms a rather
      deserted place. Since the dance none of her women friends had come. She had spent an hour or
      two with them at the restaurant.</p>
<p>At the dance she had kept rather apart. Dazed, after a shock, and needing self-collection,
      was the line sketched. Her account of things could not, of course, be blurted out anyhow. It
      had to grow out of circumstances. It, of course, must be given. She had not yet given it. But
      haste must be avoided. For its particular type, as long a time as possible must be allowed to
      elapse before she spoke of what had happened. It must almost seem as though she were going to
      say nothing; sudden, perfect, and very impressive silence on her part. To accustom their minds
      to her silence would make speech all the more imposing, when it came. At a café after the
      dance her account of the thing flowered grudgingly, drawn forth by the ambient heat of the
      discussion.</p>
<p>They were as yet at the stage of exclamations, no <hi>malveillant</hi> theory yet having
      been definitely formed about Kreisler.</p>
<p>“He came there on purpose to create a disturbance. Whatever for, I wonder !”</p>
<p>“I expect it was the case of Fraulein Fogs over again.” (Kreisler had, on a former
      occasion, paid his court to a lady of this name, with resounding unsuccess.)</p>
<p>“If I’d have known what was going on, I’d have dealt with him !” said one of the men.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say he told a pack of lies, René——?”</p>
<p>Fraulein Lipmann had been sitting, her eyes fixed on a tram drawn up near by, watching the
      people evacuating the central platform, and others restocking it. The discussion and
      exclamations of her friends did not, it would appear, interest her. It would have been, no
      doubt, scandalously unnatural if Kreisler had not been execrated. But anything they could say
      was negligible and inadequate to cope with the “Gemeine alte Sau.” The tameness of their
      reflections on and indignation against Kreisler when compared with the terrific corroding of
      this epithet (known only to her) made her sulky and impatient.</p>
<p>Applied to in this way directly about the lies, she</p>
<pb n="160"/>
<p>turned to the others and said, as it were interposing herself regally at last in their
      discussion :</p>
<p>“Ecoutez — listen,” she began, leaning towards the greater number of them, seeming to say,
      “It’s really simple enough, as simple as it is disagreeable : I am going to settle the
      question for you. Let us then discuss it no more.” It would seem a great effort to do this,
      too, her lips a little white with fatigue, her eyes heavy with disgust at it all: fighting
      these things, she was coming to their assistance.</p>
<p>“Listen : we none of us know anything about that man” ; this was an unfortunate beginning
      for Bertha, as thoughts, if not eyes, would spring in her direction no doubt, and Fraulein
      Lipmann even paused as though about to qualify this: “we none of us, I think, want to know
      anything about him. Therefore why this idiot — the last sort of beer-drinking brute — treated
      us to his bestial and — and —  wretched foolery——”</p>
<p>Fraulein Lipmann shrugged her shoulders with blank, contemptuous indifference. “I assure
      you it doesn’t interest me the least little bit in the world to know <hi>why</hi> such brutes
      behave like that at certain times. I don’t see any mystery. It seems odd to you that Herr
      Kreisler should be an offensive brute ?” She eyed them a moment. “To me not !”</p>
<p>“We do him too much honour by discussing him, that’s certain,” said one of them. This was in
      the spirit of Fraulein Lipmann’s words, but was not accepted by her just then as she had
      something further to say.</p>
<p>“When one is attacked, one does not spend one’s time in considering <hi>why</hi> one is
      attacked, but in defending oneself. I am just fresh from the <hi>souillures de ce brute.</hi>
      If you knew the words he had addressed to me !”</p>
<p>Ekhart was getting very red, his eyes were shining, and he was moving rhythmically in his
      chair something like a steadily rising sea.</p>
<p>“Where does he live, Fraulein Lipmann ?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Nein, Ekhart. One could not allow anybody to embroil themselves with that useless brute.”
      The “Nein, Ekhart” had been drawled fondly at once, as though that contingency had been
      weighed, and could be brushed aside lightly in advance. It implied as well an “of course” for
      his red and dutiful face. “I myself, if I meet him anywhere, shall deal with him better than
      you could. This is one of the occasions for a woman——”</p>
<p>So Bertha’s story had come uncomfortably and difficultly to flower. She wished she had not
      waited so long. But it was impossible now, the matter put in the light that Fraulein Lipmann’s
      intervention had caused, to delay any longer. She was, there was no doubt about it, vaguely
      responsible for Kreisler. It was obviously her duty <hi>to explain</hi> him. And now Fraulein
      Lipmann had just put an embargo on explanations. There were to be no more explanations. In
      Kreisleriana her <hi>apport</hi> was very important: much more definite than the indignation
      or hypothesis of any of the rest. She. had been <hi>nearer to him, </hi>anyway. She had waited
      too long, until the sea had risen too high, or rather in a direction extremely unfavourable
      for launching her contribution. It must be in some way, too, a defence of Kreisler. This would
      be a very delicate matter to handle.</p>
<p>Yet could she sit on there, say nothing, and let the others in the course of time drop the
      subject 1 They had not turned to her in any way for further information or as to one
      peculiarly susceptible of furnishing interesting data. Maintaining this silence was a
      solution. But it would be even <hi>bolder</hi> than her first plan. This would be a still more
      vigorous, more insolent development of her plan of confessing —  <hi>in her way.</hi> But it
      rather daunted her. They might easily mistake, if they pleased, her silence for the silence of
      acknowledged, very eccentric, guilt. The subject was drawing perilously near the point
      where it would be dropped. Fraulein Lipmann was summing up, and doing the final offices of the
      law over the condemned and already unspeakable Kreisler.</p>
<pb n="162"/>
<p>No time was to be lost. The breaking in now involved inevitable conflict of a sort with
      Fraulein Lipmann. She was going to “say a word for Kreisler” <hi>after</hi> Fraulein
      Lipmann’s words. (How much better it would have been before !)</p>
<p>So at this point, looking up from the table, Bertha (listened to with uncomfortable
      unanimity and promptness) began. She was smiling with an affectedly hesitating, timid face,
      smiling in a flat strained way, the neighbourhood of her eyes suffused slightly with blood,
      her lips purring the words a little:</p>
<p>“Renée, I feel that I ought to say something —” Her smile was that made with a screwing up
      of the eyes and slow flowering of the lips, noticed on some people’s faces when some snobbery
      they cannot help has to be allowed egress from their mouth.</p>
<p>Renée Lipmann turned towards her composedly. This interruption would require argument;
      consciousness of the peculiar nature of Bertha’s qualifications was not displayed.</p>
<p>“I had not meant to say anything — about what happened to me, that is. I, as a matter of
      fact, have something particularly to complain of. But I had nothing to say about it. Only,
      since you are all discussing it, I thought you might not quite understand if I didn’t — I
      don’t think, Renée, that Herr Kreisler was quite in his right mind this evening. He doesn’t
      strike me as <hi>méchant.</hi> I don’t think he was really in any way accountable for his
      actions. I don’t, of course, know any more about him than you do. This evening was the first
      time I’ve ever exchanged more than a dozen words with him in my life.”</p>
<p>This was said in the sing-song of quick parentheses, eyebrows lifted, and with little
      gestures of the hand.</p>
<p>“He caught hold of me — like this.” She made a quick snatching gesture at Fraulein Lipmann,
      who did not like this attempt at intimidation or velvety defiance. “He was hissing me when
      you came up,” turning to one or two of the others. This was said with dramatic suddenness and
      “determination,” as 
      <pb n="163"/>  it were : the “kissing” said with a sort of deliberate sententious brutality,
      and luscious disparting of the lips.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t make out <hi>whatever</hi> was happening——” one of them began.</p>
<p>“When you came up I felt quite dazed. I didn’t feel that it was a man kissing me. He was
      mad. I’m sure he was. It was like being mauled by a brute.” She shuddered, with rather rolling
      eyes. “He <hi>was </hi>a brute to-night — not a man at all. He didn’t know what he was
      doing.”</p>
<p>They were all silent, answer-less at this unexpected view of the case. It only differed from
      theirs in supposing that he was not <hi>always</hi> a brute. She had spoken quickly and drew
      up short. Their silence became conscious and septic. They appeared as though they had not
      expected her to stop speaking, and were like people surprised naked, with no time to cover
      themselves.</p>
<p>“I think he’s in great difficulties — money or something. But all I know for certain is
      that he was <hi>really</hi> in need of somebody——”</p>
<p>“But what makes you think, Bertha——” one of</p>
<p>the girls said, hesitating.</p>
<p>“I let him in at Renée’s. He looked strange to me: didn’t you notice ? I noticed him
      first there.”</p>
<p>Anastasya Vasek was still with them. She had not joined in the talk about Kreisler. She
      listened to it with attention, like a person newly arrived in some community, participating
      for the first time at one of their discussions on a local and stock subject. Kreisler would,
      from her expression, have seemed to be some topic peculiar to this gathering of people —  they
      engaged in a characteristic occupation. Bertha she watched as one would watch a very eloquent
      chief airing his views at a clan-meeting.</p>
<p>“I felt he was <hi>really</hi> in need of some hand to help him. He seemed just like a
      child. He was ill, too. He can’t have eaten anything for some time. I am sure he hasn’t. He
      was walking slower and slower —  
      <pb n="164"/> that’s how it was we were so far behind. It was my fault, too — what happened.
      At least——”</p>
<p>The hungry touch was an invention of the moment. “You make him quite a romantic character.
      I’m afraid he has been working on your feelings, my dear girl. I didn’t see any signs of an
      empty stomach myself,” said Fraulein van Bencke.</p>
<p>“He refreshed himself extensively at the dance, in any case. You can put your mind at rest
      as to his present emptiness,” Renée Lipmann said.</p>
<p>Things languished. The Lipmann had taken her stand on boredom. She was committed to the
      theory of the unworthiness of this discussion. The others not feeling quite safe, Bertha’s
      speeches raised no more comment. It was all as though she had been putting in her little bit
      of abuse of the common enemy. Bertha might have interrupted with a “Yes. He outraged me too!” — and this have been met with a dreary, acquiescing silence!</p>
<p>She was exculpating herself, then (heavily), at his expense. The air of ungenerosity this
      had was displeasing to her.</p>
<p>The certain lowering of the vitality of the party when she came on the scene with her story
      offended her. There should have been noise. It was not quite the lifelessness of scepticism.
      But there was an uncomfortable family likeness to the manner of people listening to discourses
      they do not believe. She persevered. She met with the same objectionable flaccid and
      indifferent opposition. Her intervention had killed the topic, and they seemed waiting
      till she had ended her war-dance on its corpse.</p>
<p>The red-headed member of the party had met Tarr by chance. Hearing he had not seen
      Bertha since the night of the ball, she had said with roguish pleasantness: “He’d better look
      after her better; why hadn’t he come to the ball ?” Tarr did not understand.</p>
<p>“Bertha had had an adventure. All of them, for that matter, had had an adventure, but
      especially Bertha. Oh, Bertha would tell him all about it.” 
      <pb n="165"/>
</p>
<p>But, on Tarr insisting, Bertha’s story, in substance, had been told.</p>
<p>So with Bertha, the <hi>fact</hi> was still there. Retrospectively, her friends insisted
      upon passing by the two remarkably unanimous-looking forms on the boulevard in stony silence.
      She shouted to them and kissed Kreisler loudly. But they refused to take any notice. She
      sulked. They had been guilty of catching her. She kept to herself day after day. She would
      make a change in her life. She might go to Germany ; she might go to another
       <hi>quartier.</hi> To go on with her life just as though nothing had happened, <hi>that was
       out of the question.</hi> Demonstration of some sort must follow, and change compatible
      with grief.</p>
<p>Her burly little clock struck four. Hurrying on reform-clothes, she went out to buy lunch.
      The dairy lay nearly next door to Lejeune’s restaurant. Crossing the road towards it, she
      caught sight of Kreisler’s steadily marching figure approaching. First she side-stepped and
      half turned. But the shop would be reached before they met, so she went on, merely quickening
      her pace. Her eye, covertly fixed on him, calculating distances and speeds, saw him hesitate —
      evidently having just caught sight of <hi>her</hi> — and then turn down a side street nearly
      beside the dairy she was making for. Unwise pique beset her at this.</p>
