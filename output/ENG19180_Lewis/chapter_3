<head>CHAPTER III</head>
<p>Tarr’s idea of leisure recognized no departure from the tragic theme of existence. Pleasure
      could take no form that did not include Death and corruption— at present Bertha and humour.
      Only he wished to play a little longer. It was the last chance he might have. <hi>Work</hi>
      was in front of him with Bertha.</p>
<p>He was giving up <hi>play.</hi> But the giving up of play, even, had to take the form of
      play. He had seen in terms of sport so long that he had no other 
      <pb n="30"/> machinery to work with. <hi>Sport might perhaps, for the fun of the thing, be
       induced to cast out sport.</hi></p>
<p>As Lowndes crept towards the door, Tarr said to himself, with ironic self-restraint, <hi>“
       Bloody</hi> fool, <hi>bloody</hi> fool!”</p>
<p>Lowndes was a brother artist, who was not very active, but had just enough money to be a
      Cubist. He was extremely proud of being interrupted in his work. His “work” was a serious
      matter. He found “great difficulty” in working. He always implied that <hi>you </hi>did not.
      He had a form of persecution mania as regards his “mornings.” From his discourse you gathered
      that he was, first of all, very much sought after. People, seemingly, were <hi>always</hi>
      attempting to get into his room. You imagined an immense queue of unwelcome visitors (how or
      why he had gathered or originally, it was to be supposed, encouraged, such, you did not
      inquire). You never saw this queue. The only person you definitely knew had been guilty of
      interrupting his “work” was Thornton. This man, because of his admiration for Lowndes’
      intelligence and moth-like attraction for his Cubism, and respect for his small income, had to
      suffer much humiliation. He was to be found (even in the morning, strange to say) in Lowndes’
      studio, rapidly sucking a pipe, blinking, flushing, stammering with second-rate Public School
      mannerisms, retailing scandal and sensational news, which he had acquired from a woman who had
      sat next him at the invariable dinner-party of the night before.</p>
<p>When you entered, he looked timidly and quickly at the inexorable Lowndes, and began
      gathering up his hat and books. Lowndes’ manner became withering. You felt that before your
      arrival, his master had been less severe; that life might have been almost bearable for
      Thornton. When he at last had taken himself off, Lowndes would hasten to exculpate himself. “
      Thornton was a fool, but he could not always keep Thornton out,” etc. Lowndes, with
      his Thornton, displayed the characteristics of the selfmade man. He had risen ambitiously in
      the sphere 
      <pb n="31"/> of the Intelligence. Thornton sat like an inhabitant of the nether world of
      gossip, pettiness, and squalor from which his friend had lately issued. He entertained an
      immense respect for that friend. This one of his own kind in a position of respect
      and security was what he could best understand, and would have most desired to be.</p>
<p>“Oh! Come in, Tarr,” Lowndes said, looking at the floor of the passage, “I didn’t know who
      it was.” The atmosphere became thick with ghostlike intruders. The wretched Thornton seemed
      to hover timidly in the background.</p>
<p>“Am I interrupting you ?” Tarr asked politely.</p>
<p>“No-o-o !” a long, reassuring, musical negative.</p>
<p>His face was very dark and slick, bald on top, pettily bearded, rather unnecessarily
      handsome. Tarr always felt a tinge of indecency in his good looks. His Celtic head was allied
      to a stocky commercial figure. Behind his spectacles his black eyes had a way of scouring and
      scurrying over the floor. They were often dreamy and burning. He waddled slightly, or rather
      confided himself first to one muscular little calf, then to the other.</p>
<p>Tarr had come to talk to him about Bertha.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I must have interrupted your work ?” Tarr said with mock ceremony.</p>
<p>“No, it’s all right. I was just going to have a rest. I’m rather off colour.”</p>
<p>Tarr misunderstood him.</p>
<p>“Off colour ? What is the matter with colour now ?”</p>
<p>“No, I mean I’m seedy.”</p>
<p>“Oh, ah. Yes.”</p>
<p>His eyes still fixed on the ground, Lowndes pottered about, like a dog.</p>
<p>As with most educated people who “do” anything, and foresee analysis and fame, he was
      biographically minded. A poor man, he did his Boswell-ing himself. His self-characterization,
      proceeding whenever he was not alone, was as follows : “A fussy and exacting man, slightly
      avuncular, strangely, 
      <pb n="32"/> despite the fineness and amplitude of his character, minute, precious, and tidy.”
      (In this way he made a virtue of his fuss.) To show how the general illusion worked in a
      particular case: “He had been disturbed in his ‘ work ’ by Tarr, or had just emerged from
      that state of wonderful concentration he called ‘ work.’ He could not at once bend himself to
      more general things. His nerves drove him from object to object. But he would soon be
      quiet.”</p>
<p>Tarr looked on with an ugly patience.</p>
<p>“Lowndes, I have come to ask you for a little piece of advice.”</p>
<p>Lowndes was flattered and relished the mystery.</p>
<p>“Ye-es,” he said, smiling, in a slow, ‘ sober,’ professional sing-song.</p>
<p>“Or rather, for an opinion. What is your opinion of German women ?”</p>
<p>Lowndes had spent two years in Berlin and Munich. Many of his friends were Austrian.</p>
<p>“German women ? But I must know first why you ask me that question. You see, it’s a wide
      subject.”</p>
<p>“A wide subject—wide. Yes, very good ! Ha ha!—Well, it is like this. I think that they
      are superior to Englishwomen. That is a very dangerous opinion to hold, as there are so many
      German women knocking about just now.—I want to rid myself of it.—Can you help me ?”</p>
<p>Lowndes mused on the ground. Then he looked up brightly.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t. Because I share it!”</p>
<p>“Lowndes, I’m surprised at you. I never thought you were that sort of man!”</p>
<p>“How do you mean ?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you can help me nevertheless. Our ideas on females may not be the same.”</p>
<p>Tarr always embarrassed him. Lowndes huddled himself tensely together, worked at his pipe,
      and met Tarr’s jokes painfully. He hesitated to sally forth and drive the joke away.</p>
<p>“What are your ideas on females ?” he asked in a moment.</p>
<pb n="33"/>
<p>“Oh, I think they ought to be convex if you are concave—stupid if you are intelligent, cold
      if you are cold, frigid if you are volcanic. Always white all over, clothes, underclothes,
      skin and all.—My ideas do not extend much beyond that.”</p>
<p>Lowndes organized Tarr’s statement, with a view to an adequate and light reply. He gnawed at
      his pipe.</p>
<p>“Well, German women are usually convex. There are also concave ones. There are cold ones
      and hot ones.” He looked up. “It all seems to depend what <hi>you</hi> are like !”</p>
<p>“I am cold ; inclined to be fat; <hi>forte tete ;</hi> and swarthy, as you see.”</p>
<p>“In that case, if you took plenty of exercise,” Lowndes undulated himself as though for the
      passage of the large bubbles of chuckle, “I should think that German women would suit you
      very well!”</p>
<p>Tarr rose.</p>
<p>“I wish I hadn’t come to see you, Lowndes. Your answer is disappointing.”</p>
<p>Lowndes got up, disturbed at Tarr’s sign of departure.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. But I’m not an authority.” He leant against the fireplace to arrest Tarr’s
      withdrawal for a minute or two. “Are you doing much work ?”</p>
<p>“I ? No.”</p>
<p>“Are you ever in in the afternoons ? I should like to come round some day——”</p>
<p>“I’m just moving into a new studio.”</p>
<p>Lowndes looked suddenly at his watch, with calculated, ape-like impulsiveness.</p>
<p>“Where are you having lunch ? I thought of going down to Lejeune’s to see if I could come
      across a beggar of the name of Kreisler. He could tell you much more about German women than I
      can. He’s a German. Come along, won’t you ? Are you doing anything ?”</p>
<p>“No, I know quite enough Germans. Besides, I must go somewhere—I can’t have lunch just
      yet. Good-bye. Thank you for your opinion.”</p>
<pb n="34"/>
<p>“Don’t mention it,” Lowndes said softly, his head turned obliquely to his shoulder, as
      though he had a stiff neck, and balancing on his calves.</p>
<p>He was rather wounded, or brusque, by the brevity of Tarr’s visit. His “morning” had not
      received enough respect. It had been treated, in fact, cavalierly. His “work” had not been
      directly mentioned.</p>
<p>When Tarr got outside, he stood on the narrow pavement, looking into a shop window. It was
      a florist’s and contained a great variety of flowers. He was surprised to find that he did not
      know a single flower by name. He hung on in front of this shop before pushing off, as a
      swimmer does to a rock, waving his legs. Then he got back into the street from which his visit
      to Lowndes had deflected him. He let himself drift down it. He still had some way to go before
      he need decide between the Rue Martine (where Bertha lived) and the Rue Lhomond.</p>
<p>He had not found resolution in his talks. That already existed, the fruit of various other
      conversations on his matrimonial position—held with the victim, Fraulein Lunken, herself.</p>
<p>Not to go near Bertha was the negative programme for that particular day. To keep away was
      seldom easy. But ever since his conversation at the Berne he had been conscious of the absurd
      easiness of doing so, if he wished. He had not the least inclination to go to the Rue
      Martine!—This sensation was so grateful that its object shared in its effect. He determined to
      go and see her. He wanted to enjoy his present feeling of indifference. Where best to enjoy it
      was no doubt where she was.</p>
<p>As to the studio, he hesitated. A new situation was created by this new feeling of
      indifference. Its duration could not be gauged.—He wished to stay in Paris just then to finish
      some paintings begun some months before. He substituted for the Impressionist’s necessity to
      remain in front of the object being represented, a sensation of the desirability of finishing
      a canvas in the place where it was begun. He had an Impressionist’s horror of change.</p>
<pb n="35"/>
<p>So Tarr had evolved a plan. At first sight it was wicked. It was no blacker than most of his
      ingenuities. Bertha, as he had suggested to Butcher, he had in some lymphatic way, <hi xml:lang="fr">dans la peau.</hi> It appeared a matter of physical discomfort to leave her
      altogether. It must be done gradually. So he had thought that, instead of going away to
      England-where the separation might cause him restlessness, he had perhaps better settle down
      in her neighbour, hood. Through a series of specially tended ennuis, he would soon find
      himself in a position to depart. So the extreme nearness of the studio to Bertha’s flat was
      only another inducement for him to take it. “If it were next door, so much the better!”
      he thought.</p>
<p><hi>Now for this famous feeling of indifference.</hi> Was there anything in it ?—The studio
      for the moment should be put aside. He would go to see Bertha. Let this visit solve this
      question.</p>
