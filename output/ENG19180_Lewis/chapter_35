<head>CHAPTER I</head>
<p>Tarr’s character at this time performed repeatedly the following manoeuvre: his best
      energies would, once a farce was started, gradually take over the business from the play
      department and continue it as a serious line of its own. It was as though it had not the go to
      initiate anything of its own accord. It was content to exploit the clown’s discoveries.</p>
<p>The bellicose visit to Kreisler now projected was launched to a slow blast of Humour, ready,
      when the time came, to turn into a storm. His contempt for the German would not allow him to
      enter into anything seriously against him. Kreisler was a joke. Jokes, it had to be admitted
      (and in that they became more effective than ever), were able to make you sweat.</p>
<p>That Kreisler could be anywhere but at the café de l’Aigle on the following evening never
      entered Tarr’s head. As he was on an unpleasant errand, he took it for granted that Fate would
      on this occasion put everything punctually at his disposal. Had it been an errand of pleasure,
      he would have instinctively supposed the reverse.</p>
<p>At ten, and at half-past, his rival had not yet arrived. Tarr set out to make rapidly a tour
      of the other cafés. But Kreisler might be turning over a 
      <pb n="238"/>  new leaf. He might be going to bed, as on the previous evening. He must not be
      again sought, though, on his own territory. The moral disadvantage of this position, on a
      man’s few feet of most intimate floor space, Tarr had clearly realized.</p>
<p>The Cafe Souchet, the most frequented café of the Quarter, entered merely in a spirit of
      German thoroughness, was, however, the one. More alert, and brushed up a little, Tarr thought,
      Kreisler was sitting with another man, with a bearded, naif, and rather pleasant face, over
      his coffee. No pile of saucers this time attended him.</p>
<p>The stranger was a complication. Perhaps the night’s affair should be put off until the
      conditions were more favourable. But Tarr’s vanity was impatient. His wait in the original
      cafe had made him nervous and hardly capable of acting with circumspection. On the other hand,
      it might come at once. This was an opposite complication. Kreisler might open hostilities on
      the spot. This would rob him of the subtle benefits to be derived from his gradual strategy.
      This must be risked. He was not very calm. He crudely went up to Kreisler’s table and sat
      down. The feeling of the lack of aplomb in this action, and his disappointment at the
      presence of the other man, chased the necessary good humour out of his face. He had carefully
      preserved this expression for some time, even walking lazily and quietly as if he were
      carrying a jug of milk. Now it vanished in a moment. Despite himself, he sat down
      opposite Kreisler as solemn as a judge, pale, his eyes fixed on the object of his activity
      with something like a scowl.</p>
<p>But, his first absorption in his own sensations lifted and eased a little, he recognized
      that something very unusual was in the air.</p>
<p>Kreisler and his friend were not speaking or doing anything visibly. They were just sitting
      still, two self-possessed malefactors. Nevertheless, Tarr’s arrival to all appearance
      disturbed and even startled them, as if they had been completely wrapped up in some engrossing
      game or conspiracy.</p>
<pb n="239"/>
<p>Kreisler had his eyes trained across the room. The other man, too, was turned slightly in
      that direction, although his eyes followed the tapping of his boot against the ironwork of the
      table, and he only looked up occasionally.</p>
<p>Kreisler turned round, stared at Tarr without at once taking in who it was ; then, as though
      saying to himself, “It’s only Bertha’s Englishman,” he took up his former wilful and patient
      attitude, his eyes fixed.</p>
<p>Tarr had grinned a little as Kreisler turned his way, rescued from his solemnity. There was
      just a perceptible twist in the German’s neck and shade of expression that would have said “
      Ah, there you are ? Well, be quiet, we’re having some fun. Just you wait!”</p>
<p>But Tarr was so busy with his own feelings that he didn’t understand this message. He
      wondered if he had been seen by Kreisler in the distance, and if this reception had been
      concerted between him and his friend. If so, why ?</p>
<p>Sitting, as he was, with his back to the room, he stared at his neighbour. His late boon
      companion distinctly was waiting, with absurd patience, for something. The poise of his head,
      the set of his yellow Prussian jaw, were truculent, although otherwise he was peaceful and
      attentive. His collar looked <hi>new</hi> rather than clean. His necktie was one not familiar
      to Tarr. Boots shone impassibly under the table.</p>
<p>Tarr screwed his chair sideways, and faced the room. It was full of people — very
      athletically dressed American men, all the varieties of the provincial in American women,
      powdering their noses and ogling Turks, or sitting, the younger ones, with blameless interest
      and fine complexions. And there were <hi>plenty</hi> of Turks, Mexicans, Russians and other “
      types” for the American ladies! In the wide passage-way into the further rooms sat the
      orchestra, playing the “Moonlight Sonata,” Dvorak and the “Machiche.”</p>
<p>In the middle of the room, at Tarr’s back, he now saw a group of eight or ten young men whom
      he had seen occasionally in the café Berne. They looked rather German, but smoother and more
      vivacious. Poles or Austrians, then ? Two or three of them appeared to be amusing themselves
      at his expense. Had they noticed the little drama that he was conducting at his table ? Were
      they friends of Kreisler’s, too ? — He was incapable of working anything out. He flushed and
      felt far more like beginning on them than on his complicated idiot of a neighbour, who had
      become a cold task. This genuine feeling illuminated for him the tired frigidity of his
      present employment.</p>
<p>He had moved his chair a little to the right, towards the group at his back, and more in
      front of Kreisler, so that he could look into his face. On turning back now, and comparing the
      directions of the various pairs of eyes engaged, he at length concluded that he was without
      the sphere of interest; <hi>just</hi> without it.</p>
<p>At this moment Kreisler sprang up. His head was thrust forward, his hands were in rear,
      partly clenched and partly facilitating his passage between the tables by hemming in his coat
      tails. The smooth round cloth at the top of his back, his smooth head above that with no back
      to it, struck Tarr in the way a momentary smell of sweat would. Germans had no backs to them,
      or were like polished pebbles behind. Tarr mechanically moved his hand upwards from his lap to
      the edge of the table on the way to ward off a blow. He was dazed by all the details of this
      meeting, and the peculiar miscarriage of his plan.</p>
<p>But Kreisler brushed past him with the swift deftness of a person absorbed with some strong
      movement of the will. The next moment Tarr saw the party of young men he had been observing in
      a sort of noisy blur of commotion. Kreisler was in among them, working on something in their
      midst. There were two blows — smack — smack; an interval between them. He could not see who
      had received them.</p>
<p>Tarr then heard Kreisler shout in German :</p>
<pb n="241"/>
<p>“For the <hi>second</hi> time to-day ! Is your courage so slow that I must do it a
       <hi>third</hi> time ?”</p>
<p>Conversation had stopped in the café and everybody was standing. The companions of the man
      smacked, too, had risen in their seats. They were expostulating in three languages. Several
      were mixed up with the <hi>garçons,</hi> who had rushed up to do their usual police work on
      such occasions. Over Kreisler’s shoulder, his eyes carbonized to a black sweetness, his cheeks
      a sweet sallow-white, with a red mark where Kreisler’s hand had been, Tarr saw the man
      his German friend had singled out. He had sprung towards the aggressor, but by that time
      Kreisler had been seized from behind and was being hustled towards the door. The blow seemed
      to hurt his vanity so much that he was standing half-conscious till the pain abated. He seemed
      to wish to brush the blow off, but was too vain to raise his hands to his cheek. It was left
      there like a scorching compress. His friends, Kreisler wrenched away from them, were left
      standing in a group, in attitudes more or less of violent expostulation and excitement.</p>
<p>Kreisler receded in the midst of a band of waiters towards the door. He was resisting and
      protesting, but not too much to retard his quick exit. The garçons had the self-conscious
      unconcern of civilian braves.</p>
<p>The young man attacked and his friends were explaining what had happened, next, to the
      manager of the cafe. A <hi>garçon</hi> brought in a card on a plate. There was a new outburst
      of protest and contempt from the others. The plate was presented to the individual chiefly
      concerned, who brushed it away, as though he had been refusing a dish that a waiter was, for
      some reason, pressing upon him. Then suddenly he took up the card, tore it in half, and again
      waived away the persistent platter. The <hi>garçon</hi> looked at the manager of the café and
      then returned to the door.</p>
<p>So this was what Kreisler and the little bearded
      <pb n="242"/> man had been so busy about! Kreisler had laid his plans for the evening as well!
      Tarr’s scheme was destined not to be realized; unless he followed Kreisler at once, and got up
      a second row, a more good-natured one, just outside the cafe ? Should he go out now and punch
      Kreisler’s head, fight about a little bit, and then depart, his business done, and leave
      Kreisler to go on with his other row ? For he felt that Kreisler intended making an evening of
      it. His companion bad not taken part in the fracas, but had followed on his heels in his
      ejection, protesting with a vehemence that was intended to hypnotize.</p>
<p>Just at the moment when he had felt that he was going to be one of the principal parties to
      a violent scene, Tarr had witnessed, not himself at all, but another man snatched up into his
      role. He felt relieved. As he watched the man Kreisler had struck, he seemed to be watching
      himself. And yet he felt rather on the side of Kreisler. With a mortified chuckle he prepared
      to pay for his drink and be off, leaving Kreisler for ever to his very complicated, mysterious
      and turbulent existence. He noticed just then that Kreisler’s friend had come back again,
      and was talking to the man who had been struck. He could hear that they were speaking Russian
      or Polish. With great collectedness, Kreisler’s emissary, evidently, was meeting their noisy
      expostulations. He could not at least, like a card, be torn in half! On the other hand, in his
      person he embodied the respectability of a visiting card. He was dressed with perfect “
      correctness” suitable to such occasions and such missions as his appeared to be. By his
      gestures (one of which was the taking an imaginary card between his thumb and forefinger and
      tearing it) Tarr could follow a little what he was saying.</p>
<p>“That, sir,” he seemed to assert, “is not the way to treat a gentleman. That, too, is an
      insult no gentleman will support.” He pointed towards the door. “Herr Kreisler, as you know,
      cannot enter the café; he is waiting there for your reply. He has been turned out like a
      drunken workman.”</p>
<p>The Russian was as grave as he was collected, and stood in front of the other principal in
      this affair, who had sat down again now, with the evident determination to get a different
      reply. The talking went on for some time. Then he turned towards Tarr, and, seeing him
      watching the discussion, came towards him, raising his hat. He said in French :</p>
<p>“You know Herr Kreisler, I believe. Will you consent to act for him with me, in an affair
      that unfortunately——? If you would step over here, I</p>
<p>will put you ‘ au courant.’”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I cannot act for Herr Kreisler, as I am leaving Paris early to-morrow morning,”
      Tarr replied.</p>
<p>But the Russian displayed the same persistence with him as he had observed him already
      capable of with the other people.</p>
<p>At last Tarr said, “I don’t mind acting temporarily for a few minutes, now, until you can
      find somebody else. But you must understand that I cannot delay my journey — you must find a
      substitute at once.”</p>
<p>The Russian explained with business-like gusto and precision, having drawn him towards the
      door (seemingly to cut off a possible retreat of the enemy), that it was a grave affair.
      Kreisler’s honour was compromised. His friend Otto Kreisler had been provoked in an
      extraordinary fashion. Stories had been put about concerning him, affecting seriously
      the sentiments of a girl he knew regarding him ; put about with that object by another
      gentleman, also acquainted with this girl. The Russian luxuriated emphatically on this point.
      Tarr suggested that they should settle the matter at once, as he had not very much time. He
      was puzzled. Surely the girl mentioned must be Bertha ? If so, had Bertha been telling more
      fibs ? Was the Kreisler mystery after all to her discredit ? Perhaps he was now in
      the presence of <hi>another</hi> rival, existing, unknown to him, even during his friendship
      with her.</p>
<p>In this heroic, very solemnly official atmosphere of ladies’ “honour” and the “honour”
      of gentlemen, that the little Russian was creating, Tarr unwillingly 
      <pb n="244"/> remained for some time. Noisy bursts of protest from other members of the
      opposing party met the Russian’s points. “It was all nonsense;” they shouted; “there could
      be no question of honour here. Kreisler was a quarrelsome German. He was drunk.” Tarr liked
      his own farces. But to be drawn into the service of one of Kreisler’s was a
      humiliation. Kreisler, without taking any notice of him, had turned the tables.</p>
<p>The discussion was interminable. They were now speaking French. The entire café appeared to
      be participating. Several times the principal on the other side attempted to <hi>go,</hi>
      evidently very cross at the noisy scene. Then Anastasya’s name was mentioned. Tarr found new
      interest in the scene.</p>
<p>“You and Herr Kreisler,” the Russian was saying patiently and distinctly, “exchanged
      blows, I understand, this afternoon, before this lady. This was as a result of my friend Herr
      Kreisler demanding certain explanations from you which you refused to give. These explanations
      had reference to certain stories you are supposed to have circulated as regards him.”</p>
<p>“Circulated — as regards — that chimpanzee you are conducting about ?”</p>
<p>“If you please! By being abusive you cannot escape. You are accused by my friend of having
      at 'his expense</p>
<p>“Expense ? Does he want money ?”</p>
<p>‘ ‘ If you please ! You cannot buy off Herr Kreisler; but he might be willing for you to pay
      a substitute if you find it — inconvenient</p>
<p>“I find you, bearded idiot!</p>
<p>“We can settle all that afterwards. You understand me? I shall be quite ready! But at
      present it is the affair between you and Herr Kreisler</p>
<p>In brief, it was the hapless Soltyk that Kreisler had eventually got hold of, and had just
      now publicly smacked, having some hours before smacked him privately.</p>
