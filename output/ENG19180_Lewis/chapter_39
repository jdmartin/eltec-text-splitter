<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>Otto Kreisler, when he had entered the café Souchet, had been anxious. His eyes had
      picked out Soltyk in a delicate flurry. He had been afraid that he might escape him. Soltyk
      looked so securely bedded in life, and he wanted to wrench him out. He was not at all
      bad-tempered at the moment. He would have extracted him quite “painlessly” if required. But
      bleeding and from the roots, he must come out! (Br-r-rr. The Bersaker rage!)</p>
<p>He was quite quiet and well-behaved; above all things, <hi>well-behaved !</hi> The mood he
      had happened on for this particular phase of his action was a virulent snobbery. He was a
      painful and blushing snob! He had, at his last public appearance, taken the rôle of a
      tramp-comedian. He had invited every description of slight and indignity. The world seemed
      to wish to perpetuate this part for him. But he would not play ! He refused ! A hundred times,
      he refused!</p>
<p>He remembered with eagerness that he was a German gentleman, with a <hi>university education
       ;</hi> who had never worked ; <hi>a member of an honourable family ! </hi>He remembered each
      detail socially to his advantage, realizing methodically things he had from childhood accepted
      and never thought of examining. But he had gone a step further. He had arbitrarily revived the
      title of Frei-Herr that, it was rumoured in his family, his ancestors had borne. With Bitzenko
      he had referred to himself as the Frei-Herr Otto Kreisler. Had the occasion allowed, he would
      have been very courteous and gentle with Soltyk, merely to prove what a gentleman he was! But,
      alas, nothing but brutality (against the grain — the noble grain — as this went!) would
      achieve his end.</p>
<p>And the end was still paramount. His snobbery was the outcome of this end, of his end. It
      was, in this obsession of disused and disappearing life, the wild assertion of vitality, the
      clamour for
      <pb n="256"/>  recognition that life and the beloved self were still there, that brought out
      the reeking and brand-new snob. He was almost dead (he had promised his father his body for
      next month, and must be punctual), but people already had begun treading on him and
      striking matches on his boots. As to fighting with a man who was practically dead, to all
      intents and purposes, one mass of worms — a worm, in short — that was not to be expected of
      anybody.</p>
<p>So he became a violent snob.</p>
<p>It was Soltyk’s rude behaviour on the day before in the presence of Anastasya that had set
      him raving on this subject. The Russian Pole was up against a raving snob whose social dignity
      he had wounded.</p>
<p>Bitzenko and Kreisler came out to get Louis Soltyk like two madmen, full of solemn method
      and with miraculous solidarity. Their schemes and energies flew direct from mind to mind,
      without the need for words. Bitzenko with his own hand had brushed the back of Kreisler’s
      coat; on tiptoe doing this he looked particularly childlike. They were together there in
      Kreisler’s room before they started like two little boys dressing up in preparation for some
      mischief.</p>
<p>Kreisler had fixed his eyes on Soltyk from his table with alert offensiveness. The
      prosperous appearance of the Poles annoyed him deeply. Their watches were all there, silk
      handkerchiefs slipped up their sleeves ; they looked sleek and new. A gentle flame of social
      security and ease danced in their eyes and gestures. He was out in the dark, they were in
      a lighted room ! He wished their fathers’ affairs might deteriorate and their fortunes fall to
      pieces; that their watches could be stolen, and their restaurant tick attacked by insidious
      reports! And as he watched them he felt more and more an outcast, shabbier and shabbier. He
      saw himself the little official in a German provincial town that his father’s letter
      foreshadowed.</p>
<p>One or two of them pointed him out to Soltyk, and it was a wounding laugh of the latter’s
      that brought him to his feet.</p>
<p>As he was slapping his enemy he woke up out of his nightmare. He was like a sleeper having
      the first inkling of his solitude when he is woken by the climax of his dream, still
      surrounded by tenacious influences. But had any one struck him then, the blow would have had
      as little effect as a blow aimed at a waking man by a phantom of his sleep. The noise
      around him was a receding accompaniment.</p>
<p>Then he felt hypnotized by Soltyk’s quietness. The sweet white of the face made him sick.
      To. overcome this he stepped forward again to strike the dummy once more, and then it moved
      suddenly. As he raised his hand his glasses almost slipped off, and at that point he was
      seized by the <hi>garçons. </hi>Hurried out on to the pavement, he could still see, at the
      bottom of a huge placid mirror just inside the cafe, the wriggling backs of the band of Poles.
      Drawing out his card-case, he had handed the waiter a visiting-card. The waiter at first
      refused it. He turned his head aside vaguely, as a dog does when doubtful about some morsel
      offered him ; then he took it. Kreisler saw in the mirror' the tearing up of his card. Fury
      once more — not so much because it was a new slight as that he feared his only hope, Soltyk,
      might escape him.</p>
<p>The worry of this hour or so in which Bitzenko was negotiating told on him so much that when
      at last his emissary announced that an arrangement, had been come to in the sense he wished,
      he questioned him incredulously. He felt hardly any satisfaction, reaction setting in
      immediately.</p>
<p>Bitzenko went back to Kreisler’s door with him and, promising to return within half an hour,
      left him. Tarr having, as he had stipulated, left when the talking was over, Bitzenko first
      went in search of a friend to serve as second. The man he decided on was already in bed, and
      at once, half asleep, without preparation of any sort, consented to do what was asked of
      him.</p>
<p>“Will you be a second in a duel to-morrow morning at half-past six ?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“At half-past six ?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” And after a minute or two, “Is it you ?”</p>
<p>“No, a German friend of mine.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>“You will have to get up at five.”</p>
<p>Bitzenko’s friend was a tall, powerfully built young Russian painter, who, with his great
      bow-legs, would take up some straggling and extravagantly twisted pose of the body and remain
      immobile for minutes together, with an air of ridiculous detachment. This combination of a
      tortured, restless attitude, and at the same time statuesque tendency, suggested something
      like a contemplative acrobat or contortionist. A mouth of almost anguished attention and
      little calm indifferent eyes, produced similar results in the face.</p>
<p>Bitzenko’s next move was to go to his rooms, put a gently ticking little clock, with an
      enormous alarum on the top, under his arm, and then walk round once more to Otto Kreisler’s.
      He informed his friend of these last arrangements made in his interests. He suggested that it
      would be better for him to sleep there that night, to save time in the morning. In short, he
      attached himself to Kreisler’s person. Until it were deposited in the large cemetery near by,
      or else departed from the Gare du Nord in a deal box for burial in Germany, it should not
      leave him. In the event of victory, and he being no longer responsible for it, it should
      disappear as best it could. The possible subsequent conflict with the police was not without
      charm for Bitzenko. He regarded the police force, its functions and existence, as a
      pretext for adventure.</p>
<p>The light was blown out. Bitzenko curled himself up on the floor. He insisted on this.
      Kreisler must be fresh in the morning and do him justice. The Russian could hear the bed
      shaking for some time. Kreisler was trembling violently. A sort of exultation at the thought
      of his success caused this nervous attack. He had been quite passive since he had heard that
      all was well.</p>
<p>At about half-past four in the morning Kreisler was dreaming of Volker and a pact he had
      made with him in his sleep never to divulge some secret, which there was never any possibility
      of his doing in any case, as he had completely forgotten what it was. He was almost
      annihilated by a terrific explosion. With his eyes suddenly wide open, he saw the little
      clock quivering in the mantelpiece beneath its large alarum. When it had stopped Kreisler
      could hardly believe his ears, as though this sound had been going to accompany life, for that
      day at least, as a destructive and terrifying feature. Then he saw the Russian, already on his
      feet. His white and hairy little body had apparently risen energetically out of the
      scratch bedclothes simultaneously with the “going off” of his clock, as though it were a
      mechanism set for the same hour.</p>
<p>They both dressed without a word. Kreisler wrote a short letter to his father, entrusting it
      to his second.</p>
<p>Kreisler’s last few francs were to be spent on a taxi to take them to the place arranged on,
      outside the fortifications.</p>
<p>They found the other second sound asleep. Bitzenko more or less dressed him. They set out in
      their taxi to the rendezvous by way of the Bois.</p>
<p>The chilly and unusual air of the early morning, the empty streets and shuttered houses,
      destroyed all feeling of reality of what was happening for Kreisler. Had the duel been a thing
      to fear it would have had an opposite effect. His errand did not appear as an inflexible
      reality, either, following upon events that there was no taking back. It was a whim, a
      caprice, they were pursuing, as though, for instance, they had woken up in the early
      morning and decided to go fishing. They were carrying it out with a dogged persistency, with
      which our whims are often served.</p>
<p>He kept his thought away from Soltyk. He seemed a very long way off; it would be fatiguing
      for the mind to go in search of him.</p>
<p>When the scientist’s nature, with immense <hi>fugue,</hi>
<pb n="260"/>  has induced a man to marry some handsome young lady — this feat accomplished,
      Nature leaves him practically alone, only coming back to give him a prod from time to time —
      assured that, like a little trickling stream, his life will go steadily on in the bed gauged
      for it by this upheaval. Nature, in Kreisler’s case, had done its work of another description.
      But she had left the Russian with him to see that all was carried out according to her
      wishes. Kreisler’s German nature that craved discipline, a course marked out, had got more
      even than it asked for. It had been presented with a mimic Fate.</p>
<p>But Bitzenko evidently took his pleasure morosely. The calm and assurance of the evening
      before had given place to a brooding humour. He was only restored to a silent and intense
      animation on hearing his “Browning” speak. He produced this somewhere in the Bois, and
      insisted on his principal having a little practice as they had plenty of time to ' spare. This
      was a very imprudent step. It might draw attention to their movements. Kreisler proved an
      excellent shot. Then the Russian himself, with impassible face, emptied a couple of
      chambers into a tree-trunk. He put his “Browning” back into his pocket hastily after this,
      as though startled at his own self-indulgence.</p>
<p>A piece of waste land, on the edge of a wood, well hidden on all sides, had been chosen for
      the duel.</p>
<p>The enemy was not on the ground. Kreisler’s passivity still subsisted. So far he had felt
      that Accident had been dealt a shrewd blow and brought to its knees. He was in good hands.
      Until this was all over he had nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Fresh compartment. The duel became for him, as he stood on the damp grass, conventional.
      It was a duel like another. He was seeking reparation by arms. He had been libelled and
      outraged. “A beautiful woman” was at the bottom of it. Life had no value for him ! <hi>Tant
       pis</hi> for the other man who had been foolhardy enough to cross his path. His coat-collar
      turned up, he looked sternly towards 
      <pb n="261"/>  the road, his moustaches blowing a little in the wind. He asked Bitzenko for a
      cigarette. That gentleman did not smoke, but the other Russian produced a khaki cigarette with
      a long mouthpiece. He struck a light. As Kreisler lit his cigarette at it, his hand resting
      against the other’s, a strange feeling shot through him at the contact of this flesh. He
      moistened his lips and spat out a piece of the mouthpiece he had bitten through.</p>
<p>The hour arranged came round and there was still no sign of anybody. The possibility of a
      hitch in the proceedings dawned on Kreisler. Personal animosity for Soltyk revived. That idea
      of obstinacy in a caprice, instead of merely carrying out something prearranged and
      unavoidable, despite his passivity, had proved really the wakefulness of his will. He looked
      towards his companions, alone there on the ground of the encounter. They were
      an unsatisfactory pair, after all. They did not look a winning team. He reproached himself for
      having hit just on this Russian for assistance.</p>
<p>Bitzenko, on the other hand, was deep in thought. He was rehearsing his part of second. The
      duel in which he had blinded his adversary was a figment of his boyish brain, confided with
      tears in his voice one evening to a friend. His only genuine claim to activity was that, in a
      perfect disguise, he had assisted the peasants of his estate to set fire to his. little Manor
      House during the revolution of 1906 for the fun of the thing and in an access of revolutionary
      sentiment. Afterwards he had assisted the police with information in the investigation of
      the affair, also anonymously. All this he kept to himself. He referred to his past in Russia
      in a way that conjured up more luridness than the flames of his little chateau (which did not
      burn at all well) warranted.</p>
<p>Bitzenko was quite in his element climatically; whereas Kreisler felt his hands getting so
      cold that he thought they might fail him in the duel.</p>
<p>But a car was heard beyond the trees on the Paris road. This sound in the listless blur of
      nature was 
      <pb n="262"/>  masterful in its significance. It struck steadily and at once into brutish
      apathy. It so plainly knew what it wanted. It had perhaps outstripped men in that. Men in
      their soft bodies still contained the apathy of the fields. Their mind had burst out of them
      and taken these crawling pulps up on its rigid back.</p>
<p>It was Staretsky’s car. With its load of hats it drew up. The four members of the other
      party came on to the field, the fourth a young Polish doctor. They walked quickly. Bitzenko
      went to meet them. Staretsky protested energetically that the duel must not proceed.</p>
<p>“It must — not — go — on ! Should anything happen — you must allow me to say, should
      anything happen  — the blood of whoever falls will be at your door!” But he felt all the same
      that the prospect of having a little pond of blood at his door was an alluring one for
      Bitzenko.</p>
<p>“Has not your principal seen that in accepting this duel, M. Soltyk had proved his respect
      for Herr Kreisler’s claim ? The attitude your principal attributed to him is <hi>not</hi> his
      attitude——”</p>
<p>Bitzenko stiffened.</p>
<p>“Is there anything in Herr Kreisler that would justify M. Soltyk in considering that he was
      condescending——?”</p>
<p>The little Russian kept up his cunning and baffling wrangle. Soltyk’s eyes steadily avoided
      Kreisler’s person. He hoped this ridiculous figure might make some move enabling them to
      abandon the duel. But the idea of a favour coming from such a quarter was repellent. His
      stomach had been out of order the day before — he wondered if it would surge up, disgrace him.
      He might be sick at any moment. He saw himself on tiptoe, in an ignominious spasm, the
      proceedings held up, friends and enemies watching. He kept his eyes off Kreisler as a man on
      board ship keeps his eyes off a dish of banana fritters or a poached egg.</p>
<p>Kreisler, from twenty yards off, stared through his
      <pb n="263"/>glasses at the group of people he had assembled, as though he had been examining
      the enemy through binoculars. Obediently, erect and still, he appeared rather amazed at what
      was occurring. Soltyk, in rear of the others, struggled with his bile. He slipped into his
      mouth a sedative tablet, oxide of bromium and heroin. This made him feel more sick. For a few
      moments he stood still in horror, expecting to vomit at every moment. The blood rushed to
      his head and covered the back of his neck with a warm liquid sheet.</p>
<p>Kreisler’s look of surprise deepened. He had seen Soltyk slipping something into his mouth,
      and was puzzled and annoyed, like a child. What was he up to ? Poison was the only guess he
      could give. What on earth——?</p>
<p>Having taken part in many <hi>mensurs</hi> he knew that for this very serious duel his
      emotions were hardly adequate. His nervous system was as quiescent as a corpse’s. He became
      offended with his phlegm. All this instinctive resistance to the idea of Death, the indignity
      of being nothing, was rendered empty by his premature insensitiveness. He tried to visualize
      and feel. In a few minutes he might be dead! That had so little effect that he
      almost laughed.</p>
<p>Then he reflected that that man over there might in a few minutes be wiped out. He would
      become a disintegrating mess, uglier than any vitriol or syphilis could make him. All that
      organism he, Kreisler, would be turning into dung, as though by magic. He, Kreisler, is
      insulted. The sensations and energies of that man deny him equality of existence.
      He, Kreisler, lifts his hand, presses a little bar of steel, and the other is swept away into
      the earth. Heaven knows where the insulting spirit goes to. But the <hi>physical
       disfigurement</hi> at least is complete. He went through it laboriously. But it fell flat as
      well. He was too near the event to benefit by his fancy. Possibilities were weakened by the
      nearness of Certainty.</p>
<p>His momentary resentment with Bitzenko survived, and he next became annoyed at being treated
      like an object, as he felt it. He was not deliberately conscious of much. But, try as he would
      to elude the disgraces and besmirchings of death, people refused to treat him as anything but
      a sack of potatoes.</p>
<p>There four or five men had been arguing about him for the last five minutes, and they had
      not once looked his way. But clearly Bitzenko was defending <hi>Ms</hi> duel.</p>
<p>Why should Bitzenko go on disposing of him in this fashion ? He took everything for granted
      ; he never so much as appealed to him, even once. Had Bitzenko been commissioned to hustle him
      out of existence ?</p>
<p>But Soltyk. There was that fellow again slipping something into his mouth! A cruel and
      fierce sensation of mixed real and romantic origin rose hotly round his heart. He
       <hi>loved</hi> that man! But because he loved him he wished to plunge a sword into him, to
      plunge it in and out and up and down 1 Why had pistols been chosen ?</p>
<p>He would let him off for two pins ! He would let him off if—— Yes! He began pretending
      to</p>
<p>himself that the duel might after all not take place. That was the only way he could get
      anything out of it.</p>
<p>He laughed ; then shouted out in German :</p>
<p>“Give me one !”</p>
<p>They all looked round. Soltyk did not turn, but the side of his face became crimson.</p>
<p>Kreisler felt a surge of active passion at the sight of the blood in his face.</p>
<p>“Give me one,” Kreisler shouted again, putting out the palm of his hand, and laughing in a
      thick, insulting, hearty way. He was now a <hi>Knabe.</hi> He was young and cheeky. His last
      words had been said with quick cleverness. The heavy coquetting was double-edged.</p>
<p>“What do you mean ?” Bitzenko called back.</p>
<p>“I want a jujube. Ask Herr Soltyk !”</p>
<pb n="265"/>
<p>They all turned towards the other principal to the duel, standing some yards on the other
      side of them.</p>
<p>Head thrown back and eyes burning, Soltyk gazed at Kreisler. It was genuine, but not very
      strong. If killing could be embodied in the organ that <hi>sees —  </hi>a new function of
      expression — a perfect weapon would exist. Only the intensest expression being effective, such
      spiritual blasting powers would be a solution of the arbitrary decisions of force. Words,
      glances, music are at present as indirect as hands and cannons. Such music might be written,
      however, that no fool, hearing it, could survive. Whether it throttled him in a spasm of
      disgust or of shame is immaterial. Soltyk’s battery was too conventional to pierce the layers
      of putrifying tragedy, Kreisler’s bulwark. It played to the limit of its power. His cheeks
      were a dull red : his upper lip was stretched tightly over the gums. The white line of teeth
      made his face look as though he were laughing. He stamped his foot on the ground with the
      impetuous grace of a Russian dancer, and started walking hurriedly up and down. He glared at
      his seconds as well, but although sick with impatience made no protest.</p>
<p>A peal of drawling laughter came from Kreisler :</p>
<p>“Sorry ! Sorry ! My mistake,” he shouted.</p>
<p>Bitzenko came over and asked Kreisler if he still, for his part, was of the same mind, that
      the duel should go on. The principal stared impenetrably at the second.</p>
<p>“If such an arrangement can be come to as should — er——” he began slowly.. He was going
      to play</p>
<p>with Bitzenko too, against whom his humour had shifted. A look of deepest dismay appeared in
      the Russian’s face.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand. You mean——?”</p>
<p>“I mean, that if the enemy and you can find a basis for understanding——” and Kreisler
      went on</p>
<p>staring at Bitzenko with his look of false surprise.</p>
<p>“You seem very anxious for me to fight, Herr Bitzenko,” he then said furiously. With a
      laugh at Bitzenko’s miserable face and evident pleasure at his 
      <pb n="266"/> quick-change temperamental, facial agility, he left him, walking towards the
      other assistants.</p>
<p>Addressing Staretsky, his face radiating affability, stepping with caution, as though to
      avoid puddles, he said:</p>
<p>“I am willing to forgo the duel at once on one condition. If Herr Soltyk will give me a
      kiss, I will forgo the duel!”</p>
<p>He smiled archly and expectantly at Staretsky.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean !”</p>
<p>“Why, a kiss. You know what a kiss is, my dear sir.”</p>
<p>“I shall consider you out of your mind, if——”</p>
<p>“That is my condition.”</p>
<p>Soltyk had come up behind Staretsky.</p>
<p>“What is your <hi>condition</hi> ?” he asked loudly.</p>
<p>Kreisler stepped forward so quickly that he was beside him before Soltyk could move. With
      one hand coaxingly extended towards his arm, he was saying something, too softly for the
      others to hear.</p>
<p>He had immobilized everybody by his rapid action. Surprise had shot their heads all one way.
      They stood, watching and listening, screwed into astonishment as though by deft Angers.</p>
<p>His soft words, too, must have carried sleep. Their , insults and their honey clogged up his
      enemy. A hand had been going up to strike. But at the words it stopped dead. So much new
      matter for anger had been poured into the ear that it wiped out all the earlier impulse.
      Action must be again begun right down from the root.</p>
<p>Kreisler thrust his mouth forward amorously, his body in the attitude of the
      eighteenth-century gallant, as though Soltyk had been a woman.</p>
<p>The will broke out frantically from the midst of bandages and a bulk of suddenly accruing
      fury. Soltyk tore at <hi>himself</hi> first, writhing upright, a statue’s bronze softening,
      suddenly, with blood. He became white and red by turns. His blood, one heavy mass, hurtled
      about in him, up and down, like a sturgeon in a narrow tank.</p>
<p>All the pilules he had taken seemed acting sedatively against the wildness of his muscles.
      The bromium fought the blood.</p>
<p>His hands were electrified. Will was at last dashed all over him, an Arctic douche. The
      hands flew at Kreisler’s throat. His nails made six holes in the flesh and cut into the
      tendons beneath. Kreisler was hurled about. He was pumped backwards and . forwards. His hands
      grabbed a mass of hair ; as a man slipping on a precipice gets hold of a plant. Then they
      gripped along the coat-sleeves, connecting him with the engine he had just overcharged
      with fuel. A sallow white, he became puffed and exhausted.</p>
<p>“Acha — acha —” a noise, the beginning of a word, came from his mouth. He sank on his
      knees. A notion of endless violence filled him. “Tchun — tchun  — tchun — tchun — tchun —
      tchun!” He fell on his back, and the convulsive arms came with him. The strangling sensation
      at his neck intensified.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a breath of absurd violence had smitten everywhere.</p>
<p>Staretsky had said:</p>
<p>“That <hi>crapule</hi> is beneath contempt! Pouah ! — I refuse to act. Whatever induced
      us——”</p>
<p>Bitzenko had begun a discourse. Staretsky turned on him, shrieking, “Foute-moi la paix,
      imbecile !”</p>
<p>At this Bitzenko rapped him smartly on the cheek. Staretsky, who spent his mornings sparring
      with a negro pugilist, gave him a blow between the eyes, which laid him out insensible.</p>
<p>Bitzenko’s friend, interfering when he saw this, seized Staretsky round the waist, and threw
      him down, falling with him.</p>
<p>The doctor and the other second, Wenceslas Khudin, went to separate Soltyk and Kreisler,
      scuffling and exhorting. The field was filled with cries, smacks, and harsh movements.</p>
<p>This Slav chaos gradually cleared up.</p>
<p>Soltyk was pulled off; Staretsky and the young Russian were separated. Bitzenko once more
      was on 
      <pb n="268"/> his feet. Then they were all dusting their trousers, arranging their collars,
      picking up their hats.</p>
<p>Kreisler stood stretching his neck to right and left alternately. His collar was torn open;
      blood trickled down his chest. He had felt weak and unable to help himself against Soltyk.</p>
<p>Actual fighting appeared a contingency outside the calculations or functioning of his
      spirit. Brutal by rote and in the imagination, if action came too quickly before he could
      inject it with his dream, his forces were disconnected. This physical <hi>melee</hi> had
      been a disturbing interlude. He was extremely offended at it. His eyes rested steadily and
      angrily on Soltyk. This attempt on his part to escape into physical and secondary things he
      must be made to pay for ! He staggered a little, with the dignity of the drunken man.</p>
<p>His glasses were still on his nose. They had weathered the storm, tightly riding his face,
      because of Soltyk’s partiality for his neck.</p>
<p>Staretsky took Soltyk by the arm.</p>
<p>“Come along, Louis. Surely you don’t want any more of it ? Let’s get out of this. I refuse
      to act as second. You can’t fight without seconds !”</p>
<p>Soltyk was panting, his mouth opening and shutting. He first turned this way, then that. His
      , action was that of a man avoiding some importunity.</p>
<p>“C’est bien, c’est bien!” he gasped in French. “Je sais. Laisse-moi.”</p>
<p>All his internal disorganization was steadily claiming his attention.</p>
<p>“Mais dépêche-toi done! Filons. Nous avons plus rien à faire ici.” Staretsky slipped his
      arm through his. Half supporting him, he began urging him along towards the car. Soltyk,
      stumbling and coughing, allowed himself to be guided.</p>
<p>Khudin and the doctor had been talking together, as the only two men on the field in full
      possession of their voices and breath. When they saw their friends moving off, they
      followed.</p>
<p>Bitzenko, recuperating rapidly, started after them.</p>
<p>Kreisler saw all this at first with indifference. He had taken his handkerchief out and was
      dabbing his neck. Then suddenly, with a rather plaintive but resolute gait, he ran after his
      second, his eye fixed on the retreating Poles.</p>
<p>“Hi! A moment! Your Browning. Give me your Browning!” he said hoarsely. His voice had been
      driven back into the safer depths of his body. It was a new and unconvincing one.</p>
<p>Bitzenko did not appear to understand.</p>
<p>Kreisler plucked the revolver out of his pocket with the deftness of an animal. There was a
      report. He was firing in the air.</p>
<p>Staretsky had faced quickly round, dragging Soltyk. Kreisler was covering them with
      the Browning.</p>
<p>“Halt!” he shouted. “Stop there ! Not so quickly ! I will shoot you like a dog if you
      will not fight!”</p>
<p>Still holding them up, he ordered Bitzenko to take over to them one of the revolvers
      provided for the duel.</p>
<p>“That will be murder ! If you assist in this, sir, you will be participating in a murder !
      Stop this——’ ’</p>
<p>Staretsky was jabbering at Bitzenko, his arm through his friend’s. Soltyk stood wiping his
      face with his hand, his eyes on the ground. His breath came heavily, and he kept shifting his
      feet.</p>
<p>Bitzenko’s tall young Russian stood in a twisted attitude, a gargoyle Apollo. His mask of
      peasant tragedy had broken into a slight smile.</p>
<p>“Move and I fire ! Move and I fire !” Kreisler kept shouting, moving up towards them, with
      stealthy grogginess. He kept shaking the revolver and pointing at them with the other hand, to
      keep them alive to the reality of the menace.</p>
<p><hi>“Don’t</hi> touch the pistols, Louis !” said Staretsky, as Bitzenko came over with his
      leather dispatch-case. He let go of Soltyk’s arm and folded his own.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch them, Louis. They daren’t shoot!” Louis appeared apathetic both as to the
      pistols and the good advice.</p>
<p>“Leave him both,” Kreisler called, his revolver still trained on Staretsky and Soltyk.</p>
<p>Bitzenko put them both down, a foot away from Soltyk, and walked hurriedly out of the zone
      of fire.</p>
<p>“Will you take up one of those pistols, or both ?” Kreisler said.</p>
<p>“Kindly point that revolver somewhere else, and allow us to go !” Staretsky said
      loudly.</p>
<p>“I’m not speaking to you, pig-face! It’s <hi>you</hi> I’m addressing. Take up that pistol!”</p>
<p>He was now five or six yards from them.</p>
<p>“Herr Soltyk is unarmed ! The pistols you want him to take only have one charge. Yours has
      twelve. In any case it would be murder !”</p>
<p>Kreisler walked up to them. He was very white, much quieter, and acted with effort. He
      stooped down to take up one of the pistols. Staretsky aimed a blow at his head. It caught him
      just in front of the ear, on the right cheek-bone. He staggered sideways, tripped, and fell.
      The moment he felt the blow he pulled the trigger of the Browning, which still pointed towards
      his principal adversary. Soltyk threw his arms up : Kreisler was struggling towards his feet:
      he fell face forwards on top of him.</p>
<p>, Kreisler thought this was a new attack. He seized Soltyk’s body round the middle, rolling
      over on top of it. It was quite limp. He then thought the other man had fainted ; ruptured
      himself——? He drew</p>
<p>back quickly. Two hands grasped him and flung him down on his stomach. This time his
      glasses went. Scrambling after them, he remembered his Browning, which he had dropped. He shot
      his hands out to left and right — forgetting his glasses — to recover the Browning. He felt
      that a blow was a long time in coming.</p>
<p>“He’s dead ! He’s dead ! He’s dead !”</p>
<p>Staretsky’s voice, announcing that in French, he heard at the same time as Bitzenko’s
      saying:</p>
<p>“What are you looking for ? Come quickly !”</p>
<p>“Where is the Browning ?” he asked. At that
      <pb n="271"/>moment his hand struck his glasses. He put them on and got to his feet.</p>
<p>At Bitzenko’s words he had a feeling of a new order of things having set in, that he
      remembered having experienced once or twice before in life. They came in a fresh surprising
      tone. It was as though they were the first words he had heard that day. They seemed to imply a
      sudden removal, a journey, novel conditions.</p>
<p>“Come along, I’ve got the Browning. There’s no time to lose.” It was all over; he must
      embrace practical affairs. The Russian’s voice was businesslike. Something had finished for
      him, too. Kreisler saw the others standing in a peaceful group; the doctor was getting up from
      beside Soltyk.</p>
<p>Staretsky rushed over to Kreisler, and shook his fist in his face and tried to speak. But
      his mouth was twisted down at the corners, and he could hardly see. The palms of his hands
      pressed into each of his eyes, the next moment he was sobbing, walking back to his
      friends.</p>
<p>Bitzenko’s bolt was shot. Kreisler had been unsatisfactory. All had ended in a silly
      accident, which might have awkward consequences for his second. It was hardly a real corpse at
      all.</p>
<p>But something was sent to console him. The police had got wind of the duel. Bitzenko,
      his compatriot and Kreisler were walking down the field, intending to get into the road at
      the. farther end, and walk to the nearest station. The taxi had been sent away, Kreisler
      having no more money, and Bitzenko’s feeling in the matter being that should Kreisler fall, a
      corpse can always find some sentimental soul to look after it. And there was always the
      Morgue, dramatic and satisfactory.</p>
<p>They were already half-way along the field when a car passed them on the other side of the
      hedge at full tilt.</p>
<p>The Russian was once more in his element. His face cleared. He looked ten years younger. In
      the occupants of the car he had recognized members of the police force!</p>
<p>Calling “Run!” to Kreisler he took to his heels, followed by his young fellow-second, whose
      neck shot in and out, and whose great bow-legs could almost be heard twanging as he ran. They
      reached a hedge, ran along the farther side of it. Bitzenko was bent double as though to
      escape a rain of bullets. Eventually he was seen careering across an open space quite near the
      river, which lay a couple of hundred yards beyond the lower end of the field. There he lay
      ambushed for a moment, behind a shrub. Then he darted forward again, and eventually
      disappeared along the high road in a cloud of dust. His athletic young friend made straight
      for the railway station, which he reached without incident and returned at once to Paris.
      Kreisler conformed to Bitzenko’s programme of flight. He scrambled through the hedge, crossed
      the road and escaped almost unnoticed.</p>
<p>The truth was that the Russian had attracted the attention of the police to such an extent
      by his striking flight, that without a moment’s hesitation they had bolted helter-skelter
      after him. They contented themselves with a parting shout or two at Kreisler. Duelling was a
      very venial offence; capture in these cases was not a matter of the least moment. But they
      were so impressed by the Russian’s businesslike way of disappearing that they imagined' this
      must have been a curiously immoral sort of duel. That he was the principal they did not doubt
      for a moment.</p>
<p>So they went after him in full cry, rousing two or three villagers in their passage, who
      followed at their heels, pouring with frantic hullabaloo in the direction of Paris. Bitzenko,
      however, with great resourcefulness, easily outwitted them. He crossed the Seine near St.
      Cloud, and got back to Paris in time to read the afternoon newspaper account of the duel and
      flight with infantile solemnity and calm.</p>
