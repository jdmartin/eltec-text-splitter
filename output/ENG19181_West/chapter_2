<t:head>CHAPTER II</t:head>
<t:p>I WAS sorry the next morning that the post comes too late at Harrowweald to be
    brought up with the morning tea and waits for one at the breakfast table; for
    under Kitty's fixed gaze I had to open a letter which bore the Boulogne postmark
    and was addressed in the writing of Frank Baldry, Chris's cousin, who is in the
    church. He wrote:</t:p>
<t:quote>
<t:p>DEAR JENNY:</t:p>
<t:p>You will have to break it to Kitty and try to make her take it as quietly as
        possible. This sentence will sound ominous as a start, but I'm so full of
        the extraordinary thing that has happened to Chris that I feel as if every
        living creature was in possession of the facts. I don't know how much you
        know about it, so I'd better begin at the beginning. Last Thursday I got a
        wire from Chris, saying that he had had concussion, though not seriously,
        and was in a hospital<t:pb n="035"/> about a mile from Boulogne, where he
        would be glad to see me. It struck me as odd that it had been sent to
        Ollenshaws, where I was curate fifteen years ago. Fortunately, I have always
        kept in touch with Sumpter, whom I regard as a specimen of the very best
        type of country clergymen, and he forwarded it without unnecessary delay. I
        started that evening, and looked hard for you and Kitty on the boat; but
        came to the conclusion I should probably find you at the hospital.</t:p>
<t:p>After having breakfasted in the town,—how superior French cooking is! I would
        have looked in vain for such coffee, such an omelet, in my own parish,—I
        went off to look for the hospital. It is a girls' school, which has been
        taken over by the Red Cross, with fair-sized grounds and plenty of nice dry
        paths under the <t:hi>tilleuls</t:hi>. I could not see Chris for an hour, so I
        sat down on a bench by a funny, little round pond, with a stone coping, very
        French. Some wounded soldiers who came out to sit in the sun were rather
        rude because I was not in khaki, even when I explained that I was a priest
        of God and that the feeling of the bishops was strongly against the
        enlistment of the clergy. I do feel that the church has lost its grip on the
            masses.<t:pb n="036"/></t:p>
<t:p>Then a nurse came out and took me in to see Chris. He is in a nice room, with
        a southern exposure, with three other officers, who seemed very decent (not
        the "new army," I am glad to say). He was better than I had expected, but
        did not look quite himself. For one thing, he was oddly boisterous. He
        seemed glad to see me, and told me he could remember nothing about his
        concussion, but that he wanted to get back to Harrowweald. He talked a lot
        about the wood and the upper pond and wanted to know if the daffies were out
        yet, and when he would be allowed to travel, because he felt that he would
        get well at once if only he could get home. And then he was silent for a
        minute, as though he was holding something back. It will perhaps help you to
        realize the difficulty of my position when you understand that all this
        happened before I had been in the room five minutes!</t:p>
<t:p>Without flickering an eyelid, quite easily and naturally, he gave me the
        surprising information that he was in love with a girl called Margaret
        Allington, who is the daughter of a man who keeps the inn on Monkey Island,
        at Bray on the Thames. He uttered some appreciations of this woman which I
        was too upset to note. I gasped, "How long has this been going on?" He
            laughed<t:pb n="037"/> at my surprise, and said, "Ever since I went down
        to stay with Uncle Ambrose at Dorney after I'd got my B.Sc." Fifteen years
        ago! I was still staring at him, unable to believe this barefaced admission
        of a deception carried on for years, when he went on to say that, though he
        had wired to her and she had wired a message in return, she hadn't said
        anything about coming over to see him. "Now," he said quite coolly, "I know
        old Allington's had a bad season,—oh, I'm quite well up in the innkeeping
        business these days,—and I think it may quite possibly be a lack of funds
        that is keeping her away. I've lost my check-book somewhere in the scrim,
        and so I wonder if you'd send her some money. Or, better still, for she's a
        shy country thing, you might fetch her."</t:p>
<t:p>I stared. "Chris," I said, "I know the war is making some of us very lax, and
        I can only ascribe to that the shamelessness with which you admit the
        existence of a long-standing intrigue; but when it comes to asking me to go
        over to England and fetch the woman—" He interrupted me with a sneer that we
        parsons are inveterately eighteenth century and have our minds perpetually
        inflamed by visions of squires' sons seducing country wenches, and
            declared<t:pb n="038"/> that he meant to marry this Margaret Allington.
        "Oh, indeed!" I said. "And may I ask what Kitty says to this arrangement?"
        "Who the devil is Kitty?" he asked blankly. "Kitty is your wife," I said
        quietly, but firmly. He sat up and shouted: "I haven't got a wife! Has some
        woman been turning up with a cock-and-bull story of being my wife? Because
        it's the damnedest lie!"</t:p>
<t:p>I determined to settle the matter by sharp, common-sense handling. "Chris," I
        said, "you have evidently lost your memory. You were married to Kitty Ellis
        at St. George's, Hanover Square, on the third, or it may have been the
        fourth"—you know my wretched memory for dates—"of February, in 1906." He
        turned very pale and asked what year this was. "1916," I told him. He fell
        back in a fainting condition. The nurse came, and said I had done it all
        right this time, so she at least seemed to have known that he required a
        rude awakening, although the doctor, a very nice man, Winchester and New,
        told me he had known nothing of Chris's delusions.</t:p>
<t:p>An hour later I was called back into the room. Chris was looking at himself
        in a hand-mirror, which he threw on the floor as I entered. "You<t:pb n="039"/> are right," he said; "I'm not twenty-one, but thirty-six." He said he
        felt lonely and afraid, and that I must bring Margaret Allington to him at
        once or he would die. Suddenly he stopped raving and asked, "Is father all
        right?" I prayed for guidance, and answered, "Your father passed away twelve
        years ago." He said, "Good God! can't you say he <t:hi>died</t:hi>," and he
        turned over and lay with his back to me. I have never before seen a strong
        man weep, and it is indeed a terrible sight. He moaned a lot, and began to
        call for this Margaret. Then he turned over again and said, "Now tell us all
        about this Kitty that I've married." I told him she was a beautiful little
        woman, and mentioned that she had a charming and cultivated soprano voice.
        He said very fractiously: "I don't like little women, and I hate anybody,
        male or female, who sings. O God, I don't like this Kitty. Take her away!"
        And then he began to rave again about this woman. He said that he was
        consumed with desire for her and that he would never rest until he once more
        held her in his arms. I had no suspicion that Chris had this side to his
        nature, and it was almost a relief when he fainted again.</t:p>
<t:p>I have not seen him since, and it is evening; but I have had a long talk with
        the doctor, who<t:pb n="040"/> says that he has satisfied himself that Chris
        is suffering from a loss of memory extending over a period of fifteen years.
        He says that though, of course, it will be an occasion of great trial to us
        all, he thinks that, in view of Chris's expressed longing for Harrowweald,
        he ought to be taken home, and advises me to make all arrangements for
        bringing him back some time next week. I hope I shall be upheld in this
        difficult enterprise.</t:p>
<t:p>In the meantime I leave it to you to prepare Kitty for this terrible shock. I
        could have wished it were a woman of a different type who was to see my poor
        cousin through these dark days, but convey to her my deepest sympathy.
        Indeed, I never realized the horror of warfare until I saw my cousin, of
        whose probity I am as firmly convinced as of my own wantonly repudiating his
        most sacred obligations.</t:p>
<t:p>Yours ever, FRANK.</t:p>
</t:quote>
<t:p>Over my shoulder Kitty muttered:</t:p>
<t:p>"And he always pretended he liked my singing." Then she gripped my arm and
    shrieked in a possessive fury: "Bring him home! Bring him home!"<t:pb n="041"/></t:p>
<t:p>So, a week later, they brought Chris home.</t:p>
<t:p>From breakfast-time that day the house was pervaded with a day-before-the-funeral
    feeling. Although all duties arising from the occasion had been performed, one
    could settle to nothing else. Chris was expected at one, but then there came a
    telegram to say he was delayed till the late afternoon. So Kitty, whose beauty
    was as changed in grief from its ordinary seeming as a rose in moonlight is
    different from a rose by day, took me down after lunch to the greenhouses and
    had a snappishly competent conversation about the year's vegetables with Pipe,
    the gardener. Then Kitty went into the drawing-room and filled the house with
    the desolate merriment of an inattentively played pianola, while I sat in the
    hall and wrote letters and noticed how sad dance-music has sounded ever since
    the war began. After<t:pb n="042"/> that she started a savage raid of domestic
    efficiency, and made the housemaids cry because the brass handles of the
    tall-boys were not bright enough and because there was only ten-to-one instead
    of a hundred-to-one risk of breaking a leg on the parquet. Then she had tea, and
    hated the soda-cake. She was a little, shrunk thing, huddled in the arm-chair
    farthest from the light, when at last the big car came nosing up the drive
    through the dark.</t:p>
<t:p>We stood up. Through the thudding of the engines came the sound of Chris's great
    male voice which always had in it a note like the baying of a big dog. "Thanks,
    I can manage by myself." I heard, amazed, his step ring strong upon the stone,
    for I had felt his absence as a kind of death from which he would emerge
    ghostlike, impalpable. And then he stood in the doorway, the gloom blurring his
    outlines like fur, the faint, clear candle-light catching the fair down on his
    face. He<t:pb n="043"/> did not see me, in my dark dress, or huddled Kitty, and
    with the sleepy smile of one who returns to a dear, familiar place to rest he
    walked into the hall and laid down his stick and his khaki cap beside the
    candlestick on the oak table. With both hands he felt the old wood, and stood
    humming happily through his teeth.</t:p>
<t:p>I cried out, because I had seen that his hair was of three colors now, brown and
    gold and silver.</t:p>
<t:p>With a quick turn of the head, he found me out in the shadows.</t:p>
<t:p>"Hullo, Jenny!" he said, and gripped my hands.</t:p>
<t:p>"O Chris, I am so glad!" I stuttered, and then could say no more for shame that I
    was thirty-five instead of twenty. For his eyes had hardened in the midst of his
    welcome, as though he had trusted that I at least would have been no party to
    this conspiracy to deny that he was young, and he said:<t:pb n="044"/></t:p>
<t:p>"I've dropped Frank in town. My temper's of the convalescent type." He might as
    well have said, "I've dropped Frank, who had grown old, like you."</t:p>
<t:p>"Chris," I went on, "it's so wonderful to have you safe."</t:p>
<t:p>"Safe," he repeated. He sighed very deeply and continued to hold my hands. There
    was a rustle in the shadows, and he dropped my hands.</t:p>
<t:p>The face that looked out of the dimness to him was very white, and her upper lip
    was lifted over her teeth in a distressed grimace. It was immediately as plain
    as though he had shouted it that this sad mask meant nothing to him. He knew not
    because memory had given him any insight into her heart, but because there is an
    instinctive kindliness in him which makes him wise about all suffering, that it
    would hurt her if he asked if this was his wife; but his body involuntarily
    began a gesture of inquiry before he realized that<t:pb n="045"/> that, too, would
    hurt her, and he checked it half-way. So, through a silence, he stood before her
    slightly bent, as though he had been maimed.</t:p>
<t:p>"I am your wife." There was a weak, wailing anger behind the words.</t:p>
<t:p>"Kitty," he said softly and kindly. He looked around for some graciousness to
    make the scene less wounding, and stooped to kiss her; but he could not. The
    thought of another woman made him unable to breathe, sent the blood running
    under his skin.</t:p>
<t:p>With a toss, like a child saying, "Well, if you don't want to, I'm sure I
    wouldn't for the world!" Kitty withdrew from the suspended caress. He watched
    her retreat into the shadows as though she were a symbol of this new life by
    which he was baffled and oppressed, until the darkness outside became filled
    with the sound like the surf which we always hear at Harrowweald on angry
    evenings, and<t:pb n="046"/> his eyes became distant, and his lips smiled. "Up
    here—in this old place—how one hears the pines!"</t:p>
<t:p>She cried out from the other end of the room, as though she were speaking with
    some one behind a shut door:</t:p>
<t:p>"I've ordered dinner at seven. I thought you'd probably have missed a meal or
    two, or would want to go to bed early." She said it very smartly, with her head
    on one side like a bird, as if she was pleading that he would find her very
    clever about ordering dinner and thinking of his comfort.</t:p>
<t:p>"Good," he said. "I'd better dress now, hadn't I?" He looked up the stair-case,
    and would have gone up had I not held him back; for the little room in the south
    wing, with the fishing-rods and the old books, went in the rebuilding, absorbed
    by the black-and-white magnificence that is Kitty's bedroom.<t:pb n="047"/></t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, I'll take you up," Kitty rang out efficiently. She pulled at his
    coat-sleeve, so they started level on the lowest step. But as they went up, the
    sense of his separateness beat her back; she lifted her arms as though she
    struggled through a fog, and fell behind. When he reached the top she was
    standing half-way down the stairs, her hands clasped under her chin. But he did
    not see her. He was looking along the corridor and saying, "This house is
    different." If the soul has to stay in its coffin till the lead is struck
    asunder, in its captivity it speaks with such a voice.</t:p>
<t:p>She braced herself with a gallant laugh.</t:p>
<t:p>"How you've forgotten!" she cried, and ran up to him, rattling her keys and
    looking grave with housewifery, and I was left alone with the dusk and the
    familiar things. The dusk flowed in wet and cool from the garden, as if to put
    out the fire<t:pb n="048"/> of confusion lighted on our hearthstone, and the
    furniture, very visible through that soft evening opacity with the observant
    brightness of old, well-polished wood, seemed terribly aware. Strangeness had
    come into the house, and everything was appalled by it, even time. For the
    moments dragged. It seemed to me, half an hour later, that I had been standing
    for an infinite period in the drawing-room, remembering that in the old days the
    blinds had never been drawn in this room because old Mrs. Baldry had liked to
    see the night gathering like a pool in the valley while the day lingered as a
    white streak above the farthest hills, and perceiving in pain that the heavy
    blue blinds that shroud the nine windows because a lost Zeppelin sometimes
    clanks like a skeleton across the sky above us would make his home seem even
    more like prison.</t:p>
<t:p>I began to say what was in my mind to Kitty when she came in, but she moved<t:pb n="049"/> past me, remote in preoccupation, and I was silent when I saw that
    she was dressed in all respects like a bride. The gown she wore on her
    wedding-day ten years ago had been cut and embroidered as this white satin was;
    her hair had been coiled low on her neck, as it was now. Around her throat were
    her pearls, and her longer chain of diamonds dropped, looking cruelly bright, to
    her white, small breasts; because she held some needlework to her bosom, I saw
    that her right hand was stiff with rings and her left hand bare save for her
    wedding-ring. She dropped her load of flannel on a work-table and sat down,
    spreading out her skirts, in an arm-chair by the fire. With her lower lip thrust
    out, as if she were considering a menu, she lowered her head and looked down on
    herself. She frowned to see that the high lights on the satin shone scarlet from
    the fire, that her flesh glowed like a rose, and she changed her seat for a
        high-backed<t:pb n="050"/> chair beneath the farthest candle-sconce. There
    were green curtains close by, and now the lights on her satin gown were green
    like cleft ice. She looked as cold as moonlight, as virginity, but precious; the
    falling candle-light struck her hair to bright, pure gold. So she waited for
    him.</t:p>
<t:p>There came suddenly a thud at the door. We heard Chris swear and stumble to his
    feet, while one of the servants spoke helpfully. Kitty knitted her brows, for
    she hates gracelessness, and a failure of physical adjustment is the worst
    indignity she can conceive.</t:p>
<t:p>"He's fallen down those three steps from the hall," I whispered. "They're new."
    She did not listen, because she was controlling her face into harmony with the
    appearance of serene virginity upon which his eyes would fall when he entered
    the room.</t:p>
<t:p>His fall had ruffled him and made him look very large and red, and he breathed<t:pb n="051"/> hard, like an animal pursued into a strange place by night, and to
    his hot consciousness of his disorder the sight of Kitty, her face and hands and
    bosom shining like the snow, her gown enfolding her, and her gold hair crowning
    her with radiance, and the white fire of jewels giving passion to the spectacle,
    was a deep refreshment. She sat still for a time, so that he might feel this
    well, then raised her ringed hand to her necklaces.</t:p>
<t:p>"It seems so strange that you should not remember me," she said. "You gave me all
    these."</t:p>
<t:p>He answered kindly:</t:p>
<t:p>"I am glad I did that. You look very beautiful in them." But as he spoke his gaze
    shifted to the shadows in the corners of the room, and the blood ran hot under
    his skin. He was thinking of another woman, of another beauty.</t:p>
<t:p>Kitty put up her hands as if to defend her jewels.<t:pb n="052"/></t:p>
<t:p>In that silence dinner was announced, and we went into the dining-room. It is the
    fashion at Baldry Court to use no electric light save when there is work to be
    done or a great company to be entertained, and to eat and talk by the mild
    clarity of many candles. That night it was a kindly fashion, for we sat about
    the table with our faces veiled in shadow, and seemed to listen in quiet
    contentment to the talk of our man who had come back to us. Yet all through the
    meal I was near to weeping, because whenever he thought himself unobserved he
    looked at the things that were familiar to him. Dipping his head, he would
    glance sidewise at the old oak paneling, and nearer things he fingered as though
    sight were not intimate enough a contact. His hand caressed the arm of his
    chair, because he remembered the black gleam of it, stole out and touched the
    recollected salt-cellar. It was his furtiveness that was heartrending; it was
        as<t:pb n="053"/> though he were an outcast, and we who loved him stout
    policemen. Was Baldry Court so sleek a place that the unhappy felt offenders
    there? Then we had all been living wickedly, and he, too. As his fingers glided
    here and there he talked bravely about non-committal things: to what ponies we
    had been strapped when at the age of five we were introduced to the
    hunting-field; how we had teased to be allowed to keep swans in the pond above
    the wood, and how the yellow bills of our intended pets had sent us shrieking
    homeward; and all the dear life that makes the bland English country-side
    secretly adventurous. "Funny thing," he said. "All the time I was at Boulogne I
    wanted to see a kingfisher, that blue scudding down a stream, or a heron's
    flight round a willow—" He checked himself suddenly; his head fell forward on
    his chest. "You have no herons here, of course," he said drearily, and fingered
    the arm of his chair<t:pb n="054"/> again. Then he raised his head again, brisk
    with another subject. "Do they still have trouble with foxes at Steppy End?"</t:p>
<t:p>Kitty shook her head.</t:p>
<t:p>"I don't know."</t:p>
<t:p>"Griffiths will know," Chris said cheerily, and swung round on his seat to ask
    the butler, and found him osseous, where Griffiths was rotund; dark, where
    Griffiths had been merrily mottled; strange, where Griffiths had been a part of
    home, a condition of life. He sat back in his chair as though his heart had
    stopped.</t:p>
<t:p>When the butler who is not Griffiths had left the room he spoke gruffly.</t:p>
<t:p>"Stupid of me, I know; but where is Griffiths?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Dead seven years ago," said Kitty, her eyes on her plate.</t:p>
<t:p>He sighed deeply in a shuddering horror.<t:pb n="055"/></t:p>
<t:p>"I'm sorry. He was a good man."</t:p>
<t:p>I cleared my throat.</t:p>
<t:p>"There are new people here, Chris, but they love you as the old ones did."</t:p>
<t:p>He forced himself to smile at us both, to a gay response.</t:p>
<t:p>"As if I didn't know that to-night!"</t:p>
<t:p>But he did not know it. Even to me he would give no trust, because it was Jenny
    the girl who had been his friend and not Jenny the woman. All the inhabitants at
    this new tract of time were his enemies, all its circumstances his prison-bars.
    There was suspicion in the gesture with which, when we were back in the
    drawing-room he picked up the flannel from the work-table.</t:p>
<t:p>"Whose is this?" he said curiously. His mother had been a hard-riding woman, not
    apt with her needle.</t:p>
<t:p>"Clothes for one of the cottages," answered Kitty, breathlessly. "We—we've a lot
    of responsibilities, you and I. With<t:pb n="056"/> all of the land you've bought,
    there are ever so many people to look after."</t:p>
<t:p>He moved his shoulders uneasily, as if under a yoke, and, after he had drunk his
    coffee, pulled up one of the blinds and went out to pace the flagged walk under
    the windows. Kitty huddled carelessly by the fire, her hands over her face,
    unheeding by its red glow she looked not so virginal and bride-like; so I think
    she was too distracted even to plan. I went to the piano. Through this evening
    of sentences cut short because their completed meaning was always sorrow, of
    normal life dissolved to tears, the chords of Beethoven sounded serenely.</t:p>
<t:p>"So you like Jenny," said Kitty, suddenly, "to play Beethoven when it's the war
    that's caused all this. I could have told that you would have chosen to play
    German music this night of all nights."</t:p>
<t:p>So I began a saraband by Purcell, a jolly thing that makes one see a plump,
        sound<t:pb n="057"/> woman dancing on a sanded floor in some old inn, with
    casks of good ale all about her and a world of sunshine and May lanes without.
    As I played I wondered if things like this happened when Purcell wrote such
    music, empty of everything except laughter and simple greeds and satisfactions
    and at worst the wail of unrequited love. Why had modern life brought forth
    these horrors, which made the old tragedies seem no more than nursery-shows? And
    the sky also is different. Behind Chris's head, as he halted at the open window,
    a search-light turned all ways in the night, like a sword brandished among the
    stars.</t:p>
<t:p>"Kitty."</t:p>
<t:p>"Yes, Chris." She was sweet and obedient and alert.</t:p>
<t:p>"I know my conduct must seem to you perversely insulting,"—behind him the
    search-light wheeled while he gripped the sides of the window,—"but if I do<t:pb n="058"/> not see Margaret Allington I shall die."</t:p>
<t:p>She raised her hands to her jewels, and pressed the cool globes of her pearls
    into her flesh. "She lives near here," she said easily. "I will send the car
    down for her to-morrow. You shall see as much of her as you like."</t:p>
<t:p>His arms fell to his sides.</t:p>
<t:p>"Thank you," he muttered; "you're all being so kind—" He disengaged himself into
    the darkness.</t:p>
<t:p>I was amazed at Kitty's beautiful act and more amazed to find that it had made
    her face ugly. Her eyes snapped as they met mine.</t:p>
<t:p>"That dowd!" she said, keeping her voice low, so that he might not hear it as he
    passed to and fro before the window. "That dowd!"</t:p>
<t:p>This sudden abandonment of beauty and amiability meant so much in our Kitty,
    whose law of life is grace, that I went over and kissed her.<t:pb n="059"/></t:p>
<t:p>"Dear, you're taking things all the wrong way," I said. "Chris is ill—"</t:p>
<t:p>"He's well enough to remember her all right," she replied unanswerably. Her
    silver shoe tapped the floor; she pinched her lips for some moments. "After all,
    I suppose I can sit down to it. Other women do. Teddy Rex keeps a Gaiety girl,
    and Mrs. Rex has to grin and bear it." She shrugged in answer to my silence.
    "What else is it, do you think? It means that Chris is a man like other men. But
    I did think that bad women were pretty. I suppose he's had so much to do with
    pretty ones that a plain one's a change."</t:p>
<t:p>"Kitty! Kitty! how can you!"</t:p>
<t:p>But her little pink mouth went on manufacturing malice.</t:p>
<t:p>"This is all a blind," she said at the end of an unpardonable sentence. "He's
    pretending."</t:p>
<t:p>I, who had felt his agony all the evening<t:pb n="060"/> like a wound in my own
    body, was past speech then, and I did not care what I did to stop her. I gripped
    her small shoulders with my large hands, and shook her till her jewels rattled
    and she scratched my fingers and gasped for breath. But I did not mind so long
    as she was silent.</t:p>
<t:p>Chris spoke from the darkness.</t:p>
<t:p>"Jenny!" I let her go. He came in and stood over us, running his hand through his
    hair unhappily. "Let's all be decent to each other," he said heavily. "It's all
    such a muddle, and it's so rotten for all of us—"</t:p>
<t:p>Kitty shook herself neat and stood up.</t:p>
<t:p>"Why don't you say, 'Jenny, you mustn't be rude to visitors'? It's how you feel,
    I know." She gathered up her needlework. "I'm going to bed. It's been a horrid
    night."</t:p>
<t:p>She spoke so pathetically, like a child who hasn't enjoyed a party as much as it
    had thought it would, that both of us<t:pb n="061"/> felt a stir of tenderness
    toward her as she left the room. We smiled sadly at each other as we sat down by
    the fire, and I perceived that, perhaps because I was flushed and looked
    younger, he felt more intimate with me than he had yet done since his return.
    Indeed, in the warm, friendly silence that followed he was like a patient when
    tiring visitors have gone and he is left alone with his trusted nurse; smiled
    under drooped lids and then paid me the high compliment of disregard. His limbs
    relaxed, he sank back into his chair. I watched him vigilantly, and was ready at
    that moment when thought intruded into his drowsings and his face began to
    twitch. I asked:</t:p>
<t:p>"You can't remember her at all?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, yes," he said, without raising his eyelids, "in a sense. I know how she bows
    when you meet her in the street, how she dresses when she goes to church. I know
    her as one knows a woman staying<t:pb n="062"/> in the same hotel, just like
    that."</t:p>
<t:p>"It's a pity you can't remember Kitty. All that a wife should be she's been to
    you."</t:p>
<t:p>He sat forward, warming his palms at the blaze and hunching his shoulders as
    though there were a draft. His silence compelled me to look at him, and I found
    his eyes, cold and incredulous and frightened, on me.</t:p>
<t:p>"Jenny, is this true?"</t:p>
<t:p>"That Kitty's been a good wife?"</t:p>
<t:p>"That Kitty is my wife, that I am old, that"—he waved a hand at the altered
    room—"all this."</t:p>
<t:p>"It is all true. She is your wife, and this place is changed, and it's better and
    jollier in all sorts of ways, believe me, and fifteen years have passed. Why,
    Chris, can't you see that I have grown old?" My vanity could hardly endure his
    slow stare, but I kept my fingers clasped on my lap. "You see?"<t:pb n="063"/></t:p>
<t:p>He turned away with an assenting mutter; but I saw that deep down in him, not to
    be moved by any material proof, his spirit was incredulous.</t:p>
<t:p>"Tell me what seems real to you," I begged. "Chris, be a pal. I'll never
    tell."</t:p>
<t:p>"M-m-m," he said. His elbows were on his knees, and his hands stroked his thick
    tarnished hair. I could not see his face, but I knew that his skin was red and
    that his gray eyes were wet and bright. Then suddenly he lifted his chin and
    laughed, like a happy swimmer breaking through a wave that has swept him far
    inshore. He glowed with a radiance that illuminated the moment till my blood
    tingled and I began to rub my hands together and laugh, too. "Why, Monkey
    Island's real. But you don't know old Monkey. Let me tell you."<t:pb n="064"/></t:p>
