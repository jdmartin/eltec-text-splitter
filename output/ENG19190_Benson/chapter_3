<t:head>CHAPTER III</t:head>
<t:head>THE EVERLASTING BOY</t:head>
<t:p>
<t:pb n="54"/>
<t:pb n="55"/>Mitten Island is a place of fine weather, its air is always like stained glass
     between you and perfection. Always you will find in the happy ways of Mitten Island a
     confidence that the worst is left behind, and that even the worst was not so very bad. You can
     afford to remember the winter, for even the winter was beautiful; you can smile in the sun and
     think of the grey flush that used to overspread the island under its urgent crises of snow, and
     it seems that always there was joy running quickly behind the storms, joy looking with the sun
     through a tall window in a cloud. Even the most dreadful curtain of a winter's day was always
     drawn up at sunset; its straight edge rose slowly, disclosing flaming space, and the dramatic
     figures of the two island churches, exulting and undying martyrs in the midst of flames.
     <t:pb n="56"/></t:p>
<t:p>It is a place of fine weather, and this is a book of fine weather, a book written in Spring.
     I will not remember the winter and the rain. It was the Spring that brought Sarah Brown to
     Mitten Island, and the Spring that first showed her magic. It was the Spring that awoke her on
     her first morning in the House of Living Alone.</t:p>
<t:p>She awoke because it was so beautiful outside, and because there was a beautiful day coming.
     You could see the day secretly making preparations behind a shining mist. She heard a sound of
     breathless singing, and the whipping of stirred grass in the garden, the sound of some one
     unbearably happy, dancing. Now there is hardly anything but magic abroad before seven o'clock
     in the morning. Only the disciples of magic like getting their feet wet, and being furiously
     happy on an empty stomach.</t:p>
<t:p>Sarah Brown went to her window. The newborn trembling slants of smoke went up from the houses
     of the island. There was a sky of that quiet design which suffices half a day unchanged. A
     garden of quite a good many yards lay behind the house;
     <t:pb n="57"/>it contained no potatoes or anything useful, only long, very green grass, and a may
     tree, and a witch dancing. The extraordinary music to which she was dancing was partly the
     braying of a neighbouring donkey, and partly her own erratic singing. She danced, as you may
     imagine, in a very far from grown-up way, rather like a baby that has thought of a new funny
     way of annoying its Nana; and she sang, too, like a child that inadvertently bursts into loud
     tuneless song, because it is morning and yet too early to get up. A little wandering of the
     voice, a little wandering of the feet.... The may tree in the middle of the garden seemed to be
     her partner. A small blot moved up and down the chequered trunk of the tree, and that was the
     shadow of a grey squirrel, watching the dancing. The squirrel wore the same fur as the
     two-and-a-half-guinea young lady wears, and sometimes it looked with a tilted head at the
     witch, and sometimes it buried its face in its hands and sat for a while shaken with secret
     laughter. There was certainly something more funny than beautiful about the witch's dancing.
     She
     <t:pb n="58"/>laughed herself most of the time. She was wearing a mackintosh, which was in itself
     rather funny, but her feet were bare.</t:p>
<t:p>A voice broke in: "Good for you, cully."</t:p>
<t:p>It was Sarah Brown's fellow-lodger leaning from her window.</t:p>
<t:p>The squirrel rippled higher up the may tree.</t:p>
<t:p>The pleasure of the thing broke like an eggshell. Sarah Brown turned back towards her bed. It
     was too early to get up. It was too late to go to sleep again. Eunice, her hot-water bottle,
     she knew, lay cold as a serpent to shock her feet if she returned. Besides, the Dog David was
     asleep on the middle of the counterpane, and she was too good a mother to wake him. There are a
     good many things to do when you find yourself awake too early. It is said that some people sit
     up and darn their stockings, but I refer now to ordinary people, not to angels. Utterly
     resourceless people find themselves reduced to reading the penny stamps on yesterday's letters.
     There is a good deal of food for thought on a penny stamp, but nothing
     <t:pb n="59"/>really uplifting. Some people I know employ this morning leisure in scrubbing their
     consciences clean, thus thriftily making room for the sins of the coming day. But Sarah Brown's
     conscience was dreadfully receptive, almost magnetic; little sins like smuts lay always deep
     upon it. There were a few regrettable seconds in every minute she lived, I think, though she
     never enjoyed the compensations attached to a really considerable sin. Anyway her conscience
     would have been a case for pumice-stone, and when she was happy she always tried to forget it.
     Yet she was not without a good many very small and unessential resources for sleepless moments.
     Often she wrote vague comments on matters with which she was not familiar, in an exercise-book,
     always eventually mislaid. She would awake from dear and unspeakable dreams full of hope, and
     tell herself stories about herself, trying on various lives and deaths like clothes. The result
     was never likely enough even to laugh at.</t:p>
<t:p>To-day she had watched magic dancing in a mackintosh, and she was at a loss.</t:p>
<t:p>There was a knock upon her door, and
     <t:pb n="60"/>a voice: "Hi, cocky, could you oblige me with a loan of a few 'alfpence for the
     milkman. I 'aven't a bean in me purse."</t:p>
<t:p>"Nor have I," said Sarah Brown, opening the door. "But I can pawn — "</t:p>
<t:p>"Ow, come awf it, Cuffbut," said the fellow-lodger. "This is a respectable 'ouse, more or
     less, and you ain't goin' out to pawn nothink in your py-jams. I'll owe it to the milkman
     again. Not but what I 'adn't p'raps better pay 'im after all. I got me money paid yesterday,
     on'y I 'ad thought to put it away for Elbert."</t:p>
<t:p>"Are you Peony, the other lodger?"</t:p>
<t:p>"Thet's right, dearie."</t:p>
<t:p>Peony was not in her first youth, in fact she was comfortably into her second. Her voice was
     so beautiful that it almost made one shy, but her choice of language, tending as it did in the
     other direction, reassured one. She had fine eyes of an absolute grey, and dark hair parted in
     the middle and drawn down so as to make a triangle of a face which, left to itself, would have
     been square. Her teeth spoilt her; the gaps among them looked like the front row of
     <t:pb n="61"/>the stalls during the first scene of a revue, or the last scene of a play by
     Shakspere. On the whole, she looked like the duckling of the story, serenely conscious of a
     secret swanhood. She showed unnatural energy even in repose, and lived as though she had a taxi
     waiting at the door.</t:p>
<t:p>"Who's Elbert?" asked Sarah Brown, and then wished she had not asked, for even without
     Peony's flush she should have guessed.</t:p>
<t:p>"'Arf a mo, kiddie, till I get rid of the milkman. Come an' sit on the stairs, an' I'll tell
     you a tale. I like no end tellin' this tale."</t:p>
<t:p>Harold the Broomstick was desultorily sweeping the stairs. He worked harder when first
     conscious of being watched, but seeing that they intended to stay there, on the top step, he
     made this the excuse to disappear indolently, leaving little heaps of dust on several of the
     lower steps.</t:p>
<t:p>"I come across Elbert first when I was about eight an' twenty," said Peony, when Sarah Brown,
     in rather a loud dressing-gown, had taken her seat on the stairs beside her.
     <t:pb n="62"/> "Elbert was the ideel kid, an' me — nothing to speak of. Nothin' more than a lump
     o' mud, I use to say. All my life, if you'll believe me, cully, I've lived in mud — an' kep' me
     eye on the moon, so to say. I worked in a factory all day, makin' mud, as it were, for muddy
     Jews, an' every Saturday night I took 'ome twelve shillin's-worth o' mud to keep meself alive
     in a city o' mud until the Saturday after. But o' nights there was the moon, or else the stars,
     or else the sunset, an' anyway all the air between to look at. I 'ad a back room, 'igh up, and
     o' nights I use to sit an' breave there, an' look at the sky. Believe me, dearie, I was mad
     about breavin' — it was me only recreation, so to say. By Gawd, it's a fair wonder 'ow the sky
     an' the air keeps on above the mud, and 'ow we looks at it, an' breaves it, an' never pays no
     rent for it, when all's said an' done. There ain't never a penny put in the slot for the
     moonlight, when you come to think of it, yet still it all goes on. Well, in those days, I never
     spoke to a soul, an' 'ated everybody, an' I got very queer, queerer nor
     <t:pb n="63"/>many as is locked up in Claybury this minute. I got to thinkin' as 'ow there was a
     debt 'anging over us all, some'ow the sky seemed like a sort of upper floor to all our 'ouses,
     with the stars an' the moon for windows, an' it seemed like as if there did oughter be some
     rent to pay, though the Landlord was a reel gent and never pressed for it. There might be
     people 'oo lived among flowers in the sunlight, an', so to say, rented the parlour floor, but
     not me. I 'ad the upper floor, an' breaved the light o' the moon. As for flowers — bless you,
     I'd never 'ardly seen a flower stuck proper to the ground until a year ago. Well, dearie, I use
     to make believe as 'ow we'd all get a charnce, all to ourselves, to pay what we owed. Some
     people, I thought, runs away from the debt, an' some pays it in bad money, but, I ses to
     meself, if ever my charnce come, I'll pay it the very best I can. Lawd, 'ow I 'ated everybody
     in those days. It seemed like people was all rotten, an' as if all the churches an' all the
     cherities was the rottenest of all the lot. Well, then, dearie, Elbert blew in. You know what
     <t:pb n="64"/>kids is mostly like in the Brown Borough, but Elbert — 'e never was. Straight legs
     'e 'ad, an' never a chilblain nor a sore, an' a small up-lookin' face, an' yallery 'air — what
     you could see of it, for of course I always made 'im keep it nicely cropped to the pink. You
     never see sich a clean boy, you never see 'im but what 'e seemed to 'ave sponged 'is collar
     that minute, an' the little seat to 'is breeks always patched in the right colour, an' all. Yet
     'e wasn't one of them choir-boy kinds, 'e could 'ave 'is little game with the best of 'em, an'
     often kicked up no end of a row when we was playin' pretendin' games of a wet Sunday. 'E 'ad
     one little game 'e loved best of all — not marbles, it wasn't, nor peg-tops — but there, I
     won't tell you what it was, for you'd laugh like the gal at the shop did when I spoke of it. I
     don't often get talkin', but I'd 'ad a nip of brandy at the time. Laugh fit to bust, she did —
     'avin' 'ad a nip of the same 'erself — an' as't if Elbert wasn't blind as well, an' if 'e wore
     any clothes besides wings.... The funny thing was thet Elbert did 'ave bad sight, it always
     seemed odd to me thet with 'is
     <t:pb n="65"/>weak eyes 'e should choose to play the little game 'e did. I use to take 'im to the
     'Eath of a summer Sunday, an' 'e use to stand on them little ridges below the Spaniards Road,
     with 'is eyes shut against the sun, never botherin' to take no aim. I can see 'im now,
     a-pulling of the string of 'is bow — it 'ad an 'igh note, like the beginnin' of a bit o' music
     — an' then awf 'e'd go like a rebbit, to see where the arrer fell. It was always a marvel to me
     'e didn't put somebody's eye out, but I didn't mind — I 'ated everybody. 'E didn't live with
     me, 'e just came in an' out. 'E never tol' me 'is name was Elbert — I just called 'im thet, the
     prettiest name I knew. 'E never tol' me 'oo 'is people were; I shouldn't think they could 'ave
     bin Brown Borough people, for Elbert seemed to 'ave bin about a lot, seen mountains an' oceans
     an' sichlike, an' come acrost a lot of furriners — even Germans. 'E talked a lot about people —
     as good as a novelette 'is stories was, but bloody 'igh-flavoured. Children knows a lot in the
     Brown Borough. 'Ow 'e'd noticed the things 'e 'ad with them blindish eyes of
     <t:pb n="66"/> 'is, I don't know. I got to count on that boy no end. Fair drunk with
     satisfaction, I use to feel. Call me a fool if you like, cully, but it was three or four year
     before I got the idee that there was anythink funny about Elbert. It was when it begun to look
     as if the War 'ad come to stop, an' one couldn't look at any boy without countin' up to see 'ow
     long 'e 'ad before the Army copped 'im. An' then I calc'lated that Elbert should be rising
     fourteen now, an' I saw then thet 'e 'adn't grown an inch since I first see 'im, nor 'e hadn't
     changed 'is ways, but still 'e run about laughin', playin' 'is little kiddy-game, with 'is face
     to the sun. An' then I remembered 'ow often 'e'd tol' me things thet seemed too 'istorical for
     sich as 'im to come by honest, tales about blokes in 'istory — nanecdotes 'e'd use to pass
     acrost about Admiral Nelson, or Queen Bess — she use to make 'im chuckle, she did — an' a chap
     called Shilly or Shally, 'oo was drownded. An' I got struck all of an 'eap, to think 'e was
     some sort of an everlasting boy, an' p'raps 'e was a devil, I thought, an' p'raps I'd sold me
     soul without knowin' it. I never took
     <t:pb n="67"/>much stock of me soul, but I always 'ad that debt o' mine in me mind, an' I wanted
     to pay it clean. For them London mists agin the sky in the Spring, an' for the moonlight, an'
     for the sky just before a thunderstorm — all them things seemed to 'ave come out of the same
     box, like, an' I didn't like feelin' as 'ow they was all jest charity.... 'Owever, I got this
     idee about Elbert, an' I didn't sleep a wink thet night, an' couldn't enjoy me starlight. In
     the mornin' 'e come as usual, with 'is pretty blind smile, an' I ses to 'im: 'Elbert,' I ses,
     'You ain't a crool boy, are you? You wouldn't do anythink to 'urt me?' Lookin' at 'im, I
     couldn't believe it. ''Urt you?' 'e ses quite 'appily; 'an' why wouldn't I 'urt you? I'd as
     lief send you to the Devil as not,' 'e ses. Well, cocky, I don't mind tellin' you I lost me
     'ead at that. I run awiy — run awiy from my Elbert — Oh, Gosh! I bin an' give up me bits o'
     sticks to a neighbour, an' got a place, an' went into service. I sneaked out one night, when
     Elbert 'ad gone 'ome. I got a place up Kilburn way, an ol' couple, retired from the pawnbrokin'
     <t:pb n="68"/> line. The ol' man 'ad softening in 'is brain, an' said one thing all the blessed
     time, murmurin' like a bee. The ol' woman never spoke, never did no work, lef' it all to me.
     She was always a-readin' of 'er postcard album, shiftin' the cards about — she 'ad thousands,
     besides one 'ole book full of seaside comics. A beautiful collection. Well, I was dishin' up
     the tea one night in the kitchen, an' I 'eard a laugh — Elbert's laugh, like three little bells
     — an' there was Elbert lookin' in at the window. I run after 'im — there wasn't nobody there.
     When I come back the tripe was burnt an' I lef' it on the fire an' run away, thet minute. They
     owed me wages, but I didn't stop for nothink. I was frightened. I got a place afterwards up
     Islington, three ol' sisters, kep' a fancy shop, fought with each other every minute of their
     lives. I 'adn't bin there two days before Elbert walked in, jest as laughin' an' lovin' as
     ever. I see then it was no use, good or bad 'e'd got me. I let 'im sit in my kitchen, an' give
     'im some sugar-bread. An' one of the ol' cat-sisters come in. ''Oo's this?' she ses.
     <t:pb n="69"/> 'A young friend o' mine,' I ses. 'You're a liar,' she ses, 'I seed from the first
     minute as you wasn't no respectable gal,' she ses, 'an' now per'aps me sisters'll believe me.
     So out I 'ad to go, an' I wasn't sorry. It seemed like there wasn't nothink in the world
     mattered but Elbert, like as if damnation was worth while. 'Ow, Elbert,' I ses, 'I'd go to the
     Devil for you, an' smile all the way.' 'E laughed an' laughed. 'Come on,' 'e ses, 'to-day's an
     'oliday.' Though it wasn't, it was a Tuesday in August. 'Come on,' 'e ses, 'get yer best 'at
     on,' an' 'e gives me a yaller rose, for me button-'ole. A year ago come August, thet was. I
     follered Elbert at a run all up the City Road, an' near the Angel we took a taxi. 'Tell 'im
     Euston Station,' ses Elbert, an' so I did. You know the 'uge top o' thet station from the 'ill
     by the Angel — well, kid, I tell you I saw a reel mountain for the first time, when I saw thet.
     It was the 'eat mist, an' a sort o' pink light made a reel 'ighland landscape out of it. I paid
     the taxi-man over 'alf of all the money I 'ad, an' we went to the ticket-awfice. 'Elbert,' I
     ses, 'where
     <t:pb n="70"/>shell we book to,' I ses, like that, though I 'adn't 'ardly a bloody oat in me
     purse. 'Take a platform ticket,' 'e ses, an' so I did. But 'e run on to the platform without no
     ticket, an' begun dancin' up an' down among the people like a mad thing, but nobody seemed to
     mind 'im. I set down on a seat to watch 'im. I thought: 'Blimey,' I thought, 'if I ain't under
     thet blinkin' mountain now, an' all these people,' I ses, 'is the Little People they tell of,
     that lives inside 'ills, an' on'y comes out under the moon.' I remembered thet moonlight debt
     o' mine, an' I thought — 'I'm done with the mud now, I'm comin' alive now,' I ses, 'and this'll
     be my charnce.' Presently Elbert come back to me, an' 'e was draggin' a soldier by the 'and.
     'This is a magic man,' ses Elbert, 'come back from livin' under the sky. Can't you feel the
     magic?' 'e ses.</t:p>
<t:p>"Well, dearie, take it 'ow you will, thet's 'ow I met my Sherrie. A magic man 'e was, for 'e
     'ad my ticket taken, an' never seemed surprised. Ten days leave 'e 'ad, an' we spent it at an
     inn in a village on a moor, jest a mile out o' sound of the sea.
     <t:pb n="71"/> The moor an' the sea, touchin' each other. ... Oh Gawd!... The sea was like my sky
     at night come nearer — come near enough to know better, like. In between the moor an' the sea
     there was the beach — it looked like a blessed boundary road between two countries, an' it led
     away to where you couldn't see nothing more except a little white town, sort of built 'igh upon
     a mist, more like a star.... Oh Gawd!...</t:p>
<t:p>"Anyway, Cuffbut, thet was me charnce, an' thet's 'ow I come to know 'ow my debt was goin' to
     be paid. Sherrie understood all thet. 'E was a magic man, 'e was. At least, 'e was mostly
     magic, but some of 'im was nothin' but a fool when all's said an' done — like any other man. I
     couldn't 'ave done with an all-magic bloke. Ow, 'e was a fool.... All the things 'e might 'ave
     bin able to do, like polishin' 'is equipment, or findin' 'is clean socks, 'e use to forever be
     askin' me to do. I loved doin' it. But all the things 'e couldn't do at all, like drawin' me
     likeness, or cuttin' out a blouse for me, 'e was forever tryin' to do."</t:p>
<t:p>She spoke of Sherrie as a naturalist
     <t:pb n="72"/>would speak of a new animal, gradually finding out the pretty and amusing ways of
     the creature.</t:p>
<t:p>"I called 'im Sherrie because thet's what 'e called me. A French word it was, 'e ses, meaning
     'dearie,' as it were. 'E was a reel gent, was Sherrie. I as't 'im once why 'e took up with a
     woman like me, instead of with a reel young lady. 'E ses as 'ow 'e'd never met before anybody
     'oo seed themselves from outside an' yet was fairly honest. I know what 'e meant, for I was
     always more two people than one, an' I watch meself sometimes as if I was a play. I wouldn't be
     tellin' you this story, else. Well, dearie, Elbert was always in an' out, an' always
     a-hollerin' an' a-laughin' an' a-playin' 'is game. 'E stayed with us all them ten days, an' 'e
     come with me to Victoria, to see Sherrie off to France. It's Sherrie's allotted money what I
     fetch every week. But I won't touch it, I puts it away for Elbert. I don't want to owe nothin'
     to nobody, for I'm payin' sich a big debt. Elbert, when 'e comes back to me, 'e's going to be
     my payment to the world, an'
     <t:pb n="73"/> it's got to be good money. For Elbert left me after Sherrie went. 'E said as 'ow
     'e was going 'ome, an' as 'ow 'e would come back to me in the Spring, an' stay with me always.
     It wasn't like partin', e' ses, 'im an' me could never do thet. I know what 'e meant,
     now...."</t:p>
<t:p>"And what about Sherrie?" asked Sarah Brown.</t:p>
<t:p>"Oh, Sherrie, 'e never writes to me. But 'e promised too to come back in the Spring, an' so
     'e will, for there ain't no Boche bullet that can 'it a magic man."</t:p>
<t:p>"It's springtime now," said Sarah Brown.</t:p>
<t:p>"It's springtime now," repeated Peony. "Ow, it's wonderful, seems like as if I was gettin'
     too much given me, so as I can never repay. But I'm keepin' count, I'm not forgettin'. It ain't
     long now before I'll pay my debt. Come the middle o' May...."
