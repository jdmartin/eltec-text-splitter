<p>SOMEWHERE in these papers I have said that Shelmerdene left England, but I touched on it very
     lightly, for I am only half-heartedly a realist, and may yet live to be accused of shuffling
     humanity behind a phrase.... Youth must endure its periods of loneliness with what grace it
     can; and youth could endure them as resignedly as its preceptors, if it were not for its
     grotesque self-importance, which inflates loneliness to such a size that it envelopes a young
     man's whole being, leaving him at the end a sorry wreck of what was once a happy mortal.
     Anyway, that is what happened to me; I took the whole affair in the worst possible spirit, and,
     during that probation time to wisdom, thought and wrote and did so many silly things, smashed
     ideals and cursed idols with such morbid thoroughness and conviction (after the fashion of all
     the bitterest young men), that I must have been as detestable
     <pb n="140"/> a person as ever trickled wheezily from the, well, pessimistic pen of a Mr.
     Wyndham Lewis.... But it takes very little effort to forget that time entirely, to let it bury
     itself with what mourning it can muster from the Shades which sent it to plague me. Enough that
     it passed, but not before it had, as they say, "put me wise" about the world and its ways.</p>
<p>For Shelmerdene had left behind her much more than just loneliness; much that was more
     precious and, thankfully, more lasting; for she had found a young man shaped entirely of acute
     angles and sharp corners, and had rubbed and polished them over with such delicate tact that it
     was only months, after she had gone that I suddenly realised how much more fit I was to cope
     with a complicated world since I had known her. But, more importantly, Shelmerdene to me was
     England. Before I met her I did not know England; I knew English, but England only as a man
     knows the landmarks about him in a strange country. But when she had come and gone England was
     a discovered country, a vast and ever-increasing panorama
     <pb n="141"/> in which discoveries were continually made, leaving yet more hidden valleys of
     discoveries still to be made—and to be enjoyed! So much and much more, O unbeliever, I learnt
     from Shelmerdene, and in the learning of it lay the best and gladdest lesson of all.</p>
<p>Time, they say, can efface all things, but in truth it can efface nothing but its own
     inability to smooth out the real problems of life; so at least I have found in the one instance
     in which I have challenged time to do its best for me, a slave bound down by an unholy
     wizardry; or else, perhaps, it was that Shelmerdene was not made of the stuff which fades into
     the years and becomes musty and haggard in their increasing company. I do not know. But, take
     it as I will, all the service time has been able to do for me has been negative, for without
     disarranging one hair of her head it has only emphasised in me the profound and subtle
     influence of that gracefully licentious woman whom I once called Shelmerdene, because, I told
     her, "it is the name of an American girl which I found in a very bad American novel about
     <pb n="142"/> the fanatical Puritans of New England, and the name seems to suit you because in
     New England they would have treated you exactly as they treated Shelmerdene Gray, the heroine
     of this book, whom they branded and burnt as a shameless woman, but loved in their withered
     hearts for her gaiety, and elegance, and wit, which they couldn't understand, but vaguely felt
     was as much an expression of Christ as their own wizened virtue."</p>
<p>Out of the silence of two years at last came a letter from her. I found it when I came in
     very late one night, and for a long time I stood in my little hall and examined the Eastern
     stamp and postmark; and the writing on the envelope was so exactly the same as on the last note
     she had sent me before leaving England that I had to smile at the idea of Shelmerdene, in the
     rush of her last pursuit of her perfect fate, laying in a sufficient store of her own special
     nibs to last her for the lifetime she intended to spend abroad; for when I opened the letter I
     found that, as I had guessed, she would never come back to England, saying, "I am a fugitive
     <pb n="143"/> branch which has at last found its parent tree.... I have run my perfect fate to
     earth, Dikran! more perfect than any dream, more lasting than the most perfect dream. And life
     is so beautiful that I can scarcely bear your not being here to share it, for, you see, I am
     quite sure that you are still the dear you were two years ago. But it is so tiresome of you to
     be so young, and to have to experience so many things before you can qualify for my sort of
     happiness; and on top of being young you are so restless and fussy, too, with your ideas of
     what you are going to do, and your ambitions—how it must tire the mind to be ambitious! It
     would certainly tire mine in this climate, so will you please make a note of the fact that I
     simply forbid you to come out here to join me! You are too young to be happy, and you aren't
     wise enough to be contented; and you can't hope to be wise enough until you begin to lose a bit
     of that mane of hair of yours, which I hope you never will, for I remember how I loved one
     particular wave in it in the far-off age when I thought I was in love with you.... It is
     terrible, but I am forgetting
     <pb n="144"/> England. Terrible, because it must be wrong to forget one's country, seeing how
     you oppressed nationalities go on remembering your wretched countries for centuries of years,
     and throwing bombs and murdering policemen for all the world as though you weren't just as
     happy as every one else, while I, with a country, which is after all worth remembering, go and
     forget it after a paltry two years! Of course it will always be my country, and I shall always
     love it for the good things it has given me, but as a <foreign>fact</foreign> in my life it has
     faded into something more dim than a memory. A spell has been put upon me, Dikran, to prevent a
     possible ache in my heart for the things I was born among, a spell which has made me forget
     Europe and all my friends in it except just you, and you because, in spite of all your English
     airs, you will always be a pathetic little stranger in a very strange land, fumbling for the
     key.... Ah, this wise old East of mine! so old and so wise, my dear, that it knows for certain
     that nothing is worth doing; and as you happen, perhaps, on the ruins of a long-dead city by
     the desert, you can almost hear it
     <pb n="145"/> chuckling to itself in its hard-earned wisdom, as though to say that since God
     Himself is that very same Law which creates men, and cities, and religions only to level them
     into the dust of the roads and the sands of the desert, why fight against God! It is a corrupt
     and deadening creed, this of the East, but it has a weight of ancestral will behind it which
     forces you to believe in it; and belief in it leaves you without your Western defences, and
     open to be charmed into non-resistance, as I and my Blue Bird have been charmed, else perhaps I
     would not now be so happy, and might even be dining with you on the terrace of the Hyde Park
     Hotel.... Rather bitterly you have often called me the slave of Ishtar, though at the time I
     did not know who the lady was, for I was always rather weak about goddesses and such like; but
     I guessed she had something to do with love because of the context, for you were developing
     your pleasant theory about how I would come to a bad end, someday.... Well, Dikran, that
     'someday' of your prophecy has come. I've never belonged so wholly to Ishtar as I do now that I
     am perhaps
     <pb n="146"/> in the very same country in which she once haunted the imagination of the myriad
     East. I've made a mess of life, I've come to my bad end, and, as I tell you, I have never known
     such perfect happiness. The world couldn't wish me a worse fate, and I couldn't wish myself a
     better.... Don't write to me, please. I can always imagine you much more clearly than your
     letters can express you, and if I think of you as doing big things, as I pray you may, it will
     be better for me than knowing that you are doing nothing at all, which might easily happen,
     seeing how lazy you are.... In the dim ages I was all wrong about life. For I know now that
     restraint in itself is the most perfect emotion...."</p>
<p>I laid the letter down, and as the windows were already greying with the March dawn it did
     not seem worth while going to a sleepless bed; and so I sat on in my chair, drawing my overcoat
     round me for warmth, and smoked many cigarettes. I felt very old indeed, for was not that
     letter the echo of a long-dead experience, and are not long-dead experiences the peculiar
     property of old men?
     <pb n="147"/></p>
<gap n="images/illus_147.jpg" unit="graphic"/>
<p>No visions of the Shelmerdene of that letter came up to disturb my peace, for she did not fit
     in with my ideas of the East, she had never appealed to that Eastern side which must be
     somewhere in me, but had always been to me a perfect symbol of the grace and kindliness and
     devilry of the arrogant West. I could not see her as she described herself, happy, meditative,
     wise in contentment.... Her contentment is too much like an emotion, and therefore spurious, I
     thought, and so she will still dine with me on the terrace of the Hyde Park Hotel, and will
     wonder why I look so differently at her, for I will still be young while she will be
     <pb n="148"/> middle-aged.... No, that letter conjured up no perfect vision of her in the East,
     except that I saw her, melodramatically perhaps, pleading on her knees for release from the
     bonds of Ishtar, for I knew that not even a Shelmerdene among women can evade the penalty of so
     many unsuccessful love-affairs just by the success of one.</p>
<p>The grey of the March dawn became paler, and the furniture and books in my room seemed so wan
     and unreal that I thought drowsily that they were a dream of last night and were fading before
     the coming daylight; and later, when my thoughts had mellowed into a security of retrospect, I
     may have slept, for I realised with a start that the maid had come in to tidy up the room for
     breakfast, but had got no further than the door, perhaps wondering whether I had been very
     drunk the night before, or only just "gay."</p>
<p>Retrospect came naturally after that letter, for she had written at the end how she had found
     the true worth of "restraint"; it would have been just a phrase in a letter if I had not
     remembered, as she must have
     <pb n="149"/> when she wrote it, that the word had a context, and that the context lay in a
     long summer afternoon on a silent reach of the river many miles from Maidenhead.... One day
     that summer I had suggested to her that, as the world was becoming a nuisance with its heat and
     dust, we might go and stay on the river for a few days, but she had said, quite firmly, "No, I
     can't do that. I am not yet old enough to put my name down for the divorce stakes, so if you
     don't mind, Dikran, we will call that bet off and think of something else. For if that same
     husband heard of my staying on the river with a young man of uncelibate eye and uncertain
     occupation, he would at once take steps about it, and although I like you well enough as a man,
     I couldn't bear you as a co-respondent.... But if you really do want to stay on the river, I
     will get the Hartshorns to ask us both down, for they have a delightful house on a little hill,
     from which you can see the twilight creeping over the Berkshire downs across the river."</p>
<p>"Oh, we can't do that," I said; "Guy
     <pb n="150"/> Hartshorn is such a stiffnecked ass and his wife is dull enough to spoil any
     river—"</p>
<p>"Tolerance, my dear, is what you lack," she said; "tolerance and a proper understanding of
     the relation between a stiffnecked ass and a possible host. And Guy, poor dear, always does his
     duty by his guests.... Please don't be silly about it, Dikran. The Hartshorns distinctly need
     encouragement as hosts, so you and I will go down and encourage them. And if you can manage to
     cloak your evil thoughts behind a hearty manner and watch Guy as he swings a racing punt down
     the river, you will learn more about punting and the reason why Englishmen are generally
     considered to be superior to foreigners than I could teach you in a lifetime."</p>
<p>We had been two days at the house on the little hill by the river (for, of course, we went
     there) before, on the third afternoon, after lunch, our chance came, and Shelmerdene and I were
     at last alone on the river; I had not the energy to do more than paddle very leisurely and look
     from here to there, but always in the end to come back to the
     <pb n="151"/> woman who lay facing me against the pale green cushions of the Hartshorn punt,
     steeped in the happy sunshine of one of those few really warm days which England now and again
     manages to steal from the molten South, and exhibits in a new green and golden loveliness. From
     round a bend of the river we could quite clearly see the ivy-covered Georgian house of our
     host, perched imperiously up on the top of its little hill, but not imperiously enough to
     prevent the outlet of two days' impatience in the curse I vented on it.</p>
<p>"Little man with little toy wants big toy of the same pattern and cries when he can't have
     it," she mocked me, and smiled away my bad temper, which had only a shallow root in impatience.
     But I would not let it go all at once, for man is allowed licence on summer afternoons on the
     river, and I challenged her to say if she did not know of better ways of spending the whole
     glorious time between dinner and midnight than by playing bridge, "as we tiresomely do at the
     house on the hill, much to the delight of that sombre weeping elm which looks in at the
     <pb n="152"/> window and can then share the burden of its complaining leaves with my
     pessimistic soul."</p>
<p>"We will leave your soul severely alone for the moment, but as for playing bridge, I think it
     is very good for you," she said. "It is very good for you to call three No Trumps, and be
     doubled by some one who won't stand any nonsense, and go down four hundred or so. It teaches
     you restraint."</p>
<p>"Restraint," I said, "is the Englishman's art of concealing his emotions in such a way that
     every one can guess exactly what they are. And I have acquired it so perfectly that you know
     very well that only the other day you told me how you admired my restraint, and how I would
     never say to a man's face what I couldn't say just as well behind his back." But she did not
     answer, and in silence I pulled into a little aimless backwater, and moored by a willow which
     let through just enough sun to speck Shelmerdene's dress with bright arabesques.</p>
<p>I changed my seat for the cushions and lay full length in front of Shelmerdene, but it was as
     though she had become part of the
     <pb n="153"/> river, she was so silent. I said something, I can't remember what it was, but it
     must have suited the day and my mood. I could not see her face because she had turned it
     towards the bank and it was hidden under the brim of her pale blue hat, but when my words had
     broken the quietness and she turned it towards me, I was surprised at the firm set of her lips
     and the sadness of her smile.</p>
<p>"You are making love to me, and that is quite as it should be," she said. "But on the most
     beautiful of all days I have the saddest thoughts, for though you laughed at me when I talked
     about restraint, I was really very serious indeed. I know a lot about restraint, my dear, and
     how the lack of it can make life suddenly very horrible ... for once upon a time I killed an
     old man because I didn't know the line between my desires and his endurance." She shook her
     head at me gently. "No, that won't do, Dikran. You were going to say something pretty about my
     good manners, but that is all so much play-acting, and, besides, good manners are my trade and
     profession, and
     <pb n="154"/> without them I should long ago have been down and under, as I deserve to be much
     more than Emma Hamilton ever did.... The tragedy about people like me is that we step into life
     at the deep end and find only the shallow people there, and when we meet some one really deep
     and very sincere, like that old man, we rather resent it, for we can't gauge him by the
     standards we use for each other. Men like that bring a sudden reality into life, but the
     reality is unacceptable and always ugly because it is forced upon one, while the only realities
     that are beautiful are those that were born in your heart when you were born; just like your
     country for you, which you have never seen and may never see, and yet has been your main
     reality in life since you were born; a reality as sad and beautiful as the ancestral memories
     which must lurk somewhere in you, but which you can't express because you have not learnt yet
     how to be really natural with yourself. And when you have learnt that you will have learnt the
     secret of great writing, for literature is the natural raw material which every man secretes
     within himself, but
     <pb n="155"/> only a few can express it to the world. But I may be wrong about all that, and
     anyway you must know a great deal more about great thinking and great writing than I do, for
     you have read about it in dull books while I have only sensed it in my trivial way...."</p>
<p>"Shelmerdene, I want to hear about your old man," I said, "whom you say you killed. But that
     is only your way of saying that he was in love with you, and that you hurt him so much that he
     died of it."</p>
<p>"Ah, if it had been only that I would not be so sad this afternoon! In fact, I would not be
     sad at all, for he was old and had to die, and all that about love and being hurt is fair and
     open warfare. But it was something much beastlier than that, something animal in me, which will
     make me ashamed whenever I think of that day when we three gave our horses rein down to the
     Breton coast, and I turned on the old man, a very spitfire of a girl broken loose from the
     restraint of English generations, forgetting for one fierce moment that her saddle was not
     covered with the purple of a Roman Augusta, and that she couldn't do as she
     <pb n="156"/> liked in a world of old men.... Have you ever seen a quarrel, a real quarrel,
     Dikran? When some one is so bitterly and intensely angry that he loses all hold on everything
     but his wretched desire to hurt, and unchains a beast which in a second maims him as deeply as
     his enemy—no, it maims him more.</p>
<p>"The old Frenchman was my guardian," she said, "and the last of a name which you can find
     here and there in Court Memoirs, in the thick of that riot of gallantry and intrigue which
     passed for life at old Versailles. But the world has grown out of that and does things much
     better now, for gallantry has been scattered to the four winds of democracy and is the navvy's
     part as much as the gentleman's, while intrigue has become the monopoly of the few darling old
     men who lead governments, more as a way of amusing their daughters than for any special purpose
     of their own. But if the world has grown old since then so had my old man, for he was none of
     your rigid-minded <foreign>cidevant aristos</foreign> whom you can see any day at the Ritz
     keeping up appearances on an occasional
     <pb n="157"/> cocktail and the use of the hotel note-paper; but the air of the <foreign>grand
      seigneur</foreign> hadn't weathered proscriptions and revolutions for nothing, and so still
     clung rather finely to him in spite of himself, and made him seem as old and faded as his
     ancestors in the world in which he had to live, poor old dear! It was cruel of that other nice
     old gentleman above him to put him through the ordeal, for he did so bitterly and genuinely
     resent a world in which honour was second to most things and above nothing. He couldn't
     forgive, you see. He couldn't forgive himself, nor France, nor God, but especially he couldn't
     forgive France. Sedan, revolution, republic—and no Turenne or Bonaparte to thrash a Moltke with
     the flat of his sword, for he wasn't worth more! And all a France could muster were the
     trinkets of her <foreign>monde</foreign> and <foreign>demimonde</foreign>, and a threatening
     murmur of '<foreign>revanche</foreign>' and '<foreign>Alsace-Lorraine</foreign>'—as though
     threats and hatred could wipe out the memory of that day of surrender at Sedan, when he stood
     not ten yards away among only too polite Prussian aides-de-camp while Napoleon put the seal
     <pb n="158"/> on his last mistake, and signed away an empire.... And allowing for exaggeration,
     and the white-hot excitement to which folk who fuss about honour, etc., are liable, there may
     have been something in his point of view about it all, for I once heard a man with a lot of
     letters behind his name say that when a country gives up a limb it also gives up its body; but
     he may have been wrong, for after all France is still France!</p>
<p>"But you would have adored my old man, Dikran, just as I did. He treated life, and men, and
     women with all that etiquette which you so admire, he was simply bristling with etiquette—a
     deal too much of it for my taste, for I was only seventeen then and liked my freedom like any
     other Englander.... But I'm finding it very difficult to describe the man he was, my dear, for
     in our slovenly sort of English we've got used to describing a person by saying he is like
     another person, and I can't do that in this case because he belongs as much to a past age as
     Hannibal, and there isn't any one like him now. And even when he was alive there were very
     few—two or three old
     <pb n="159"/> men as fierce and unyielding and vital as himself, who used to come and dine, and
     say pretty things to little me who sat at the end of the table with very large eyes and
     fast-beating heart, wondering why they weren't all leading Cabinets and squashing revolutions,
     for they seemed to know the secrets of every secret cabal and camarilla in Europe.</p>
<p>"Yes, my old guardian was a remnant of an empire—but what a remnant! Such a fierce-looking
     little man he was, with pale, steel-blue eyes which pierced into you from under a precipice of
     a forehead, a bristling Second Empire moustache, and thin bloodless lips which parted before
     the most exquisite French I've ever heard; I can scarcely bear it when you say I talk French
     divinely, for I know how pitiful mine is compared to the real thing, as done by that old man
     and Sarah Bernhardt, for they were very old friends and she used often to come and lunch with
     us.</p>
<p>"He talked well, too, and all the better for having something to say, as well he might have
     since he had been everything and
     <pb n="160"/> known every one worth knowing of his time—ministers, and rebels, and artists, and
     all the best-known prostitutes of the day; but they did those things better then, Dikran. In
     fact, more as an excuse for getting away from a parvenu Paris than from any Bonapartist
     feelings, for he was always an Orleanist, I think he had represented Louis Napoleon at every
     city which could run to an Embassy from London to Pekin; from where he brought back that ivory
     Buddha which is on my writing-table, and which has an inscription in ancient Chinese saying
     that every man is his own god, but that Buddha is every man's God, which goes a long way to
     prove that the wisdom of the East wasn't as wise as all that, after all.</p>
<p>"But you are getting restless," she said suddenly. "You probably want to open the tea-basket
     to see what's inside, or you've just seen a water rat——"</p>
<p>"No, it's a little more subtle than that, Shelmerdene, although as a fact I do see a water
     rat not a yard from you on the bank.... I merely wanted to know how it was that, since you had
     a perfectly good father
     <pb n="161"/> alive in England, you were allowed to go gadding about in France with a guardian,
     soi-disant——"</p>
<p>"We will ignore your soi-disant, young man. But I'll allow your interruption, for it may seem
     a bit complicated.... It was like this: as the fortunes of our family had run rather to seed
     through generations of fast women and slow horses, my father who was utterly a pet, succumbed
     to politics for an honest living, or, if you pull a face like that about it, for a dishonest
     living. For up to that time, in spite of having exactly the figure for it, he had always
     refused to enter Parliament, because his idea was that the House was just a club, and one
     already belonged to so many better clubs. But once there nothing could stop him, and when he
     entered for the Cabinet stakes he simply romped home with a soft job and a fat income.... But
     all that is really beside the point, for between politics and guineas father and I had had a
     slight disagreement about a certain young man whom I was inclined to marry offhand, being only
     sixteen, you know, and liking the young man—and, of course,
     <pb n="162"/> my father did the correct thing, as he always did, gave the young man a glass of
     port and told him not to be an ass, and shipped me off to Paris to his very old friend. You
     see, he knew about that old Marquis, and how I'd be quite safe in his care, for any young man
     who as much as looked at me would have a pair of gimlet eyes asking him who the devil he might
     be and why he chose to desecrate a young lady's virginal beauty by his so fatuous gaze.</p>
<p>"I've been saying a lot of nice things about that old man to you, but I didn't feel quite
     like that about him at the time. I liked him, of course, because he was a man; but all that
     French business about the sanctity of a young maid's innocence got badly on my nerves, for
     innocence was never my long suit even from childhood, having ears to hear and eyes to see; and
     I soon began to get very bored with life as my old Frenchman saw it. So it wasn't surprising
     that I broke out now and again just to shock him, he was so rigid, but I was always sorry for
     it afterwards because he just looked at me and said not a word for a minute or so, and then
     went
     <pb n="163"/> on talking as though I hadn't hurt him—but I had, Dikran! I had hurt him so much
     that for the rest of the day he often couldn't bear to see me.... But though I was ashamed of
     myself for hurting him, I couldn't stop; life with him was interesting enough in a way, of
     course, but it left out so much, you see; it entirely left out the stupendous fact that I was
     almost a woman, and a very feminine one at that, who liked an odd young man about now and again
     just to play about with. But I wasn't allowed any young men, except a twenty-five-year-old
     over-manicured Vicomte who was so unbearably worldly and useless that I wanted to hit him on
     the head with my guardian's sword-stick, which he always carried about with him, as a sort of
     mental solace, I think. No, there weren't any young men, nor any restaurants, for the old man
     simply ignored them; my dear, there wasn't anything at all in my young life except a few old
     dukes and dowagers, and the aforesaid young Vicomte, who had manicured himself out of existence
     and was considered harmless. And so Paris was a dead city to me who lived in the heart
     <pb n="164"/> of it, and all the more dead for the faded old people who moved about in my life,
     and tried to change my heart into a Louis-Quinze drawing-room hung with just enough beautiful
     and musty tapestries to keep out the bourgeois sunshine and carelessness, which I so longed
     for.</p>
<p>"So I had to amuse myself somehow.... I was a bad young woman then, as I am a bad woman now,
     Dikran; for I've always had a particular sort of vanity which, though it doesn't show on the
     surface like most silly women's, is deep down in me and has never left me alone; a sort of
     vanity which makes itself felt in me only in the off-seasons when no one happens to be in love
     with me and I in love with no one, and tells me that I must be dull and unattractive, utterly
     insignificant and non-existent; it is a weakness in me, but much stronger than I am, for I've
     never resisted it, but been only too glad to fall in love again as soon as I could; and that is
     why I've never made a stand against my impressionableness, why I've never run away from or
     scotched a love-affair which I knew wouldn't last two weeks, however much
     <pb n="165"/> I loved the wretched man at the time; it was so much the line of least
     resistance, it drowned that infernal whisper in me that I was of no account at all in the
     world. But the tragedy of it was, and is, my dear, that indulgence made the monster grow; it
     was like a drug, for as soon as the off-season came again it was at its old tricks with twice
     its old virulence and malice, and, of course, I gave way again. And so on, and so on—did you
     murmur <foreign>dies iræ</foreign>, Dikran? Well, perhaps, but who knows? There's a Perfect
     Fate for every one in this world, and if any one deserves to find it, it's myself who has
     failed to find it so often....</p>
<p>"At that time that wretched vanity of mine was only a faint whisper, but there it was, and it
     had to be satisfied, or else I should have become a good woman, which never did attract me very
     much. I simply had to amuse myself somehow—and so I formed <foreign>la grande idée</foreign> of
     my young life, just as Napoleon III had long ago formed his equally <foreign>grande
      idée</foreign> about Mexico and Maximilian, and with the same disastrous results. True, there
     was no young man about, but there was a man, anyway,
     <pb n="166"/> and a Marquis to boot, even though he was a bit old and rigid. But it was exactly
     that rigidity of his which I wanted to see about; I wanted to find out things, and in my own
     way, don't you see? And so, deliberately and with all the malice in me, I set out to subdue the
     old man. Not childishly and gushingly, although I was so young, but with all the finesse of the
     eternal game, for clever women are born with <foreign>rouge</foreign> on their cheeks.</p>
<p>"But it was a disappointing business; I didn't seem to make the impression I wanted to make;
     all my finesse went for nothing, except as signs of the affection of a ward. Obviously, I
     thought hopelessly, I don't know all there is to be known about subduing old French marquises,
     and I had almost decided to try some other amusement when one May morning, a few months after
     my father had died and appointed him as my guardian and executor, he came into my little
     boudoir, looking more stern and adorable than ever. And as he came in I knew somehow that big
     things were coming into my little life; I don't know how, but I knew it
     <pb n="167"/> as surely as I knew that for all his grand air of calmness he was as shy as any
     schoolboy.</p>
<p>"'My child,' he said very gently, 'I am intruding on you only because I have something to say
     to you of the utmost importance and delicacy. I am too old and too much of the world to do
     things by impulse, and so if I seem to offend against your unworldliness now it is not because
     I have not thought very carefully about what I am going to say.... And I beg you not to count
     it as any more than the suggestion of an old man who thinks only of your good, and to tell me
     quite frankly at the end what you think of it.</p>
<p>"'My old friend, your father,' he said, 'honoured me by placing you entirely in my charge as
     guardian and executor; but on looking into matters I find that he has left very little for me
     to do in the latter capacity—very little, in fact, besides that small estate in Shropshire
     which is entailed on you and your children, as with all its associations of that beautiful
     girl—scarcely older than you are now, your mother—your father could not
     <pb n="168"/> bear the thought of it ever passing to strangers. And so, my child, without any
     reflection on my friend, when you leave my care you enter the world with an old enough name to
     ensure your position, but without the income to maintain it, and, if you will forgive me, a
     quite insignificant <foreign>dot</foreign>; though in your case, as in your beautiful
     mother's,' he added, with his little gallant smile, the first and last of the morning, 'a
      <foreign>dot</foreign> would be the requirement of a blind man.</p>
<p>"'All this preamble must seem very aimless and tiresome to you, but I wish to put all the
     facts before you, my dear, before asking you to take the responsibility, as indeed it is, of
     weighing the suggestion I am going to make.... You must have seen that I am out of sympathy
     with this modern world of yours, that I belong to some other period, better or worse, what does
     it matter? And this world, my child, has little use for those hard-headed persons who cannot
     change the bent of their minds according to its passing whims, and so it has little use for me
     who cannot and will not change.... Do you understand? I mean that I am an old
     <pb n="169"/> man who is every day losing touch with life, and that I know here, quite
     certainly, that I have only a very few more years to live. Do not look sad, child,' he said,
     almost impatiently, 'it is not that I am complaining, but that I wish you to understand my
     thoughts.... Into an old life you have come like a ray of sunshine which is even now making
     light of your little puzzled frown; and I have a debt of gratitude to pay to you, my child,
     which I wish to pay at the expense even of your young peace of mind this morning. Although this
     new world has passed out of my grasp, and will soon pass out of my understanding, I know that
     it is the proper setting for you, the only subtle and beautiful thing that I have found in it,
     and my greatest wish is to leave you in a position worthy of your beauty and intelligence. It
     is not that I am afraid for you, for you are no trivial chit of a girl, but merely that I wish
     to leave you both happy and independent.... And, as it is, I can do nothing, nothing at all!
     For it has been a fixed rule of our family that we may not leave our fortune and property to
     any one
     <pb n="170"/> who does not bear our name, and thus, though my nephew and I have had no occasion
     to meet for some fifteen years, I must leave him such money as I have and all this not
     unappreciated furniture.... And that is why, my child, because of my wish to leave you all I
     have, I have been forced to suggest the only alternative, for I would not have even considered
     it otherwise, that you should consent to bear my name with me for the few years I have to live,
     and then, as a young and beautiful widow of means, and bearing an old French name which may
     still be worth a little consideration, you can take your fit position in the world in which
     you, and not I, were born to be happy....'</p>
<p>"There it is, Dikran, or as much of it as I can remember. And do you need a setting for it?
     Oh, yes, you do, for you are a little lost. Imagine then, sitting by a window of a large house
     in the <foreign>Rue Colbert</foreign>, a young girl with a battered copy of Madame Bovary
     skilfully hidden beside her, and a little erect old man, very stiff but
      <foreign>soigné</foreign>, and cruelly aged by the sunlight which poured blessedly into the
     room, standing by the arm of her
     <pb n="171"/> chair, asking her to marry him. Oh! but you can't imagine it, you will think of
     him as pleading, and of me as surprised. He didn't plead, he couldn't and I, my dear, by the
     time he had finished, wasn't surprised.... I knew, you see. Why, I knew everything! Lexicons
     and encyclopædias had toppled off their dusty shelves, and the Sibylline books had come running
     to my feet, and the whole world had come trotting out with its wisdom, wisdom as clear and cold
     as any Dán-nan-Rón that your friend Gloom ever played on his <foreign>feadan</foreign>, and all
     in the few minutes that an old man was speaking to me! Of course, it should all have happened
     differently; I should have been just a 'trivial chit of a girl,' and then I would have accepted
     all the old darling said, and gaped, and cried, and said 'thank you.' But as it was I did none
     of those things; I'm not quite sure what I did, unless it was nothing at all.... It all seems
     rather mixed now, but on that May morning it was as clear as the sunlight in my cruel young
     mind—how young and how cruel, Dikran!</p>
<p>"You see, as he spoke, he opened out the
     <pb n="172"/> world which he so despised to me; page by page he showed me life, how beastly and
     how beautiful; he showed me both sides, because he himself was both beastly and beautiful....
     And I gloried in it all! At my knowledge and the power it gave me over life. After a while the
     old man didn't seem to matter—there he was, talking away! I knew about him, and just how
     beastly and beautiful he was. For he <emph>was</emph> beautiful in his sincerity; I knew that
     he wished for my good, that to leave me well provided was the only condition he made with
     death; but I knew too that there was a beastly little imp somewhere in him, as in other men,
     which turned his finest thoughts into so much bluff, which told him through the locked and
     bolted doors of his honour that he wanted me for my own sake, and just for that, because I was
     young and because he loved me, and, stripped of all his honour and guardianship, because he
     loved me just as Solomon loved his wives, and Lucifer loved Lilith, and as you love me
     now....</p>
<p>"There it was, then, the whole damnable world, and I, only eighteen, in the middle
     <pb n="173"/> of it! And there he was, my dear old man, more rigid and more adorable than ever;
     for, cruel as I was in seeing through him, I loved him all the more for his sweet naïveté and
     for his old, so old illusions about his motives. While as for being shocked at the way he loved
     me, I've never been shocked by anything but the vulgarity and the indecencies of respectable
     people, who seem to think that sex is purely a sort of indoor sport to be indulged in darkness
     and behind barricaded doors, while it is really a setting for the most beautiful Bacchanal that
     was ever devised by the fairest and purest of God's children. In spite of bibles and the Bishop
     of London, Mary knew what she was about, Dikran. Love doesn't grow anywhere, to be picked up by
     the wayside. Pure beauty grows only where beauty already is....</p>
<p>"But, wise as I was, I didn't know what to say; what could I say? He was waiting; I had to
     say, do something. I did—flung my arms round his neck and told him he was a pet to be so nice
     to me, and that I must think about it. For the first time that he had wanted me to behave like
     a woman
     <pb n="174"/> I behaved consciously like a child—it seemed the easiest way out. And I think he
     saw that I was acting; he had expected something else, for he smiled very sadly down at me, and
     patted my hair, saying I was a sweet child not to be angry with him for making life so suddenly
     serious, and then, very gently, he went away, leaving me in the sunshine, a playmate of the
     gods.... And yet I was so sorry for him that I almost cried when I thought of him sitting alone
     and lonely in his library.</p>
<p>"We never spoke of it again. At first it was as though he was waiting for me to say yes, or
     no, or something, but I didn't say anything, and, later, he seemed to forget. I didn't do it
     out of cruelty, my dear; I simply couldn't say anything, that's all. After sunshine, rain, you
     know; I was dismal, frightened of him a little. The romance of that May morning when he had
     come to me in my room had become a ridiculous fantasy, so that it seemed to me that any
     reference to it would rather tarnish the very splendid dignity which he had kept, and sort of
     increased, through it all. Besides,
     <pb n="175"/> anyway, what was there to say? I had made up my mind as he spoke that morning,
     through all the clearness of my new-found knowledge. I had never a doubt as to what I was going
     to do. It wasn't in me to do as he asked, or rather, as he advised, the old dear! I wish it had
     been in me, for to be a rich French marquise without a marquis is no bad fate for any girl, and
     it might have helped me to steer clear of many complications. But I couldn't, because all my
     life, Dikran, I've been cursed by an utter inability to make any money out of love. And that is
     why I would never be a success in my mother's country of America, where men throw pearls and
     beauty roses about as a matter of course and are very offended if one suggests an economical
     flirtation on a gross of diamonds and a hundredweight of Russian sables.... It isn't that I am
     mean-minded, but I cannot take presents from men who love me, for, after all, the old Marquis'
     offer was a present. When I see other women with relays of fur coats, and pearl necklaces, and
     no visible means of support, I am thoroughly sorry for myself,
     <pb n="176"/> for it isn't through any excess of morals that I haven't just as many furs and
     pearls; it is simply because I don't see life that way, as, ten years ago, I didn't see life as
     the wife of an old man, whom I adored but didn't love, and couldn't have thought of marrying
     him even if he had promised to arrange for his death an hour after the wedding.... Do you
     understand, Dikran? For all this while I've been trying to tell you that whatever else I am
     not, I am an honest woman; a very upright gentleman in my way, which is more than you can say
     for most really nice women.</p>
<p>"The reason why realistic tragedies are impossible, or at best only melodramatic, on the
     stage is that the Person who arranges life has no sense of drama at all. Imagine how Sardou,
     the wretched man who turned Sarah Bernhardt into an exhibition, would have worked it out: the
     young girl would have run away from the lustful old man to Nice; the old man would have
     followed her to her boarding-house and made faces at the landlady's fair-haired son, who was
     the girl's destiny; a duel, tears, another duel, more tears, and Sarah falling about the stage
     in exhausted
     <pb n="177"/> attitudes, as well she might.... And then imagine how life worked out the tragedy
     of that girl and old man; it let them be, or it seemed to let them be! No, God can have no
     dramatic sense, as we know it, because all the tragedies He arranges for us are slow-moving, so
     slow and moving none of the actors know whither; perhaps this tragedy we are acting will fade
     away, they say hopefully to themselves, and leave us again happy and careless; a little later
     they are happily sure that their tragedy is fading, there is no possible climax in sight, and
     then suddenly, out of the inmost earth, from some really foul spot of their animal natures,
     come the sudden ingredients for the tragical climax; the climax lasts only a second, but after
     it no blessed curtain falls; God has interfered again, Life is more cruel than Art, He says, so
     away with your tricks, your curtains and your finales. And I suppose He is right, you know; it
     must be right that shameful memories live beside the beautiful ones, as twenty years from now
     the memory of that old man and myself will live beside this very moment of you and I under this
     willow; for
     <pb n="178"/> my abundant confession of it all seems to make it as much yours as mine,
     Dikran.</p>
<p>"My guardian and I lived on smoothly enough, then; as before I broke out now and again when
     he stepped too sternly between myself and an amusing indiscretion, but rebellions always ended
     in my smiling at some cutting remark of his, and in his always sweet dismissal of the subject;
     there was nothing to show that we were different with each other. But we were, indeed we were.
     I did not know it then, but I knew it very clearly later; how we two people, really loving each
     other, though in our different ways, had found a deep, subtle antagonism in each other, a very
     real antagonism, which it would have shamed us to realise at the time, and with a very real and
     inevitable climax; but like God's creatures, mummers in yet another of His cruelly monstrous
     plays, we thought the tragedy was fading, had faded, and were forgetting it, for what climax
     could there possibly be?</p>
<p>"Four or five months after that May morning he took me to stay at a château in Brittany; a
     very beautiful, tumble-down,
     <pb n="179"/> draughty place, my dear, standing proudly at the head of a valley like a
     dissipated actor who feels that he must have done great things in the past to be what he now
     is, and with nothing to show for its draughty arrogance but a few rakish stones which were once
     the embattlement from which the Huguenot <foreign>seigneur</foreign> of the day defied the old
     Medici; and the slim, white-haired old woman who charmingly met me at the door, the châtelaine
     of only one castle, but with the dignity of an empire in her kind, calm elegance. My hostess
     and my guardian were old, old friends, and to watch them in their gentle, courteous intimacy
     was a lesson on the perfect management of such things. When we are old and white-haired, will
     you come and stay at my place, Dikran, and will you pretend that you have forgotten that you
     ever liked me for anything else than my mind? Just like those two old people in the Breton
     château, who a thousand years ago may have been lovers or may have only loved one another....
     Who knows? and does it matter?</p>
<p>"The idea of this visit, on my guardian's part, to the solitary château from whose highest
     <pb n="180"/> windows one could just see the sea curling round the Breton coast, was of course
     excellent. He wanted me to be out of harm's way and entirely his own, and was there any better
     way of achieving that than by putting me in a lonely château with only my hostess as an
     alternative to himself? But, poor old dear, it didn't fall out like that; for we had only been
     there two days when the alternative presented himself in the person of the young man of the
     house, my hostess's son, the young lord of Tumbledown Castle.... He went and spoilt it all,
     good and proper, did that young man. His mother hadn't expected him, my guardian didn't want
     him, and I didn't mind him—there he was, all the way from England on a sudden desire to see his
     mother, the only woman whom Raoul had ever a decent thought about, I suppose. (His name wasn't
     really Raoul, you know, but it is a sort of convention that all young Frenchmen with the title
     of Vicomte and with languid eyes and fragile natures are called Raoul.) For he wasn't by any
     means a nice young man, except facially, but how was I to know that! And besides, the man
     <pb n="181"/> could sit a horse as gallantly as any young prince who ever went crusading, and I
     strained my eyes in prolonging the little thrill I had when, the morning after he came, I saw
     him from a window riding out of the gates and down into the valley, very much the young lord of
     the manor, on the huge white stallion which, with such a master, defied a Republic and still
     proclaimed him as the <foreign>Sieur du Château-Mauvrai</foreign> to the dour and morose-minded
     peasants of the Breton villages....</p>
<p>"When I say that Raoul was not a nice young man, I mean that he was a very agreeable
     companion; but, like little Billee, in 'Trilby,' and Maurice, the stone-image of my dreams,
     that poor young man couldn't love, it wasn't in him to love; but unlike the other two, who were
     sweet about it and made up for it as much as they could, Raoul had taken it into his head that
     love was all stuff and nonsense, anyway, and that he could do a deal better with the very
     frequent and not very fastidious pretences of it; and, according to his little-minded lights,
     he seems to have been right, for he had already done
     <pb n="182"/> fairly well for himself in London—this I found much later, of course—with a flat
     in Mayfair which was much more consistent with the various middle-aged ladies who came to tea
     with him than with the extent of his income.</p>
<p>"No reasonable person could expect that a young man like that and I could stay in the same
     house and no trouble come of it. But my guardian wasn't reasonable. He seemed still to expect
     me to go riding with him, and let a perfectly good young man run to waste for want of a
     companion to say pretty things to. Raoul and I, in that beautiful spot, were scarcely ever
     allowed to be alone, and only twice did we manage to ride away together to the sea for a
     delicious, exciting few hours; only twice, I said, for the second time was very definitely the
     last.... Somehow the Marquis was always there. Not in any unpleasant way, but he would just
     happen to come into the room or the particular corner of the large garden where we also
     happened to be; he didn't rebuke or look sulky, he was just the same, except, perhaps, for a
     little irony to Raoul, whom
     <pb n="183"/> he refused to take seriously as a young man of the world. And there is where the
     old man made his mistake with me, for I, too, didn't take Raoul seriously; I took him for just
     what he was, more knave than fool, a charming companion, and a very personable young man, as
     far as being just 'personable' counts, and only so far. If I had been allowed to deal with the
     matter in my own way, without let or hindrance, it would only have been very pleasant trifling,
     and certainly no more; even as it was, the 'no more' part of it was still safe in my keeping,
     thanks entirely to my having brought myself up properly; but for the rest a simple amusement
     became a rather sordid tragedy, for God and guardian had combined to use a commonplace young
     man as the climax to a faded and forgotten little fantasy, once sun-kissed by a May morning,
     now to be shivered and scattered by the shrieking sea wind, discordant chorus enough for the
     unmingled destinies of any Tristans and Isoldas, which kept forcing our horses apart on that
     last morning of all, when we three rode by the sea, and made a world of anger for ourselves
     <pb n="184"/> because some one, something, had suddenly pushed us out of the other world where
     we had been so careless and happy....</p>
<p>"Once things happened, they happened quickly. For all my not taking him at all seriously, I
     suppose I liked him quite a lot, really—I must have done, else I would not have been such a
     fool. He was my first experience of dishonesty in man, and I suppose I wanted to plumb this
     dishonesty of his to the depths, which was very stupid of me because he was much more likely to
     find out about me than I about him.... Raoul had been at the château two weeks, and our little
     affair had taken the important and unpleasant air of a conspiracy. Our own stay was to last
     another month, and if it hadn't been that my guardian would not for the world have offended his
     old friend by cutting short this long-looked-for visit, he would very soon have taken me away
     from the so desecrating gaze of young Raoul.</p>
<p>"On that day, towards evening, he and I had managed to steal out walking for an hour.
     Agreeable enough as he was, he would have bored me if I had let him. But I
     <pb n="185"/> wanted him, I intended to keep him in my mind; I wanted him as an assertion of my
     independence from the old man. As we went back up the drive to the château I carefully became
     as animated and smiling as I could, for I knew that he would be watching us from the
     drawing-room windows, and I wanted to irritate him as much as his incessant care was irritating
     me, though that would have been impossible, for that evening I was absurdly, fiercely angry
     with him. Life seemed made up of the interferences of old men. I didn't want old men in my
     life. I wanted young men, and sunshine, and fun. And so, as Raoul and I went up the steps to
     the massive door, and as I turned to him just below the drawing-room window and gave him my
     most trustful smile, I was feeling reckless, unrestrained, fiercely independent.... Oh, Dikran!
     what idiocies we do for the fancied sake of independence!</p>
<p>"It was time to dress for dinner, so I left Raoul and went straight to my room. A minute
     later came a knock on the door, and as I turned sharply from the mirror, it
     <pb n="186"/> opened and Raoul stood there, rather shy, smiling. I wasn't old enough to know
     the proper way of dealing with young men in one's bedroom, even if I had overpoweringly wanted
     to.</p>
<p>"'I had an impulse,' he said, but he still stood in the doorway, a little question somewhere
     about him. I didn't answer it; just watched him, rather interested in his methods.</p>
<p>"'Because,' he went on, 'I used to sleep in this room once, and remember it as a dreary
     little place, and I wanted to see what it looked like with you in it.' Poor silly fool, I
     thought, but rather loved him. I have found since then, though, that his fatuous speech was
     quite the proper one to make, for the established way of entering a woman's room is by
     expressing an interest in the furniture, thus making the lady self-conscious and not so sure
     about her dignity; seductions are successful through women fearing to look fools if they refuse
     to be seduced.</p>
<p>"But this time, as he spoke, he closed the door behind him and came into the room towards
     <pb n="187"/> me. 'This isn't playing fair, Raoul,' I only said; 'you will get me into a
     row.'</p>
<p>"'Fair!' he said, lifting his eyebrows, the gallant ass. 'My sweet, do you think anything
     real is fair in this world? And don't you trust me? That isn't fair of you, you know—haven't I
     made love to you for two weeks, haven't I loved you for two weeks, haven't I loved you all my
     life—and now?' And with that he had me in his arms, not for the first time, mind you, but this
     time very differently; and, over his shoulder, as he held me, I saw the door open, and the
     Marquis stood there, outraged. Raoul didn't seem to know, still held me, and I, for a paralysed
     moment, couldn't move, just stared at the old man standing very stiffly in the doorway, a hand
     outstretched on the door-knob—hell seemed to have opened for him through that door, and he
     could move as little as I. At last I jumped away from Raoul with a sort of cry, and he turned
     quickly round to the door. He didn't go pale, or look a fool; he must have made a study of such
     contretemps; nothing was said,
     <pb n="188"/> the old man waiting in the doorway, with words terribly smothered; he moved aside
     a little from the door as though to let a dog slink through. But Raoul wasn't going to slink;
     he was rather pink, negligent, resigned; and as, without the least hurry, he bent over my
     fingers and his eyes smiled gently at me, I found myself admiring him, really loving him for
     the first time. Women are like that.... All this, of course, had happened in less than a
     minute; from point of time my guardian came into my room and Raoul left it—but in point of fact
     a great deal happened. For, as Raoul left me and walked across the room to the door, and
     through it without taking the least notice of the old man, and as I heard his even steps
     receding down the <foreign>parquet</foreign> corridor, my first paralysed fear simmered in me
     and boiled up into a fierce, vixen anger. I simply trembled now with anger at the old man as I
     had first trembled with fear of him. What right had he to be standing there, ordering about my
     life and my young men? What right had he to be closing the door, as he was doing now? What
     right, what right? The
     <pb n="189"/> words were throbbing inside me, just those words, fixed unrestrainedly on the old
     man, who had made a step towards me, and stopped again....</p>
<p>"'Child!' the pain in that one word, the lack of anger in it, an utter, absolute pain
     accusing me, did not soothe. Accuse me? By what right?</p>
<p>"The scene was dreadful, Dikran. I can't tell you what we said, what I said, for I did most
     of the scene-making. He just forbade me to talk again alone with Raoul or to go out with him;
     said he would take me away to-morrow if it weren't that explanations would then be necessary to
     our hostess, who was in feeble health and might be killed by such a disgrace as this in her own
     house. As for Monsieur le Vicomte, he himself would arrange that I did not see him for longer
     time than could be helped. That's all he said, but my white heat took little notice of his
     commands. I said I don't know what—it must all have been terrible, for it ended on a terrible
     note. Dikran, how could I have done it? I pointed at the door and asked him how he could think
     he had more
     <pb n="190"/> right in my room than Raoul, for though he was my guardian our relations had been
     changed by a certain proposal, which perhaps he remembered.... A look at me, in which was the
     first and last contempt that's ever been given me, and the door closed on the wonderful old
     man.</p>
<p>"Dinner that night passed off quite well considering the unsettled climatic conditions
     aforesaid. Myself didn't contribute much, but my guardian and Raoul talked smoothly away about
     anything that came, while Madame, our hostess, smiled sweetly at us all, on brooding me in
     particular.... Quite early I made for bed; the old man and I hadn't exchanged a word all
     evening, and his 'good night' was a little bow, and mine cold. As I passed Raoul he cleverly
     put a small piece of paper into my hand. Upstairs in my room, that piece of paper said that he
     would be going away in a day or two, and would I ride with him to-morrow morning before
     breakfast, at seven o'clock. Of course I would.</p>
<p>"It was all a silly business, Dikran. If I had ever been in love with Raoul, I certainly
     <pb n="191"/> wasn't that morning when we rode away from the gloomy, silent château, a little
     frightened by our own bravado; for that is all it was. But later, as we reached the sands, I
     forgot that, I forgot Raoul, though of course he always talked; I was enjoying the horse under
     me, the summer morning, the high sea wind dashing its salt air against my cheeks; I was
     enjoying every one of those things more than the company of the young man, but, tragically, my
     guardian could not know that.</p>
<p>"We had been out about half an hour when Raoul, looking back over his shoulder, murmured,
     'Ah!' 'What is it?' I asked. I could barely force my little voice through the wind. 'That old
     man,' Raoul said indifferently. 'It seems that he too is out to take the salt air.' Yes, there
     was a figure on horseback, perhaps half a mile behind us but rapidly gaining on our slow
     canter. I had forgotten my anger, but now again it thrust itself viciously on me.</p>
<p>"'Come on, let's give him a run,' I said, a little excitedly.</p>
<p>"'Oh, no! I am not a baby to be chased
     <pb n="192"/> about by my own guests or other people's grandfathers!'</p>
<p>"Affected idiot, I thought, and we rode on in silence. So really silly it all was, my dear;
     for if it hadn't been for my anger, the natural reaction, in a way, of the muffled life I had
     led with him, I had much sooner been riding with the old man than with the young one. But that
     feeling didn't last long—no one gave it a chance to last. For at last, after what seemed an
     age, his horse drew beside mine, and I heard his voice distantly through the wind, saying,
     'Sandra! You must come back.' I didn't answer, but worse, I looked sideways at him and laughed.
     It was the first time that I had ever seen him in the least bit ridiculous, and my laugh took
     advantage of it. Raoul was a yard or so ahead of us and was giving his horse rein, and so I put
     mine to the gallop—and heigh-ho! there were the three of us racing away on the Breton
     sands—until, with wonderful and dangerous horsemanship, my guardian's horse leapt a yard or so
     ahead and swung broadside round in front of our startled horses. Near as anything there were
     <pb n="193"/> broken collar-bones. Our horses reared high up, almost fell backwards, nearly
     braining the old man with their frantic hoofs, and then at last took the ground, startled and
     panting. My guardian didn't wait. He pointed his whip at Raoul and said sternly, 'If I were not
     a guest at your mother's house I would thrash you, for that is what you need'; and then to me,
     harshly, 'Come, Sandra. Enough of this nonsense. Home.'</p>
<p>"'Not I,' I cried against the wind. 'I'm enjoying my ride.' And round his horse I went,
     towards the sea, leaving them to their argument. I almost wanted him to follow me, I was so
     bitterly angry. I don't know what I thought I would do—but I suppose I didn't think.</p>
<p>"I must have galloped two hundred yards or so when he was beside me again. I took no notice;
     we rode on, almost knee to knee. And then I saw his hand stretch out, clutch my rein, and pull;
     I saw red, I saw nothing, or just his old, lined face bending over ... and, my dear, I swung my
     riding-whip as hard as I could across it. The hand left my rein, but my horse had already been
     pulled
     <pb n="194"/> up. I don't remember what happened. I stared at him as unbelievingly as he stared
     at me. I seemed to see a weal across his face, where my whip had struck him—had I done that?
     And then he smiled. Dikran, that dear old man smiled after that horrible insult, so sweetly and
     sadly.</p>
<p>"'That then is the end, my child,' he said very gently; and then he left me, and for a long
     time I watched him as he rode slowly away. Frightfully ashamed.</p>
<p>"It was done, irretrievably; such things can't be forgiven, except in words; and as far as
     words went he, of course, forgave me. A few hours later I saw him in the hall; he was going to
     pass me, but suddenly I flung my arms about him, begging him ... very pitiful, dreadful thing I
     was. He was splendid. He said very softly into my ear that of course he forgave me, but that he
     was too old to have a proper control over his memory, and so couldn't forget, and that he was
     too old to be hurt any more, and so this would be the very last time, for he didn't think it
     would be wise for me to live with
     <pb n="195"/> him any more. 'Sandra, my child, you must not think me too unkind for sending you
     away, but I think it is the best plan. You have lived with an old man long enough—it was a
     mistake. I see now that it was a mistake. You must forgive me, child. I was wrong to keep you
     so long. I thought, perhaps, it might have been different....' He was inexorable about that,
     and it wasn't my place to, I couldn't, beg him to keep me. I, who had hurt him so much!</p>
<p>"He must have made some excuse to our hostess, for the next day saw us in Paris. Raoul? Oh, I
     never noticed him any more. And two days later I was with a stodgy uncle in Portman Square,
     hating London but hating myself more. I have been miserable many times, but never so
     shamefacedly as then, during the two weeks which passed between my arrival in London and the
     coming of that note from the old man's valet, saying that Monsieur le Marquis was very ill, and
     the doctor said he would die; and so he had taken the liberty of writing to me, without
     permission, in case I should like to go and
     <pb n="196"/> see him; would I be so kind as not to tell Monsieur le Marquis that he had
     written to me?</p>
<p>"Like a young woman to a dying lover, I went to Paris, and with a terrible flutter in my
     heart stood on the doorstep of the stern-looking house in the <foreign>Rue
     Colbert</foreign>.... They hadn't told him I was coming, but he must have expected me, for
     there was no surprise in the smile with which he met the timid little figure which came into
     his room. He seemed to me not ill, but just dying; he looked the same, only very tired. And
     then I realised that he was dying because he wanted to die. An angry girl had shown him that
     life was indeed not worth living, and so he was stopping his heart with his own hand.... It was
     terrible to realise that as I stood by his bed and he smiled quite gaily up at me. The weakness
     was too strong inside him, and he couldn't speak, just patted my hand and held it very
     tightly.... I was very glad when I was out of that room, and I did not see him again before he
     died early the next morning.</p>
<p>"And so you see, Dikran, for all your talk
     <pb n="197"/> of <foreign>dies iræ</foreign> in the future, I've already had my <foreign>dies
      iræ</foreign>, and very sadly, too—and been the wiser for it in restraint."</p>
<p>Then it was that I realised with a start that my housemaid was staring at me from the door in
     the grey March morning, and that I was not listening to Shelmerdene in a backwater of the
     Thames, but was in London, where there is less time for cherishing one's ideals than for
     enquiring into other people's....</p>
