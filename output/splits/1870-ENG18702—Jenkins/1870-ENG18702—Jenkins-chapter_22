The infant borne to the workhouse of St. Bartimeus was Ginx's Baby. When he had been
            placed on the floor of the matron's room, and examined by the master, that official
            turned to the unwelcome bearer of the burden.
“Did you find this child?”
“Yes.”
“Where?”
“Lying opposite my shop in Nether Place.”
“What's your name?”
“Doll.”
“Oh! you're the cheesemonger. Your shop's on the other side of the boundary, in the
            other parish. The child ought not to come here; it doesn't belong to us.”
“Yes it does: it wasn't on my side of the line.”
“But it was in front of your house?”
“Well, the line runs crossways: it don't follow the child was in our parish.”
“Oh, nonsense! there's no doubt about it! We can't take the child in. You must carry it
            away again.”
Mr. Snigger turned to leave the room.
“Wait a bit, sir,” said Mr. Doll; “I shall leave the child here, and you can do as you
            like with it. It ain't mine, at all events. I say it lay in your parish; and if you
            don't look after it you may be the worse of it. The coroner's sure to try to earn his
            fees. Good-night.”
He hurried from the room.
“Stop!” shouted the master, “I say: I don't accept the child. You leave it here at your
            own risk. We keep it without prejudice, remember—without prejudice, sir!—without——”
Mr. Doll was in the street and out of hearing.
