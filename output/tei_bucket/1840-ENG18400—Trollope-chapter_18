 CHAPTER XVII. 
A JOURNEY, BEGUN IN VERY GOOD STYLE, BUT ENDING NOT QUITE SO WELL — A FAITHFUL
				DESCRIPTION OF A VALLEY IN DERBYSHIRE — MICHAEL MAKES SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCE.

				And where was little Michael? The indentures, when duly signed and
				executed, did not remain two hours in Sir Matthew Dowling's possession before he
				began to put in action the power they gave him. Mr. Joseph Parsons perfectly
				understood the nature of the " few necessaries " which he was commanded to
				procure for the young stocking-weaver; and accordingly, by the time Sir Matthew had
				taken leave of Martha in the hall, after their walk back from Hoxley-lane, his
				confidential agent was ready to attend him in his study.
"Now, Mr. Parsons, I flatter myself that you will allow I have managed this business
				tolerably well. My excellent friend, Elgood Sharpton, will owe me a good turn — for,
				thanks to the meddling of old Sir Robert, 'prentice-boys are not so easily got as
				they used to be — and you and I, Mr. Parsons, have got rid of a most infernal spy.
				Now then, to business. How soon can you set off with him?"
"As soon as a horse can be harnessed to the jockey-cart, Sir Matthew."
"The jockey-cart! — the devil! What a fool you are, Parsons! Have you really no more
				wit in you than to propose setting off, willynilly, with this young cur, that yelped
				at the rate he did the other night, before all the fine folks in the county, in an
				open jockey-cart? Fie, Mr. Parsons, fie! — I really had a better opinion of your
				understanding."
"I thought he was going to set off, at any rate, by his own free will, Sir Matthew,"
				replied the superintendent, "and I knew when we got among the moors, it wouldn't
				much matter to me, if he did sing out."
"You are an excellent fellow, Parsons — true to the backbone, and as firm as a rock —
				but don't you ever undertake to carry through such a pretty little kidnapping scheme
				as this, where every thing is to be done according to law, unless you have got the
				help of a little such stuff as this," and the knight touched his own forehead
				expressively as he spoke.
"There's few men as wouldn't be the better for a little of that, Sir Matthew,"
				returned the judicious Parsons with a submissive nod; "but I'm ready and willing to
				do your bidding, be it what it may, and that's the best way of putting your honour's
				wit to profit."
 "You are right there, my good fellow — one captain is always better than two. But,
				however, as to master Michael, Parsons, we must neither let him stay loitering here
				till his dainty mother has questioned all the gossips who will come to prate with
				her about her boy, and  about all the nonsense current concerning
				Squire Elgood Sharpton's, of Thistledown House; nor yet must we carry him off at
				noonday in an open jockey-cart, without permitting him to kiss mother and brother,
				and uncle and aunt, and the devil knows who beside, from one end of Ashleigh to the
				other, — all ready perhaps to tell him some amusing anecdotes concerning his future
				master." 
"But what be the indentures good for, Sir Matthew," shrewdly inquired Mr. Parsons,
				"if they don't give you power over the chap, let him hear what he will?"
"Fair and softly, Mr. Parsons — there is a when and a where in all things. It has
				cost me some pounds, and a d — d deal of trouble to get up a cry hereabouts
				concerning my goodness and charity to these Armstrongs. Once get the boy off, and
				you and I between us, can make folks talk as loud of the great preferment he is come
				to, as mother Armstrong can about her doubts and alarms. There is no fear of that —
				I have more than one friend who will swear a thing or two for me. But once get up a
				screaming bout at the widow's, and a struggling scene in taking off the young
				gentleman, and we never shall hear the last of it. So, if you please, Mr. Parsons,
				we will just get the young gentleman to take a ride before he is an hour older. But
				not in a jockey-cart though. I believe you know the road and the baiting-place? — By
				Jove! Parsons, now I think of it, there would be no better joke than taking him in
				my own carriage for the first few miles, and letting you drive on, as far as
				Wood-End or there about, and wait till our coming. You know I have taken him out in
				the carriage lots of times, so he will think nothing of that — and I will have
				Crockley go with me to make the party agreeable. So off with you to Wood-End as fast
				as you can go. But it must be in the covered cart remember — and a trifle of cord
				must be in the way in case he gives trouble."
Within an hour from this time, Sir Matthew Dowling's carriage was proceeding at a
				dignified and leisurely pace along a cross-country road which led to a lane, which
				led to a moor, across which was a track which led by another lane to Mr. Elgood
				Sharpton's factory in the desolate hollow, known by the name of "Deep Valley."
The party, as arranged by Sir Matthew, consisted of himself, his friend Dr. Crockley,
				and Michael Armstrong. The little fellow had been repeatedly honoured by a seat in
				the same stately vehicle before, for the purpose of being shown off at various
				houses in the neighbourhood, and had a notion that he was now taken out, in order to
				hear the remainder of his great fortune announced. That this final proof of Sir
				Matthew's benevolence should have for its object the sending him far away from
				Dowling Lodge would have been, but for the dreaded parting with his mother and
				brother, a source of unmixed joy to the little apprentice; and, even with this
				drawback, the distant hopes of his young heart might have been read in the contented
				meditation of his eye, as he rode silently along in front of his jocose companions,
				who amused themselves the while in talking very mystically concerning him, and his
				very useful and judicious destination.

At length the carriage reached the point at which Sir Matthew intended his airing
				should terminate, and he looked out to reconnoitre the opening of a lane to the left
				where he expected to see the covered cart. Nor was he disappointed; a covered cart,
				with an excellent stout horse in it, was drawn up close to the bank to take
				advantage of the shade of a thick elm-tree that grew upon it. As the carriage
				approached, the occupant of the humbler vehicle peeped out, and Sir Matthew
				recognised the punctual Parsons.
"Pull the check-string, Crockley," said the knight, "We will get out here. That is,
				you may if you will, there is no occasion, I suppose, for me to trouble myself, is
				there?"
"Oh! dear no," replied Dr. Crockley, cheerfully. "Here comes Parsons, good man and
				true. Get out master Michael. Jump, jump, and enjoy it, my fine fellow! Perhaps you
				won't have much time for jumping when you begin learning your trade."
Without thinking it needful to reply to what he did not very clearly understand,
				Michael did as he was bid, and sprang from the carriage to the ground. The
				well-known figure of Parsons greeted him as his feet touched the turf, and the next
				instant he felt his hand suddenly seized by him.
"Shall you want me, Mr. Parsons?" said Dr. Crockley, putting his head out of the
				carriage.
"Not at all, sir," replied the superintendent, leading Michael forward. "Then shut
				the carriage-door, John," said Sir Matthew, "and order the coachman to drive
				home."
"Please sir! Please sir! — " uttered the plaintive voice of Michael, as he turned his
				head, and attempted to disengage his hand. "Please sir, is Mr. Parsons to take me
				away?"
"Yes, my boy, he is," replied the knight, loud enough for the footman to hear. "He is
				going to take you to your new master, and you may give my compliments to him, my
				dear, and tell him, that I have sent him a very good boy. Good bye! — Good bye! —
				Home!"
So ended the colloquy; the carriage turned round and drove off by the way it came,
				and Michael Armstrong was left alone with Mr. Joseph Parsons. He need not, however,
				have held the little fellow's hand so tight, for there was no rebellion in his
				heart, nor any thought of escape in his head. He knew his companion too well to hope
				for any explanation from him respecting this sudden manner of sending him off, and
				child as he was, he had no inclination to weep before him; but, on the contrary, his
				young heart swelled with a proud determination to behave well, and to set about his
				new employment with a stout spirit. Nevertheless, when he arrived at the cart he
				paused for a moment, before he obeyed the orders of Parsons to "climb up," and
				ventured to say, "Please sir, beant I to see mother any more?"
"Climb up! I tell you," said the brute, clenching his fist at him, "and if you bother
				me with any more questions, I'll just give you this in your mouth to stop your
				jabbering."
 Had Michael counted twenty years instead of ten, he could not  more
				resolutely have screwed his spirit to endurance than he did as he now clambered up,
				and placed himself, as he was directed, in the back part of the vehicle, not another
				syllable passed his lips. For four hours the slow but sore-footed cart-horse, jogged
				on through a lane, that would have made any pace beyond a walk, intolerable. At the
				end of that time, the cart stopped before the door of a lonely public-house that
				formed a corner, round which the road turned off at nearly a right angle, and
				stretched across one of those wild and desolate moors which are, perhaps, only to be
				found in such perfection of dark and stoney ruggedness in Derbyshire. Michael, as he
				descended from the cart, looked out upon the unlimited expanse of dreariness, and
				shuddered; but his mind had not been sufficiently filled with the remembrance of
				brighter objects, to give the scene as full effect upon him, as it might have
				produced on others. 
The "Mucklestone Moor," haunted by the black dwarf, was a pleasant spot compared to
				it; for there the barren heath was only strewed with fragments of stones around one
				certain spot whence rose, doubtless with some pretence to picturesque dignity, "a
				huge column of unhewn granite." But on the Ridgetop Moor of Derbyshire, no object
				reared itself above the rest, either to attract or relieve the eye. As far as sight
				could reach, the wild heath was encumbered with a crowded layer of large and
				shapeless gray stones, defying the air of heaven to nourish vegetation among them,
				and making any effort of man to remove the congregated mass, desperate and
				unavailing. Arid, rugged, desolate, was the desert that spread around; and to those
				who knew the nature of the operations carrying on in every direction near it, no
				great stretch of imagination would have been necessary to suggest the idea of
				fitness, and sympathy between the district, and the most influential portion of its
				population. This is, indeed, a fitness that seems often found. Where towering
				mountains scale the heavens the hardy natives show a spirit pure and clear as the
				sweet air by which they live. In the rich valleys of the East the lazy peasant eats
				his rice, purchased with easy labour, and is content to dream away his being in the
				sultry shade. And in the flinty region of our northern moors, the race of Millocrats
				batten, and grow fat, as if they were conscious of, and rejoiced in the local
				sympathy.
A stunted elderly lad of all work, came forth on hearing the rumbling of the wheels.
				"Ask the dame if she has got two beds in one room!" said Mr. Parsons, descending
				from the driving-seat, of which he had had quite as much as he desired. The message
				brought out a hideous crone, whose sharp visage looked as if it had drawn itself up
				into points and angles while battling with the rough blasts that roared, whistled,
				and moaned about her dwelling.
"And who be you?" was her first salutation. To which Mr. Parsons only nodded
				graciously in reply.
"Dear me! Be it you, sir?" exclaimed the woman. "I ax your pardon, for not knowing
				your honour at a glance. Beds? Ay, ay, plenty of beds, sir. — Please to walk in. Who
				is this fine young'un? He can't have nothing to do with the mills, any way."

"This a fine holiday suit, dame, that Sir Matthew has been pleased to bestow upon
				him," replied Mr. Parsons, "and if he had behaved himself a little better, he might
				have lived like a prince to the end of his days; but he is an untoward chap, and
				chose to cry, when he should have laughed. And so, you see, the fine folks at the
				lodge got tired of him.'
"What then! — This be the boy, be it, as we have had so many talking about? He was to
				be made a gentleman of by Sir Matthew Dowling? And so he is turned off, is he?"
This was said as the old woman led the way to the receiving-room, that is to say, the
				kitchen of the mansion, and here, though the season was still warm elsewhere, a
				large fire was burning. That its warmth was welcome might be gathered from the fact,
				that the only persons in possession of the room were sitting or standing close
				beside it. The guests, before the arrival of the new comers, amounted only to three,
				namely, a young woman pacing her way to a distant service, a stout lad, her brother,
				who travelled with her, to carry her box and guard her from harm; and a venerable
				looking man with gray hair, but having withal bright eyes, and a florid skin, and
				bearing in his dress and demeanour, the appearance of a thriving agriculturist.
It was with so bustling a movement, that the landlady pushed back the little round
				table on which stood the farmer's mug of beer, and there was so much of respect in
				the manner with which she wiped the chair brought forward for Mr. Parsons, that the
				fact of his being a person of consequence, became notorious to all. The farmer
				quietly pushed back his chair, to follow the table, the young woman modestly
				squeezed herself very closely into the chimney-corner, and her brother fairly
				bolted, standing with eyes and mouth widely opened, to gaze at ease upon the
				distinguished society into which it had been his chance to fall. Mr. Parsons took
				his place among them, as such a great man ought to do. That is to say, he looked
				neither to the right nor to the left, but made himself comfortable without taking
				the trouble of considering whether any other person were present, or not. Michael
				crept in after him, and when the more important part of the company had arranged
				themselves, he was observed standing alone in the most distant part of the room.
"What dost stand shivering there for, my boy?" said the old farmer, in north-country
				dialect, so broad as to be dangerous for south-country folks to spell, "I could be
				after thinking there was some mistake here. Surely you ought not to be standing,
				while some other folks are sitting."
This observation, though the genuine result of the old man's notions of vulgar, and
				the reverse, might not have been so bluntly spoken, had he not felt himself
				affronted by the unceremonious style in which his place before the fire had been
				taken from him. Michael probably did not understand the full meaning of the remark,
				nevertheless he looked dreadfully terrified, and fixed his eyes upon the back part
				of Mr. Parson's august head, his face being fortunately turned from him, with an
				expression of desperate fear, that seemed to puzzle the good farmer.

"Well now, don't he look like as well-behaved and pretty a young gentleman as one
				would wish to see?" continued the farmer, turning to the young girl, "and yet
				there's no mistaking that t'other's his master."
"Fine feathers makes fine birds, for them as can see no farther," cried Parsons
				contemptuously, and turning one of his threatening scowls upon the old man. "But
				wait a bit, Goodman Goose, and you'll find out perhaps, as all is not gold as
				glitters."
"Poor little fellow!" exclaimed the farmer, on meeting the superintendent's
				ill-omened eye. "I wish, with all my heart, master, that nobody cared no more for
				your ugly looks than I do."
"Dame Pritchard," said Parsons, without appearing to hear him, "Let the boy and me
				have a bit of supper, d'ye hear. Spite of his fine clothes, however, which were but
				a gift of charity, the boy is neither better nor worse, than one of our factory
				children."
"I would not have thought it!" said the old man, apparently satisfied, and turning to
				his mug.
"No, I dare say," retorted Parsons, with a sneer. "Such chaps as you, seldom finds
				out what's what, or who's who, before they are told."
From this moment no further interest was expressed about little Michael. He was a
					factory boy , and what good was there in asking any further questions? So a
				thick slice of bread, and a scrap of bacon were set before him, and as soon as the
				more elaborate supper of Mr. Parsons was concluded, he with great affability took
				the little fellow by the hand, and preceded by Dame Pritchard and a candle,
				conducted him to a pallet bed in the same chamber as his own.
For the first moment after he was left alone with the boy, the superintendent felt a
				strong inclination to make him pay for the affronts he had been the cause of his
				receiving below. But the same wisdom which had cut short his indignation there,
				checked him now; and having locked the chamber door, and given Michael a stimulating
				kick to hasten his undressing, he carefully packed in a bundle the Dowling Lodge
				suit which he took off, leaving in its place beside the bed, the result of his hasty
				shoppings at Ashleigh.
When roused from his slumbers at day-break the following morning, Michael found these
				new garments ready for him, and for a moment his heart sunk at the change, for
				though new, they were of the very lowest kind, and formed as strong a contrast as
				was well possible with the dress he had laid aside on preparing for his night's
				rest. But the human mind will often show symptoms of philosophy even at ten years
				old; which truth was made evident by the manner in which the young apprentice
				invested himself in his new suit, cheering his spirit as he did so, with the
				recollection that a person going to be bound to a trade like that of
				stocking-weaving, would look very ridiculous in such a dress as had been just taken
				away from him.
Early as it was, Mrs. Pritchard was ready in the kitchen with "a pot of hot tea" for
				Mr. Parsons; Michael received a fitting hunch of bread, the covered cart was brought
				up to the door, and the ill-matched pair set off again upon their journey.

It might seem paradoxical to say, that the temper of Mr. Parsons was irritated by the
				patient, unsuspicious, and submissive demeanour of his helpless charge; yet such,
				nevertheless, was the fact. It was many years since the bones of Mr. Parsons had
				been exposed to any conveyance more rough and rude than Sir Matthew's jockey cart,
				which was constructed with excellent and efficient springs; the movement, therefore,
				of the covered vehicle which had brought his aching joints to the "Crooked Billet"
				on Ridgetop Moor, was equally unwonted and disagreeable; and now that the peaceable
				demeanour of his little companion had convinced him that it was altogether
				unnecessary, he felt ready to twist his neck round, as an atonement for all he had
				endured.
Ere they had advanced a mile further, however, his spirit found a species of
				consolation that was perfectly congenial to it. The drear dark desert that spread
				before them, dimly visible as far as the eye could reach through the chilling mist
				of the morning, was just such a region as his heart desired for the dwelling of the
				young plague who had caused him so jolting a journey; and here too the covering of
				the rough machine was far from unwelcome, so that Mr. Parsons, as he drove slowly
				and cautiously onward amidst the deep ruts, and rumbling stones, looked out upon the
				bleak desolation of the scene, with a feeling that almost approached to
				complacency.
At length the moor was passed, and for a few miles their joints enjoyed the luxury of
				a turnpike-road. The country too, seemed softening into a species of wild beauty,
				that might, in some degree, atone for its bleakness. But ere this had lasted for
				more than a couple of hours, the horse's head was again turned aside from the main
				road, and by a steep and very rough descent, they gradually approached the level of
				a stream, running through so very narrow a valley, as in many places to afford
				barely space enough for the road, between the brook and the precipitate heights
				which shut it in.
On reaching this level, the road, which for the last quarter of a mile had seemed to
				be leading them into the little river itself, turned abruptly, and by an angle so
				acute, following the indented curve of the lofty hill, that they speedily appeared
				to be shut in on all sides by the towering hills that suddenly, and as if by magic
				reared themselves in every direction round. It is hardly possible to conceive a spot
				more effectually hidden from the eyes of all men, than this singular valley.
				Hundreds may pass their lives within a few miles of it, without having the least
				idea that such a spot exists; for, from the form of the hills it so happens, that it
				is possible to wander for hours over their summits, without discovering it; one
				undulation rising beyond another, so as to blend together beneath the eye, leaving
				no opening by which this strip of water-level in their very centre, can be
				discerned. [3]


For about another half mile, the narrow cart-road runs beside the stream without
				encountering any single object, except its lofty barrier and the brook itself, more
				remarkable than here and there a reed of higher growth than common, or a plant of
				Foxglove, that by its gay blossom seems to mock the desolate sadness of the spot.
				Another turn, however, still following the wavy curvings of the mountain's base, for
				mountain there it seems to be, opens another view, and one that speaks to many
				senses at once, the difference between the melancholy caused by nature, and that
				produced by the work of man. A wide spreading cotton-factory here rears its
				unsightly form, and at one glance makes the happy wanderer whose foot is free to
				turn which way he will, feel how precious is the power of retracing his steps back
				again along the beguiling path that has led him to it.
This was a joy for which our little Michael sighed in vain. On jogged the cart, and
				nearer it came at every jolt to the object which he most hated to look upon. But
				then came also the cheering thought, that he was no longer a mere factory boy, but
				about to become an apprentice to a good and profitable trade, in which hereafter he
				might expect to get money enough for himself, for mother, and Teddy too!
				Nevertheless, he certainly did wish, at the very bottom of his heart, that the
				stocking-weaving business was not carried on in a building so very like a cotton
				factory! But though Michael saw this hated cotton factory, he as yet saw but a small
				portion of the horrors which belonged to the spot he had reached. His position in
				the vehicle made it impossible for him to look round, and perceive how completely
				all the acts that might be committed in that Deep Valley , were hid from
				the eye of every human being but those engaged in them. Neither could he recognise
				in the dismal building detached, yet connected both with the manager's house and the
				factory, the Prison Prentice-house which served as HOME to hundreds of
				little aching hearts, each one endowed by nature with light spirits, merry thoughts,
				and fond affections; but all of whom rose to their daily toil under circumstances
				which rendered enjoyment of any kind both morally and physically impossible.
The gradations by which all the misery that awaited him was disclosed, were, however,
				neither lingering nor uncertain. The cart stopped, Parsons got out, and then calling
				forward his companion, seized him roughly by the arm, and swung him through the door
				which opened to receive them.
"Soh! This is the chap you are going to bestow upon us, is it, Mr. Parsons?" said a
				fellow, whose aspect must have withered hope in the gayest spirit that youth and joy
				ever produced between them. "Has he nimble fingers?"
"He can move 'em quick enough when he've got a mind for it," replied Parsons. "But
				you must not spare the strap, I can tell you, for a more obstinate hard-skinned
				little devil, never crossed the threshold of a factory."
 "Never mind, Mr. Parsons, we know how to manage all those matters, you may depend
				upon it. We possess many advantages over you, sir. No parents here you know, to come
				bothering us about  bones and bruises. Here they all count at what they
				are worth, and no more. Children is plenty, Mr. Parsons; and that's about the best
				thing we have got in our favour; for it can't be denied but we all of us, at times,
				finds that we have managed to complete more work than 'tis easy to dispose of." 
"No doubt of that, Mr. Woodcomb. But you had better hand off the boy, if you please,
				and then we'll settle our little matter of business, and I'll be off. Your roads are
				none of the best, sir, and I must make my way back to the Crooked Billet
				to-night."
"Not till you have had a bit, and a drop with us, Mr. Parsons. They are at supper in
				the Prentice-house now, and our young master shall be handed in at once."
So saying, the scowling manager opened a door in the farther corner of the room, and
				made Michael a sign that he was to pass through it. The child obeyed, but he
				trembled in every joint. Feelings of deeper terror than had ever reached his heart
				before, were creeping over him. His lips moved not, but his very soul seemed to
				whisper within him, "Mother! Mother!"
Yet at that moment the unhappy boy knew not what was before him; the influence under
				which he cowered thus, was like that produced by the leaden dimness of a coming
				storm upon the birds, who droop their pinions and seem ready to fall to the earth,
				even before a single hailstone has touched them.
A long low passage led to another door, which was again opened by the condescending
				hand of Mr. Woodcomb; through this he thrust the poor Michael, and having either by
				a word or a sign made known to the governor of the Prentice-house, that he had
				brought an accession to his wretched crew, he retired, closing the door behind
				him.
Michael heard the door close, and looked up. The room he was in was so long as almost
				to appear like a gallery, and from one end to the other of it a narrow deal board
				stretched out, having room for about two hundred to sit down at once. The whole of
				this table was now occupied by a portion of the apprentice children, both boys and
				girls, belonging to Deep Valley Mill, and their appearance might have wrung the
				heart of any being who looked upon them, however blessedly wide his own destiny
				might lead him from the melancholy troop. But to Michael, the spectacle was
				appalling; and, young as he was, he seemed to feel that the filthy, half-starved
				wretches before him, were so many ghostly representations of what he was himself to
				be. A sickness like that of death came over him, and he would have given a limb,
				only for freedom to stretch himself down upon the floor and see no more. But the
				master of the ceremonies at this feast of misery bore a huge horsewhip in his hand,
				without which indeed, it is said, he seldom appeared on the premises, and with it an
				eye that seemed to have the power of quelling with a single glance, the will of
				every little wretch it looked upon.
 The place that Michael was to take at the board was indicated to him, and he sat
				down. The food placed before him consisted of a small bowl of what was denominated
				stir-pudding, a sort of miserable  water-porridge, and a lump of oaten
				cake, of a flavour so sour and musty, that the little fellow, though never
				accustomed till the fatal patronage of Sir Matthew fell upon him, to any viands more
				dainty than dry bread, could not at this first essay persuade himself to eat it. The
				wife of the governor of the Prentice-house, a help meet for him in every way,
				chanced to have her eye upon the stranger child as he pushed the morsel from him,
				and the smile that relaxed her features might have told him something, had he
				chanced to see, and understand it, respecting the excellent chance there was of his
				having a better appetite in future. 
A girl nearly of his own age sat on one side, and a boy considerably older on the
				other; the first who had as much of beauty as it was perhaps, possible for any human
				being to have after a six month's residence at Deep-Valley Mill, looked up into his
				face with a pair of large blue eyes that spoke unbounded pity, and he heard a soft
				little voice whisper, "Poor boy!" While his lanky neighbour on the other side made
				prize of the rejected food, venturing to say aloud, "Any how, it is too good to be
				wasted."
The wretched meal did not last long, and for a few minutes after it was ended, the
				governor and his wife disappeared. During this interval, those who had strength and
				inclination moved about the room as they listed, but by far the greater number were
				already dropping to sleep after a day of protracted labour, during which they had
				followed the ceaseless movements of the machinery, for above fifteen hours. Among
				the former was the hungry lad who had appropriated the oat-cake of Michael, and no
				sooner were the eye of the master and mistress removed, than he turned to the
				new-comer, and in a tone that seemed to hover between good-humour and ridicule,
				said, "So you could not find a stomach for your supper, my man?"
"I did not want supper," replied Michael, dolefully. "You did'nt want it, didn't you?
				That speaks better for the living as you have left, than I can speak of that as
				you'll find," returned his new acquaintance. "Don't you say nothing to nobody, and,
				to-morrow morning, after the lash have sounded through the room to wake us all, just
				you start up, and jump into your clothes, and when we goes to pump, I'll show you
				where we gets our tit-bits from."
Michael was in the act of nodding assent to this proposal, when the woman, who five
				minutes before had left the room, returned to it, and by a very summary process
				caused the ragged, weary, prayerless, hopeless multitude to crawl and clamber, half
				sleeping and half waking, to their filthy beds. They were divided by fifties in a
				room, but notwithstanding the number, and the little space in which they had to stow
				themselves, the stillness of heavy sleep pervaded every chamber, ere the miserable
				little inmates had been five minutes enclosed within the walls. Poor Michael lay as
				motionless as the rest, but he was not sleeping. Disappointment, fearful
				forebodings, and excessive nausea, all conspired to banish this only blessing that
				an apprenticed factory child can know.
 He had already laboured, poor fellow, for nearly half his little life, 
				and that under most hard and unrelenting masters; but till now, he had never known
				how very wretched his young thoughts could make him. His mother's fond caresses, and
				his brother's fervent love, had in spite of toil, and sometimes in spite of hunger,
				cheered and comforted the last moments of every day. The rude bed also, on which the
				brothers lay, was too clean, notwithstanding all the difficulty of keeping it so, to
				be tainted with the loathsome scent of oil, or sundry other abominations which
				rendered the place where he now lay, almost intolerable. Yet to this den, far, far
				away from the only creatures who loved and cherished him, he was come by his own
				consent, his own express desire! The thought was almost too bitter to bear, and the
				bundle of straw that served him for a pillow, received for the first hour of the
				night a ceaseless flood of tears. 
It was, as his young companion had predicted, by the sound of a flourished whip, that
				he was awakened on the following morning. In an instant he was on his feet, and a
				minute or two more sufficed to invest him in his clothes; this speed, however, was
				the effect of terror, for he remembered not the invitation of the preceding evening.
				But hardly had he finished the operation of dressing, when Charley Ford, the boy who
				gave it, was by his side, and giving him a silent hint by a wink of the left eye,
				and a movement of the right elbow that he might follow him, turned away, and ran
				down stairs.
Michael did so too, and presently found himself with a multitude of others in a small
				paved court, on one side of which was a pump, to whose spout every child came in
				succession to perform a very necessary, but, from lack of soap, a very imperfect act
				of ablution.
Neglecting to watch his turn for this, and not permitting Michael to do so either,
				Charles Ford made his way to a door that opened upon another part of the premises,
				and pushing it open, disclosed to the eyes of Michael a loathsome and a fearful
				spectacle.
Seven or eight boys had already made their way to the sort of rude farm-yard upon
				which this door opened, one and all of whom were intent upon purloining from a
				filthy trough just replenished for the morning meal of two stout hogs, a variety of
				morsels which, as Michael's new acquaintance assured him, were "dainty eating for
				the starving prentices of Deep Valley mill."
"Make haste, young'un," cried Charles, good-naturedly, "or they won't leave a turnip
				— paring for us." And on he rushed to the scuffle, leaving Michael gazing with
				disgust and horror at the contest between the fierce snouts of the angry pigs, and
				the active fingers of the wretched crew who contested with them for the offal thus
				cast forth.
 Michael Armstrong was a child of deep feeling; and it was, perhaps, lucky for him,
				that the burning sense of shame and degradation which pervaded every nerve of his
				little frame, as he looked on upon this revolting spectacle, come upon him while yet
				too young for any notion of resistance to suggest itself. He felt faint, sick, and
				broken-hearted; but no worm that ever was crushed to atoms by the foot of an
				elephant, dreamed less of vengeance than did poor Michael, as the horrid thought
				came over him, that he was going to abide in a  place where little boys
				were treated with less care and tenderness than pigs! 
He turned away shuddering, and feeling almost unable to stand — and then the image of
				his mother seemed to rise before him — he felt her soft gentle kisses on his cheeks,
				and almost unconsciously pronounced her name. This dear name, lowly as it was
				murmured, came upon his ear so like the knell of happiness that was never to return,
				that the hard agony of his little heart melted before it, and sitting down upon a
				bundle of fagots that were piled up against the wall, he rested his burning head
				against the bricks, and burst into a passion of tears. At this moment he felt a hand
				upon his shoulder, and trembling from head to foot, he sprung upon his feet, and
				suddenly turning round beheld, instead of the savage features of the overlooker
				which his fancy had conjured up, the meekest, gentlest, loveliest little face, that
				ever eyes looked upon, within a few feet of him. It was the same little girl who had
				been placed next him at the miserable supper of the preceding night, and whose low
				murmur of pity for all the sorrow he was come to share with her, had reached his
				ears and his heart.
"You'll be strapped dreadful if you bide here," said the child. "Come away — and
				don't let them see you cry!" But even as she spoke she turned from him, and ran
				towards the door through which the miserable pilferers of the pig-trough were
				already hurrying.
Perhaps no other warning-voice would have been so promptly listened to at that moment
				by poor Michael, for it was something very like the numbing effect of despair that
				seemed to have seized upon him, and it is likely enough he would have remained in
				the attitude he had taken, with his head resting against the wall, till the brutal
				violence of his task-master had dragged him from it, had not this pretty vision of
				pity appeared to warn him of his danger.
He rose and followed her so quickly, that by the time she had reached the crowd of
				children who were still thronging round the pump, he was by her side.
"Thank you!" whispered Michael in her ear, "It was very kind of you to call me — and
				I shouldn't have come if you hadn't — for I shouldn't care very much if they killed
				me."
"That's very naughty!" said the little girl.
"How can I be good?" demanded Michael, while the tears again burst from his
				eyes. "'Twas mother that made me good before, and I don't think I shall ever see her
				any more."
"I never can see my mother any more, till I go to Heaven," replied the little girl —
				"but I always think every day, that she told me before she died, about God's making
				every thing come right in the end, if we hear all things patiently for love of
				him."
"But God can't choose I should be taken from mother, and that's why I can't bear it,"
				said Michael.
The little girl shook her head, very evidently disapproving his theology.
"How old are you?" said Michael.
"Eleven years old three months ago, and that was one week after I came here,"
				answered his new acquaintance.

"Then you are more than one whole year older than me?" said Michael; "and I dare say
				you know better than I do; and I'll try to be good too, if you'll love me, and be
				kind to me always, like poor Edward. My name is Michael — What's your name?"
"Fanny Fletcher," replied the little girl, "and I will love you and be kind
				to you, if you'll be a good boy and bear it all patiently."
"I would bear it all patiently," said Michael, "if I knew when I was to get away, and
				when you was to get away too. But perhaps we are to stay here for ever?" And again
				the tears ran down his cheeks.
"That's nonsense, Michael," said Fanny. "They can't keep us here for ever. When we
				die, we are sure to get away from them."
Michael opened his large eyes and looked at her with something like reproach. "When
				we die?" he repeated sadly. "Are we to stay here till we die? — I am never to see
				mother and Teddy any more then?"
"Don't cry, Michael!" said the little girl, taking his hand — "We shall be sure to
				get out if God thinks it right. Don't cry so!"
"I wish I was as old as you," said Michael, with an accent expressive of great
				respect. "I should bear it better then."
As Michael ceased speaking he felt the little girl shudder. "Here he is!" she
				whispered, withdrawing her hand from him — "we mustn't speak any more now."
"Off with you, vagabonds!" roared the voice of the apprentice-house governor, from
				behind them. "Don't you see the factory-gates open?".
The miserable little troop waited for no second summons, well knowing that the lash,
				which was now only idly cutting the air above their heads, would speedily descend
				upon them if they did; but not even terror could enable the wasting limbs of those
				who had long inhabited this fearful abode, to move quickly. Many among them were
				dreadfully crippled in the legs, and nearly all exhibited the frightful spectacle of
				young features pinched by famine.

Let none dare to say this picture is exaggerated, till he has taken the trouble to
				ascertain by his own personal investigation, that it is so. It is very fearful crime
				in a country where public opinion has been proved (as in the African Slave Trade),
				to be omnipotent, for any individual to sit down with a shadow of doubt respecting
				such statements on his mind. If they be true, let each in his own
				little circle, raise his voice against the horrors detailed by them, AND THESE
				HORRORS WILL BE REMEDIED. But woe to those who supinely sit in contented ignorance
				of the facts, soothing their spirits and their easy consciences with the cuckoo
				note, " exaggeration ," while thousands of helpless children pine away
				their unnoted, miserable lives, in labour and destitution, incomparably more
					severe , than any ever produced by negro slavery.

 It was with a feeling certainly somewhat akin to comfort, that Michael found himself
				thrust into the same chamber with his gentle  little monitor, Fanny.
				The mules they attended, were side by side, and though no intercourse was permitted,
				that could by possibility interfere with the ceaseless labour of piecing,
				nevertheless, a word when their walk brought them near enough to each other to be
				heard, was often exchanged between the children, and the effect of this on Michael,
				was most salutary. 
Superlatively, and above all others, wretched as are the miserable young victims
				apprenticed to factory masters, it is not unusual to find among them some helpless
				creature, whose first impressions were received under more favourable moral
				circumstances, than those in which the pauper children of the manufacturing
				districts are placed. For it is from a distance from those unblessed regions, that
				the great majority of apprentices are furnished, and the chances are, therefore,
				greatly in favour of their having first opened their eyes amidst scenes of less
				ignorance, degradation, and suffering, than those born within reach of the poisonous
				factory influence.
Such was the case with Fanny Fletcher. It was not till mother and father were both
				dead, that she had ceased to hear the voice of love, and the precepts of religion.
				For three years she had, indeed, been supported by the labour of a poor widowed
				mother; but being her only child, Fanny had wanted nothing, had never been exposed
				to the hearing of coarse language, or the witnessing vicious habits, and all her
				little studies had been so thoroughly mixed up with religious feelings, that by the
				time she was ten years old, it would have been almost impossible to eradicate them,
				or rob her entirely of the gentle courage, and patient endurance, such feelings
				invariably lead to. When her mother died, all the world — her little world,
				consisting of a score of poor bodies of her own class, exclaimed, "Poor Fanny
				Fletcher!" But there was not one among them rich enough to save her from the
				workhouse, and to the workhouse therefore she went, whence within three months she
				was sent, with many others, as apprentices, to Deep Valley factory, ostensibly, and
				as doubtless the parish authorities believed, to learn a good trade, but in truth,
				to undergo a species of slavery, probably the most tremendous that young children
				were ever exposed to in any part of the known world, civilized or uncivilized.
 That the desolate little creature suffered fearfully, both in body and mind, cannot
				be doubted; yet at the time Michael first saw her, there was still that beautiful
				look of innocent patience in her eyes, which shows that the spirit, though bending
				under sorrow, is neither reckless nor degraded. Herself, and her companions from the
				workhouse to which she had been consigned at her mother's death, were the latest
				arrivals at Deep Valley when Michael reached it, and were still considered by the
				rest of the inmates as new-comers, who did not yet know the full misery of incessant
				labour, with strength daily failing for want of pure air and sufficient food. Fanny
				was by nature a slight delicate little creature, with an elastic sort of vitality
				about her which seemed to set fasting at defiance. That is to say, her sweet eye had
				not yet lost its brightness, but her beautifully fair cheek was very pale, and her
				delicate limbs most deplorably thin, though they had  not yet reached
				that shrunk and wasted condition which was nearly general among her companions.
				Michael looked at her as she bent over her threads, and repaired the incessant
				breakings among them with her white little hands, with a degree of love and pity
				which while it wrung his heart, softened the hard despair that had nearly seized
				upon him, by making him feel, that though his mother and his brother were lost to
				him for long long years, during which he was to taste of nothing but misery, still
				there was somebody who might grow to love him. This was a timely solace! Young as he
				was, he perceived at once, that instead of being brought to Deep Valley to learn
					a trade , he had been beguiled to enter there bound and helpless,
				for more years than he dared to count, and with no prospect of learning any thing
				beyond the same slavish process of waiting upon the machinery, which had painfully
				occupied his daily existence, and that of his dearer brother, as long as they could
				remember to have lived. Under these circumstances, it was truly a great blessing to
				have found somebody of whom he might make a friend, and so strongly did the poor
				little fellow feel it, that when the miserable band were led to their morning meal,
				he told Fanny as he walked beside her, that he thought he should grow to behave
				better than he had done that morning, if she would always talk to him about good
				things, and let him talk about mother and Teddy to her in return. 
"There's a good boy!" replied Fanny, soothingly. "I will talk to you, Michael,
				whenever I can — and never mind," she added, as they sat down again side by side at
				the long dirty board that formed their breakfast table, "never mind not having
				what's good to eat, it won't taste so nasty by and bye, when you grow used to
				it."
"I won't mind it!" replied Michael, manfully, as he supped the musty-flavoured watery
				mess. "But I wish I had got a bit of good bread for you, Fanny!"
