 CHAPTER XXX. 
MICHAEL GROWS RICH, AND TAKES A VERY DELIGHTFUL WALK BACK TO WESTMORLAND — HIS
				PREPARATIONS FOR A LONGER JOURNEY ARE SUDDENLY STOPPED — HE MAKES A PAINFUL VISIT,
				BUT MEETS MANY OLD ACQUAINTANCES.

				The morning's walk had been a long one, even for Michael Armstrong,
				and right glad was he to find himself again in the neatly-sanded kitchen of his
				little inn, with a loaf and cheese before him, of sufficient dimensions to resist
				any attacks he could make upon them. A moderate proportion of beer, in addition to
				the solid meal these afforded, refreshed him so effectually that he determined to
				take his leave of Mr. Bell that night, preparatory to setting off on his return to
				Westmorland on the following morning, in order to bid farewell to his good old
				master there. On the subject of Martha's bank-notes he meant to be entirely guided
				by the advice of the clergyman, being equally fearful of offending, or rather of
				paining their generous owner by refusing to accept them, or of depriving her of what
				might be hereafter useful by agreeing to do so.

"I have seen Miss Martha, sir!" were his first words on entering Mr. Bell's parlour,
				and both look and accent showed that the interview had been an interesting one.
				"But, alas! she is greatly altered," he added, restraining with difficulty the tears
				that rose to his eyes. "I fear she is very ill; — but she was glad — oh! so glad to
				see me, sir! She has been fretting, poor dear young lady, under the false notion
				that she had been to blame about me; but, thank Heaven! think she knows better now,
				and perhaps when her mind is at ease again she may recover health. I can't bear to
				think how pale and thin she is grown, and all about me, to whom she was the best and
				kindest friend that ever poor boy had. And see, sir, what she has done now!"
				continued Michael, drawing forth the roll of notes from his pocket. "Here is a large
				sum of money, I believe. She did not rightly know how much it was herself, she told
				me, because she had kept on putting by what she did not want, and had never counted
				how much it came to — and I'm sure I have not counted it either; but whether it is
				little or much, I don't feel quite certain whether I ought to take it."
Mr. Bell smiled at the unusual manner in which the rich-looking, but
				carelessly-packed roll of paper had passed from one hand to the other. Before he
				examined the contents he questioned Michael as to all that the generous-hearted girl
				had said to him, on bestowing it, and the young man's faithful answers soon
				convinced him that there would be little kindness to the self-reproaching Martha in
				refusing a donation which she evidently considered as an atonement, and which would,
				he doubted not, by its application to Michael's necessities, do more towards healing
				her wounded mind than any other thing whatever.
"You must not refuse the gift, Michael," said Mr. Bell, after hearing his narrative
				to the end. "I do not wonder, little as she has been to blame in the matter, at her
				having suffered greatly for all that she innocently made you suffer; nor am I at all
				surprised, since it was in her power to do so, that she should wish to make you this
				atonement. It comes at a lucky moment, my dear boy, for not only will it enable you
				to present yourself before Miss Brotherton, without throwing yourself, as you said
				yesterday, upon her charity, but I suspect it may go far in assisting your hopes of
				entering into some business, which may enable you to support yourself."
Mr. Bell then opened the bundle of notes, and found that they amounted to rather more
				than five hundred pounds; a sum which, to Michael, appeared so enormous that he
				uttered something like a remonstrance against the opinion which advised his
				appropriating the whole.
"Did you not tell me, sir," he said, "that Sir Matthew Dowling's affairs were not
				considered to be in so flourishing a state as they had been? And may not this money
				be wanted by Miss Martha in case he should really become involved in
				difficulties?"
 "I think there is no danger of her wanting it, Michael," returned Mr. Bell. "Let
				what will happen, I have no doubt that Sir Matthew  will be able to
				secure sufficient from the relics of his enormous wealth to maintain his family in
				easy circumstances. A sum like this, my dear boy, is but a drop in such an ocean." 
Michael resisted no longer, and this point being settled, his plan of operations was
				soon arranged. In deference to Martha's fears for his safety, he decided not to
				visit his good friend Richard Smithson, at Milford, Mr. Bell undertaking to settle
				the matter of the loan, and moreover to convey to the kind-hearted man the
				assurances of Michael's well-doing, of his gratitude, and hearty good wishes. The
				letter from the travellers, which was to settle the happy Michael's road, would
				probably arrive within a week or two, and Mr. Bell recommended that, having paid his
				farewell visit to Westmorland he should return to Fairly, and there equip himself in
				such a manner as would be suitable for presenting himself before Miss Brotherton.
				Mr. Bell agreed to take the custody of his treasure, till his return, and with his
				bundle again on his shoulder, and five pounds in his pocket, Michael set off to walk
				over the fells and moors he had to traverse, with a lightness of spirit that seemed
				to strew the deserts with flowers, and made every blast that blew upon him as soft
				and sweet as the gales of Araby. It was not the least, perhaps, of his pleasures, as
				he strode sturdily along, to compare his present walk with that which had conducted
				him from the Deep Valley to Ashleigh, four years before.
The suffering, the terror, and the final agony of that expedition could not come over
				his mind, however, without throwing a shade over his gladness; but it chastened
				without obscuring the bright combination of objects that glowed in the prospect
				before him; and, altogether, it would be difficult to find any walk on record more
				replete with enjoyment than this of Michael to the humble mountain-home that had so
				kindly sheltered him.
It was with a very flattering mixture of joy and sorrow that the good statesman and
				his family accepted Michael's farewell, and listened to his happy hopes; and it was
				amidst blessings and hearty good wishes that once again he sallied forth to wend his
				way for the last time over the mountains, and bid a fond and lingering adieu to his
				beloved lakes and tarns. He felt that those had been to him as teachers and
				preachers, elevating his heart and imagination, and preparing him, more effectually
				perhaps than any other school could have done, for the different sphere of life in
				which he now hoped to move.
 On reaching Fairly, he found that a letter had arrived from Miss Brotherton,
				enclosing one to Martha Dowling, which had been forwarded immediately; and which, by
				what the kind-hearted heiress said to her Fairly friends, seemed to have been
				written in consequence of the reports which had reached her respecting the failing
				fortunes of Sir Matthew. Miss Brotherton was at Nice, where it was her purpose to
				remain for some months. To Nice, then, the thrice happy Michael prepared to go; a
				respectable wardrobe, and all other necessary equipments were easily procured in the
				neighbourhood, his place to  London taken, and all things ready for his
				setting off, save that he still expected an answer to a very cautiously-worded
				epistle which he had ventured to address to Martha, informing her that he was
				setting off for Nice, and that any letter or message she might wish to convey to
				Miss Brotherton, should be carefully delivered by her faithful humble servant, M. A. 
Michael was at breakfast with his kind and hospitable friends, when a lad, bearing
				great marks of hasty travelling in his appearance, made his way into the room, and
				with a look that seemed to prophesy eventful tidings, if he were but asked for them,
				delivered a letter to Mr. Bell. This proved, however, to be only a blank cover,
				enclosing one to Michael, which was handed to him, while the eyes of his host and
				hostess fixed themselves with some anxiety on his face. Michael tore open the
				despatch, and changed colour as he read it. Then, giving an intelligible glance at
				the messenger who ceased not to wipe his forehead with one arm, while he held his
				hat squeezed to his side with the other, he said, "I should like to speak to you
				about this, Mr. Bell."
"Go into the kitchen, my lad," said the clergyman, "and get some breakfast. You shall
				know when the answer is ready."
Though evidently disappointed at being thus dismissed unquestioned, the boy consoled
				himself with the hope of a kitchen audience, and making his reverence, retired.
"What in the world have you got there, Michael?" demanded Mr. Bell. "Not good news, I
				am afraid?"
"No, indeed, sir," replied Michael, "very far from it. It is from Miss Martha
				Dowling, who seems to be in great distress."
"Read it to us, my good fellow, will you? If there is no reason to the contrary."
"What is written here, sir, cannot long be a secret from any body. This is what she
				says:
 "'Dear Michael!
"'Pray come to me at Dowling Lodge directly. There is no longer any danger to be
				feared from my poor dear father, for he is very, very ill — and I think you can be
				useful to me, which I am sure you will be if you can. Alas! Michael, you will
				witness a dreadful scene! My poor father has kept every thing secret to the very
				last; meaning, I am sure, to prepare his family for it as well as he could. I could
				not think what it was made him send all my sisters away to Arabella and Harriet. The
				two little ones, indeed, as well as the three youngest boys, are all at school, so
				that I am the only child he has left with him, my elder brothers being all away in
				their different professions. I tell you all this now, Michael, because I shall, I
				suppose, have no time to say any thing but on necessary business when you come here.
				Do not delay, I am sure you can be useful to me.

				"'In great sorrow, your friend,
			
"' Martha Dowling .'"

"Poor girl! This is sad indeed!" cried Mr. Bell. "I imagine, though she does not
				explain herself, that her father's affairs are fallen into confusion. Yet I cannot
				guess what you can do for her. However, you must go immediately of course; and you
				had better hire a chaise that no time may be lost. And I would advise you, Michael,
				to take with you the pocket-book which Mrs. Bell packed up for you so carefully last
				night. I fear that it is but too likely your prediction will be fulfilled already,
				and that the poor young lady may be glad to have some of her notes returned."
"Thank God! that I was not gone," replied Michael, fervently. "It will be the
				greatest pleasure of my life, if I can be useful to her!"
Little time was lost in setting off; and certainly much before his arrival had been
				hoped for by Martha, Michael, who left his postchaise at a public-house near the
				lodge, was walking towards the mansion by the same path in which he had so lately
				parted from her. On entering the kitchen, the scene which met his eyes, explained at
				the very first glance the nature of the business carrying on upon the premises. A
				number of men were standing about, some few occupied in sticking slips of paper
				inscribed "Lot No. — ," upon a variety of articles which appeared to have been
				collected there for the purpose. Others, with black canvass aprons and paper caps,
				were coming and going with no very apparent purpose; while another set, with cold
				meat and beer-flagons before them, sat round a small table in a corner, discoursing
				upon themes which appeared to occasion them much merriment.
But among all these, there was not one that looked like a servant of the house; and
				taking advantage of the confusion which seemed to license the freedom, he walked on
				without speaking to any of them, and determined to trust to his memory for finding
				the small morning-parlour which used to contain all poor Martha's little literary
				personalties, and in which all his reading and writing lessons had been
				received.
Neither his recollection nor his conjeture deceived him; he found the apartment he
				sought, and on opening the door, discovered Martha sitting there. But she was not,
				as he had hoped to find her, alone. On a sofa placed opposite the windows sat a
				figure, bolt upright in the middle of it, with a sofa-table before her entirely
				covered with trinkets, delicate Sèvre china, miniature bronzes, and other valuable
				nick-nacks. A quantity of cotton-wool lay on the sofa beside her, and her long lean
				fingers were actively employed in selecting the most precious articles, enveloping
				them in the wool, and then cramming them into a large basket that stood before her,
				— sometimes selecting one, either smaller or more precious than the rest, and
				thrusting it into her pocket or up her sleeve. A large Indian screen was spread
				before the door, which induced Michael, on hearing a voice that certainly was not
				that of his friend Martha, to remain unseen long enough to decide whether his
				entrance would be likely to occasion her any embarrassment.

"I tell you, Martha, that you talk like a fool, and that is what you always were, and
				always will be!" said the upright lady, in a shrill voice, but in a tone that she
				was endeavouring to reduce to a whisper. "What right can any one of these horrid
				dirty fellows have with what is mine, i should like to know? I am not going to be
				made bankrupt, or sent to jail, or have my property seized, because your abominable,
				wicked, low-born, brutal, treacherous, false father, has been found out, and is
				going to be treated as he deserves. As for you, and all the rest of your family,
				there is nothing to be said or done, I suppose, but to submit, and just do what you
				can to get your bread. With such blood as you have got in your veins, there will be
				no great harm done if you were all to go out as housemaids and footmen. The thing
				happens among low people continually, if the father gets into distress; but I should
				like to know who ever heard of a woman of quality, the daughter of an earl, being
				treated in the same sort of unceremonious way?"
"But indeed, Lady Clarissa, it will be a great deal worse for my father, if it is
				found out that his wife has been endeavouring to secrete property," said Martha.
"His wife, indeed! A pretty sort of husband he has made me, hasn't he? Having my
				noble arms painted on his paltry carriages, and engraven on his plate, not a single
				ounce of which had been twenty years in his possession; and then, vulgar wretch!
				insisting upon seeing my housekeeper's account, for fear I should save any thing out
				of the money he allowed me! Pitiful, cheating, brutal, manufacturing savage! But
				thank Heaven! my slavery is at an end! — To-morrow will see me many a good mile on
				my way to Scotland! The monsters say I may take my clothes and my money — and my
				clothes and my money I will take, I promise you, Miss Martha; so I would really
				advise you to go and collect your own things, and see them put together decently.
				You may be able to sell some of them perhaps, which might be very useful, and that
				would be spending your time much more profitably, and decently too, than sitting
				there lecturing me upon what I may, and what I may not take. I shall take every
				thing that belongs to me, and there's an end of that; and I wish to my heart you
				would just go away and leave me in peace."
"Did I not know, Lady Clarissa, that my father would suffer for it," said Martha
				rising, "I would not have troubled you with my remonstrances; but I am certain that
				you are now occupied in abstracting things that of right belong to my poor father's
				creditors, and if it is discovered, it may be the means of their refusing his
				certificate, and he may be thrown into a jail for life."
"And where could he be better, Miss Martha? I am sure I don't know. My belief is that
				he is mad, or going to be mad, and I don't see but a jail is as comfortable as a
				mad-house, and as it must be a great deal cheaper, it will suit his circumstances a
				great deal better. I wish you would go, child, and see if there is such a thing in
				the house as a basin of soup for my luncheon. I may ring and ring, but there is not
				a creature that will answer the bell now."

Martha made no reply, but she rose from her chair, and Michael stepped back into the
				passage, that she might not meet him within hearing of her selfish step-mother.
"You are come, then!" exclaimed the poor girl, on catching sight of him. "This is
				very kind of you, Michael! If you will walk this way with me — there is nobody in
				the great drawing-room now — I will explain my reasons for sending for you."
Michael followed her to the well-remembered drawing-room, which had so often
				witnessed the display of Sir Matthew's munificent charity, by showing him off to all
				the neighbourhood. The recollection was very hateful to him, yet the right-hearted
				lad felt a pang as he accompanied his benefactress into this greatly-altered scene
				of former splendour. The whole house was under preparation for a sale by auction,
				and nothing could exceed the speaking state of gilded desolation which this fine
				room exhibited.
Never mind the confusion, Michael! Just step over these curtains — we can sit down,
				up in that corner of the room — take care of the mirrors, my dear boy! Surely they
				have thrown these costly things about more heedlessly than was necessary!" said poor
				Martha, as she led the way rather over, then through the scattered mass of splendid
				furniture with which the room was strewed.
"It is strange, Michael," she resumed, as soon as they had seated themselves in a
				clear space of six feet wide, where two chairs were standing near one of the
				windows, — "it is strange, most strange, that you should be the only person that I
				could think of to assist my poor father in his misery! You who have suffered so
				severely from — from his displeasure. But I found out, Michael, that you had a kind,
				good heart, when you used to talk to me of your mother and poor Teddy. It was that
				which made me take notice of you then, and it is that which makes me ask for your
				assistance now."
"And happy and thankful shall I be if I can do you any good, Miss Martha!" replied
				Michael, eagerly. "I have brought back the notes, all but about twelve pounds, that
				has been laid out for me. It is a very large sum, Miss Martha, and I trust it will
				be useful to you."
 "I do not want it, my dear boy!" replied Martha, smiling through her tears, "but I
				am glad to find that I was not mistaken in you. No, Michael! let me still, under all
				circumstances, have the unspeakable comfort of believing that I have been able to
				make you some little atonement for all you have gone through from my ill-judged and
				ignorant advice. You would make no difficulty about keeping what has been
				accumulated out of my hatred of silks and satins, Michael, if you could guess the
				extraordinary good it has done me to know that you are alive and well, and less
				destitute than you would have been, had you never seen me. I thought I was dying,
				Michael, before your little note reached me; but now, strange to say, spite of all
				the calamities which have fallen upon my family since, I feel as if I might still
				live long enough to be useful to my poor father. Alas! Michael, his condition is
				very dreadful! For some months past, I have perceived a great alteration in him. His
				memory ha  failed him, and at times his temper has been so variable
				that I have seen him violently angry, and very intemperate in his language, one
				minute, and enduring the insolence of Lady Clarissa, with the meekness of a child,
				the next. And now — In short, Michael, I greatly fear that his reason is shaken by
				the misfortunes that have fallen upon him. He has kept all his commercial disasters
				so completely to himself, that not even his most confidential agents were at all
				aware of their extent; and I therefore hope that if I can contrive to remove him
				from this melancholy scene, his mind will be relieved by felling that the worst is
				over, and that I may have the exceeding happiness of seeing him restored to reason
				and to health." 
"And in what way then can I be useful to you, my dear Miss Martha? I dare not combat
				your will, but it seems to me that if his creditors are stripping his house in this
				way, such a sum as you have put into my hands might be very useful to him," said
				Michael.
 "And so it would, certainly, my good friend, if he had not provided for the
				exigences of this terrible moment, by having a large sum of ready money in the
				house, a fact which he has confided to me only," replied Martha. "His marriage with
				Lady Clarissa," she continued, "has been a greater misfortune to him, Michael, than
				any losses in his business could possibly be. She has led him a most wretched life —
				constantly keeping his high spirit in subjection by threatening to bring her brother
				upon him, if he treated her with any want of respect, and my poor father's reverence
				for rank and title is such, that he has submitted to her in every thing. But during
				the terrible fortnight that has passed since the disclosure of his ruin, her conduct
				has been perfectly frightful — and I feel quite certain that when she has taken
				herself off to Scotland, which she intends to do to-morrow, my father will feel so
				greatly relieved, that the very best effects upon his mind may be hoped for from it.
				What I want you to do for me, Michael, is this: You must procure a postchaise to be
				at the Lodge-gates to-night at twelve. The men who are left in charge of the house,
				get both tired and tipsy before that hour, and will be in bed and asleep; and then I
				think I shall be able to get my poor father away from all the irritating objects
				which surround him here. He has been very ill with violent spasms, and confined to
				his bed for a day or two, which one of the maids tells me is the reason why he has
				not been more strictly watched. They think he is too ill to get away. But he is
				greatly better to-day, and though I have persuaded him to remain in bed, I think he
				has quite lost the complaint, and will be able to get off if you will do what I
				desire of you. I know not another being that I could trust. My poor father has spent
				a great deal of money, and been very liberal to many, but I do not know one whom I
				do not suspect would be more ready to betray, than to help him, if they saw him
				endeavouring to get away. His physician, Dr. Crockley, a man on whom he has heaped
				innumerable favours, is, I strongly suspect, acting as a spy upon him; and it is
				because I expect his daily visit presently, that I will not let my father get up.
				Therefore you see, Michael, there are some difficulties to be encountered.  Do you think you could manage to get a chaise to the gates without its
				being known that it was for him?" 
"I am quite sure of it," replied Michael; "for to save time I came hither in a chaise
				myself, which is now waiting at the public-house to take me back to Fairly. I have
				only to go and tell the boy that I shall not be able to return before night, in
				order to have him ready to start at any hour you please."
"To Fairly?" said Martha, musingly. "But it is no matter — he may sleep at the inn
				there as well as at any other, and the next morning we must make our way to the
				nearest port where there is a chance of our finding a steam-boat going to France. It
				will not do at present for my father to remain in the country. When he has got his
				certificate, he will be safe; but I greatly fear some difficulty about it."
While Martha was thus explaining her hopes and fears, the sound of carriage-wheels
				was heard slowly approaching by the road which led to the chief entrance, and which
				passed at no great distance from the window at which they were sitting.
"Here comes Dr. Crockley!" she exclaimed; "I am very glad his visit will be over so
				early. This will give me time for preparation."
But she was mistaken; the equipage she heard a approaching was not the recently
				set-up cab of Dr. Crockley, but the donkey-chair of the ever active Mrs. Gabberly.
				Nothing could be much farther from poor Martha's inclination than encountering the
				prying old woman at this moment; but having hastily told Michael to appear as if he
				were employed in taking a catalogue of the furniture, for which purpose, paper,
				pens, and ink lay conveniently ready on one of the marbleslabs, she hurried out into
				the hall for the purpose of meeting the physician, and attending him as usual to her
				father — so that the avoiding Mrs. Gabberly was impossible.
"Oh, my poor dear Martha! that's you, is it? Well now! you was just the person I
				wanted to see. But I do wonder you did not get off with your father, poor man! when
				he made his escape, this morning," said the unchanged little lady.
"I know not what you mean, Mrs. Gabberly," replied Martha gravely. "My poor father
				has been extremely ill, and is at this moment confined to his bed." The old lady
				gave a wink with one of her little cunning black eyes, and nodding her head very
				expressively, replied, "Old birds are not caught with chaff, my dear."
"What is it that you mean, Mrs. Gabberly — that you do not believe me?" said Martha,
				indignantly.
"You are very foolish to bawl out in that manner, my dear, with that young fellow
				that's cataloguing in there, close within hearing. Mind, it is your fault and not
				mine, if he suspects any thing from your violence."
 "You are taking an account of all the looking-glasses, are you not?" said Martha,
				approaching the drawing-room door and addressing Michael. "You may come into Sir
				Matthew's room now, if you please. He was asleep when I sent you away just now."
				Then, turning to Mrs. Gabberly, she added — "Perhaps you would be so 
				good as to see my poor father, Mrs. Gabberly? I would not wish you to stay long with
				him, for he is very feverish; but I dare say he would take it very kindly if you
				will just come in to inquire for him." 
Looking a good deal surprised, but accepting the invitation with great alacrity, Mrs.
				Gabberly began to mount the stairs; exceedingly well pleased to have an opportunity
				of procuring so excellent a ticket of admission to every house in the neighbourhood,
				as this ocular demonstration of the actual condition of the fallen knight would
				furnish. Michael, in compliance with the order he had received, followed after; and
				in a few minutes, found himself once more in the presence of the man under whose
				tyranny he had suffered so terribly. But a harder heart than Michael's might have
				been softened into forgiveness and forgetfulness of all former injuries, by the
				miserable aspect of the wretched man who lay stretched upon the splendid bed that he
				could no longer call his own. His steadfast-minded and affectionate daughter — the
				only earthly good that avenging Heaven had left him — entered first, intending to
				announce the visit of Mrs. Gabberly; but Sir Matthew started up in bed, and before
				she could speak, cried out, "Do not let that devil Crockley come to me, Martha! I
				will not see him, I tell you. I have got no pain now; and if I had, don't I know he
				would rather give me poison than physic? He is going to lose his annuity, you
				know."
"It is Mrs. Gabberly, dear papa, just come to ask you how you are," said Martha,
				leading the old lady to the bedside. "She will not stay, because you are not well
				enough to talk; but you will be glad to see her, will you not?"
"Glad?" said the miserable man, knitting his brows, and throwing upon her a look of
				deep aversion. "Don't I know her? Is she not the town-crier of all the country
				round? Have I not paid her for it a hundred times? And do you think I don't know
				what she is come for now? Somebody else will pay her now, for bringing them word how
				the poor bankrupt Dowling looks."
"Well now, that is terrible, to be sure!" exclaimed Mrs. Gabberly. "He is
				quite shook in his mind. Do you think he would be outrageous if I was to feel his
				pulse, my dear? I should like to prescribe for him — I should indeed. Poor dear man!
				His talking about paying me is comical to be sure. Let me feel your pulse,
				Sir Matthew, shall I?"
Sir Matthew looked so very much as if he would have liked to take her up in his
				enormous hand and throw her to the further end of the room, that Martha thought it
				prudent to prevent her nearer approach.
"You have now seen my father, Mrs. Gabberly," she said with emphasis, "and
				that, I think, is all that can be necessary for your satisfaction."
 "Oh! certainly — it is very satisfactory," she replied, but without appearing to
				have the slightest intention of leaving the room; for, in truth, it was at that
				moment the place where, beyond all others, she best liked to be. The downfal of Sir
				Matthew Dowling was the  subject that employed every tongue, and nobody
				could be so welcome to every drawing-room, and every dining-room too, throughout the
				neighbourhood, as one who could testify to having seen him, listened to him, and
				ascertained how he seemed to bear it. It was impossible that any person could have
				been better qualified for the service than Mrs. Gabberly. Willingly would the still
				brisk little lady have crept under the toilet-table, or the bed itself, rather than
				have lost so glorious an opportunity; and instead of attending to Martha's repeated
				assurance that she "had better go now," she began opening sundry physic-vials that
				stood on a table at the bottom of the bed, smelling some, tasting others, and
				pronouncing judgment upon all. 
"It is quite a mystery to me, my dear, what Dr. Crockley can be thinking of, giving
				such medicines as these to your father," said she.
"I see, plainly enough, that he is in a very inflammable and irritable state, and he
				ought to be put altogether upon the depleting plan." Then putting her finger on her
				lip, in sign of secrecy, she whispered, "I'll just stay here, Martha, behind the
				bed-curtains, till Dr. Crockley comes, and I think it may be very useful for us to
				have a little conversation together. I know my poor dear father's method in these
				cases as well as he did himself, and he was regular bred you know, which is more
				than we can say of poor dear Dr. Crockley."
Exceedingly provoked, Martha now addressed her father, saying, "Mrs. Gabberly wishes
				to stay, papa, till Dr. Crockley comes, in order that they may have a consultation
				about you; but you won't like that, shall you?"
"Like it?" replied the prostrate man, with bitterness, "Oh! dear yes, I shall like it
				vastly! They are exactly a fitting pair to come together, glowering and gloating
				round the bed of a ruined neighbour. Let her stay, by all means, Martha, let her
				stay and watch it all. See, Mrs. Gabberly, there is a young auctioneering gentleman
				come to take an account of the furniture. Isn't it pleasant? I am sure it must do
				your heart good to see it. Don't go away, young man!" he continued, addressing
				Michael, who, shocked and disgusted, was making his way towards the door. "Don't go
				away. Go on, never mind losing a little time, I dare say you will be paid for it all
				the same and my dear good neighbour would not enjoy it half so much if she did not
				see something of the kind going on."
"Oh, dear! oh, dear! quite wild and wandering! Isn't he? — Calling Crockley and me a
				pair too! As if we ever thought of such a thing! I am sure, for one, I can answer
				for it that I never did. — His doll of a wife, you know, hasn't been dead above a
				year, and I've no notion of such quick work, it is quite indecent, I think. Good
				gracious me, now!" she continued, catching Sir Matthew's fierce eye fixed upon her
				with a mixture of hatred and bitter irony; "what have I said! — I'll bet a guinea he
				fancies I mean something about his marrying himself up, all in such a hurry with
				Lady Clarissa."
 "Lady Clarissa!" cried the knight in a loud voice. "That's right! I had very nearly
				forgotten her ladyship. Go to her this moment, Martha — tell her to come here. Is
				she not my wife — bone of my  bone — flesh of my flesh? Is she not,
				Mrs. Gabberly? And shall she not come hither and share with me the delight of seeing
				a broker taking possession of my furniture, and a dear good soul like you looking
				on? Go, Martha, go when I tell you, and bring the right honourable Lady Clarissa
				Dowling here." 
"I am quite certain she won't come, papa," said Martha, leaning down, and whispering
				in his ear. "So don't make me go to her."
"But she shall , though!" shouted Sir Matthew, "even if I go down, and fetch
				her myself. My dear Mrs. Gabberly, my sweet Mrs. Gabberly — will you have the great
				condescension to go for her? You used to run about, if I did but hold up my finger,
				you know — and you would not be so ungenerous as to refuse now, merely because I am
				a bankrupt! Go to my Lady Clarissa, if you please, sweet Mrs. Gabberly, and tell her
				that as she is a daughter of the noble house of Highlandloch, I wish, before we
				part, to give her a parting token of remembrance. She knows that I wear a
				magnificent diamond ring, Mrs. Gabberly, and you may just hint to her, if you
				please, that nothing has been taken off my body yet. I do assure you it will be a
				very pretty touching scene for you to witness, and talk about. It will indeed. I am
				quite determined to have a sentimental parting; and as she has told me that she
				means to set off to-morrow, this will be just the right time for it — won't it, Mrs.
				Gabberly?"
Perfectly well disposed to execute the commission, and quite as desirous as Sir
				Matthew could be that the proud poor lady who had ever treated her with haughty
				coldness, should be properly humbled, she darted towards the door, in order to
				perform her errand; but Martha, remembering the manner in which she had left her
				step-mother engaged, stepped forward to prevent her, quietly saying, "If my father
				wishes to see his wife, Mrs. Gabberly, I can go for her, without troubling you — and
				I really wish you would permit me to lead you down stairs to your donkey-chair, at
				the same time — I am sure you must be aware that papa is not in a state to bear
				seeing company."
"You are quite right, my dear, quite right, indeed — Sir Matthew is looking sadly
				wild and feverish, and I should say that nobody whatever but the doctor and his own
				family ought to see him. Of course I suppose it would not be very convenient to hire
				attendants now, for these sort of people, I am sorry to say, always insist upon
				ready money, which is a cruel thing under such circumstances. But so it is, and
				therefore it follows that you and Lady Clarissa must be the chief nurses."
"Certainly, ma'am, it will be his own family who will wish to attend to him. And
				therefore, if you please, I will take you down stairs, and see you to your
				carriage."
 "Me! my dear!" cried Mrs. Gabberly, in the shrillest possible tone. "Surely you
				cannot mean to call such an old friend as I am, company? No, no, my dear Martha.
				Don't think me such a brute! I would not leave you just yet, for the whole world!
				You shall go yourself, my dear, if you will, and bring her ladyship up. I will stay
				here as quiet as a mouse, and watch by your poor papa. But perhaps it might be as
				well to desire that young man to finish with his scribbling,  and get
				out of the room. He must have gone over every thing by this time, mustn't he?" 
"I will have her right honourable ladyship here before that fellow stirs a step,
				Martha. Do you hear me? That's more than half the fun," cried Sir Matthew, bursting
				into a shout of laughter. "Doesn't she know our kind, clever, observing, neighbour,
				who is come here so thoughtfully, just to look about her a little? Doesn't she know
				her, almost as well as I do? And won't she enjoy thinking what a pleasant
				description dear Mrs. Gabberly will be able to give of my Lord Highlandloch's sweet
				daughter watching the broker, and seeing that he sets every thing down fair?"
Thankful was Martha that the supposed broker was one who could not in reality add to
				the horror of the scene. She turned to him as she left the room, saying, "You had
				better remain here, if you please, till I return," upon which he modestly ensconced
				himself in a distant corner of the room, and resting his paper upon a commode,
				continued, as he stood, to scribble upon it.
Quite certain that it would be impossible to get rid of Mrs. Gabberly till her
				father's summons to his proud wife had been obeyed, and greatly more anxious to
				clear his room of this troublesome guest, than to spare the feelings of her
				ladyship, Martha entered the little sittingroom, determined to deliver the message
				concerning the diamond-ring, if she could not prevail without it. She found Lady
				Clarissa in the act of finishing the packing of her basket, by laying on the top of
				it sundry light articles of female attire, very cleverly calculated to make the
				whole pass under the general description of wearing-apparel, which the courtesy of
				the law permits to be removed by all persons in the unfortunate situation of her
				ladyship.
"Now I hope you will cease your impertinent preaching, Miss Martha," she said, as the
				pale and agitated young woman entered the room. "Unless every separate nightcap and
				frill are to be examined one by one by these brutes, I conceive no objection can be
				made to this package. Gather up the cotton-wool, and poke it somewhere out of sight
				directly." Martha obediently set herself to collect the scattered fragments of the
				suspicious-looking wool, but as she did so, said, "My father wishes to see you, Lady
				Clarissa."
"Insolent wretch!" exclaimed her ladyship, pausing in the act of collecting various
				little articles for which she had not found room in the basket, "have you the
				audacity to bring me this as a message?"
"My father says, Lady Clarissa, that as you are going to leave him to-morrow, he
				should wish to see you once more," replied Martha.
 "Monster!" screamed Lady Clarissa stamping her foot upon the floor, "he, see me
				again? he, dare to lift his bankrupt eyes upon the noble woman he has so basely
				injured? — Tell him, you bold messenger, who fear not to face the descendant of a
				dozen earls to convey to her the words of a bankrupt cotton-spinner, tell him, that
				the only atonement he can make, is TO DIE. Tell him, this from me! — and may the
				ostentatious settlement his unprincipled pride made on me,  excuse me
				in some degree in the eyes of my noble brother, for the degradation I brought upon
				him by accepting it!" These last words were uttered with clasped hands, raised eyes,
				fervent accents, and all other ordinary indications of uttering a prayer. 
Indignant and disgusted, Martha felt no scruple in employing the means her father had
				given her for obtaining the interview he desired, and quietly said in reply to this
				burst, "My father stated that his motive for asking to see you, Lady Clarissa,
				proceeded from his wish to present to you, as a parting gift, the diamond ring which
				he wears on his right hand."
The effect of these words was as sudden as that produced by the magic touch of a hand
				employed in turning off gas.
"That indeed is a most natural wish! Unhappy, guilty man! I can well believe that had
				he the crown jewels at command, he would deem them all too poor an offering to atone
				for the offence he has committed against me! I thank God, Martha Dowling, that my
				noble blood has never taught me to forget that I am a Christian! There are many
				women, believe me there are, of less exalted rank than myself, who would not deign
				to obey such a summons. But I feel what my duties are, and I shall nerve my courage
				to perform them. Come with me to my dressing-room, Martha, carry that basket for me,
				and then I will go with you to the bedside of Sir Matthew."
Martha attempted to obey, but the basket was too heavy for her to carry, and she set
				it down again, declaring that the task was beyond her strength.
"A tolerably good joke that," said Lady Clarissa, endeavouring to laugh, "considering
				your origin; but this is the last day of such pleasant jestings, and therefore I
				must bear it with good humour I suppose." Then applying her own much stronger hand,
				she lifted her treasure, and was stalking off with it; but stopped short ere she
				reached the door, saying, "No, I will stay here while you go and fetch my faithful
				Mistress Saunderson. She enters into all my feelings! thank God! and is as strong as
				a Highland pony into the bargain." Having obediently performed this commission, and
				brought back the faithful Scotch waiting-woman, who had adhered very steadfastly to
				her mistress through all the vicissitudes of her fortune, Martha at length succeeded
				in marshalling the Lady Clarissa Dowling into the bedroom of her husband.
No signet-ring ever made a deeper impression on wax, than the diamond one of Sir
				Matthew had done on the memory of his noble wife; and her first glance, as she
				entered the room, was directed to the hand which lay on the bedclothes, that she
				might see if it had been already removed; but on! there it sparkled still, and with
				a gentler aspect than she had been seen to wear since the tremendous hour when the
				declension of Sir Matthew, from the richest commoner in the county into a bankrupt,
				had been announced to her, she said,
"You wish to see me, Sir Matthew — Martha says you wish to see me."

"Yes my beloved!" replied the knight. "I do wish to see you. Angelic sweetness! How
				can I do otherwise? Look at yourself in the mirror, most beautiful Clarissa? Look in
				the mirror before that broker there carries it off, and tell me if you think it
				possible that any man could bear to part with so much beauty, without having one
				final gaze upon it? And see, my dear, here is your amiable neighbour Mrs. Gabberly!
				Is it not kind of her to leave all other visitings, that she may come to nestle
				herself here, among the very brokers, in the very centre of our misery? It is so
				heavenly-minded of her, isn't it? I guessed indeed that one great reason for her
				making such a tremendous sacrifice was the hope of edification from beholding the
				christian spirit with which your ladyship bears your ladyship's overthrow; and
				besides her own improvement from it, she wishes to have it in her power to describe
				it to the whole neighbourhood. Very right of her, isn't it, my dear? And that is the
				reason why I sent for you."
In general the nose of Lady Clarissa greatly outblushed her cheeks, which had more of
				the jonquil than the rose in them; but now, from the tip of her high forehead, to
				that of her long chin, she became crimson; and but from the remarkable length of her
				throat, which seemed to rear itself in defiance of such danger, a fit of apoplexy
				might have been expected.
"Begone! you vulgar gossip-picker!" she cried, turning in uncontrollable rage upon
				the terrified little woman, "and tell the contemptible neighbourhood through which
				you are going to crawl in your donkey-cart, like a snail in his shell, leaving your
				slime as you go, tell them all, from me, that the best consolation under my remorse
				at having forgotten my own dignity by condescending to hold a place among them,
				arises from being released from the degradation of associating with so contemptible
				a being as yourself, and all who are capable of listening to you!" And having
				uttered these words in a piercing voice, she rushed to the door, threw it with great
				violence wide open, and so left it, as she paced, with rapid but tragic strides, to
				the shelter of her own boudoir, and the sympathy of Mistress Saunderson.
It was, perhaps, because the door was open, and that he knew the sound would follow
				her, that Sir Matthew burst into the most violent shout of laughter that ever made
				itself heard from mortal lungs; it terrified Martha, made Michael Armstrong shudder,
				and caused Mrs. Gabberly herself to wish she were any where else, notwithstanding
				the very valuable information this extraordinary scene would enable her to
				communicate. Long did this frightful laugh continue, and when strength seemed to
				fail, and the boisterous merriment could be sustained no longer, a vehement and
				reiterated hissing followed, which at length ended in such complete exhaustion that
				Sir Matthew fell back pale, and apparently motionless, upon his pillow.
"Mrs. Gabberly," said Martha, "I must beg you to leave us now. You must perceive that
				my poor father ought to be alone. It is very important — fearfully important, I am
				afraid — that he should be kept perfectly quiet! Give me leave to wish you good
				morning."
 "I must say that it does seem very odd in you, Miss Martha, to persist 
				in calling me company . Good gracious! To think of the terms on which I
				have always been in this house before your poor papa's unfortunate marriage! I
				cannot and I will not leave you in such a condition. It would be perfectly
				monstrous, and every body would call me a brute for it. Till Dr. Crockley has been
				here, I really neither can nor will go. I am quite determined that I will hear what
				he says about him." 
"Let her stay," said Sir Matthew, in a hollow whisper, which proved that he was
				neither asleep nor dead, though his closed eyes, and ghastly countenance, might have
				been mistaken for one state or the other.
Martha went to him, took his hand, wiped the profuse perspiration from his brow, and
				then placing herself in a chair beside him, continued to watch his altered
				countenance, alike unmindful as it seemed of the presence of Mrs. Gabberly, or that
				of Michael either.
The lady, perfectly contented to be thus quietly established as a looker-on,
				determined, for the present, neither to move'nor speak, lest she might lose the
				valued privilege thereby; but Michael became so conscious of the awkwardness of his
				situation, and so fearful lest Martha, from forgetting him, might get into a scrape
				likewise, that he ventured to approach the foot of the bed on tiptoe, merely for the
				purpose of recalling himself to her recollection, and then, on seeing her start at
				the sight of him, he said in a whisper, "I suppose I had better go down stairs now,
				Miss Martha?"
Martha in reply to this nodded affirmatively, and in the same low tone added, "I
				shall have other business to speak to you about. Do not go away till you have seen
				me."
Michael's eyes were naturally turned to Martha while this passed; but when he
				withdrew them, and was about to make his retreat, he caught the large, wide open,
				wild-looking eyes of Sir Matthew fixed earnestly upon him. The young man
				involuntarily dropped his eyelids, for the gaze was a frightful one, and turned to
				leave the room.
"Stay!" roared a hoarse but loud and stunning voice from the bed. "Stay! devil!
				demon! hell-bird! what do you come here for? Cowardly blackguard! Do you think I do
				not know you? You never dared to come till it was too late for me to hold you! I
				have heard of your purring round the place weeks ago. But you escaped me then, base
				runaway! What do you come spying here for? Did you think I should not know ye? Did
				you think I should forget those d — d hypocritical eyes, and that hateful curly
				hair, of the devil's own colour? No, my pretty 'prentice, I have not forgotten your
				crocodile looks, and never shall. I suppose you thought you should bring me to
				repentance by sending home word that you were dead. Was that it, eh?"
 "I am able now, Sir Matthew, to pay for leaving the mill before my time, and I am
				quite ready to do it, if you please," replied Michael, gently. But he spoke to one
				who heard him not. Sir Matthew had a neck as short and thick as that of his lady was
				long and thin. His last interview with her had not been a salutary one for a man in
				his  state of mind and body; and the subsequent discovery of Michael,
				of whose visit to the factory he had heard from Parsons, and at whose escape he
				expressed the most unbridled rage, accelerated symptoms which had before threatened
				him, and sent such a rush of blood to the brain as instantly produced apoplexy, and
				left him totally deprived of sense and motion. 
Martha, whose eyes were fixed upon him, uttered a fearful shriek, and threw herself
				on the body, believing that he was dead. But Mrs. Gabberly knew better. She had
				practised too long as an amateur not to know a fit of apoplexy when she saw it, and
				promptly exclaimed, "Get away, Martha! Get off of him, child! He is not dead, I tell
				you, and, if we could but bleed him, he would open his eyes again fast enough."
With the rapidity of lightning poor Martha obeyed. She withdrew herself from the bed,
				endeavoured to raise her father in her arms, and, by the help of Michael, succeeded.
				She then bared his arm, bound her own waist-belt tightly round it, and with
				unshrinking courage had thrust a sharp penknife which she drew from her pocket into
				a vein, before the skillful lady who had prescribed the measure had half recovered
				her astonishment on perceiving that the poor girl had conceived the project of
				putting it into immediate execution.
The old adage that "where there is a will, there is a way," was never better
				illustrated than by this act of the tender-hearted and invalided Martha. She felt
				that her father's life hung on the promptness with which the operation was
				performed; she felt too, that if she shrunk from it, there was no one else who would
				perform it, and totally forgetful of herself and her own feelings conquered the
				rebellious weakness that would have held her hand, and did what two minutes before
				she would have believed it utterly impossible she could have done. The result did
				honour to the skill of Mrs. Gabberly. The lazy current flowed, though reluctantly.
				Sir Matthew opened his large eyes, rolled them from side to side, heaved a deep and
				heavy sigh, and presently attempted to speak, but this was beyond his power.
"What more should be done?" said the pale, and now trembling Martha, turning towards
				Mrs. Gabberly.
"Why now, my dear, you must just let him alone for a little bit," replied the
				physician by hereditary right. "Well now!" she added, "Wasn't it a blessing that I
				was here? If I had not staid, he would have been as dead as mutton by this
				time."
