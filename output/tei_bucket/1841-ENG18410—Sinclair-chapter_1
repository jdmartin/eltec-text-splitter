  CHAPTER I.
The newspapers have recently adopted a strange habit of sometimes unexpectedly seizing an
     individual's name, long since retired from public notice, and gibbetting it up before the
     world's eye, when least anticipated, by volunteering a paragraph to announce, that some aged
     lord, or ex-minister, whom no one has remembered to think of for half a century or more, is
     residing on his estates, and enjoying, the editor is happy to understand, astonishing health,
     considering his advanced years. In observance of this custom, an exclamation of irritability
     and astonishment, too violent to be worthy of record, was elicited one day, from a dignified
     and very distinguished-looking old gentleman, with a venerable head, such as Titian might have
     painted, and a high lofty forehead bearing the traces of deep thought and feeling, when, after
     having seated himself on his favorite arm chair at the United Service Club in Edinburgh, his
     eye rested with a look of kindling amazement on these few lines, in large consequential-looking
     type, on a leading column of the Courant.
June 1829. "We are happy to inform our readers that the brave and noble veteran,
     once a distinguished hero in many a well-fought fight, Sir Arthur Dunbar, G.C.B., is yet alive,
     reposing on his well-earned laurels, at a retired mansion in the marine village of Portobello.
     Though frequently and most severely wounded in battle, besides being deprived of an arm in Lord
     Rodney's engagement during the year '82, the Admiral's health continues unimpaired and his
     cheerfulness invariable, at the advanced age of 70."
"Pshaw! stuff and nonsense! Some enemy is resolved to make a laughing-stock of me in my old
     age!" exclaimed he, angrily pointing out the paragraph to his gay young relative, Louis De
     Crespigny, who was familiarly leaning over the high back of his chair; and then crumpling up
     the offending Courant with an obvious wish that it might be consumed in the flames—"I hope this
     is only the work of some wretched penny-a-liner; but if I even suspected that my conceited,
     good-looking scoundrel of a nephew had a hand in the jest, I would cut him off with a
     shilling,—or rather without one, for I could scarcely raise so much as a shilling to leave him,
     and he knows that. This is most thoroughly ridiculous! I, who have been dead, buried, and
     forgotten for years, to be made as conspicuous here, as a hair-dresser's wig-block! The editor
     shall be prosecuted,—horse-whipped,—or—or made as absurd as he has made me!"
"Why really, Admiral, I wish he had as much good to say of us all, and then the sooner he
     paragraphs about me the better!—'We are happy to inform our readers that the agreeable and
     fascinating Cornet De Crespigny, of the 15th Light Hussars, now in his eighteenth year, is
     still alive!'—the public likes to know the exact age of distinguished men, such as you and I,
     Admiral!"
"The public is an ass!" replied Sir Arthur, breaking into a smile; "and perhaps I am another,
     to mind what is said at all, but that rascal of an editor has made me ten years older than I
     am; besides which, though a grey-haired Admiral of sixty-four is not probably much addicted to
     blushing, he really has put my modest merit out of countenance. I would rather pay the
     newspapers any day for overlooking than for praising me. We ought to live or die for our
     country; but now, when I am no longer needed, let me stay in peace on the shelf, like," added
     he, giving a comic smile at his empty sleeve, "like a cracked tea-cup with the handle off!"
"But, Sir Arthur!" replied the young Cornet warmly, "you who never turned your back on friend
     or foe, are not very likely to remain quietly on the shelf, as long as every man who lives must
     respect you, and every man who dies continues to appoint you, as my father did, his executor,
     the trustee of his estates, and the guardian of his children, asking you to lend them a hand,
     as you have done to me in all the difficulties of life."
"I have but one hand to lend, and that is much at your service, in whatever way it can be
     useful! the other, though absent without leave, has been my own best friend, as the loss of
     that arm was the luckiest hit in the world. It obtained me a step at the time, and the pension
     has supported me ever since. What with my nephew's frantic extravagance, and my two young
     nieces being but indifferently provided for, I often wish, like every body else, for a larger
     income. Poor girls!" added Sir Arthur, knitting his bushy eye-brows into a portentous frown,
     which gave to his venerable countenance a look of noble and manly sorrow. "No one can blame
     them! but it was little short of insanity in my brother to leave such young children under the
     sole guardianship of a heartless spendthrift like your friend and my nephew Sir Patrick, who
     would sell his soul for sixpence."
"Yes! and squander it the next minute," added young De Crespigny, laughing. "I saw Pat
     produce a £20 note yesterday at Tait's auction-room, and a buzz of wonder ran all through the
     circle of his friends. Such a sight had not been seen in his pocket for many a day, and he
     threatened to put it up to auction, saying, he was sure we would all give double the value for
     it, as a rarity, considering the quarter from which it came. He really seems to pique himself
     on his poverty, and has the art of doing what another man would be cut for, with so much grace
     and apparent unconsciousness, that his friends really forget to disapprove."
"I never forget!" replied the Admiral, slowly rising and adjusting his spectacles. "I am even
     told the incorrigible rascal has mortgaged the legacy he pretends to expect from me! He would
     do anything short of a highway robbery for money, and has done some things that seem to a man
     of honor quite as bad. But," added Sir Arthur, growing more and more angry, "as long as he can
     give his friends a good bottle of claret, they ask no questions! Patrick Dunbar has caused me
     the only feeling of shame I ever had occasion for, and yet to see that proud snuff-the-moon
     look of his, you would suppose the world scarcely big enough to hold him! With his chin in the
     air, as I saw him yesterday, he will certainly knock his forehead some day against the
     sky!"
"You cannot wonder, Sir Arthur, that Dunbar is in immense favor with himself, when he is so
     admired, and almost idolized in society. He certainly has the handsomest countenance in
     Scotland;—as my uncle Doncaster says, Pat is a portrait of Vandyke in his best style. With that
     grand, chivalrous, Chevalier-Bayard look, he is the best rider who ever sat on horseback! I
     could not but laugh when he mounted yesterday for a ride along Princes Street, and turned to
     me, with his lively, victorious laugh, saying, 'Now I am going to give the ladies a
     treat!'"
"The insufferable coxcomb!" said Sir Arthur, relaxing into an irresistible smile of indulgent
     affection. "From the day he first came staggering into this world to astonish us all, he has
     thought himself the finest sight between this and Whitehall!"
"Of course he does! Pat is asked for so many locks of his hair, by various young ladies, that
     his valet keeps a wig to supply them; and he might almost pay his debts with the countless
     collection he has received of sentimental rings, displaying forgotten forget-me-nots, in
     turquoises and gold! Who, on the wide earth, except yourself, Sir Arthur, would ever dream of
     finding fault with our gay, dashing, high-spirited friend, Dunbar, the life of society, the
     model of dress, equipage, and good living. Why! the very instant he opens his lips, all dulness
     vanishes like a spectre! I wish the whole world were peopled with such men; but he promises to
     shoot himself as soon as he sees his own equal. He staked his reputation one day that he
     would!"
"His reputation!! the sooner he parts with it the better! Let Patrick Dunbar exchange his own
     with the first man he meets in the street, and he will gain by the bargain."
"Pardon me there, Sir Arthur, your nephew is universally allowed to be the best fellow upon
     earth!"
"Very probably! 'the best fellow upon earth' generally means a selfish, extravagant,
     scatter-brained roue; but I must be off! There is a cold, sharp, cutting wind, blowing in at
     the back of my neck, which makes me feel like Charles the First when the axe fell. If you have
     any influence, De Crespigny, with my scape-grace of a nephew—all nephews are scape-graces, as
     far as my experience goes—try to make him more like yourself, and I shall be grateful, with all
     my heart."
"Like me!!!" said the young Cornet, turning away with a smile; but it was a smile of
     bitterness, almost amounting to remorse, while he hastily grasped a newspaper, and flung
     himself into a seat. "No! no! Sir Arthur, he is not quite so bad as that. Dunbar has his
     faults; he wears them upon his sleeve, and attempts no disguise; but there are many worse men
     in the world, who are held up as examples by those who know no better. Whenever I reform
     myself, you may depend upon my lecturing our friend, but not till then. We must both sow all
     our wild oats first."
"Yes! and endure the fruit of them afterwards," replied Sir Arthur, with a look of anxious
     kindness at his young relative. "That is the only crop where to sow is more agreeable than to
     reap! But I waste words! Young men will be young men, and I might as well ask this east wind
     not to blow, or try to turn the sea from its course, as attempt to stop the mad career of that
     scatter-brained madcap! It would matter less if he only fell himself hereafter, like a pebble
     in the stream; but the fatal eddy extends in a wide circle, which must reach the interests of
     those helpless young girls, my nieces; and I cannot but grieve over the consequences which may,
     and must befall them, after I go to that rest which is in the grave, and to that hope which is
     beyond it."
"Never trouble your head about that which shall occur then, Sir Arthur! 'Too much care once
     made an old man grey.' My motto is, 'apres moi le deluge!' This little
     world of ours got on wonderfully well before we came into it, and will do astonishingly well
     again, after we make our exit," said young De Crespigny, with a strange medley in his tone, of
     melancholy thought, and contemptuous derision. "Pat tells me that both my young cousins promise
     to turn out a perfect blaze of beauty, with long shining ringlets that they almost tread upon
     in walking, teeth that would make the fortune of a dentist, and complexions that Rowland's
     kalydor could not improve. Ten years hence, I shall propose to one or both of them myself, if
     that will give you satisfaction."
"Perfect! but as marrying two sisters at once is not quite customary, let your intentions be
     limited to Agnes. She is several years the eldest; and I like the good old patriarchal rule of
     marrying by seniority; besides which, she is quite a little flirt already, though scarcely yet
     in her teens. She will be a young lady, entirely suited for the ordinary marrying and giving in
     marriage of every-day life; but little Marion is the very light of my eyes, and I must match
     her by a very high standard indeed. It will be a dark day for me, if ever I am obliged to part
     with her at all; and being now only in her sixth year, I may, without selfishness, hope to keep
     her beside me for my few remaining days. I must begin match-making for Agnes, however,
     directly, and your offer shall be duly considered. A future peer, with countless thousands in
     expectancy, and not particularly ill-looking, does not fall in our way every morning."
"So all the young ladies seem to think!" replied the young Cornet, in his most conceited
     tone. "Girls dislike nothing so much as to marry on a competence; there is a great deal of
     romance in marrying on nothing, and a great deal of comfort in marrying on wealth; but a mere
     vulgar competence has neither romance nor reality. Now I can offer both! First, actual
     starvation on a Cornet's pay; and then, with my uncle's leave, the pumpkin will turn to a
     carriage, and the mice into horses; but in the meantime, Sir Arthur, Pat tells me you keep a
     capital chop-house at Portobello, so pray invite me to drop in some day at six, to begin my
     siege of your pretty niece. I must come and see, before I can conquer," added Mr. De Crespigny,
     in a tone of peculiar conceit, with which he always spoke either to ladies or of them.
     "Probably next week I may find my way to this terra incognita of yours. Is it across
     the Queensferry, or where?"
"My good friend! you are not so pre-eminently ignorant of geography as you would appear; for
     did I not see you honoring that dullest of all dull places, the little obscure village of
     Portobello, with your august presence, only yesterday. I nearly spitted you on the point of my
     umbrella, you hurried so rapidly past, evidently wishing to escape from that girl in a cloak,
     who seemed to beset your footsteps!"
"Impossible!!!" exclaimed young De Crespigny, coloring violently, and starting from his seat.
     "Could it be in the nature of things that I should cut you!"
"True enough! I might have said, like Lady Towercliffe to Prince Meimkoff, 'vous m'avez coupe.'"
"Indeed!" continued the cornet, trying to conceal his countenance. "I wish you had cut my
     throat in return!"
"If it is to be done, I would rather somebody else did! Why, De Crespigny! you will set the
     house on fire with that violent poker exercise! Your own face is on fire already! Have more
     regard for your complexion! Ah! now it is pale enough! Are you ill? My dear fellow! what is the
     matter?"
"Nothing! I am merely looking at the beautiful sunset!"
"What! does the sun set in the east to-night?" asked Sir Arthur, jestingly; "that is worth
     looking at!"
"I am annoyed with a spasm of toothache!" said De Crespigny, putting a handkerchief to his
     face, which nearly covered it; and then suddenly throwing open the window, he looked far out,
     as if in search of his groom. He leaned forward so long, however, that Sir Arthur kindly but
     vehemently remonstrated on the danger of exposing himself, while in so much pain, to the cold
     air; enumerated a whole host of remedies for decayed teeth; suggested the great comfort and
     convenience of having the offender extracted by Hutchins, and ended by hoping his young friend
     would still have a tooth left for his proposed dinner at Portobello.
"Depend upon me for that," replied Mr. De Crespigny, with forced vivacity. "I shall ferret
     you out next week. I have little doubt your pasture is excellent in that quarter, and there is
     no one from whom I would be half so happy to receive a soup ticket."
"Keep your flattery for the ladies, where it will always be acceptable, and where I hear you
     are already an experienced practitioner in the arts of captivation. As for my dinner, I
     consider it an imposition to ask any friend, and not give him the best my cook and cellar can
     furnish; and you may expect whenever you do come, to find a notice over my door, 'hot joints
     every day!'"
"But it was the society of your house, and not the dinner, to which my agreeable
     anticipations were directed; and there, you know, I cannot be disappointed! as somebody wisely
     said, when shown a tempting bill of fare, 'show me a bill of the company!'"
"That reminds me to say, you must not expect my pretty niece to be at my little bathing
     machine of a house! It would not be fair to inveigle you under such false pretences; but I
     promise you an old man's welcome, and the best that my cottage can produce; aged as this
     newspaper makes me I enjoy every inch of life, and hope you, at the same age, will do the same.
     I may almost apply to my little villa that favourite saying in Spain,

'My home, my home! though thou'rt but small,
Thou art to me th' Escurial.'"

With a cordial shake of the hand, and a smile of cheerful benignity, Sir Arthur withdrew, and
     as his firm and stately step receded, Mr. De Crespigny watched him with a look of respectful
     interest, which ended in his turning away after the admiral had disappeared, and heaving a deep
     sigh, while a cloud of care darkened on his forehead, and a look of angry vexation shaded his
     previously animated eyes.
Day after day passed on, subsequent to the preceding conversation, during which Sir Arthur
     frequently postponed his chop, to what he considered an atrociously late hour, in hopes of his
     promised guest appearing. Once the admiral felt positively convinced that he had seen him enter
     a Portobello omnibus at four o'clock, but still he appeared not. Week after week elapsed, and
     still Sir Arthur ate his dinner alone, in long-surviving expectation that either his own not
     very dutiful nephew, or young De Crespigny, would "cast up;" but at last these hopes and wishes
     were ended by his hearing that Sir Patrick's embarrassments had caused him to leave Edinburgh
     by moonlight, and that, soon after, Mr. De Crespigny as suddenly departed, no one knew why,
     when, or wherefore.
