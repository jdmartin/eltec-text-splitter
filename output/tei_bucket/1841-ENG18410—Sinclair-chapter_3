  CHAPTER III.
The life of Louis De Crespigny, from the hour he entered the army, was one continued
     steeple-chase after pleasure and amusement, in whatever form they could be courted, or at
     whatever expense they could be enjoyed. At a very early age, he was already a veteran in the
     world and its ways; for he stood "alone in his glory," the most admired, courted, and idolized
     of mankind, a perfect adept in all the arts of rendering himself agreeable in society, and
     possessing many pleasant qualities, but none that were valuable. During a gay career of
     dissipation and frivolity, he had entered with successive eagerness on a thousand flirtations,
     though he always forgot to marry in the end, while his heart, like a phœnix, was frequently
     consumed, yet never destroyed, and always ready at the service of any young lady, with youth,
     beauty, and accomplishments enough to excite his temporary interest. Being of opinion, that,
     though not yet a peer, he ought speedily to be one, young De Crespigny openly avowed the
     impossibility of marrying while Lord Doncaster survived, and jocularly remarked, that it would
     be a pity prematurely to cut off the hopes of his hundred and one Scotch cousins, who lived,
     like Ernest Anstruther, on the hope, that if his neck were broken at Melton, his succession
     might yet be "cut up" amongst them; and to the friendly inquiries of his many relatives, he
     frequently replied with a condoling look, that he and his uncle were both "hopelessly
     well."
Lord Doncaster was not even yet, by any means, so great a Methusalemite in age, nor so
     weighed down by infirmities, as his lively nephew chose among the mothers and daughters of his
     intimate acquaintance to represent; and some ladies whom young De Crespigny had piqued or
     affronted, were actually ill-natured enough to hint, that Lord Doncaster was still almost young
     and almost handsome! They had even been so malicious as to insinuate, that his Lordship might
     possibly have a genius for marrying his house-keeper, almost the only respectable female who
     ever crossed his threshold; but Mrs. Fireland's very mature age, and very antiquated dress,
     shewed how completely she must have given up that point; and even her desire to please him in
     her own department, became every hour so increasingly difficult, and was attended with failures
     and disappointments so unforeseen and unaccountable, that the good woman often shook her head
     ominously, in alluding to his Lordship's numerous whims, saying, in a confidential under tone,
     which seemed to mean more than met the ear, to the steward, "he's petiklar! he's very petiklar!
     It would require a person bespoke to order to please his Lordship." And certainly he had become
     of late years more particular than ever.
One personage only seemed to have the art of doing no wrong in the estimation of Lord
     Doncaster; and the respect which he withheld from all mankind, was concentrated to an
     immeasurable degree on the Abbe Mordaunt, who was the Cardinal Wolsey of Kilmarnock Abbey and
     Beaujolie Castle. Proud, overbearing, harsh, and arbitrary, he ruled over the house, the purse,
     and even the will of his patron, with despotic and unlimited sway. Men are generally advanced
     in years before the passions and feelings have stamped their indelible traces, like the
     impression of a seal, which becomes permanent only after the wax has began to cool; but in
     every feature of the Abbe's countenance, might now be seen the evidences of a gloomy, severe,
     and almost ferocious temper, yet never was there a greater triumph of art over nature, than in
     the skill with which he adapted his looks and conversation to the taste or caprice of those
     whom it was his interest to govern, and the astonishing facility with which he could call up a
     bland smile and insinuating voice, to supersede the habitual haughtiness of his tone and
     manner.
Educated at St. Omers, in all the dark superstitions of that bigoted college, the Abbe was
     nevertheless far from desirous to seek within the walls of a cloister any protection from those
     temptations to worldly indulgence, which he had not even the wish to resist. He neither
     preached nor practised the virtues of his vocation, but paraded a whole troop of vices openly
     in the public eye; and far from attempting to reform mankind, he never attempted even to reform
     himself. Though in personal appearance of distinguished ugliness, yet such was the magic of his
     manner, that even by ladies he was considered perfectly irresistible; and to all, whether old
     or young, he generally succeeded in imparting a conviction, that he saw in her, for the first
     time, a realization of female perfection and female fascination. The Abbe was never known to
     stop half-way in arduously pursuing any object of pleasure, profit, or ambition, nor, whatever
     might be the impediments, was he ever seen to fail of success; for, like Bonaparte, he did not
     know the meaning of the word "impossible."
After having recklessly squandered, in a career of almost startling dissipation, the whole of
     his own patrimony, it was believed that he had obtained fraudulent possession of £10,000
     belonging to his very beautiful niece, to whom he must have refunded it had she lived to come
     of age, or had she married it must have been restored to her children, but about the time our
     story commences, she was supposed either to have died, or to have retired to a convent abroad,
     though whether upon conviction or not, might be considered very doubtful, as she had been
     educated by her mother in the Protestant faith, and it was generally conjectured that to so
     sudden and entire a removal from all former connections, her poverty more than her will must
     have consented. Laura Mordaunt had resided much at Kilmarnock Abbe with her uncle, to whom she
     seemed warmly and blindly attached, but the gossiping world sometimes conjectured that perhaps
     the evident partiality and admiration of Lord Doncaster might have roused in her some ambitious
     thoughts, backed by the influence of the Abbe. Among the peculiarities of the Marquis he had
     always professed a decided contempt for all respectable ladies, and therefore his attentions to
     Laura Mordaunt were at best a very questionable compliment, and became naturally of a nature
     which few relatives would have wished to encourage, yet Miss Mordaunt still remained a guest at
     Kilmarnock Abbey, till the period of her sudden disappearance, which caused so much
     astonishment among her intimate friends and near connections, that the father of Richard
     Granville, her cousin, shortly before his own death, wrote an affectionate letter, entreating
     her to return, were it but for a few months, and to make a home of his house for the future,
     should it suit her to do so; but to this kind and generous offer no reply ever came, and as all
     communications were to pass through the Abbe's hands, who alone knew his niece's direction, it
     might be doubted whether the invitation ever reached that hand for which it was intended.
That Lord Doncaster had cruelly disappointed Laura Mordaunt, as he had already disappointed
     many others, her friend and cousin had good reason to believe; and though unable to imagine any
     really romantic or lasting attachment to a man, however elevated in rank or agreeable in
     manners, of at least fifty years old, yet he knew that Laura, who lived so retired that she
     could boast of few friends and no admirers, might really have been dazzled with the splendour
     of his rank or the fascination of his conversation; while it seemed the most unaccountable part
     of the whole affair, that if such were the case, the attachment had not been reciprocal,
     between a young and beautiful girl, thrown so continually in his way, and an aged roue, who had
     so evidently admired her.
If the probable duration of Lord Doncaster's life had been measured according to the estimate
     formed of it in many an Edinburgh drawing-room, it would have brought a very small premium
     indeed at the insurance offices. By referring to that valuable record, Debrett's peerage, it
     was satisfactorily proved that the De Crespignys were a very short-lived family! One Lord
     Doncaster had died of a fall from his horse at thirty-five; another had been killed in battle,
     at forty-two; and not one of them had contrived very much to exceed eighty, therefore hopes
     might be entertained of the popular and fascinating Louis De Crespigny at last gaining the
     long-expected "step." It might have been supposed by strangers in Edinburgh, that there was but
     one marquisate in Britain, so frequently were the strawberry-leaves of Lord Doncaster under
     animated discussion; and any visitor who accidentally took Burke or Debrett in his hand, might
     smile to observe that the pages naturally fell open where that interesting paragraph presented
     itself to notice,
"Doncaster, Marquis of. Heir presumptive, Louis Henry De Crespigny."
A tradition prevailed among the elder ladies of fashion now in society, that a splendid set
     of diamonds, which had been long the ornament and admiration of Queen Charlotte's
     drawing-rooms, were since entailed, by an old Lady Doncaster, in the family; and many a young
     beauty, in arranging a bright futurity on her own plan, had frequently worn these far-famed
     jewels in her imagination, when presented at Court as a Marchioness, the envy and admiration of
     all her contemporaries. Meantime nothing could be more astonishing than to find how much was
     known in Edinburgh concerning the modes of life, temper, and character of the present Lord
     Doncaster, though he lived not only secluded from society, but made it his peculiar study to
     evade the scrutiny of impertinent curiosity, and was so anxious to check the loquaciousness of
     servants, that his butler and housekeeper had strict orders to keep up a sort of prison
     discipline in the establishment, and not to allow a word to be spoken when at meals. It was,
     however, authentically ascertained by some unknown means, that Lord Doncaster, who had formerly
     been a man of dissipated habits and irregular hours, now devoted himself to the care of his
     health as diligently and intensely as a miser does to the care of his money, and that to him it
     had become a subject of almost avaricious interest. If the Marquis had a finger-ache, it was
     magnified in Edinburgh into a case of certain death; but after a really severe illness, he was
     heard jocularly to remark, in sporting phrase, "I have had another round with death!" while he
     seemed confident, on these occasions, of always coming off victorious, though few among the
     young ladies of his nephew's acquaintance would have been found ready to back his expectations,
     while Agnes Dunbar impatiently remarked, that Lord Doncaster had been so long in the world, he
     seemed not to know how to leave it.
It was generally understood by the juries who sat upon Lord Doncaster's case in society, that
     his breakfast consisted of strong gravy-soup and poached eggs, which were pronounced to be very
     plethoric,—he ate no luncheon, which must be very exhausting at his time of life,—he had an
     enormous appetite for dinner, which would certainly drive blood to his head,—and above all, he
     took a hot supper, which must be fatal at last;—every newspaper tends to prove, that after
     eating a hearty supper the night before, people are invariably found dead in their beds the
     next morning;—and it was already unaccountable how many mornings Lord Doncaster had survived!
     Any day in the world might bring accounts of his death,—some day must do so, sooner or
     later,—hundreds of old people were dying continually, and so might the superannuated peer; yet
     though his days were numbered in so many houses, they nevertheless seemed to be numberless,
     while gentlemen, older than himself, were often heard impatiently speculating and wondering
     what will he would make, and declaring they only wished to live, in order to know the result of
     so many anxious conjectures, while his dutiful nephew gayly remarked, that his uncle need never
     wait for parchment to write his will upon, while the skin on his face looked so like it.
Still Lord Doncaster obstinately persevered in living on, while, strange to say, many of the
     manœuvring mamas who had been heard to declare, that if an old person must die at any rate,
     they could spare his Lordship better than any other mortal, became mortal themselves, and were
     first consigned to the tomb. Even some of the young and lovely girls, who had thought, in the
     morning of life, before the freshness of their bloom had been dimmed, or the lustre of their
     beauty had decayed, that this one obstacle to their happiness must be removed,—many of these
     gay, joyous, and unthinking beings had sunk unexpectedly into an early grave, while still Lord
     Doncaster, in a most provoking and unprincipled manner, disappointed everybody, and continued
     to exist in a world where he was anything but welcome, resolved apparently, never, in an
     every-day vulgar way, to die at all.
In the mean time, Louis De Crespigny, devoted to the amusements of life, but independent of
     all its finer sympathies, seemed to breathe nothing but the exhilarating ether of life, joyous,
     giddy, and intoxicating. He revelled in a laughing, lively, satirical consciousness of his own
     exact position in society, and privately resolved to make the most of it,—not that he
     deliberately made up his mind to deceive,—his code of honor was rigid enough in respect to his
     transactions with gentlemen, but in the case of young ladies it was otherwise,—

"Man, to man so oft unjust,
Is always so to woman."

With ladies Mr. De Crespigny considered his own brilliant prospects and personal fascinations
     to be fair, marketable produce, which there could be no objection that he should use to the
     utmost advantage, for bringing in the largest possible return of pleasure, profit, and
     amusement. Accordingly, the gay young Cornet, living upon what he could borrow, on the
     disinterested attentions of manœuvring mothers, and on the expectation of his uncle's speedy
     demise, made himself the chosen attendant of half a hundred accomplished and perfectly amiable
     young ladies, who laughed, talked, sang, and danced with him, while he soon became but too
     intimately known as a ruthless flirt, to many a young heart, and to many a happy home, where he
     took care that it should be distinctly implied and understood, that nothing but the jealous
     penuriousness of "that old quiz, Lord Doncaster," impeded his ardent wish to settle for life;
     while in the mean time, wherever a good table and cellar were kept, he testified exactly such a
     degree of partiality for the sister or daughter of his host, as made her be considered his
     wife-presumptive, and secured him a regular knife and fork in the house on all family festivals
     and state occasions, without any trouble in either ordering or paying for the entertainment. It
     has been said, that as a rolling stone gathers no moss, neither does a roving heart gain any
     affection; but whatever might be the case with others, Louis De Crespigny felt himself without
     a doubt the idol of every drawing-room, where he sentimentalized, rattled, and flirted in every
     style, with every girl under twenty, as diligently as if he were canvassing for an election,
     while they talked, looked, smiled, and dressed their very best; and the excellence of any
     gentleman's wine might be accurately estimated by the thermometer of Mr. De Crespigny's
     attention to the daughters; but he had a declared abhorrence of family dinners, which looked
     too business-like and domestic, as if he had really committed himself; though, as Lady
     Towercliffe remarked to her four daughters one day, "he never said anything to the purpose,
     when the purpose was marriage."
Though Mr. De Crespigny seemed, at the "dignity dinners" in Edinburgh, to live for no other
     object on earth, but the one fascinating young lady, with whom it was his game at the time to
     appear epris, and though she might probably be astonished and piqued
     during the following week, to observe this indefatigable amateur in flirtations equally
     assiduous in his attentions to another, and shooting like a brilliant meteor in the ball-room,
     unheedingly past herself, yet she might console herself by reflecting, that Mr. De Crespigny
     was in the habit of confidentially hinting how much he felt embarrassed and annoyed by the
     necessity of generalizing his intimacies, that no gossiping reports might reach his whimsical
     relative. "Because actually!" he one day whispered in confidence to Lady Towercliffe, "when my
     uncle becomes irritable, he threatens to make all sorts of ridiculous marriages himself; and it
     would be my last hour in his will, if he thought me heretic enough merely to dance with a
     Protestant partner. He would not engage so much as a housemaid of your persuasion; but for my
     own part, I leave all these concerns to the Abbe Mordaunt, who, to do him justice, lets me off
     very easily."
The difference of faith made wonderfully little difference in the intentions of those young
     ladies who believed themselves the objects of Mr. De Crespigny's unacknowledged preference, for
     every bit of millinery in a ball-room was in a flutter of agitation whenever he approached; and
     certainly no one ever excelled more in making those he conversed with rise in their own
     opinion, from his tact in showing how very high they stood in his, and the consequence was,
     that he already possessed a rare and romantic collection of sentimental valentines, sketches
     with his figure in the foreground, songs with the magical name of Louis conspicuously
     introduced, withered bouquets, anagrams, anonymous letters, and anonymous verses, all with a
     too-well-remembered history belonging to them, which called up a smile of derision, or a sigh
     of self-reproach, according as the case required, but all treasured as relics of former happy
     hours, which had perhaps been the history of a lifetime to the fair donors, and the diversion
     of a few days only to himself, while he secretly applauded his own dexterity in escaping the
     matrimonial noose, and to them there remained only the silent remembrance of that intercourse,
     now for ever at an end, which they had believed was to last for life.
Mr. De Crespigny's engagement book was nearly as complicated an affair as any ledger or
     day-book, and much more so than his own banker's account, for he arranged it on the most
     systematic principles of profit and loss. In whatever house he had been invited to dine, he
     considered himself as "owing a quadrille" to one of the young ladies at the next assembly. If
     he had actually "sat under her father's mahogany," as he termed it, she might be perhaps
     entitled to two dances; and when he had spent the greater part of a summer in her mother's
     country house, that established a sort of sinking fund in her behalf, which entitled him to
     have the use of him as a partner, whenever he happened accidentally to be disengaged, though
     indeed nothing ever occurred accidentally in Captain De Crespigny's arrangements, for he never
     acted on impulse, but always on systematic calculation. He seemed, with his gay pell-mell
     manner, the most off-hand, careless, and undesigning of men; but even in the trifling affair of
     going to a ball, where he might literally have exclaimed, "I am monarch of all I survey," he
     invariably carried in his mind's eye a list of all those partners with whom policy or
     self-interest directed him to dance, and very seldom indeed did he swerve from his
     pre-conceived muster-roll.
It was a singular evidence of young De Crespigny's discretion and skill, that, while paying
     attentions which should either have never been paid at all, or never afterwards discontinued,
     and while, with all its fascinations, Lady Towercliffe declared it was dangerous to a young
     lady's happiness to be even introduced to him, still, in not one instance had "his intentions"
     ever yet been asked, and neither fathers, uncles, nor brothers had betrayed the slightest
     symptoms of insurrection against his universal dominion, believing, as his excuse for delaying
     to propose was so perfectly unanswerable and respectable, that his intentions might safely be
     allowed to "lie on the table," while they awaited in breathless suspense the denouement, certainly to take place on Lord Doncaster's death.
Some of Mr. De Crespigny's brother officers, envious perhaps of his extraordinary success in
     society, threw out sceptical hints respecting the certainty of his succession, and laughed
     sarcastically at the indefatigable vanity with which he evidently liked being thus torn to
     pieces among the chaperons and dowagers of society; but he laughed as heartily as themselves.
     No one could ever get the start of him in a joke; and his associates, when he came in
     competition with any one of them, found it no laughing matter. He knew his own power—who does
     not know that?—and difficulties only enhanced his triumph.
Lord Doncaster often dryly remarked, that the best economist in Britain must certainly be
     Louis De Crespigny, as, to his certain knowledge, he possessed only £300 a year, and yet he
     seemed to revel in all the luxuries of life, besides having a great deal over for extravagance.
     There was no occasion for the young Cornet ever to think of dining at his club, as he might be
     entertained at the houses of three or four friends in a day, if he could have mustered as many
     appetites. In summer he incurred no expense, except to pay for his place occasionally on the
     top of a coach, or in a steam-boat, from one hospitable country house to another, where gigs
     were sent a stage to meet him on the way, if he were expected by the mail, or if by sea, a
     chariot might be seen waiting on the pier. He got "a mount" from one friend, the best seat in a
     barouche from another, and often the vacant place in a britschska from a third party, even to
     the expulsion of its more legitimate occupiers.
"De Crespigny has nothing on earth, and you see how he looks!" remarked his handsome friend
     Sir Patrick one day to Sir Arthur Dunbar; "yet how magnificently he contrives to live at the
     expense of all those deluded mortals who have disposable or indisposable daughters. His future
     prospects act like a cork jacket in society, keeping him always at the top. Last summer worthy
     Lord Towercliffe, with his rapidly increasing family and rapidly decreasing income, took De
     Crespigny in his gig to that old tumble-down castle of his in Argyleshire, where he spent six
     weeks, ruining the family in champagne and wax candles. The house became rather cold in
     September, so at last he accepted a cast in Lady Winandermere's carriage to that nest of nieces
     and daughters at Castle Highcombe, where he found excellent yachting and sea-bathing. There he
     lingered a month, till the brother of those four pretty Miss Vavasours bid still higher for his
     company, by offering him a mount at Kelso, and mentioning that he had a first-rate French cook
     a 'cordon bleu,' who hires his own stall at the opera during the London
     season, and enjoys a salary and perquisites amounting to more than the best curacy in the
     English Church; and all this De Crespigny repays with a few frothy nothings, which he is for
     ever repeating to any young lady who will lend an ear. Those who beat the bush do not always
     snare the bird; and I wonder the manœuvring world does not yet see that he is evidently no
     marrying man."
"What sort of looking individual, is a marrying man?" asked Sir Arthur, slyly. "I am often
     told that you, for instance, do not look like a marrying man; but pray point me out any one who
     does, that I may become more a connoisseur on the subject than I am. As for what you say of
     Louis De Crespigny, it sounds to my unpractised ear very like swindling; and he is not the
     youth I took him for if he live in such an element of deceit, sacrificing all sense of honor,
     all confidence, and all good feeling, for a worthless and transient popularity, or worse than
     all, for motives of mean, heartless self-interest. Such a man is not worth the space he
     occupies in the world!"
The Admiral's honest indignation would have been vented in still stronger terms, could his
     upright and honorable mind have been made to understand how entirely every thought, word, and
     action of Mr. De Crespigny's life was based on the most unswerving principles of cold, hard,
     unrelenting selfishness, and with what utter carelessness he seemed ready to trample on the
     wounded feelings of others; for it mattered not to him what degree of confidence he betrayed,
     or what degree of sorrow he inflicted. If in one house where he had been received as a son or a
     brother, he no longer found the cordial welcome of other days, a hundred other doors were still
     opened wide to receive him, where he could boast of having been "very nearly caught," and carry
     on the same game as before, which was a pastime to him, though fatal to the peace of many, who
     would willingly have died rather than betray the injury their feelings had suffered, when,
     after passing through the ordeal of his assiduities, they found themselves beguiled and cheated
     of all that was deepest and most sacred in their earthly affections—robbed without compunction
     by one who gave no return—who watched with elated triumph the growing delusion of those whom he
     had marked as victims to his own self-love, and whom he appeared to consider all in all to his
     happiness, till they found out at last that they were in reality less than nothing to him; yet
     the deception admitted of no redress. He lived on in a sort of cowardly impunity; for no young
     girl endowed with sensibility, and conscious of her own injuries, could desire, after
     entrusting him with the whole story of her hopes and affections, that the truth should be
     known; and his was a crime against which no evidence can be brought; for who could describe the
     tender nothings—the refined insinuations—the looks which say everything and mean nothing—the
     wordless language of the eyes, with which an undeclared love may be safely and yet obviously
     professed? What but a smile of ridicule or of censure could attend on such a detail of
     "unutterable things?" But with Louis De Crespigny nothing was unutterable; for he could say and
     unsay the same things two hundred times, and they always seemed to carry as much or as little
     weight as he pleased at the moment, while he entered society as a school-boy rushes into a
     garden, eagerly to pursue the brilliant insects fluttering in the sunbeams, ready to crush and
     injure them all for his momentary diversion, and yet on his guard to retreat in good order,
     should there appear to be the slightest danger of annoyance or discomfort to himself.
