  CHAPTER XXXVIII.
Sir Patrick gave instant information to the civil authorities at Harrowgate, respecting the
     dangerous madman now in the neighborhood; and when every particular of his adventure had
     reached Agnes, she felt an undefined sensation of disappointment that the end had not been of a
     more exciting nature. Never happy unless her mind were in a complete foam of excitement, she
     lived for sensation, and would have bought it at any price, being heard often to complain, that
     now nothing ever happened. Every day she considered as a chapter in her own life, into which
     she wished as many incidents crowded as possible, caring little whether joy or sorrow prevailed
     among those around, if the weary vacuum in her thoughts were but filled up. A few elopements or
     murders made a newspaper extremely acceptable; while even public riots she would have allowed
     to a certain pitch, provided she could pull the check-string as soon as they became at all
     inconvenient or alarming to herself; while she often remarked, in a querulous tone, that a
     revolution had been a thing threatened and talked of all her life, without ever seeming any
     nearer. The world, in short, if arranged to suit her taste, would have been one shifting scene
     of accidents and offences, fires, overturns, explosions, narrow escapes, marriages, births,
     deaths, mournful catastrophes, and astonishing vicissitudes.
On the evening after the pic-nic at Studley, Sir Arthur having gone early to bed, at his
     lodgings near the Granby, Marion accompanied her sister and Mrs. O'Donoghoe, to fulfil a dinner
     engagement at the Crown Hotel; and on their way home, the lively widow rallied Agnes on her
     prospect of walking at the next coronation, saying, that Lord Doncaster had evidently laid down
     twenty years of his life, lately; and that she had once seen the Doncaster diamonds, then
     considered the finest family jewels in Britain, which Queen Charlotte herself was supposed to
     have coveted, and the box containing which required two footmen to carry it.
"The tiara would shine like glow-worms in your dark hair, and the bandeau round your waist
     would be exquisite! I have heard it remarked, that people in this perverse world will not be
     happy; that those who have every wish gratified, and not a want upon earth, invent a grievance
     for themselves, and live upon it; but I wonder where the Marchioness of Doncaster could find
     one. You might drive away care in that beautiful pony carriage, kill time with your grand
     pianoforte, and read your own happiness in the envy of every one around. Even your sister seems
     scarcely so happy at your good fortune as might have been expected!"
"There is no earthly blessing I do not with my whole heart desire for Agnes," replied Marion
     warmly, when thus appealed to. "But if she has any plans such as you speak of, let no one ask
     me what I think, as it is quite enough that she should herself know my utter abhorrence of
     them."
Tears of indignant sorrow sprang into Marion's eyes, and she gazed earnestly out of the
     window, trying to conceal and to conquer her emotion, while Mrs. O'Donoghoe exclaimed, in a
     tone of satirical burlesque,

"For of the choice, what heart can doubt,
Of tents with love, or thrones without!"

As their carriage drove on, the night being clear and moon-lit, the wind sweeping over the
     earth with a rushing sound, and ten thousand stars twinkling in the blue vault above, Agnes
     remarked, in accents of surprise, that crowds of people were running eagerly on the road, with
     animated looks, and an appearance of most unusual excitement. Soon after she heard a rumbling
     noise behind, as of some heavy vehicle hurtling and thundering along the road; and the next
     moment a fire-engine passed at full speed, amidst the cheers and vociferations of a dense
     multitude, who assisted and followed its progress, with looks of mingled curiosity, delight,
     and apprehension.
Marion hastily thrust her head far out of the carriage, and perceived that a lurid glare
     burned on the sky, evidently reflected from High Harrowgate, while bright spiral flames shot
     upwards into the flaming arch above, and burning flakes of fire descended in showers of
     terrifying brilliancy. Every now and then a fresh burst of dazzling light blazed to the very
     heavens, while Marion watched the flickering flames with intense and solemn interest; but
     Agnes, after the first surprise was over, sank lazily back into the carriage, saying, with a
     look of peevish disappointment,
"It is only a fire somewhere! Fires are so common now, that they excite scarcely any
     sensation! One might fancy, Marion, that you had a valuable uninsured house at High
     Harrowgate!"
"It looks, even at this distance, very awful!" replied Marion. "The hills are like molten
     fire, while the broad red reflection on those massy clouds makes the very heavens seem on fire!
     What gleams of fiery light! What sheets of flame! It is fearfully grand! We should pray, Agnes,
     that no lives may be lost!"
"Fires are never fatal now! Years ago, they were said to be sometimes really frightful; but
     now any one I ever saw might be extinguished with a tea-cup. I never so much as read the
     accounts in one of the newspapers. We shall of course be asked to subscribe for the sufferers,"
     added Agnes, in a tone of contemptuous pity, "poor creatures!"
"What a strange look of terrified enjoyment is depicted on the countenances of all who hurry
     past," exclaimed Marion. "It is curious, that probably some of those people who are ready to
     risk their lives in extinguishing the flames, would yet feel quite disappointed and ill-treated
     on arriving, to find that there was actually no conflagration. There are no limits to the love
     of excitement. When people have made up their great minds to a catastrophe, they feel really
     cheated if it does not occur; and I often think, that old people especially wish their few
     remaining days to be crowded with events, like the last pages in a novel."
The noise and the mob had greatly increased: loud shouts, hoarse yells, and clamorous cries
     of fire resounded on every side, with the heavy trampling of a hundred feet, when suddenly Sir
     Arthur's coachman whipped the horses violently, and proceeded forward with unprecedented
     rapidity, till Marion fancied the horses must have taken fright at the ignited sparks, which
     were now borne along in the air, and that maddened with terror, they were actually running
     off.
Agnes, now really in a state of excitement, thrust her head again out of the window,
     believing that the coachman must be drunk, and that a catastrophe, though not exactly what she
     would have selected, might actually occur, and Marion continued anxiously gazing around, till
     gradually a horrid sensation of doubt and fear gathered upon her mind, as she looked in the
     direction from which the light came. The curtain of night was withdrawn—the surrounding scene
     seemed one mighty furnace—and the roaring noise of the flames was now distinctly audible. At a
     turn of the road the whole became distinctly visible; and Marion, suddenly uttering a wild cry
     of horror and amazement, covered her face with her hands, and sank back, almost fainting, in
     the carriage; for she had at once become aware that the fire must be among the houses where Sir
     Arthur lodged. The garden around them was one vivid blaze of burning light—the stems of the
     trees were visible in dark relief, on a drapery of fire—while a brilliant pillar of flame, like
     a gigantic serpent, twirled its enormous coils upwards into the very sky. Forked flames
     appeared bursting from every window, and sweeping over the whole house, which was one great
     reservoir of fire, while a black volume of smoke rolled far away to the distant horizon.
"Is there no mistake?" exclaimed Marion, wringing her hands with terror, and bending her head
     almost to her knees in unendurable grief. "Is there no hope? Tell John to drive on
     faster—faster! O let me out—let me fly to the house! This is dreadful! fearful! Shall we never
     reach the spot! Listen to their cries! Let me out! let me out!"
"Dear Marion! there are crowds giving assistance! He must have escaped," said Agnes, in
     trembling accents. "I feel certain he has escaped. He has surely heard the noise, and called
     for help!"
A dense mass of persons round the crashing house, wild with agitation, and vehement in their
     attitudes and gestures, prevented the carriage from advancing farther; but Marion instantly
     opened the door, sprang out, and with an impetuosity which nothing could resist, rushed
     onwards. She was not one whose faculties could be prostrated by terror or danger; for it was
     then that her quick judgment and generous spirit became most active; and while crowds were
     standing around, in vacant, helpless wonder, she reached the spot where a tottering ladder had
     been placed against the walls, and where the engines were playing upon the blazing roofs, while
     flames spouted forth in every direction, and a confused din of cries and vociferous oaths
     became audible on every side.
Timid and easily frightened on slight occasion, all emotion now appeared to be dead within
     the breast of Marion, who paused, while, with bloodless cheek, and a face as rigid as death,
     she seemed turned into stone; yet every word whispered around fell with frightful distinctness
     on her ear.
"The last house that caught fire is uninhabited, I believe?" asked a stranger, calmly. "I am
     informed that the whole conflagration was raised by a madman—a perfect Guy Fawkes, who
     afterwards escaped. There are crowds of servants belonging to the heiress Miss Howard, and he
     had some scheme of carrying her off; but most mercifully she and her attendants were all
     saved."
"Very fortunate indeed, as the stair-case is now falling in," added another, while crash
     followed crash in frightful succession. "Some one talked of a blind gentleman being there, but
     that is probably a picturesque addition, to give the story interest, for that tall house seems
     really empty."
At this moment, a low murmur of grief and horror arose among the crowd, followed by a
     death-like silence. In a part of the building high above what had yet been consumed by the
     flames, though already undermined, the shutters of a window were slowly opened, the sash
     hastily thrown open, and the venerable figure of Sir Arthur appeared there, his grey hair
     streaming in the wind, and his head stretched forward in the act of listening. He raised his
     hand to his forehead, as if bewildered, and seemed evidently calling for help; but his feeble
     voice was lost amid the war of elements, the crackling and blazing of all around, and the loud
     crash of falling timber.
No one had a hope of his being rescued, and the most selfishly indifferent looked on with
     breathless dismay, while Agnes threw herself on the grass in an agony of horror and despair;
     but Marion rapidly grasped her hand with convulsive energy, saying, in a low deep whisper, "I
     shall save him, or die with him."
Using the speed of thought she flew forward, while every voice was raised in loud shouts to
     stop her; and several persons, as soon as they became aware of Marion's rash intentions,
     followed vehemently in pursuit, determined to force her back; but eluding their grasp, she
     wrapped her large cloak around her, and ascended the crackling beams of the staircase, beneath
     a shower of glowing sparks, while blazing flames were running round the cornices and ceiling,
     with a sound like incessant thunder.
The smoke nearly blinded her—the smell of burning wood became suffocating—and the heat was
     nearly unbearable. Long wreaths of fire and smoke soon shut Marion out from the view of those
     who followed, and none could pursue with their eyes the fearful progress of her enterprise,
     while she hurried onwards, having one only thought in her heart, that Sir Arthur, blind and
     alone, was calling for help, and might yet perhaps be saved. A wooden gallery, leading from the
     stair to Sir Arthur's room, though fringed with an intense and devouring flame, which had
     almost entirely burned it away, showed yet a plank remaining close to the wall, charred and
     blackened, while shrivelling and crackling in the devouring element. Over this Marion quickly
     but cautiously glided; and opening the Admiral's door, she tried to compose her voice, saying
     in a clear, distinct tone—
"I am here, uncle Arthur! come away quickly! give me your hand!"
"What is the matter, Marion? What is all this?" replied he, turning round with a quivering
     lip, and in a tone of piercing agitation. "The blessings of your blind and helpless uncle be
     upon you! I am so agitated and confused! Where is the fire? Every body had forgotten me but
     you!"
"Uncle Arthur!" answered Marion, hurrying with him towards the door, where they were almost
     suffocated by a dense cloud of dust and smoke; "you were always brave and determined. All our
     courage is necessary now. Be firm and we may escape. You are now at the door. This wooden
     gallery is nearly burned away. It could not sustain us both, and no earthly power shall
     persuade me to go first. You can only impede me by speaking of it. Lose not a moment, then, for
     that will but increase our danger. Cling close to the wall; feel it all the way. I shall call
     out when you are safely over. Then remember the fifty steps we always counted to the first
     landing-place. After that, turn to the right, and you are safe. May the Almighty protect and
     guide you!"
"But Marion! my dear child! you are coming this way too?"
"Yes! or perhaps some other!" said she, assuming a tone of indifference, while she
     despondingly gazed at the rapidly consuming beam, and the thick smoke, which arose like mist
     before her sight.
"Go on, dear uncle, and pray for yourself and me."
Marion led Sir Arthur to the very brink of the yawning gulf, and cautiously placed him on the
     tottering gallery, deaf to his entreaties that she would seek her own safely first, and
     imploring him not to render her enterprise unavailing by delay. Flames were leaping upwards in
     the dark abyss beneath, dust and mortar fell in clouds on every side, while the heat and noise
     of the flashing light became more and more terrific; but still she spoke calmly to him, in
     tones of confidence and encouragement, giving directions while he remained in sight, and
     anxiously watching, as he slowly and cautiously groped his way. All Sir Arthur's firmness of
     look and voice had now returned, as he questioned or thanked her, when suddenly a deafening
     crash took place over head, an impending fragment of the roof was precipitated with a roaring
     convulsion upon the spot where a moment before the Admiral had stood, and nothing now remained
     beneath the eye of Marion but a hideous gulf of smoke and ruins, one bewildering medley of
     crackling beams and falling floors, a mighty mass of horror, which it made her giddy to
     behold.
Marion ceased now to speak, fearful that her voice might induce Sir Arthur, if yet alive, to
     return; and nearly hopeless of his having escaped, she now felt that no duty was so imperative,
     as, if possible, to seek her own safely. Yet what resource remained? Her heart beat hurriedly,
     stopped and beat again, while a choking sensation arose in her throat, when for the first time
     she fully contemplated her own instant danger. The noise was like that of a mighty wind, while
     the flames swept the very heavens, with a sound more appalling than the loudest thunder, and
     she hurried almost breathlessly back to Sir Arthur's apartment, which had not yet been attacked
     by the devouring element.
The heat was even there so intense, that she hastened to a window for air, and a shuddering
     groan burst from the surrounding multitude when they beheld her; but no succor was near, while
     the door became instantly blockaded by shivered beams and smouldering ruins, which had fallen
     at the entrance, setting it on fire, and she saw around long aisles of flame, and deep caverns
     filled with surges of fire and smoke.
Marion felt now that death impended in its most terrifying form. It was no new thing with her
     to prepare for the certain approach of dissolution; yet often as she had tried to realize the
     idea of that mighty change, never did it appear before with the appalling distinctness, which
     now filled her spirit with unutterable awe, while standing as it were between earth and heaven,
     all beneath full of boundless terror, but all above promising peace, and full of hope.
No effort of her own could avail. Marion looked at the long line of tall houses on her left,
     untouched by the flames. She glanced at the crowd below, all anxiously gazing upwards, in
     death-like stillness, and at the garden, which seemed paved with faces; but while the consuming
     flames pursued their desolating track, not a hope of rescue appeared. A storm of burning ashes
     fell on every side, and all around was a whirlwind of fire and smoke.
Marion's figure became conspicuously seen at the window, every pane of which was already so
     heated by the blazing conflagration behind, that she leaned against the shutters, and gazed
     towards heaven, as if already lost to all connection with the world around.
"Martyrs have willingly died in a scene like this," thought she. "Let me also testify the
     faith in which I die."
Marion clasped her hands, while now her spirit rose superior to danger, and, seeing the
     hundreds gazing at her in silent, horror-struck sympathy, she calmly pointed upwards, that all
     might remember the comfort derived from a hope full of immortality.
The heat had become so intense, that Marion, choked almost to suffocation, leaned farther
     than ever out of the window, trying to catch one breath of air, when to her astonishment she
     now perceived the figure of a man descending from the window of a house far to the left, and
     having planted his foot on a narrow ledge of stone, which ran along all the buildings as an
     architectural ornament, he pressed his hands firmly against the wall, to preserve his balance,
     and, with a degree of skill and intrepidity scarcely to be credited, rapidly traversed that
     shelf towards the place where she stood, carrying one end of a rope in his hand, the other
     extremity of which had been already fixed to the window from which he came out.
"Marion! dear Marion!" cried the voice of Richard Granville, which even at this awful moment
     thrilled to her heart with deep emotion, "we must live or die together. Trust yourself to me!
     Here is a firm footing. Try it! At the worst you cannot be in greater danger than now."
While yet speaking, he had securely fixed the rope to the window-frame, thus forming a
     temporary balustrade, and after carefully assisting her out, he slowly led Marion with one hand
     on the rope, and her face to the wall, safely towards a house as yet untouched by the fire.
A low, whispering murmur of intense interest arose among the spectators, when they saw hopes
     of her being preserved, but not a voice was raised till they perceived her safe, when a
     deafening cheer burst from the spectators, which rang through every ear like a trumpet. Again
     and again it resounded, louder and louder still, but Marion heard it not, for no sooner was she
     out of danger, than, with a cry of thankfulness, she rushed into the expanded arms of Sir
     Arthur, and fainted.
When Marion recovered to consciousness, her first evidence of returning life, was the deep
     blush with which she extended her hand to Mr. Granville. Tears now streamed from the blinded
     eyes of Sir Arthur, while he spoke to her with every term of affectionate endearment, saying,
     in a voice that yet quivered with emotion—
"My child! my dear Marion! I thank God that your life, young and full of hope, has not been
     sacrificed to keep my grey hairs a few hours longer from the grave. Would that I were able to
     thank you as you deserve."
"Never thank me for anything, dear uncle Arthur. I owe you more than my existence, for I owe
     you, under Providence, all the happy days I have ever known in it, and long, long, may I be
     able to show you my grateful affection."
"My very dear girl, aged as I am, and shattered now by this night's alarms, I have little
     more hold of life than of the gale that blows along the ocean, but existence would yet be
     precious to me, if I could only live to see my Marion as happy as she merits."
"Already I am!" replied Marion, affectionately embracing her uncle, while a torrent of
     joyous, agitated tears rushed into her eyes. "I am too happy, dear uncle Arthur! You are saved,
     we are restored to all we love, and my life is doubly precious to me, preserved by the generous
     courage of—of——"
"Of one whose first earthly wish is to render it happy," said Mr. Granville, warmly. "I trust
     that for many long years we shall testify together our gratitude to God for the mercies of this
     night."
A smile and a tear struggled hard for the mastery in Marion's downcast countenance, while
     Richard continued to speak with confidence and hope of the happy future, trusting that their
     engagement, though unavoidably postponed, could not be long delayed, and that if Clara
     recovered in a more favorable climate, to which she must set out the next evening, he might
     speedily return, to resume his duties and occupations, with new motives of hope, while Sir
     Arthur expressed, in brief and powerful language, his fervent wish that nothing might interfere
     with a prospect which secured the happiness of his beloved Marion.
"Yet," observed Sir Arthur, next morning, when Mr. Granville called to take leave, "I dislike
     long engagements, and never would recommend one. If you both remain constant, it is
     unnecessary, and if either of you change, it would be little worth to obtain from a sense of
     honor what should only spring from affection."
"There is nothing to fear on that score," replied Mr. Granville, exchanging a smile with
     Marion. "We are most apt in general to doubt where we have most at stake, but I have lately
     become almost presumptuously confident. I would not wish, Sir Arthur, that Marion should feel
     engaged one hour after she ceased to love me more than she could love any other, or if there
     were any man on earth who could value her more, and make her happier. One thing I ask of you,
     dear Marion, and only one," added he, his eyes flashing with animation—"That till we meet
     again, nothing shall make you doubt my unalterable affection; and in asking this, I ask only
     what I intend in return towards you, that our mutual confidence may be for ever unbroken, from
     the first hour we met."
"To trust you once is to trust you for ever," answered she, in a low, scarcely audible voice.
     "All my happiness in life depends on one, who, I am certain, never will change."
"Then, as surely as day follows night, I hope our present parting shall be followed by a
     happy re-union; and months will seem like hours, till I return to claim you as my own, till I
     once more hear your voice, and till this hand is again clasped in mine."
Marion listened with a quivering smile on her lip, while a tear trembled in her eye. For a
     moment, the blood forsook her cheek, and returned again in rushing torrents over her whole
     countenance, while the eloquence of the heart was in her eyes, though she attempted not to
     reply; and Mr. Granville continued, in accents of the deepest tenderness,—
"It grieves me more and more every day to think of leaving you, but my duty to Clara must not
     be postponed any longer. Her strength is gradually diminishing, and though she does not idly or
     selfishly indulge her feelings, yet here, above all places, she seems least likely to forget a
     sorrow, which is, I trust, not incurable. We, who are Christians, know that there is some good
     purpose in her affliction, and that the lightest straw which casts its balance into our lot, is
     ordained by the infinite power, and the infinite goodness of One who cannot err."
"Yes," replied Marion. "In going through life, I feel myself reading a book by the best of
     all authors. Many of the incidents, as we advance, surprise and disappoint us; but, knowing
     that the whole is on a plan which could not be improved, we feel certain that all shall turn
     out right and best in the end."
"It is a conviction such as you describe, Marion, which allays the torturing and almost
     feverish anxiety I should otherwise suffer respecting those around whom my warmest affections
     are kindled," observed Mr. Granville. "Religion is indeed the best of all anodynes for pain of
     every kind; otherwise, who can tell how greatly I should have suffered in our sorrowful
     uncertainty respecting Clara's recovery, and in leaving you, my Marion, to whom I am now bound
     by every tie that can unite heart to heart. I will not,—I cannot say, farewell; but let us live
     in hope of better days to come."
Mr. Granville at length took leave; and, as he hurried for the last time across the common,
     Marion leaned against the window, and followed him with her eyes till he vanished out of sight;
     while Sir Arthur's countenance shewed that his kind heart was full of anxiety and sorrow; for
     he had seen many vicissitudes in human life and human attachment, therefore he trembled for the
     possibility of sorrow hereafter, to one whom he loved with all the unbounded warmth of his
     nature.
Marion closed her eyes that night with the pleasing conviction, that the world contained not
     a happier being than herself. She felt conscious how much Mr. Granville had elevated her mind
     by his conversation, what a treasure of interesting thoughts and pleasing hopes he had left
     her; and, while following him in imagination through every mile of his journey, and sadly
     counting the many days that must intervene till they could meet again, she resolutely turned
     her mind towards all the pursuits and occupations calculated to render her worthy of Richard
     Granville, when he returned to claim her as the partner and companion of his future
     existence.

"Discerning mortal! do thou serve the will
Of time's Eternal Master, and that peace
Which the world wants, shall be to thee confirm'd."
