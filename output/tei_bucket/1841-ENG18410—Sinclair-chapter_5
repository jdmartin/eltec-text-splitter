  CHAPTER V.
The day of trial at length arrived, and the court, from the roof to the floor, seemed one sea
     of faces, crowded together like the "studies of heads" on a painter's canvass. During the legal
     investigation, which was conducted with deep solemnity and anxious perseverance, the mystery
     became still deeper, and more inscrutable. No appearance of a robbery could be observed, except
     that the finger of the lady's hand, on which a wedding ring had probably been worn, was much
     bruised and discolored, as if, immediately after her decease, it had been violently torn off;
     and a vain attempt had evidently been made to snatch away a gold chain hung round her neck, to
     which was appended a small broken miniature frame, set with brilliants, and adorned with what
     seemed to represent a very antique coronet. The portrait which it once enclosed, had been, with
     obvious difficulty removed, as the marks were visible all round, of some sharp-pointed
     instrument having been inserted in the frame, to which there still adhered several broken
     fragments of glass.
Sarah Davenport, who had been fully committed for trial, on suspicion of being an accomplice,
     refused to give any references as to character, and was strongly suspected of habitually
     concealing her real name, and of more than once assuming those that were fictitious, as her
     clothes and linen appeared to be marked with various initials, but in not one case did they
     bear those that she pretended were her own. It was evident that she labored under a powerful,
     but forcibly-subdued excitement; yet, with a tone and manner externally cold and hard as
     Siberian ice, she persisted in professing her own perfect innocence, and her utter
     consciousness of anything that might by possibility lead to a discovery of the perpetrators.
     She coldly, and almost calmly, threw back glance for glance, on the spectators nearest her, who
     were keenly watching every turn of her countenance, while dark surmises, and fearful
     conjectures, were whispered in murmurs of horror on every side; but at length her eye wandered
     to a distant part of the court, when suddenly a livid paleness flashed upon her face—an
     indescribable but startling lustre glittered in her eyes—her whole frame shook, as in the
     coldest blast of winter, and with a suppressed groan of agony and fear, she bowed her head upon
     her hands, and sunk fainting upon the floor. At the same time, a man was observed hastily to
     leave the court, and, gliding with rapid steps through the narrow passages, disappeared, before
     any of those who stood near had presence of mind to stop him, or could even identify his
     appearance.
Nothing apparently touched the feelings of Sarah Davenport, except when a suspicion seemed to
     be implied that she meant to injure the boy; and when a question to this effect was put to her
     by the court, she wrung her hands and burst into tears, saying, in accents of piercing anguish,
     though with a shudder as if death were upon her, "No! oh, no! Who suspects that I would injure
     a hair of his head! He once loved me! Few—few but he, ever did!—none that have not afterwards
     given me reason to hate them! I am a solitary, lost, and desolate being; but let him not forget
     in after years, that I saved his life!—that I saved it at a risk you never can conceive!"
An impulse of mournful interest and astonishment ran through the assembled multitude, when
     they beheld the rare and singular beauty of the child, after he was led into court; and it
     seemed as if the spectators had ceased to breathe as soon as he began to answer some of the
     questions which were skilfully put, to draw out his recollections of past times, and especially
     the dark history of the last few weeks. He was at first shy and intimidated, but gradually
     regained an unexpected degree of self-possession, and spoke with a surprising degree of
     intelligence and distinctness of all he remembered.
The boy retained a faint recollection of having been awakened, on the night of the murder, by
     some violent scene of strife and horror; but his faculties had evidently been so benumbed by
     opiates, that no distinct impression remained; and to his own young mind, the whole seemed like
     a fearful dream, too dreadful to look back upon even yet, except with bewildering terror. He
     gave a clear account, however, of the last evening he had passed with his mother, of whom he
     spoke in accents of infantine affection, evidently unable yet to conceive that he should see
     her face no more.
An old gentleman, he said, had come into the room and spoken angrily to her; while, with
     astonishing precision, the boy acted over the whole scene, recapitulated some of the language
     they had used, and described how his mother had hung to him with frantic eagerness, saying she
     would promise anything, if she might only retain her child; how the stranger, who was very
     tall, and wore a black coat, had spoken again with angry vehemence before he left the room; and
     how his mother, when left alone, had prayed and wept over him with looks of agonized and
     desolate grief, until he had been carried away to bed by the maid, who administered some
     medicine to him, which she said the doctor had ordered.
He spoke much also of a large room, hung with pictures, in which his earliest days had been
     passed, and of a small dark apartment close beside it, into which he had often been
     precipitately hurried, apparently for concealment, and where toys and sweetmeats had been
     always provided to keep him quiet, while he was punished with the utmost severity, for making
     the slightest noise; and he still remembered with looks of apprehension, the gentleman dressed
     in black, who most frequently visited him there, and often caused his mother to weep
     bitterly.
Sarah Davenport was then recalled, and rigidly cross-examined, respecting the gentleman who
     had visited at the house; but she doggedly asserted her entire ignorance respecting his rank in
     life, or connections, and pertinaciously maintained that the lady's death had been her own
     voluntary act, and that the sleeping potion had been given to the boy by his mother's own
     imperative orders, as she did not herself know even what it contained.
During a long and anxious consultation of the jury, there was a hushed and intense silence in
     the court, so still and unbroken, that the breathing of an infant would have been audible,
     while every eye perused the countenance of the prisoner, with an intensity that brought a
     hectic flush, burning like fire, upon her cheek, and she gazed around with a glance of anger
     that caused her beauty for the moment to look like that of a fiend or a fury.
At length, after arduously scrutinizing every atom of evidence that could be gathered, the
     jury, though morally certain of the prisoner's being an accomplice in the crime, felt
     unwillingly obliged to bring in a verdict of "not proven," and she was immediately liberated,
     after which, amidst the yells, jeers, and execrations of the populace who were convinced of her
     criminality, she hurried from the court, and was seen no more.
Nothing is half so attractive as a mystery, and many crowded at first, with a temporary
     enthusiasm, to see the beautiful boy, so strangely bereaved, and so cruelly abandoned; but the
     interest and excitement of hearing and relating his story were soon superseded by greater
     wonders and fresher news. In a world where all are rushing on headlong in pursuit of novelty,
     and where events, great or small, are speedily hurried into one common oblivion, people were
     tired at last of thinking or talking about young Henry and his concerns.
Every one of the Admiral's friends hinted that he could have managed the whole affair ten
     times better than Sir Arthur; all blamed him for many things, and praised him for very few; the
     Admiral was wondered at, criticised, discussed, admired, pitied, and censured, more than he
     remembered to have been for many years before; and the givers of advice were lavish of
     propositions and objections, all which were borne by their venerable friend with good-humored
     indifference, whether adopted or not. At length some perfectly new murders from London came on
     the tapis in society; those who liked reading in the Jack Sheppard style were satiated with
     studies from the life; the Mording Post assumed a terrifying interest; and the lady of fashion
     who consulted Sir Henry Halford about her appetite, because she could no longer enjoy her
     murders and robberies at breakfast, would have thought, when they were coming out hot and hot
     every week, that it was a wearisome repetition to speculate another hour upon a murder nearly a
     month old.
In short, "the Portobello story" ceased to be told or listened to. Henry had had his day.
     There is no such thing now as a nine days' wonder, because nothing lasts so long. Young De
     Lancey had been talked of as much as any reasonable being could expect to be talked of; and now
     it was universally voted a bore whenever the subject occurred in conversation; for, as Lady
     Towercliffe remarked, with a very long-drawn yawn, when, for the last time, it was alluded to
     in her presence, "It was a shocking, barbarous, and really startling affair; but all stories
     should be allowed to die out like an echo, which grows fainter and fainter at every repetition.
     One cannot be for ever talking of the same thing."
When Henry De Lancey lost one parent, he certainly gained another in Sir Arthur, who often
     afterwards remarked, that in no instance could virtue be more obviously its own parent, than in
     the case of any kindness he had shown to this fascinating boy, whose gay, joyous spirits became
     a source of perpetual amusement to him, while the Admiral seemed to derive new life from
     watching the frolicsome gambols of his young companion, occasionally enlivened by the gleeful
     vivacity of his niece Marion, when she escaped a single day from the trammels of school,
     bringing generally in her train two of her favorite juvenile companions, Clara Granville and
     Caroline Smythe, both several years older than herself.
On many occasions the sensibility of Henry De Lancey seemed already to have attained almost
     the depth and intensity of manhood, so strong were the bursts of natural feeling with which he
     occasionally spoke or acted, while it was deeply affecting to trace throughout the
     extraordinary progress thus early made in his education, the careful culture given to his
     remarkable abilities—the pains bestowed by his solitary parent to strengthen his mind for
     future difficulties and sorrows, the earliest and worst of which she could so little have
     foreseen or apprehended.
With considerable thoughtfulness of character, however, and natural integrity of mind, which
     Sir Arthur was delighted from the first to remark, yet, when the merry group of young friends
     assembled together on the shore of Portobello, building houses of sand, or running eagerly in
     search of shells, it would have been difficult to say which was the most carelessly happy,
     while the Admiral seemed to borrow their young spirits for the time, and gazed with ceaseless
     delight on those joyous countenances, radiant with laughter and smiles, which were archly
     turned towards their aged playmate, sometimes with a challenge to run after them, or lighted up
     with smiles of affection when they brought him a bouquet of his favorite flowers, torn roughly
     from the stems, and crumpled in their little hands.
Sir Arthur often seemed almost ashamed to betray the engrossing interest and delight he felt
     in his young companion, who gained every day a stronger hold upon his affections, and it
     appeared as if he were anxious to forget that a time had ever existed when the playful and
     interesting boy was unknown to his heart; but a circumstance occurred, not long after Henry's
     adoption, which brought painfully to mind, with greatly increased solicitude, the fearful
     mystery that hung over his origin, proving also that danger still threatened him from some
     unforeseen quarter.
While the whole party of his young guests were noisily engaged on the shore in a game at
     hide-and-seek, one day in the month of July, Sir Arthur had seated himself on a bench within
     sight of them, sometimes watching their gambols with pleasure, and frequently conning over a
     newspaper, which proved by undeniable and satisfactory demonstration, that the country was
     entirely ruined—that the Government was coming to an end—that the Houses of Lords and Commons
     would be completely demolished—that the ministry had not another day to exist—and, as a grand
     climax, that anarchy, confusion, bankruptcy, and revolution, were about finally to drop their
     extinguisher over Great Britain. Sir Arthur had read the same thing in different words every
     day during fifty years, and under twenty varied administrations; yet still the wonder grew, how
     a constitution so mismanaged could so long survive, and that when all was wrong at the head of
     the country, it still had a leg to stand on. The Admiral's patriotic meditations had been
     several times interrupted by repeated complaints from the little girls, that Henry had hid
     himself so well, that they could not possibly find him; but he was too much pre-occupied to
     give the subject much attention, till at length Martin announced that the children's dinner had
     waited some time, and that still the boy was not to be found, though his companions had been
     searching for him at least half an hour.
Upon hearing this, Sir Arthur hastily started up, making a considerable expenditure of
     energetic and wondrous explanations, while he gazed around with increasing surprise at the wide
     waste of sand, like an Arabian desert, with which he was on every side encompassed, and where
     it seemed to him as if a mouse could not be long concealed.
A hasty and most anxious search was instantly commenced in the garden, while Sir Arthur and
     Martin shouted the name of Henry at the full pitch of their voices, but in vain; not a sound
     was heard in reply, nor was there a spot unexamined in which he could by possibility be
     lurking.
The Admiral now became seriously alarmed at so unaccountable a disappearance, especially when
     the child's gardening tools, with which he had been last observed, were found mutilated and
     broken, at a great distance, on the beach—one of his shoes had fallen off close to the water,
     and his hat lay nearly buried in the tide. Sir Arthur instantly summoned the police to his aid,
     but the search continued fruitless, till at length the dreadful conjecture became more and more
     probable, that Henry must have rashly ventured into the water, and been washed away by the
     waves—in pursuance of which apprehension Sir Arthur summoned more assistance, that the water
     might instantly be dragged.
Martin, meantime, no less active than his master, had accidentally met a stranger on the
     beach, who mentioned, on hearing of his alarm, that on the road to Leith, half an hour before,
     he had observed a boy struggling and screaming in the arms of a female, dressed like a
     nursery-maid, who complained loudly that the child would not go home, when a young man, rather
     strangely dressed, and of very singular appearance, had instantly offered his assistance, and
     carried him forcibly onwards. This gentleman said he had stopped the woman to remonstrate with
     her on using the boy so roughly, as a cap was drawn over his eyes, and he seemed to suffer
     agonies of terror, sobbing convulsively, and trembling in every limb; but the man had answered
     in reply, with a strong Irish accent, that he would see the child safe to his friends, and let
     no one do the poor boy "a taste of harm." The stranger added indifferently, that it was no
     affair of his, therefore he ceased to interfere; but he thought both the man and the woman had
     a very bad expression, and he would not trust either of them with his dog for an hour, to use
     it kindly.
Without wasting time in returning to communicate what he had heard, Martin hurried forward to
     Leith, where, with reckless speed and untiring diligence, he threaded all the narrow streets,
     and elbowed his way among carts, carriages, parcels, and passengers, till at length he reached
     the pier, to which he had been so eagerly aiming his steps. At its farthest point stood a
     smoking steam-boat in full boil, while men and women, boxes, packages, bags, and trunks were
     pouring in; and at length, as he breathlessly approached within some hundred yards, an
     arbitrary little bell was rung, to summon stragglers on board, and to hurry stragglers
     away.
A single plank, connecting the steam-boat with the pier, was on the point of being withdrawn,
     when Martin approached; and while he paused, in momentary hesitation whether to pursue his
     almost hopeless search, the steward peremptorily desired him to hasten on board instantly, if
     he were coming at all, as not a moment more could be lost.
At this moment a cry, almost amounting to a scream of childish joy, became audible on the
     deck—a young boy was seen vehemently struggling in the arms of a female; and in an instant,
     pursued by a man who vainly endeavored to overtake him, he rushed past the steward, ran across
     the temporary bridge, and clasped Martin round the knees, exclaiming, with eager incoherent
     exclamations of almost hysterical delight, "Take me, Martin! take me! O let me go home to Sir
     Arthur! I did not come away without leave! I did not, indeed! That naughty, horrid woman forced
     me! She tied a cap over my face, and would not let me go back! I have been so frightened and so
     sorry," added the child, bursting into tears, and sobbing as if his heart would break; "I
     thought Sir Arthur would be angry, and I thought, perhaps, I would never see him again! O take
     me home, Martin! take me home! and let me never see these people again!"
The boy put his hand, with an air of happy confidence and security into that of Martin, who
     snatched him up in his arms, with a thousand expressions of joyful surprise; but a moment
     afterwards, when he recollected himself, his first impulse was to secure the culprits who had
     decoyed Henry away, and to deliver them up to a magistrate for examination. With this
     intention, he looked hastily around, intending to cause their immediate apprehension; but the
     steam-boat had sailed off; and all the gesticulations he could make to bring them back only
     caused the steward laughingly to shake his head, thinking that Martin had merely missed his
     passage, as he deserved, for not showing more alacrity in obeying his injunctions to
     embark.
At Portobello, meantime, Sir Arthur had suffered agonies of grief, and even of self-reproach,
     thinking he had too securely relied on the safety of his young protege; and with a heavy heart
     he was still directing his steps, and conducting his assistants to the most probable places for
     finding the child's body, having already ordered his maid to have everything in readiness, in
     case a chance remained of his being restored to life, when he felt a gentle pull at the skirt
     of his coat, and, on looking down, he uttered a volley of joyful exclamations, on beholding the
     radiant countenance of Henry, whom he clasped in his arms with unutterable joy. While Martin
     and the boy himself gave each his own history of the strange adventure, Sir Arthur walked up
     and down in a state of irrepressible irritation, clenching his teeth, and grasping his
     walking-stick firmly in his hand, as if about to wreak instant vengeance on the miscreants. At
     length, after exhausting his indignation, he took Henry again in his arms, declaring he would
     never for a moment lose sight of him again.
Nothing in Henry's narrative threw the slightest gleam of light on the plans or intentions of
     the strange man and woman, which seemed destined to remain buried in impenetrable obscurity.
     They had evidently been accomplices in decoying him from home; and the boy had brought away
     from the steam-boat a small book which they had given him, full of ribald songs and profane
     jests, but covered with magnificent boards, and clasped with silver hinges, which seemed to
     have once belonged to some ancient missal, and still retained in the inside a collection of
     texts beautifully written in a very remarkable hand, which seemed to be that of a
     highly-educated female.
For some time afterwards, several suspicious-looking people were seen lurking about Sir
     Arthur's premises, late at night; and one evening a shot was fired suddenly in at the
     drawing-room window, which passed so near to Henry's head, that his hair was actually
     disturbed; but though an active police had been placed on the watch, not a trace could be
     obtained of the authors of this outrage.
As time wore on, and the mind of Henry rapidly expanded on all subjects of classical learning
     and general science, the fearful and melancholy events of his early years faded considerably
     from his mind, while he made astonishing progress at the excellent school where Sir Arthur
     placed him, exhibiting that happy, but rare combination of deep thought, and refinement of
     mind, with extreme liveliness of fancy, and enthusiasm of character. This threw a perfect
     witchery over his conversation, which sparkled with vivacity, or flowed with uncommon depth and
     power, as best suited the occasion, while at the same time, during his intercourse with Sir
     Arthur, he became imbued with the highest principles of honor and good-feeling; and from his
     master he imbibed the most enlightened knowledge of the doctrines and duties of Christianity,
     with the profoundest reverence for its precepts and practice.
Sir Arthur felt a dreary blank during Henry's absence at school, which became more and more
     intolerable as his eyesight was at length nearly extinct; and he had serious thoughts of
     engaging a person to walk out with him during the day, and to read to him during the evening,
     being of opinion that it is the highest wisdom, as well as the best Christianity, cheerfully to
     meet every appointed privation, and derive from the blessings that remain, as much enjoyment as
     they can afford.
Sir Arthur often remarked to his friend, Lady Towercliffe, that it is a misfortune to wear
     out a taste of any inoffensive occupation; and he began to fear it might be possible for him to
     survive his enjoyment of reading. "In my long life," he observed, "I have myself travelled all
     the travels described by others, thought all the thoughts, and felt all the feelings. If I read
     such a book as Robertson's America, for instance, the question forces itself upon me, 'what the
     better would I be of knowing this whole volume by heart!' The time was once, when a romance
     carried me off into another existence altogether, and I seemed to awaken as from a dream, when
     called back to the ordinary business of life; but now I can anticipate from the first page, the
     whole denouement of every novel, and never for an instant forget my own
     identity in reading the story."
"It is a shocking symptom of advancing years," said Lady Towercliffe. "But you must wait till
     I publish."
"Yet," continued Sir Arthur, "there is one volume always new, in which I never can tire of
     reading my own heart and character; and in the Bible, the descriptions of eastern countries are
     so like what I have observed myself of the scenery, customs, and manners, that they fill me
     with recollections and associations that are of endless interest."
No sooner had Sir Arthur mentioned incidentally, to Lady Towercliffe, and several friends,
     that he would willingly give a handsome salary to a person of good reading and writing
     abilities, than it seemed as if all the meritorious young men in Scotland happened at that very
     time to be looking out for precisely such a situation; and it made Sir Arthur almost melancholy
     in examining testimonials, which ought to have procured any one of them a bishopric, to think
     that so many admirable youths, of learning and talents, were ready to sacrifice themselves for
     a mere home, and a pittance of £50 per annum!
No situation ever became vacant in the memory of man, for which Lady Towercliffe had not some
     protege exactly suited; and no sooner did she hear that Sir Arthur required a secretary and
     reader, than she wrote him a note of seven pages, closely penned, in which she made it evident
     that there was but one individual in the world who could suit, or ought to suit, and that one
     individual was the bearer of her despatch, who waited below for an answer.
It appeared that, with all her zeal in the cause, Lady Towercliffe knew very little of the
     young man she so vehemently recommended; but having accidentally met him in a bookseller's
     shop, he had been employed by her to copy some verses in an album, and she thought him, without
     exception, one of the most civil and grateful creatures in the world, who really deserved
     encouragement.
When Sir Arthur sent for Mr. Howard up stairs, his kind heart was almost shocked at the tone
     of wild energy, and the look of feverish anxiety with which he entreated that his capabilities
     might be tried. His figure, though youthful, was tall, gaunt, and meagre, while his care-worn
     countenance, which bore a stern and melancholy aspect, was lighted up by large, dark, flashing
     eyes, in which there gleamed an expression of singular excitement. He appeared young and
     handsome, but not prepossessing—so gloomy and determined was the expression of his
     firmly-compressed mouth, that it seemed almost indicative of ferocity; and his eye had that
     peculiarity invariably expressing evil—an impossibility of looking any one steadily in the
     face.
"You see me under great disadvantage, Sir Arthur; friendless, homeless, and poverty-struck,"
     said Mr. Howard, with a look of eager, deprecating solicitude, which spoke at once to the
     generous heart of the Admiral, and filled him with commiseration. "Fate and fortune have
     hitherto frustrated my efforts, and weighed me down with life-crushing sorrows; but only give
     me employment, and I would not thank the Queen to be my cousin!"
It was a favorite saying with Sir Arthur, that he would be more ashamed to suspect mankind,
     than to be deceived by them; and if he had a weakness in the world it was a total incapacity to
     give pain. Touched by the nervous excitement in Mr. Howard's eye and manner, which he
     attributed entirely to his necessitous circumstances, he almost immediately engaged him, to the
     entire satisfaction of Lady Towercliffe, who never asked or cared any more about her protege,
     gratified that he had achieved "a job," and that by her interest, and hers only, a place in the
     world had been filled up, which would have been occupied by some one else, perhaps equally
     deserving, if she had not interfered, and she was satisfied for the present to have been of
     consequence to somebody, no matter whom.
Mr. Howard generally spoke in a subdued, mysterious voice, as if afraid to let himself know
     what he was saying; yet sometimes his words came forth with a rushing impetuosity, full of
     energy and fire, like lightning itself. His hollow, blood-shot eyes, betrayed a wild, watchful,
     suspicious expression, by no means prepossessing; and there was something inscrutable in the
     bland, perpetual smile he always wore upon his countenance, and in the frozen tranquillity of
     his manner, which occasionally, though seldom, gave way to bursts of tempestuous emotion. The
     very pupils of his eyes seemed to have become darker, with a fearfully wild and ferocious
     expression when irritated, while the fierce fire flashed out from beneath his lowering brows,
     with a blaze of inexpressible fury; yet in a moment he could command himself again into a cold,
     calm, and almost haughty exterior, while the spectral paleness of his handsome countenance made
     him look like marble itself.
Years passed on, during which Sir Arthur endured, rather than enjoyed, Mr. Howard's
     attendance, whose pre-occupied air and vague manner continually annoyed him; but his benevolent
     heart shrunk from consigning the poor man to that hopeless and solitary want which he seemed to
     apprehend must inevitably follow the loss of his present situation, and from day to day he
     postponed the decision, till habit grew into second nature, and he became so accustomed to hear
     "The Times," column after column, spouted forth in a rather theatrical tone by his reader, and
     to dictate notes and letters to his very silent and diligent secretary, that he almost forgot
     at last to think of parting with him.
When Henry returned for the first time from school, six or seven months after Mr. Howard had
     become domesticated at Portobello, the secretary professed a vehement fancy for the boy, would
     fetch and carry for him like a tame dog, and loaded him with attentions; yet, though in general
     most affectionately grateful to all who showed him even a trifling kindness, these assiduities
     and flatteries were lavished upon him in vain. The boy shrunk instinctively from Mr. Howard's
     notice, but could assign no other reason to himself or others for this apparently unreasonable
     antipathy, except merely that the stranger resembled somebody he had seen before, but how,
     when, or where, not a trace remained in his memory. This little caprice did not appear to be
     noticed or resented by the secretary, till one day, when Henry refused some bon-bons which Mr.
     Howard offered him, saying, the last he accepted had made him sick, and when the boy soon after
     flew gaily out of the room, Marion was for a moment startled and surprised to observe the
     malignant scowl with which the eye of Mr. Howard followed Henry. It was a glance, fell and
     malignant, that feared to be seen, while his cheek became pale as death, but whether in anger
     or in sorrow, Marion thought it impossible to divine.
As Henry grew older, his instinctive dread of Mr. Howard seemed only to increase, but he was
     too considerate to disturb the tranquillity of Sir Arthur by mentioning it, or to injure the
     poor man himself, by giving way to a feeling of dislike so unaccountable, and yet so perfectly
     unconquerable; but at length, after many years of such prudent self-restraint, when nearly
     grown up to manhood he could not help saying one day, in a careless tone, to the Admiral, after
     witnessing a sudden outbreak of temper in Mr. Howard that morning,
"Your secretary always reminds me, Sir Arthur, of Sinbad's Old Man of the Sea. It seems
     impossible to get handsomely rid of him, and he will never certainly make a voluntary
     departure!"
"I fear not!" replied the Admiral, with something between a smile and a sigh. "He does all I
     desire him, but without interest or pleasure, and he has the most undisguised contempt for
     every living being, almost amounting to hatred, yet he expresses unbounded gratitude for being
     harbored in my house. What can I do? It would be cruel to kick the man out of doors, merely
     because he is unhappy; but I have often observed, Henry, that he is no favorite of yours,
     though that is the only subject on which you have never been entirely open with me."
"Because I am heartily ashamed of my feelings, Sir Arthur, and you are the last person on
     earth to whom I wish to tell anything against myself. You have told me there are people with a
     loathing antipathy to cats, and somewhat similar is the shuddering sensation with which I see
     your worthy secretary enter the room. A sort of shiver comes over me, and a wish to keep him
     off—to avoid his very glance and touch. He has a strange under-look certainly! His smile makes
     me shudder! and yet the feeling is quite undefinable! They say dogs and children have an
     instinctive liking or antipathy to those who secretly like or hate them, and perhaps my
     sensation is on somewhat similar grounds.
"There is something fearful in the eye of Mr. Howard, occasionally, when I catch it fixed
     upon myself," added Henry rapidly, but in a sort of musing, absent under-tone, while his voice
     acquired a deeper tinge of thought, "I seem to have beheld him once in a dream! When he looks
     at me in that strange and extraordinary manner, his eyes like the flickering glare of light in
     a gloomy cavern, I feel and know that at some period in my life I have seen such a countenance
     before! The time and place have escaped me, but the remembrance is painful, and in his presence
     I cannot but be convinced that I am in the presence of an enemy. It is a feeling I can neither
     drive away, nor distinctly realize!"
"Why did you never tell me this before, Henry?" asked the Admiral, rising with agitation. "He
     has been hardly dealt with by fortune, but surely you do not think——"
"Think!!—; I think nothing, Sir Arthur, for I know nothing, and I ought not to have spoken as
     I have done,—it was wrong and rash. I shall try to conquer this,—to conquer myself,—and, as
     they say, acquired tastes are always the strongest, I may yet learn to like Mr. Howard better
     than any one living; but, in the mean time, Sir Arthur, he does occasionally look to me, very
     like some stray member of the Lunatic Asylum!"
"I sometimes think," said Sir Arthur, "that Howard has a bee in his bonnet."
"He has a whole hive of bees in his bonnet!" replied Henry in his usual off-hand tone; but
     when he looked round, as is usual, when people are spoken of, the individual himself, Mr.
     Howard, stood before him. A mortal paleness had overspread his countenance, contending emotions
     seemed flitting across his lowering brow, like shifting clouds in a threatening sky, and his
     eye gleamed upon young De Lancey with a look of maniacal fury; but the same artificial smile
     was on his lips which he habitually assumed, while, in the blandest tone of courtesy, he turned
     from the steady penetrating gaze of Henry to Sir Arthur, saying, in a tone of servile cunning,
     but with a smile the most ghastly that was ever seen on a human face,
"Every fool can find fault, but my livelihood fortunately depends not on any boyish caprice.
     It is derived from the generosity of a noble mind, unbiassed by cruel and unfounded prejudices,
     which may, however, yet be my ruin. A small leak sinks a great ship, and even you, my
     benefactor, may hereafter be influenced by the opinion of one who avowedly hates me, though
     without cause,—I should have little to dread if he were like you, but then who is? Come what
     may, however, you deserve and shall ever retain my undying gratitude and attachment. I have met
     with little kindness in life, and am never likely to forget that little, from whatever
     benevolent heart it comes. In this bleak, desolate, most harsh and cruel world, you are now my
     only friend."
"Those who have deserved friends, Mr. Howard, are seldom so entirely destitute of them!" said
     Sir Arthur, with a certain tone of interrogation in his voice, for he abhorred the slightest
     approach to flattery, and always had an instinctive apprehension that it was accompanied by
     deceit. "We are too ready often to throw the blame upon human nature, when our own individual
     nature is to blame. For my own part, I have met with little unkindness or ingratitude hitherto,
     and would willingly look upon the sunny side of life, hoping all things, and believing all
     things, of mankind in general, and of yourself among the number."
The darkened sight of Sir Arthur prevented him from perceiving that in the countenance of Mr.
     Howard there flitted a quick succession of emotions, fiery and vivid as summer lightning, but
     Henry observed with astonishment the powerful though ineffectual efforts he made to control his
     agitation. His hands were clenched, till the very blood seemed ready to spring; he gnawed his
     nether lip with frightful vehemence, and his eyes shot fire from beneath his dark and frowning
     brow. With a glance of unspeakable malevolence at Henry, and a hurried bow to Sir Arthur, he
     hastened with rapid steps out of the room, and subsequently out of the house.
"If there be a madman out of bedlam, Sir Arthur, that is he!" exclaimed Henry, following with
     his eyes the rushing steps of Howard, as he crossed the garden. "Before I go to college, let me
     hope you will dismiss him. Give the man a trifling pension, or do anything for him, rather than
     trust yourself in his hands, for I am mistaken, indeed, if he is not a bad and dangerous
     man."
"Before you return here, I may perhaps be able to find some other situation for him; but he
     has done nothing yet, Henry, to forfeit my protection, and I scarcely think he would live, if I
     dismissed him. He has drank a bitter cup of wretchedness, and without principle or hope, he has
     more than hinted to me, that death itself will be his resource if I turn him adrift. It was a
     well-meant officiousness of Lady Towercliffe to force him upon my good offices, and I cannot
     yet see any easy way to relieve myself of the charge, without causing more distress than I can
     reconcile myself to occasioning."
"He is certainly a strange, mysterious being," replied Henry, wishing to turn off a subject
     which he saw was agitating Sir Arthur with perplexity; "but Mr. Howard is not probably the only
     man on earth whom in the course of my existence I shall not be able to comprehend."
