CHAPTER XXIII.
CONVALESCENCE.
Very slowly did Emily recover, for the blow had been more than she could bear: nothing but
     religion gave her any chance at all: and the phials, blisterings, bleedings, would have been in
     vain, in vain—she must have died long ago—had it not been for the remembrance of God's love,
     resignation to His will, and trust in the wisdom of his Providence. But these specific remedies
     gradually brought her round, while the kind-eyed doctors praised their own prescriptions: and
     after many rallyings and relapses, delirious ramblings, and intervals of hallowed Christian
     peace, the eye of Love's meek martyr brightened up once more, and health flushed again upon her
     cheek.
She recovered, God be praised! for her death would have been poor Charles's too; and the same
     grave that yawned for her and him would have closed upon their father also. Even as it was,
     when she arose from off the weary bed of sickness, it was to be a nurse herself, and watch
     beside that patient, weak old man. He could not bear her out of his sight all the fever
     through; but eagerly would listen to her hymns and prayers, joining in them faintly like a
     dying saint. With the saddening secret, which had so long pressed upon his mind, he seemed to
     have thrown off his old nature, as a cast skin: and now he was all frankness for reserve, all
     piety for profaneness, all peacefulness for blusterings and wrath.
He remembered then poor Julian and his mother: taking blame to himself, justly, deeply, for
     neglected duties, chilling lack of sympathy,
     and that dull domestic sin, that still continued evil of unnatural omissions—stern
     reserve. And he would gladly have seen Julian by his bedside, to have freely forgiven the lad,
     and welcomed him home again, and begun once more, in openness and charity, all things fair and
     new: but Julian was not to be found, though rewards were offered, and placards posted up, and
     emissaries from the Detective Police-force sought him far and wide. Alas! the bold bad man had
     heard with scorn of his father's penitence, and knew that he would gladly have received
     him;—but what cared he for kindnesses or pardons? He only lived to waylay Emily.
As for Mrs. Tracy, she was seldom in a state to appear; but one day she managed to refrain a
     little, and came to see her husband, almost sober. I was, authorially speaking, behind the
     door, and saw and heard as follows:
The old man, worn and emaciate, was weakly sitting up in bed, and Emma by his side, with the
     Bible in her lap: she casually shut it as the mother entered.
"Well, Miss Warren, there's a time for all things; but this is neither morning, noon, nor
     night: nor Sunday either, nor holiday, that I know of; it's eleven o'clock on Tuesday, Miss—and
     I think you might as well leave the general at peace, without troubling him for ever with your
     prayer-books and your Bibles."
"Jane, my dear, I requested it of Emily; come and sit by me, and take my hand, wife."
"Thank you, sir, you are very obliging: not while that young woman is in the room.—You ought
     to be ashamed of yourself, General Tracy."
Poor Emmy ran away to weep. It seems that, in her delirium, she had spoken many things, and
     the servants blabbed them out to Mrs. Tracy.
"Ah, my poor wife, indeed I am: both ashamed and sorry—heartily sorry. But God forgives me,
     Jenny, and I hope that you will too."
"Upon, my word, general, you carry it off with a high hand: and, not content, sir, with
     insulting me in my own home by bringing here your other women's children, you have expelled
     poor dear, dear Julian."
"Jane, if you will remember, he ran away himself; and you know that now I gladly would
     receive him: we are all prodigal sons together, and if God can bear with us, Jane, we ought to
     look kindly on each other."
"Ha! that's always the way with old sinners like you—canting hypocrites! Be a man, General
     Tracy, if you can, and talk sense. I never
     did any harm or sin in all my life yet, and don't intend to: and my poor boy
     Julian's well enough, if they'd only let him alone; but nobody understands his heart but me.
     Good boy, I'm sure there's virtue enough left in him, if he loves his mother."—If he
     loves his mother.
"Jane, dear, I sent for you to kiss you; for I could not die in peace, nor live in peace
     (whichever God may please), without your pardon, Jane, for a thousand unkindnesses—but,
     especially for the sin that gave me Emily. Forgive me this, my wife."
"Never, sir!" rejoined that miserable mind; and fancied that she was acting virtuously. She
     thrust aside the kindly proffered hand; scowled at him with darkened brow; drew up her
     commanding height; and, calling Mrs. Siddons to remembrance, brushed away in the indignant
     attitude of a tragedy queen.
Emmy ran again to her father, and the vain bad mother to her bottle; we must leave them to
     their various avocations.
