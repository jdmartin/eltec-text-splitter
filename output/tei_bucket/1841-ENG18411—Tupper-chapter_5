CHAPTER V.
JEALOUSY.
For Julian soon perceived that Charles was no despicable rival. At first, self-flattery, and
     the habitual contempt wherewith he regarded his brother, blinded him to Emily's attachment:
     moreover, in the scenes of gayety and the common social circle, she never gave him cause to
     complain of undue preferences; readily she leant upon his arm, cheerfully accompanied him in
     morning-visits, noon-day walks, and evening parties; and if pale Charles (in addition to the
     more regular masters, dancing and music, and other pieces of accomplishment) thought proper to
     bore her with his books for sundry hours every day, Julian found no fault with that;—the girl
     was getting more a woman of the world, and all for him: she would like her play-time all the
     better for such schoolings, and him to be the truant at her side.
But when, from ordinary civilities, the coarse loud lover proceeded to particular attentions;
     when he affected to press her delicate hand, and ventured to look what he called love into her
     eyes, and to breathe silly nothings in her ear—he could deceive himself no longer,
     notwithstanding all his vanity; as legibly as looks could write it, he read disgust upon her
     face, and from that day forth she shunned him with undisguised abhorrence. Poor innocent maid!
     she little knew the man's black mind, who thus dared to reach up to the height of her
     affections; but she saw
     enough of character in his swart scowling face, and loud assuming manners, to make
     her dread his very presence, as a thunder-cloud across her summer sky.
Then did the baffled Julian begin to look around him, and took notice of her deepening love
     of Charles; nay, even purposely, she seemed now to make a difference between them, as if to
     check presumption and encourage merit. And he watched their stolen glances, how tremblingly
     they met each other's gaze; and he would often-times roughly break in upon their studies, to
     look on their confused disquietude with the pallid frowns of envy: he would insult poor Charles
     before her, in hope to humble him in her esteem; but mild and Christian patience made her see
     him as a martyr: he would even cast rude slights on her whom he professed to love, with the
     view of raising his brother's chastened wrath, but was forced to quail and sneak away beneath
     her quick indignant glance, ere her more philosophical lover had time to expostulate with the
     cowardly savage.
Meanwhile, what were the parents about? The general had given out, indeed, that he had
     brought Emily over for schooling; but he seemed so fond of her (in fact, she was the only thing
     to prove he wore a heart), that he never could resolve upon sending her away from, what she now
     might well call, home. Often, in some strange dialect of Hindostan, did they converse together,
     of old times and distant shores; none but Emily might read him to sleep—none but Emily wake him
     in the morning with a kiss—none but Emily dare approach him in his gouty torments—none but
     Emily had any thing like intimate acquaintance with that moody iron-hearted man.
As to his sons, or the two young men he might presume to be his sons, he neither knew them,
     nor cared to know. Bare civilities, as between man and man, constituted all which their
     intercourse amounted to: what were those young fellows, stout or slim, to him? mere accidents
     of a soldier's gallantries and of an ill-assorted marriage. He neither had, nor wished to have,
     any sympathies with them: Julian might be as bad as he pleased, and Charles as good, for any
     thing the general seemed to heed: they could not dive with him into the past, and the sports of
     Hindostan: they reminded him, simply, of his wife, for pleasures of Memory; of the grave, for
     pleasures of Hope: he was older when he looked at them: and they seemed to him only living
     witnesses of his folly as lieutenant, in the choice of Mrs. Tracy. I will not take upon myself
     to say, that he had any occasion to congratulate himself on the latter reminiscence.

So he quickly acquiesced in Julian's wish for a commission, and entirely approved
     of Charles's college schemes. After next September, the funds should be forthcoming: not but
     that he was rich enough, and to spare, any month in the year: but he would be vastly richer
     then, from prize-money, or some such luck. It was more prudent to delay until September.
With reference to Emily—no, no—I could see at once that General Tracy never had any serious
     intention to part with Emily; but she had all manner of masters at home, and soon made
     extraordinary progress. As for the matter of his sons falling in love with her, attractive in
     all beauty though she were, he never once had given it a thought: for, first, he was too much a
     man of the world to believe in such ideal trash as love: and next, he totally forgot that his
     "boy, or boys," had human feelings. So, when his wife one day gave him a gentle and triumphant
     hint of the state of affairs, it came upon him overwhelmingly, like an avalanche: his yellow
     face turned flake-white, he trembled as he stood, and really seemed to take so natural a
     probability to heart as the most serious of evils.
"My son Julian in love with Emily! and if not he, at any rate Charles! What the devil, madam,
     can you mean by this dreadful piece of intelligence?—It's impossible, ma'am; nonsense! it can't
     be true; it shan't, ma'am."
And the general, having issued his military mandates, wrapped himself in secresy once more;
     satisfied that both of those troublesome sons were to leave home after the next quarter, and
     the prize-money at Hancock's.
