CHAPTER II.
The political agitation which for a year and a half had shaken England to its
       centre, received if possible an increase to its intensity and virulence, when it was known in
       the early part of the month of May, 1832, that the Prime Minister had tendered his
       resignation to the King, which resignation had been graciously accepted.
The amendment carried by the Opposition in the House of Lords on the evening of the 7th of
       May, that the enfranchising clauses of the Reform Bill should be considered before entering
       into the question of disfranchisement,
        was the immediate cause of this startling event. The Lords had previously
       consented to the second reading of the Bill with the view of preventing that large increase
       of their numbers with which they had been long menaced; rather indeed by mysterious rumours
       than by any official declaration; but nevertheless in a manner which had carried conviction
       to no inconsiderable portion of the Opposition that the threat was not without
       foundation.
During the progress of the Bill through the Lower House, the journals which were looked
       upon as the organs of the ministry, had announced with unhesitating confidence, that Lord
       Grey was armed with what was then called a carte blanche to create any number of
       peers necessary to insure its success. Nor were public journalists under the control of the
       ministry, and whose statements were never contradicted, the sole authorities for this
       prevailing belief.
Members of the House of Commons, who were strong supporters of the cabinet, though
        not connected with it by any official tie, had unequivocally stated in their
       places that the Sovereign had not resisted the advice of his counsellors to create peers, if
       such creation were required to carry into effect what was then styled "the great national
       measure." In more than one instance, ministers had been warned, that, if they did not
       exercise that power with prompt energy, they might deserve impeachment. And these intimations
       and announcements had been made in the presence of leading members of the government, and had
       received from them at least the sanction of their silence.
It did not subsequently appear that the Reform ministers had been invested with any such
       power; but a conviction of the reverse fostered by these circumstances had successfully acted
       upon the nervous temperament, or the statesman-like prudence, of a certain section of the
       peers, who consequently hesitated in their course; were known as being no longer inclined to
       pursue their policy of the preceding session, and who
        had thus obtained a title at that moment rife in everybody's mouth—the title of
       " the Waverers ."
Notwithstanding therefore the opposition of the Duke of Wellington and of Lord Lyndhurst,
       the Waverers carried the second reading of the Reform Bill; and then scared at the
       consequences of their own headstrong timidity, they went in a fright to the Duke and his able
       adviser to extricate them from the inevitable result of their own conduct. The ultimate
       device of these distracted councils, where daring and poltroonery, principle and expediency,
       public spirit and private intrigue, all threw an ingredient in the turbulent spell; was the
       celebrated and successful amendment to which we have referred.
But the Whig ministers, who, whatever may have been their faults, were at least men of
       intellect and courage, were not to be beaten by "the Waverers." They might have made terms
       with an audacious foe; they trampled on a
        hesitating opponent. Lord Grey hastened to the Palace.
Before the result of this appeal to the Sovereign was known, for its effects were not
       immediate, on the second morning after the vote in the House of Lords, Mr. Rigby had made
       that visit to Eton which had summoned very unexpectedly the youthful Coningsby to London. He
       was the orphan child of the youngest of the two sons of the Marquis of Monmouth. It was a
       family famous for its hatreds. The eldest son hated his father; and, it was said, in spite,
       had married a lady to whom that father was attached, and with whom Lord Monmouth then
       meditated a second alliance. This eldest son lived at Naples, and had several children, but
       maintained no connexion either with his parents or his native country. On the other hand,
       Lord Monmouth hated his younger son, who had married against his consent a woman to whom that
       son was devoted. A system of domestic persecution, sustained by
        the hand of a master, had eventually broken up the health of its victim, who
       died of a fever in a foreign country, where he had sought some refuge from his creditors.
His widow returned to England with her child; and, not having a relation, and scarcely an
       acquaintance in the world, made an appeal to her husband's father, the wealthiest noble in
       England, and a man who was often prodigal, and occasionally generous. After some time and
       more trouble, after urgent and repeated, and what would have seemed heart-rending,
       solicitations, the solicitor of Lord Monmouth called upon the widow of his client's son, and
       informed her of his Lordship's decision. Provided she gave up her child and permanently
       resided in one of the remotest counties, he was authorised to make her in four quarterly
       payments, the yearly allowance of three hundred pounds, that being the income that Lord
       Monmouth, who was the shrewdest accountant in the country, had calculated a lone woman might
        very decently exist upon in a small market town in the county of
       Westmoreland.
Desperate necessity, the sense of her own forlornness, the utter impossibility to struggle
       with an omnipotent foe, who, her husband had taught her, was above all scruples, prejudices
       and fears, and who though he respected law, despised opinion, made the victim yield. But her
       sufferings were not long; the separation from her child, the bleak clime, the strange faces
       around her, sharp memory, and the dull routine of an unimpassioned life, all combined to wear
       out a constitution originally frail, and since shattered by many sorrows. Mrs. Coningsby died
       the same day that her father-in-law was made a Marquess. He deserved his honours. The four
       votes he had inherited in the House of Commons had been increased by his intense volition and
       unsparing means to ten; and the very day he was raised to his Marquisate, he commenced
       sapping fresh corporations, and was working for the strawberry
        leaf. His honours were proclaimed in the London Gazette, and her decease was not
       even noticed in the County Chronicle; but the altars of Nemesis are beneath every outraged
       roof, and the death of this unhappy lady, apparently without an earthly friend or an earthly
       hope, desolate and deserted, and dying in obscure poverty, was not forgotten.
Coningsby was not more than nine years of age when he lost his last parent; and he had then
       been separated from her for nearly three years. But he remembered the sweetness of his
       nursery days. His mother too had written to him very frequently since he quitted her, and her
       fond expressions had cherished the tenderness of his heart. He wept very bitterly when his
       schoolmaster broke to him the news of his mother's death. True it was, they had been long
       parted, and their prospect of again meeting was vague and dim; but his mother seemed to him
       his only link to human society. It was something to have
        a mother, even if he never saw her. Other boys went to see their mothers; he at
       least could talk of his. Now he was alone. His grandfather was to him only a name. Lord
       Monmouth resided almost constantly abroad, and during his rare visits to England had found no
       time or inclination to see the orphan with whom he felt no sympathy. Even the death of the
       boy's mother, and the consequent arrangements, were notified to his master by a stranger. The
       letter which brought the sad intelligence was from Mr. Rigby. It was the first time that name
       had been known to Coningsby.
Mr. Rigby was a member for one of Lord Monmouth's boroughs. He was the manager of Lord
       Monmouth's parliamentary influence, and the auditor of his vast estates. He was more; he was
       Lord Monmouth's companion when in England, his correspondent when abroad—hardly his
       counsellor, for Lord Monmouth never required advice; but Mr. Rigby
        could instruct him in matters of detail, which Mr. Rigby made amusing. Rigby was
       not a professional man indeed, his origin, education, early pursuits, and studies, were
       equally obscure; but he had contrived in good time to squeeze himself into Parliament, by
       means which no one could ever comprehend, and then set up to be a perfect man of business.
       The world took him at his word, for he was bold, acute, and voluble; with no thought, but a
       good deal of desultory information; and though destitute of all imagination and noble
       sentiment, was blessed with a vigorous, mendacious fancy, fruitful in small expedients, and
       never happier than when devising shifts for great men's scrapes.
They say that all of us have one chance in this life, and so it was with Rigby. After a
       struggle of many years, after a long series of the usual alternatives of small successes and
       small failures, after a few cleverish speeches and a good many cleverish pamphlets, with a
       considerable reputation indeed for pasquinades, most of which
        he never wrote, and articles in reviews to which it was whispered he had
       contributed, Rigby, who had already intrigued himself into a subordinate office, met with
       Lord Monmonth.
He was just the animal that Lord Monmouth wanted, for Lord Monmouth always looked upon
       human nature with the callous eye of a jockey. He surveyed Rigby, and he determined to buy
       him. He bought him; with his clear head, his indefatigable industry, his audacious tongue,
       and his ready and unscrupulous pen; with all his dates, all his lampoons; all his private
       memoirs, and all his political intrigues. It was a good purchase. Rigby became a great
       personage, and Lord Monmouth's man.
Mr. Rigby, who liked to be doing a great many things at the same time, and to astonish the
       Tadpoles and the Tapers with his energetic versatility, determined to superintend the
       education of Coningsby. It was a relation which identified him with the noble house of his
       pupil, or properly speaking, his charge: for Mr. Rigby
        affected rather the graceful dignity of the governor than the duties of a tutor.
       The boy was recalled from his homely, rural school, where he had been well grounded by a
       hard-working curate, and affectionately tended by the curate's unsophisticated wife. He was
       sent to a fashionable school preparatory to Eton, where he found about two hundred youths of
       noble families and connexions lodged in a magnificent villa, that had once been the retreat
       of a minister, superintended by a sycophantic Doctor of Divinity, already well beneficed, and
       not despairing of a bishopric by favouring the children of great nobles. The Doctor's lady
       clothed in cashmeres, sometimes inquired after their health, and occasionally received a
       report as to their linen.
Mr. Rigby had a classical retreat, not distant from this establishment, which he esteemed a
       Tusculum. There, surrounded by his busts and books, he wrote his lampoons and articles;
       massacred a she liberal, (it was thought that no
        one could lash a woman like Rigby) cut up a rising genius whose politics were
       different from his own, or scarified some unhappy wretch who had brought his claims before
       parliament, proving by garbled extracts from official correspondence that no one could refer
       to, that the malcontent, instead of being a victim, was on the contrary a defaulter. Tadpole
       and Taper would back Rigby for a "slashing reply" against the field. Here too at the end of a
       busy week, he found it occasionally convenient to entertain a clever friend or two of
       equivocal reputation, with whom he had become acquainted in former days of equal brotherhood.
       No one was more faithful to his early friends than Mr. Rigby; particularly if they could
       write a squib.
It was in this refined retirement that Mr. Rigby found time enough, snatched from the toils
       of official life and parliamentary struggles, to compose a letter on the study of History,
       addressed to Coningsby. The style was as much like that of Lord Bolingbroke as if it had been
        written by the authors of the "Rejected Addresses," and it began, "My dear young
       friend." This polished composition, so full of good feeling and comprehensive views, and all
       in the best taste, was not published. It was only privately printed and a few thousand copies
       were distributed among select personages as an especial favour and mark of high
       consideration. Each copy given away seemed to Rigby like a certificate of character, a
       property which like all men of dubious repute he thoroughly appreciated. Rigby intrigued very
       much that the head-master of Eton should adopt his discourse as a class book. For this
       purpose he dined with the Doctor; told him several anecdotes of the King, which intimated
       personal influence at Windsor; but the head-master was immovable; and so Mr. Rigby was
       obliged to be content by his Letter on History being canonized as a classic in the
       Preparatory Seminary, where the individual to whom it was addressed was a scholar.
This change in the life of Coningsby contributed
        to his happiness. The various characters, which a large school exhibited,
       interested a young mind whose active energies were beginning to stir. His previous
       acquirements made his studies light; and he was fond of sports in which he was qualified to
       excel. He did not particularly like Mr. Rigby. There was something jarring and grating in
       that gentleman's voice and modes from which the chords of the young heart shrank. He was not
       tender; though perhaps he wished it, scarcely kind; but he was good-natured, at least to
       children. However, this connexion was on the whole a very agreeable one for Coningsby. He
       seemed suddenly to have friends; he never passed his holidays again at school. Mr. Rigby was
       so clever that he contrived always to quarter Coningsby on the father of one of his
       school-fellows, for Mr. Rigby knew all his school-fellows and all their fathers. Mr. Rigby
       also called to see him, not unfrequently; would give him a dinner at the Star and Garter, or
       even have him up to town for a week to
        Whitehall. Compared with his former forlorn existence, these were happy days
       when he was placed under the gallery as a member's son, or went to the play with the
       butler!
When Coningsby had attained his twelfth year, an order was received from Lord Monmouth who
       was at Rome, that he should go at once to Eton. This was the first great epoch of his life.
       There never was a youth who entered into that wonderful little world with more eager zest
       than Coningsby. Nor was it marvellous.
That delicious plain, studded with every creation of graceful culture; hamlet and hall, and
       grange; garden and grove, and park; that castle-palace, grey with glorious ages; those
       antique spires hoar with faith and wisdom, the chapel and the college; that river winding
       through the shady meads; the sunny glade and the solemn avenue; the room in the Dame's house
       where we first order our own breakfast and first feel we are free; the stirring multitude,
        the energetic groups, the individual mind that leads, conquers, controls; the
       emulation and the affection; the noble strife and the tender sentiment; the daring exploit
       and the dashing scrape; the passion that pervades our life, and breathes in everything, from
       the aspiring study to the inspiring sport—oh! what hereafter can spur the brain and touch the
       heart like this; can give us a world so deeply and variously interesting; a life so full of
       quick and bright excitement—passed in a scene so fair!
