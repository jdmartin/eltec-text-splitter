CHAPTER V.
In the meantime, while ladies are luncheoning on chicken pie, or coursing in
       whirling britskas, performing all the singular ceremonies of a London morning in the heart of
       the season; making visits where nobody is seen, and making purchases which are not wanted;
       the world is in agitation and uproar. At present the world and the confusion are limited to
       St. James's Street and Pall Mall; but soon the boundaries and the tumult will be extended to
       the intended metropolitan boroughs; to-morrow they will spread over the manufacturing
       districts. It is entirely evident, that before eight and forty
        hours have passed, the country will be in a state of fearful crisis. And how can
       it be otherwise? Is it not a truth, that the subtle Chief Baron has been closeted one whole
       hour with the King; that shortly after, with thoughtful brow and compressed lip, he was
       marked in his daring chariot entering the court-yard of Apsley House. Great was the panic at
       Brookes', wild the hopes of Carlton Terrace; All the gentlemen who expected to have been made
       peers, perceived that the country was going to be given over to a rapacious oligarchy.
In the meantime, Tadpole and Taper, who had never quitted for an instant the mysterious
       head-quarters of the late opposition, were full of hopes and fears, and asked many questions
       which they chiefly answered themselves.
"I wonder what Lord Lyndhurst will say to the King," said Taper.
"He has plenty of pluck," said Tadpole.
"I almost wish now that Rigby had breakfasted with him this morning," said Taper.

"If the King be firm, and the country sound," said Tadpole, "and Lord Monmouth keep his
       boroughs, I should not wonder if Rigby were made a privy counsellor."
"There is no precedent for an under secretary being a privy counsellor," said Taper.
"But we live in revolutionary times," said Tadpole.
"Gentlemen," said the groom of the chambers, in a loud voice, entering the room, "I am
       desired to state that the Duke of Wellington is with the King."
"There is a Providence!" exclaimed an agitated gentleman, the patent of whose
       intended peerage had not been signed the day that the Duke had quitted office in 1830.
"I always thought the King would be firm," said Mr. Tadpole.
"I wonder who will have the India Board," said Taper.
At this moment, three or four gentlemen entered the room in a state of great bustle
        and excitement; they were immediately surrounded.
"Is it true? Quite true; not the slightest doubt. Saw him myself. Not at all hissed;
       certainly not hooted. Perhaps a little hissed. One fellow really cheered him. Saw him myself.
       Say what they like there is re-action. But Constitution Hill they say? Well, there
       was a sort of inclination to a row on Constitution Hill; but the Duke quite firm; pistols and
       carriage doors bolted."
Such may give a faint idea of the anxious inquiries, and the satisfactory replies that were
       occasioned by the entrance of this group.
"Up guards and at them!" exclaimed Tadpole, rubbing his hands in a fit of patriotic
       enthusiasm.
Later in the afternoon, about five o'clock, the high change of political gossip, when the
       room was crowded, and every one had his rumour, Mr. Rigby looked in again to throw his eye
       over the evening papers, and catch in various
        chit-chat the tone of public or party feeling on the 'crisis.' Then it was known
       that the Duke had returned from the King, having accepted the charge of forming an
       administration. An administration to do what? Portentous question! Were concessions to be
       made? And if so, what? Was it altogether impossible, and too late, stare super vias
        antiquas ? Questions altogether above your Tadpoles and your Tapers, whose idea of the
       necessities of the age was that they themselves should be in office.
Lord Eskdale came up to Mr. Rigby. This peer was a noble Croesus, acquainted with all the
       gradations of life; a voluptuary who could be a Spartan; clear-sighted, unprejudiced,
       sagacious; the best judge in the world of a horse or a man; he was the universal referee; a
       quarrel about a bet or a mistress was solved by him in a moment, and in a manner which
       satisfied both parties. He patronised and appreciated the fine arts, though a jockey;
       respected literary men, though he only read French
        novels; and without any affectation of tastes which he did not possess, was
       looked upon by every singer and dancer in Europe, as their natural champion. The secret of
       his strong character and great influence was his self-composure, which an earthquake or a
       Reform Bill could not disturb, and which in him was the result of temperament and experience.
       He was an intimate acquaintance of Lord Monmouth, for they had many tastes in common; were
       both men of considerable, and in some degree similar abilities; and were the two greatest
       proprietors of close boroughs in the country.
"Do you dine at Monmouth House to-day?" inquired Lord Eskdale of Mr. Rigby.
"Where I hope to meet your Lordship. The Whig papers are very subdued," continued Mr.
       Rigby.
"Ah! they have not the cue yet," said Lord Eskdale.
"And what do you think of affairs?" inquired his companion.

"I think the hounds are too hot to hark off now," said Lord Eskdale.
"There is one combination," said Rigby, who seemed meditating an attack on Lord Eskdale's
       button.
"Give us it at dinner," said Lord Eskdale; who knew his man, and made an adroit movement
       forwards as if he were very anxious to see the Globe newspaper.
In the course of two or three hours these gentlemen met again in the green drawing-room of
       Monmouth House. Mr. Rigby was sitting on the sofa by Lord Monmouth, detailing in whispers all
       his gossip of the morn: Lord Eskdale murmuring quaint inquiries into the ear of the Princess
       Lucretia. Madame Colonna made remarks alternately to two gentlemen, who paid her assiduous
       court. One of these was Mr. Ormsby; the school, the college, and the club crony of Lord
       Monmouth, who had been his shadow through life; travelled with him in early days, won money
       with him at
        play, had been his colleague in the House of Commons; and was still one of his
       nominees. Mr. Ormsby was a millionnaire, which Lord Monmouth liked. He liked his companions
       to be very rich or very poor; to be his equals, able to play with him at high stakes, or join
       him in a great speculation; or to be his tools, and to amuse and serve him. There was nothing
       which he despised and disliked so much as a moderate fortune.
The other gentleman was of a different class and character. Nature had intended Lucian Gay
       for a scholar and a wit; necessity had made him a scribbler and a buffoon. He had
       distinguished himself at the University; but he had no patrimony, nor those powers of
       perseverance which success in any learned profession requires. He was good-looking, had great
       animal spirits, and a keen sense of enjoyment, and could not drudge. Moreover he had a fine
       voice, and sang his own songs with considerable taste; accomplishments which made his fortune
       in society, and completed
        his ruin. In due time he extricated himself from the bench and merged into
       journalism, by means of which he chanced to become acquainted with Mr. Rigby. That worthy
       individual was not slow in detecting the treasure he had lighted onâ€”a wit, a ready and happy
       writer, a joyous and tractable being, with the education, and still the feelings and manners,
       of a gentleman. Frequent the Sunday dinners which found Gay a guest at Mr. Rigby's villa;
       numerous the airy pasquinades he left behind, and which made the fortune of his patron.
       Flattered by the familiar acquaintance of a man of station, and sanguine that he had found
       the link which would sooner or later restore him to the polished world that he had forfeited,
       Gay laboured in his vocation with enthusiasm and success. Willingly would Rigby have kept his
       treasure to himself; and truly he hoarded it for a long time, but it oozed out. Rigby loved
       the reputation of possessing the complete art of society. His dinners were celebrated at
       least for their guests. Great
        intellectual illustrations were found there blended with rank and high station.
       Rigby loved to patronize; to play the minister unbending, and seeking relief from the cares
       of council in the society of authors, artists, and men of science. He liked Dukes to dine
       with him and hear him scatter his audacious criticisms to Sir Thomas or Sir Humphrey. They
       went away astounded by the powers of their host, who had he not fortunately devoted those
       powers to their party, must apparently have rivalled Vandyke, or discovered the Safety
       lamp.
Now in these dinners, Lucian Gay who had brilliant conversational powers, and who possessed
       all the resources of boon companionship would be an invaluable ally. He was therefore
       admitted, and inspired both by the present enjoyment, and the future to which it might lead,
       his exertions were untiring, various, most successful. Rigby's dinners became still more
       celebrated. It however necessarily followed that the guests who were charmed by
        Gay, wished Gay also to be their guest. Rigby was very jealous of this, but it
       was inevitable; still by constant manoeuvre, by intimations of some exercise some day or
       other of substantial patronage in his behalf, by a thousand little arts by which he carved
       out work for Gay which prevented him often accepting invitations to great houses in the
       country, by judicious loans of small sums on Lucian's notes of hand and other analogous
       devices, Rigby contrived to keep the wit in a very fair state of bondage and dependence.
One thing Rigby was resolved on: Gay should never get into Monmouth House. That was an
       empyrean too high for his wing to soar in. Rigby kept that social monopoly distinctively to
       mark the relation that subsisted between them as patron and client. It was something to
       swagger about when they were together after their second bottle of claret. Rigby kept his
       resolution for some years which the frequent and prolonged absence of the Marquess rendered
       not very difficult. But we are the creatures of
        circumstances; at least the Rigby race particularly. Lord Monmouth returned to
       England one year and wanted to be amused. He wanted a jester; a man about him who would make
       himâ€”not laugh for that was impossible, but smile more frequently, tell good stories, say good
       things, and sing now and then, especially French songs. Early in life Rigby would have
       attempted all this, though he had neither fun, voice, nor ear. But his hold on Lord Monmouth
       no longer depended on the mere exercise of agreeable qualities, he had become indispensable
       to his Lordship by more serious, if not higher, considerations. And what with auditing his
       accounts, guarding his boroughs, writing him, when absent, gossip by every post, and when in
       England, deciding on every question and arranging every matter, which might otherwise have
       ruffled the sublime repose of his patron's existence, Rigby might be excused if he shrank a
       little from the minor part of table wit, particularly when we remember all his subterranean
       journalism;
        hisacid squibs, and his malicious paragraphs, and, what Tadpole called, his
       "slashing" articles.
These "slashing articles" were, indeed, things which had they appeared as anonymous
       pamphlets, would have obtained the contemptuous reception, which in an intellectual view, no
       compositions more surely deserved: but whispered as the productions of one behind the scenes,
       and appearing in the pages of a party review, they were passed off as genuine coin, and took
       in great numbers of the lieges, especially in the country. They were written in a style
       apparently modelled on the briefs of those sharp attorneys, who weary advocates with their
       clever common place; teasing with obvious comment and torturing with inevitable inference.
       The affectation of order in the statement of facts had all the lucid method of an adroit
       pettifogger. They dealt much in extracts from newspapers, quotations from the Annual
       Register, parallel passages in forgotten speeches, arranged with a formidable array of dates
       rarely accurate. When
        the writer was of opinion he had made a point, you may be sure the hit was in
       italics, that last resource of the Forcible Feebles. He handled a particular in chronology as
       if he were proving an alibi at the Criminal Court. The censure was coarse without being
       strong, and vindictive when it would have been sarcastic. Now and then there was a passage
       which aimed at a higher flight, and nothing can be conceived more unlike genuine feeling, or
       more offensive to pure taste. And yet perhaps the most ludicrous characteristic of these
       factious gallimaufreys, was an occasional assumption of the high moral and admonitory tone,
       which when we recurred to the general spirit of the discourse and were apt to recall the
       character of its writer, irresistibly reminded one of Mrs. Cole and her prayer book.
To return to Lucian Gay. It was a rule with Rigby that no one, if possible, should do
       anything for Lord Monmouth but himself; and as a jester must be found, he was determined
        that his Lordship should have the best in the market, and that he should have
       the credit of furnishing the article. As a reward, therefore, for many past services and a
       fresh claim to his future exertions, Rigby one day broke to Gay that the hour had at length
       arrived when the highest object of reasonable ambition on his part, and the fulfilment of one
       of Rigby's long cherished and dearest hopes were alike to be realized. Gay was to be
       presented to Lord Monmouth and dine at Monmouth House.
The acquaintance was a successful one; very agreeable to both parties. Gay became an
       habitual guest of Lord Monmouth when his patron was in England; and in his absence, received
       frequent and substantial marks of his kind recollection, for Lord Monmouth was generous to
       those who amused him.
In the meantime, the hour of dinner is at hand. Coningsby, who had lost the key of his
       carpet bag, which he finally cut open with a pen-knife that he found on his writing table,
        and the blade of which he broke in the operation, only reached the drawing-room
       as the figure of his grandfather, leaning on his ivory cane and following his guests, was
       just visible in the distance. He was soon overtaken. Perceiving Coningsby, Lord Monmouth made
       him a bow, not so formal a one as in the morning, but still a bow, and said, "I hope you
       liked your drive."
