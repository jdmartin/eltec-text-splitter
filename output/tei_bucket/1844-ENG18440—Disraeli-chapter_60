CHAPTER V.
There is a romance in every life. The emblazoned page of Coningsby's existence was
       now open. It had been prosperous before; with some moments of excitement; some of delight;
       but they had all found, as it were, their origin in worldly considerations, or been
       inevitably mixed up with them. At Paris for example, he loved, or thought he loved. But there
       not an hour could elapse without his meeting some person, or hearing something, which
       disturbed the beauty of his emotions or broke his spellbound thoughts. There was his
       grandfather hating the Millbanks or Sidonia loving them;
        and common people in the common world making common observations on them;
       asking who they were, or telling who they were; and brushing the bloom of all life's fresh
       delicious fancies with their coarse handling.
But now his feelings were ethereal. He loved, passionately—and he loved in a scene and in a
       society as sweet, as pure, and as refined, as his imagination and his heart. There was no
       malicious gossip, no callous chatter, to profane his ear and desecrate his sentiment. All
       that he heard or saw was worthy of the summer sky, the still green woods, the gushing river,
       the gardens and terraces, the stately and fantastic dwellings, among which his life now
       glided as in some dainty and gorgeous masque.
All the soft, social domestic sympathies of his nature which, however abundant, had never
       been cultivated, were developed by the life he was now leading. It was not merely that he
       lived in the constant presence, and under the constant influence of one whom he adored, that
       made him so happy. He was surrounded by beings who found felicity in the interchange of kind
        feelings and kind words; in the cultivation of happy talents and refined
       tastes; and the enjoyment of a life which their own good sense and own good hearts made them
       both comprehend and appreciate. Ambition lost much of its splendour, even his lofty
       aspirations something of their hallowing impulse of paramount duty, when Coningsby felt how
       much ennobling delight was consistent with the seclusion of a private station; and mused over
       an existence to be passed amid woods and waterfalls with a fair hand locked in his; or
       surrounded by his friends in some ancestral hall.
The morning after his first visit to Hellingsley, Coningsby rejoined his friends, as he had
       promised Oswald at their breakfast table; and day after day, he came with the early sun, and
       left them only when the late moon silvered the keep of Coningsby Castle. Mr. Millbank who
       wrote daily, and was daily to be expected, did not arrive. A week, a week of unbroken bliss,
       had vanished away—passed in long rides and longer walks; sunset saunterings, and sometimes
       moonlit strolls; talking of flowers, and
        thinking of things even sweeter; listening to delicious songs, and sometimes
       reading aloud some bright romance, or some inspiring lay.
One day, Coningsby who arrived at the Hall unexpectedly late; indeed it was some hours past
       noon, for he had been detained by despatches which arrived at the Castle from Mr. Rigby and
       which required his interposition; found the ladies alone, and was told that Sir Joseph and
       Oswald were at the fishing cottage, where they wished him to join them. He was in no haste to
       do this; and Lady Wallinger proposed, that when they felt inclined to ramble, they should all
       walk down to the fishing cottage together. So seating himself by the side of Edith who was
       tinting a sketch which she had made of a rich oriel of Hellingsley, the morning passed away
       in that slight and yet subtle talk in which a lover delights, and in which, while asking a
       thousand questions, that seem at the first glance, sufficiently trifling, he is indeed often
       conveying a meaning that is not expressed, or attempting to discover a feeling that is
       hidden. And these are occasions, when glances
        meet, and glances are withdrawn: the tongue may speak idly, the eye is more
       eloquent; and often more true.
Coningsby looked up; Lady Wallinger who had more than once announced, that she was going to
       put on her bonnet, was gone. Yet still he continued to talk trifles; and still Edith
       listened.
"Of all that you have told me," said Edith, "nothing pleases me so much as your description
       of St. Geneviève. How much I should like to catch the deer at sunset on the heights! What a
       pretty drawing it would make!"
"You would like Eustace Lyle," said Coningsby. "He is so shy and yet so ardent."
"You have such a band of friends, Oswald was saying this morning there was no one who had
       so many devoted friends."
"We are all united by sympathy; it is the only bond of friendship; and yet friendship—"
"Edith," said Lady Wallinger looking into the room from the garden with her bonnet on,
        "you will find me roaming on the terrace."
"We come, dear aunt."
And yet they did not move. There were yet a few pencil touches to be given to the tinted
       sketch; Coningsby would cut the pencils.
"Would you give me," he said, "some slight memorial of Hellingsby and your art! I would not
       venture to hope for anything half so beautiful as this; but the slightest sketch. I should so
       like when away to have it hanging in my room."
A blush suffused the cheek of Edith, she turned her head a little aside, as if she were
       arranging some drawings. And then she said in a somewhat hushed and hesitating voice,
"I am sure I will do so; and with pleasure. A view of the Hall itself; I think that would
       be the best memorial. Where shall we take it from? We will decide in our walk," and she rose,
       and promising immediately to return, left the room.
Coningsby leant over the mantle in deep abstraction, gazing vacantly on a miniature of the
        father of Edith. A light step roused him; she had returned, Unconsciously he
       greeted her with a glance of ineffable tenderness.
They went forth; it was a grey, sultry day. Indeed it was the covered sky which had led to
       the fishing scheme of the morning; Sir Joseph was a very expert and accomplished angler; and
       the Darl was renowned for its sport. They lingered before they reached the terrace where they
       were to find Lady Wallinger, observing the different points of view which the Hall presented,
       and debating which was to form the subject of Coningsby's drawing; for already it was to be
       not merely a sketch, but a drawing, the most finished that the bright and effective pencil of
       Edith could achieve. If it really were to be placed in his room, and were to be a memorial of
       Hellingsley, her artistic reputation demanded a master-piece.
They reached the terrace: Lady Wallinger was not there; nor could they observe her in the
       vicinity. Coningsby was quite certain that she had gone onward to the fishing cottage, and
       expected them to follow her; and he convinced
        Edith of the justness of his opinion. To the fishing cottage therefore they
       bent their steps. They emerged from the gardens into the Park, sauntering over the table
       land, and seeking as much as possible the shade in the soft but oppressive atmosphere. At the
       limit of the table land their course lay by a wild and winding path through a gradual and
       wooded declivity. While they were yet in this craggy and romantic woodland, the big, fervent
       drops began to fall. Coningsby urged Edith to seek at once a natural shelter; but she, who
       knew the country, assured him that the fishing cottage was close by, and that they might
       reach it before the rain could do them any harm.
And truly at this moment emerging from the wood, they found themselves in the valley of the
       Darl. The river here was narrow and winding, but full of life; rushing and clear, but for the
       dark sky it reflected; with high banks of turf and tall trees; the silver birch, above all
       others, in clustering groups; infinitely picturesque. At the turn of the river, about two
       hundred yards distant, Coningsby observed the
        low, dark roof of the fishing cottage on its banks. They descended from the
       woods to the margin of the stream, by a flight of turfen steps, Coningsby holding Edith's
       hand as he guided her progress.
The drops became thicker; they reached, at a rapid pace, the cottage. The absent boat
       indicated that Sir Joseph and Oswald were on the river. The cottage was an old building of
       rustic logs, with a very shelving roof so that you might obtain sufficient shelter without
       entering its walls. Coningsby found a rough garden seat for Edith. The shower was now
       violent.
Nature, like man, sometimes weeps from gladness. It is the joy and tenderness of her heart
       that seek relief; and these are summer showers. In this instance, the vehemence of her
       emotion was transient, though the tears kept stealing down her cheek for a long time, and
       gentle sighs and sobs might for some period be distinguished. The oppressive atmosphere had
       evaporated; the grey, sullen tint had disappeared; a soft breeze came dancing up
        the stream; a glowing light fell upon the woods and waters; the perfume of
       trees and flowers and herbs floated around. There was a carolling of birds; a hum of happy
       insects in the air; freshness and stir, and a sense of joyous life, pervaded all things; it
       seemed that the heart of all creation opened.
Coningsby, after repeatedly watching the shower with Edith, and speculating on its progress
       which did not much annoy them, had seated himself on a log almost at her feet. And assuredly
       a maiden and a youth more beautiful and engaging had seldom met before in a scene more fresh
       and fair. Edith on her rustic seat watched the now blue and foaming river, and the birch
       trees with a livelier tint, and quivering in the sunset air; an expression of tranquil bliss
       suffused her beautiful brow, and spoke from the thrilling tenderness of her soft dark eye.
       Coningsby gazed on that countenance with a glance of entranced rapture. His cheek was
       flushed, his eye gleamed with dazzling lustre. She turned her head, she met that glance, and,
       troubled, she withdrew her own.

"Edith," he said, in a tone of tremulous passion, "let me call you Edith! Yes," he
       continued, gently taking her hand, "Let me call you my Edith! I love you!"
She did not withdraw her hand; but turned away a face flushed as the impending
       twilight.
