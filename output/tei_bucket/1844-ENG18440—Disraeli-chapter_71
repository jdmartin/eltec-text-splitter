CHAPTER I.
It was merry Christmas at St. Geneviève. There was a Yule log blazing on every
       hearth in that wide domain, from the hall of the squire to the peasant's roof. The Buttery
       Hatch was open for the whole week from noon to sunset; all comers might take their fill, and
       each carry away as much bold beef, white bread, and jolly ale as a strong man could bear in a
       basket with one hand. For every woman a red cloak, and a coat of broad cloth for every
        man. All day long, carts laden with fuel and warm raiment were traversing the
       various districts, distributing comfort and dispensing cheer. For a Christian gentleman of
       high degree was Eustace Lyle.
Within his hall too he holds his revel, and his beauteous bride welcomes their guests from
       her noble parents to the faithful tenants of the house. All classes are mingled in the joyous
       equality that becomes the season, at once sacred and merry. There are carols for the eventful
       Eve, and mummers for the festive Day.
The Duke and Duchess and every member of the family had consented this year to keep their
       Christmas with the newly married couple. Coningsby too was there, and all his friends. The
       party was numerous, gay, hearty and happy; for they were all united by sympathy.
They were planning that Henry Sydney should be appointed Lord of Misrule, or ordained Abbot
       of Unreason at the least, so successful had been his revival of the Mummers, the Hobby-horse
       not forgotten. Their host had intrusted to Lord Henry the restoration of many old
       observances, and the joyous feeling which
        this celebration of Christmas had diffused throughout a very extensive
       district, was a fresh argument in favour of Lord Henry's principle, that a mere mechanical
       mitigation of the material necessities of the humbler classes, a mitigation which must
       inevitably be very limited, can never alone avail sufficiently to ameliorate their condition;
       that their condition is not merely "a knife and fork question," to use the coarse and shallow
       phrase of the Utilitarian school; that a simple satisfaction of the grosser necessities of
       our nature will not make a happy people; that you must cultivate the heart as well as seek to
       content the belly; and that the surest means to elevate the character of the people is to
       appeal to their affections.
There is nothing more interesting than to trace predisposition. An indefinite yet strong
       sympathy with the Peasantry of the realm had been one of the characteristic sensibilities of
       Lord Henry at Eton. Yet a schoolboy, he had busied himself with their pastimes and the
       details of their cottage economy. As he advanced in life, the horizon of his views expanded
       with his intelligence and his experience,
        and the son of one of the noblest of our houses, to whom the delights of life
       are offered with fatal facility, on the very threshold of his career, he devoted his time and
       thought, labour and life, to one vast and noble purpose, the elevation of the condition of
       the great body of the people.
"I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule," said Lord Henry, "I will be content with
       being his Gentleman Usher.
"It shall be put to the vote," said Lord Vere.
"No one has a chance against Buckhurst," said Coningsby.
"Now, Sir Charles," said Lady Everingham, "your absolute sway is about to commence. And
       what is your will."
"The first thing must be my formal installation," said Buckhurst. "I vote the Boar's head
       be carried in procession thrice round the hall, and Beau shall be the champion to challenge
       all who question my right. Duke, you shall be my chief butler; the Duchess my herbwoman. She
       is to walk before me, and scatter rosemary. Coningsby shall carry the Boar's head. Lady
       Theresa and Lady Everingham shall sing the
        canticle. Lord Everingham shall be Marshal of the lists, and put all in the
       stocks who are found sober and decorous. Lyle shall be the palmer from the Holy Land, and
       Vere shall ride the Hobby-horse. Some must carry cups of Hippocrass; some lighted tapers; all
       must join in chorus."
He ceased his instructions and all hurried away to carry them into effect. Some hastily
       arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses, the ladies in robes of white with garlands of
       flowers, some drew pieces of armour from the wall, and decked themselves with helm and
       hauberk, others waved ancient banners. They brought in the Boar's head on a large silver
       dish, and Coningsby raised it aloft. They formed into procession, the Duchess distributing
       rosemary, Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of Tamerlane, his mock court irresistibly
       humorous with their servility, and the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chaunting the first
       verse of the Canticle, followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa.


I.
Caput Apri defero
Reddens laudes Bomino
The Boar's heade in hande bring I,
With garlandes gay and rosemary,
I pray you all singe merrily,
Qui estis in conbibio.
II.
Caput Apri defero
Reddens laudes Bomino
The Boar's head I understande
Is the chief serbyee in this lande
Loke whereeber it be fande
Serbite cum cantico.

The procession thrice paraded the Hall. Then they stopped, and the Lord of Misrule ascended
       his throne and his courtiers formed round him in circle. Behind him they held the ancient
       banners and waved their glittering arms; and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the
       Boar's head covered with garlands. It was a good picture and the Lord of Misrule sustained
       his part with untiring energy. He was addressing his court in a pompous rhapsody of merry
        nonsense, when a servant approached Coningsby and told him that he was wanted
       without.
Our hero retired unperceived. A despatch had arrived for him from London. Without any
       prescience of its purpose, he nevertheless broke the seal with a trembling hand. His presence
       was immediately desired in town—Lord Monmouth was dead.
