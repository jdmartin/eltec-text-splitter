CHAPTER III.
" This is a crash," said Coningsby with a grave rather than agitated countenance
       to Sidonia, as his friend came up to greet him without however any expression of
       condolence.
"This time next year, you will not think so," said Sidonia.
Coningsby shrugged his shoulders.
"The principal annoyance of this sort of miscarriage," said Sidonia, "is the condolence of
       the gentle world. I think we may now depart. I am going home to dine. Come and discuss your
       position. For the present we will not speak of it." So saying Sidonia good-naturedly got
       Coningsby out of the room.

They walked together to Sidonia's house in Carlton Gardens, neither of them making the
       slightest allusion to the catastrophe; Sidonia inquiring where he had been, what he had been
       doing, since they last met, and himself conversing in his usual vein, though with a little
       more feeling in his manner than was his custom. When they had arrived there, Sidonia ordered
       their dinner instantly, and during the interval between the command and its appearance, he
       called Coningsby's attention to an old German painting he had just received, its brilliant
       colouring and quaint costumes.
"Eat, and an appetite will come," said Sidonia, when he observed Coningsby somewhat
       reluctant. "Take some of that Chablis; it will put you right; you will find it
       delicious."
In this way some twenty minutes past; their meal was over, and they were alone
       together.
"I have been thinking all this time of your position," said Sidonia.
"A sorry one, I fear," said Coningsby.
"I really cannot see that," said his friend "You have experienced this morning a
       disappointment;
        but not a calamity. If you had lost your eye it would have been a calamity: no
       combination of circumstances could have given you another. There are really no miseries
       except natural miseries: conventional misfortunes are mere illusions. What seems
       conventionally in a limited view a great misfortune, if subsequently viewed in its results,
       is often the happiest incident in one's life."
"I hope the day may come when I may feel this."
"Now is the moment when philosophy is of use; that is to say, now is the moment when you
       should clearly comprehend the circumstances which surround you. Holiday philosophy is mere
       idleness. You think, for example, that you have just experienced a great calamity, because
       you have lost the fortune on which you counted?"
"I must say I do."
"I ask you again: which would you have rather lost, your grandfather's inheritance or your
       right leg?"
"Most certainly my inheritance."

"Or your left arm?"
"Still the inheritance."
"Would you have received the inheritance on condition, that your front tooth should have
       been knocked out."
"No; certainly not."
"Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled?"
"Even at twenty-three, I would have refused the terms."
"Come, come, Coningsby, the calamity cannot be very great."
"Why you have put it in a very ingenious point of view; and yet it is not easy to convince
       a man that he should be content who has lost everything."
"You have a great many things at this moment that you separately prefer to the fortune that
       you have forfeited. How then can you be said to have lost everything?"
"What have I?" said Coningsby, despondingly.
"You have health, youth, good looks, great abilities, considerable knowledge, a fine
       courage, a lofty spirit, and no contemptible experience. With each of these qualities one
       might make a
        fortune; the combination ought to command the highest."
"You console me," said Coningsby, with a faint blush and a fainter smile.
"I teach you the truth. That is always solacing. I think you are a most fortunate young
       man; I should not have thought you more fortunate if you had been your grandfather's heir;
       perhaps less so. But I wish you to comprehend your position: if you understand it, you will
       cease to lament."
"But what should I do?"
"Bring your intelligence to bear on the right object. I make you no offers of fortune,
       because I know you would not accept them, and indeed I have no wish to see you a lounger in
       life. If you had inherited a great patrimony, it is possible your natural character and
       previous culture might have saved you from its paralysing influence; but it is a question
       even with you. Now you are free—that is to say you are free, if you are not in debt. A man
       who has not seen the world, whose fancy is harassed with glittering images of pleasures he
       has never experienced, cannot live on £300 per annum; but
        you can. You have nothing to haunt your thoughts, or disturb the abstraction of
       your studies. You have seen the most beautiful women; you have banquetted in palaces; you
       know what heroes and wits and statesmen are made of; and you can draw on your memory instead
       of your imagination for all those dazzling and interesting objects that make the
       inexperienced restless, and are the cause of what are called scrapes. But you can do nothing
       if you be in debt. You must be free. Before therefore we proceed, I must beg you to be frank
       on this head. If you have any absolute or contingent incumbrances, tell me of them without
       reserve, and permit me to clear them at once to any amount. You will sensibly oblige me in so
       doing: because I am interested in watching your career, and if the racer start with a clog my
       psychological observations will be imperfect."
"You are indeed a friend; and had I debts I would ask you to pay them. I have nothing of
       the kind. My grandfather was so lavish in his allowance to me that I never got into
       difficulties. Besides there are horses and things
        without end which I must sell, and money at Drummond's."
"That will produce your outfit, whatever the course you adopt. I conceive there are two
       careers which deserve your consideration. In the first place there is Diplomacy. If you
       decide upon that, I can assist you. There exists between me and the Minister such relations
       that I can at once secure you that first step which is so difficult to obtain. After that
       much, if not all, depends on yourself. But I could advance you, provided you were capable.
       You should at least not languish for want of preferment. In an important post, I could throw
       in your way advantages which would soon permit you to control cabinets. Information commands
       the world. I doubt not your success, and for such a career, speedy. Let us assume it as a
       fact. Is it a result satisfactory? Suppose yourself in a dozen years a Plenipotentiary at a
       chief court or at a critical post; with a red ribbon and the Privy Council in immediate
       perspective; and after a lengthened career, a pension and a peerage. Would that satisfy you?
       You
        don't look excited. I am hardly surprised. In your position, it would not
       satisfy me. A Diplomatist is after all a phantom. There is a want of nationality about his
       being. I always look upon Diplomatists as the Hebrews of politics; without country, political
       creeds, popular convictions, that strong reality of existence which pervades the career of an
       eminent citizen in a free and great country."
"You read my thoughts," said Coningsby. "I should be sorry to sever myself from
       England."
"There remains then the other, the greater, the nobler career," said Sidonia, "which in
       England may give you all—the Bar. I am absolutely persuaded that with the requisite
       qualifications and with perseverance, success at the Bar is certain. It may be retarded or
       precipitated by circumstances; but cannot be ultimately affected. You have a right to count
       with your friends on no lack of opportunities when you are ripe for them. You appear to me to
       have all the qualities necessary for the Bar: and you may count on that perseverance, which
       is indispensable, for the reason
        I have before mentioned, because it will be sustained by your experience."
"I have resolved," said Coningsby; "I will try for the Great Seal."
