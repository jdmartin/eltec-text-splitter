CHAPTER V.
About a week after this interview with Flora, as Coningsby one morning was about
       to sally forth from the Albany to visit some chambers in the Temple to which his notice had
       been attracted, there was a loud ring, a bustle in the hall, and Henry Sydney and Buckhurst
       were ushered in.
There never was such a cordial meeting; and yet the faces of his friends were serious. The
       truth is, the paragraphs in the newspapers had circulated in the country, they had written to
       Coningsby, and after a brief delay he had confirmed their worst apprehensions. Immediately
       they came up to town. Henry Sydney, a
        younger son, could offer little but sympathy, but he declared that it was his
       intention also to study for the Bar, so they should not be divided. Buckhurst after many
       embraces, and some ordinary talk, took Coningsby aside, and said, "My dear fellow, I have no
       objection to Henry Sydney hearing everything I say; but still these are subjects which men
       like to be discussed in private. Of course I expect you to share my fortune. There is enough
       for both. We will have an exact division."
There was something in Buckhurst's servent resolution very loveable and a little humorous,
       just enough to put one in a good temper with human nature and life. If there were any
       fellow's fortune in the world that Coningsby would share, Buckhurst's would have had the
       preference, but while he pressed his hand, and with a glance in which a tear and a smile
       seemed to contend for mastery, he gently indicated why such arrangements were with our
       present manners impossible.
"I see," said Buckhurst after a moment's thought. "I quite agree with you. The thing cannot
       be done; and to tell you the truth, a
        fortune is a bore. What I vote that we three do at once is to take plenty of
       ready money, and enter the Austrian service. By Jove, it is the only thing to do."
"There is something in that," said Coningsby. "In the meantime, suppose you two fellows
       walk with me to the Temple; for I have an appointment to look at some chambers."
It was a fine day, and it was by no means a gloomy walk. Though the two friends had arrived
       full of indignation against Lord Monmouth and miserable about their companion, once more in
       his society and finding little difference in his carriage, they assumed unconsciously their
       habitual tone. As for Buckhurst, he was delighted with the Temple which he visited for the
       first time. The name enchanted him. The tombs in the Church convinced him that the Crusades
       were the only career. He would have himself become a law student, if he might have prosecuted
       his studies in chain armour. The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the misfortunes of
       Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion of his life amid these halls and
       courts, gardens and terraces, that maintain
        in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century so much of the grave
       romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners. Henry Sydney was very sanguine; he was
       reconciled to the disinheritance of Coningsby by the conviction that it was a providential
       dispensation to make him a Lord Chancellor.
These faithful friends remained in town with Coningsby until he was established in Paper
       Buildings, and had become a pupil of a celebrated special pleader. They would have remained
       longer, had not he himself suggested that it was better that they should part. They parted
       with deep emotion. It seemed a terrible catastrophe after all the visions of their boyish
       days; their college dreams; and their dazzling adventures in the world.
"And this is the end of Coningsby, the brilliant Coningsby, that we all loved, that was to
       be our leader!" said Buckhurst to Lord Henry as they quitted him. "Well, come what may, life
       has lost something of its bloom."
"The great thing now," said Lord Henry, "is to keep up the chain of our friendship. We must
       write to him very often; and contrive to
        be frequently together. It is dreadful to think that in the ways of life our
       hearts may become estranged. I never felt more wretched than I do at this moment, and yet I
       have faith that we shall not lose him."
"Amen!" said Buckhurst, "but I feel my plan about the Austrian service was after all the
       only thing. The continent offers a career. He might have been Prime Minister: several
       strangers have been; and as for war, look at Brown and Laudohn and half a hundred others. I
       had a much better chance of being a Field-Marshal than he has of being a Lord
       Chancellor."
"I feel quite convinced that Coningsby will be Lord Chancellor," said Henry Sydney
       gravely.
This change of life for Coningsby was a great social revolution. It was sudden and
       complete. Within a month after the death of his grandfather, his name had been erased from
       all his fashionable clubs, his horses and carriages sold, and he had become a student of the
       Temple. He entirely devoted himself to his new pursuit. His being was completely absorbed in
       it. There
        was nothing to haunt his mind; no inexperienced scene or sensation of life to
       distract his intelligence. One sacred thought alone indeed there remained, shrined in the
       innermost sanctuary of his heart and consciousness. But it was a tradition, no longer a hope.
       The moment that he had fairly recovered from the first shock of his grandfather's will, had
       clearly ascertained the consequences to himself, and had resolved on the course to pursue, he
       had communicated unreservedly with Oswald Millbank, and had renounced those pretensions to
       the hand of his sister which it ill became the destitute to prefer.
His letter was answered in person. Millbank met Henry Sydney and Buckhurst at the chambers
       of Coningsby. Once more they were all four together; but under what different circumstances,
       and with what different prospects to those which attended their separation at Eton! Alone
       with Coningsby, Millbank spoke to him things which letters could not convey. He bore to him
       all the sympathy and devotion of Edith, but they would not conceal from themselves that, at
       this moment, and in the present state of affairs,
        all was hopeless. In no way did Coningsby ever permit himself to intimate to
       Oswald the cause of his disinheritance. He was of course silent on it to his other friends,
       as any communication of the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his
       inmost soul.
