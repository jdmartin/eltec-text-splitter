EPILOGUE TO VOLUME I.
THUS far have we pursued our adventurous theme; and though we have already told so much, how
      much more does there remain yet to tell!
Said we not, at the outset, that we would introduce our readers to a city of strange
      contrasts? and who shall say that we have not fulfilled our promise?
But as yet we have only drawn the veil partially aside from the mighty panorama of grandeur
      and misery which it is our task to display:—the reader has still to be initiated more deeply
      into the Mysteries of London.
We have a grand moral to work out—a great
       lesson to teach every class of society;—a moral and a lesson whose themes are
       WEALTH. | POVERTY.
For we have constituted ourselves the scourge of the oppressor, and the champion of the
      oppressed: we have taken virtue by the hand to raise it, and we have seized upon vice to
      expose it; we have no fear of those who sit in high places; but we dwell as emphatically upon
      the failings of the educated and rich, as on the immorality of the ignorant and poor.
We invite all those who have been deceived to come around us, and we will unmask the
      deceiver;—we seek the company of them that drag the chains of tyranny along the rough
      thoroughfares of the world, that we may put the tyrant to shame;—we gather around us all those
      who suffer from vicious institutions, that we may expose the rottenness of the social
      heart.
Crime, oppression, and injustice prosper for a time; but, with nations as with individuals,
      the day of retribution must come. Such is the lesson which we have yet to teach.
And let those who have perused what we have already written, pause ere they deduce therefrom
      a general moral;—for as yet they cannot anticipate our design, nor read our end.
No:—for we have yet more to write, and they have more to learn, of the Mysteries of
       London.
Strange as many of the incidents already recorded may be deemed,—wild and fanciful as much
      of our narrative up to this point may appear,—we have yet events more strange, and episodes
      more seemingly wild and fanciful, to narrate in the ensuing volume.
For the word "London" constitutes a theme whose details, whether of good or of
      evil, are inexhaustible: nor knew we, when we took up our pen to enter upon the subject, how
      vast—how mighty—how comprehensive it might be!
Ye, then, who have borne with us thus far, condescend to follow us on to the end:—we can
      promise that the spirit which has animated us up to this point will not flag as we prosecute
      our undertaking;—and, at the close, we feel convinced that more than one will be enabled to
      retrospect over some good and useful sentiment which will have been awakened in his soul by
      the perusal of "The Mysteries of London."
END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.
P. P. THOMS, PRINTER, 12, WARWICK SQUARE, LONDON.
