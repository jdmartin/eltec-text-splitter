CHAPTER CLXXXI.   THE RESURRECTION MAN AGAIN.
Anthony Tidkins was dressed in a most miserable manner; and his whole appearance denoted
      poverty and privation. He was thin and emaciated; his eyes were sunken; his cheeks hollow; and
      his entire countenance more cadaverous and ghastly than ever.
"My dear fellow," cried the Buffer, springing forward to meet him; "how glad I am to see you
      again. I really thought as how you was completely done for."
"And no thanks to you that I wasn't," returned the Resurrection Man gruffly. "Didn't you
      leave me to die like a dog in the plague-ship?"
"I've been as sorry about that there business, Tony, ever since it happened, as one can well
      be," said the Buffer: "but if you remember the hurry and bustle of the sudden panic that came
      over us, I'm sure you won't harbour no ill-feeling."
"Well, well—the least said, the soonest's mended," growled the Resurrection Man, taking his
      friend's hand. "Holloa, Lafleur! What are you doing here?"
"Business—business, Mr. Tidkins," answered the valet; "and you're the very man we are in
      want of."
"The very man," echoed the Buffer. "I give up the command of the expedition to him: he's my
      old captain."
"In the first place, order me up some grub and a pint of brandy," said the Resurrection Man;
      "for I've been precious short of every thing at all decent in the eating or drinking way of
      late;—and while I refresh myself with some supper, you can tell me what new scheme there is in
      the wind. Of course I'm your man, if there's any good to be done."
The waiter was summoned: Lafleur ordered him to bring up the entire contents of the larder,
      together with a bottle of brandy; and when these commands were obeyed, the Resurrection Man
      fell to work with extraordinary voracity, while the French valet briefly explained to him the
      nature of the business already propounded to the Buffer.
The hopes of obtaining a considerable sum of money animated the eyes of Tidkins with fire
      and his cadaverous countenance with a glow of fiendish satisfaction. He highly approved of the
      idea of engaging the Lully Prig and Long Bob in the enterprise; for he entertained a good
      opinion of their courage, in spite of the affair of the plague-ship. Indeed, he could well
      understand the invincible nature of the panic-terror which had seized upon them on that
      occasion; and, as he foresaw that their co-operation would be valuable in other matters, he
      was disposed to forget the past.
In fine, all the preliminary arrangements were made with Lafleur, who presented the two
      villains each with a ten pound-note as an earnest of his sincerity, and then took his
      departure.
When the Resurrection Man and the Buffer were alone together, they brewed themselves strong
      glasses of brandy and water, lighted their pipes, and naturally began to discourse on what had
      passed since they last saw each other.
The Buffer related all that had occurred to him after his return to Mossop's wharf,—how he
      had been pursued by the three men belonging to the Blossom,—how one turned out to be
      Richard Markham, another a policeman in disguise, and the third Morcar,—how they had vainly
      searched the Fairy to discover Anthony Tidkins,—and how he himself eventually sold
      the lighter.
"Since then," added the Buffer, "I have not been doing much, and was deuced glad when
      Greenwood's valet came to me last evening and made an appointment with me for to-night to talk
      upon some business of importance. You know what that business is; and I hope it will turn up a
      trump—that's all."
"Then the whole affair of the Blossom was a damnation plant?" cried the
      Resurrection Man, gnashing his teeth with rage. "And that hated Markham was at the bottom of
      it all? By the thunders of heaven, I'll have the most deadly vengeance! But how came you to
      learn that Morcar was one of the three?"
"Because I heard Markham call him by that name when they all boarded the Fairy; and
      I instantly remembered the gipsy that you had often spoken about. But what do you think? He
      was the Black—the counterfeit Brummagem scoundrel that could neither speak nor hear. The
      captain was the blue-bottle; and Markham, I s'pose, had kept down below during the time the
       Blossom was at Mossop's. It was a deuced good scheme of theirs; and if you hadn't
      been left in the plague-ship, it might have gone precious hard with you."
"Well said, Jack," observed the Resurrection Man. "Out of evil sometimes comes good, as the
      parsons say. But that shan't prevent me from doing Master Richard Markham a turn yet."
"You must go to Italy, then," said the Buffer laconically.
"What gammon's that?" demanded Tidkins.
"Why, I happened yesterday morning to look at a newspaper in the parlour down stairs, and
      there I read of a battle which took place in some country with a cursed hard name in Italy,
      about three weeks ago; and what should I see but a long rigmarole about the bravery of
       'our gallant fellow-countryman, Mr. Richard Markham,' and 'the great delight it
       would be to all the true friends of freedom to learn that he was not retained amongst the
       prisoners'."
"But perhaps he was killed in the battle, the scoundrel?" said the Resurrection Man.
"No, he wasn't," answered the Buffer; "for the moment I saw that all this nonsense was about
      him, I read the whole article through; and I found that he had been taken prisoner,
      but had either been let go or had made his escape. No one, however, seems to know what's
      become of him;—so p'r'aps he's on his way back to this country."
"I'd much sooner he'd get hanged or shot in Italy," said the Resurrection Man. "But if he
      ever does come home again, I'll be square with him—and no mistake."
"Now you know all that has happened to me
      Tony," exclaimed the Buffer, "have the kindness to tell us how you got out of
      that cursed scrape in the Lady Anne."
"I will," said the Resurrection Man, refilling his glass. "After you all ran away in that
      cowardly fashion, I tried to climb after you; but I fell back insensible. When I awoke, the
      broad day-light was shining overhead; and a boy was looking down at me from the deck. He asked
      me what I was doing there. I rose with great difficulty; but I was much refreshed with the
      long sleep I had enjoyed. The boy disappeared; and in a few minutes the surgeon came and
      hailed me down the hatchway. I begged him to help me up out of the hold, and I would tell him
      every thing. He ordered me to throw aside my pistols and cutlass, and he would assist me to
      gain the deck. I did as he commanded me. He and the boy then lowered a rope, with a noose; I
      put my foot in the noose, grasped the rope tight, and was hauled up. The surgeon instantly
      presented a pistol, and said, 'If you attempt any violence, I'll shoot you through the
       head.' I declared that nothing was farther from my intention, and begged him to give me
      some refreshment. This request was complied with; and I then felt so much better, that I was
      able to walk with comparative ease. It, however, seemed as if I had just recovered from a long
      illness: for I was weak, and my head was giddy. I told the surgeon that I was an honest
      hard-working man; that I had come down to Gravesend the day before to see a friend; and had
      fallen in with some persons who offered me a job for which I should be well paid; that I
      assented, and accompanied them to their boat; that when I understood the nature of their
      business, I declared I would have nothing more to do with it; that they swore they would blow
      my brains out if I made any noise; that I was compelled to board the ship with them; that when
      some sudden sound alarmed them as they were examining the goods in the hold, they knocked me
      down with the butt-end of a pistol; and that I remembered nothing more until the boy awoke me
      by calling out to me from the deck. The surgeon believed my story, and said, 'A serious
       offence has been perpetrated, and you must declare all you know of the matter before a
       magistrate.' I of course signified my willingness to do so, because I saw that the only
      chance of obtaining my liberty was by gaining the good opinion of the surgeon; for he had a
      loaded pistol in his hand—I was unarmed—and the police-boat was within hail. 'But,
       according to the quarantine laws,' continued the surgeon, 'you cannot be permitted
       to leave the vessel for the present; and what guarantee have I for your good behaviour while
       you are on board?'"
"That was a poser," observed the Buffer.
"No such thing," said the Resurrection Man. "I spoke with so much apparent sincerity, and
      with such humility, that I quite gained the surgeon's good opinion. I said, 'You can lock
       me in your cabin during the day, sir; or you can bind my hands with cords; and, at night, I
       can sleep in the hold from which you released me, with the hatches battened
       down.'—'I really do believe you to be an honest man,' exclaimed the surgeon;
       'but I must adopt some precaution. You shall be at large during the day; and I think it
       right to give you due notice that I carry loaded pistols constantly with me. At night you
       shall sleep in the hold, with the hatches battened down, as you say.' I affected to
      thank him very sincerely for his kindness in leaving me at liberty during the day; and he then
      repaired to the fore-cabin to attend to his patients."
"Hadn't he got the plague himself?" inquired the Buffer.
"No: but the fœtid atmosphere of the fore-cabin, to which he was compelled so frequently to
      expose himself, had made him as emaciated and as pale as if he had only just recovered from
      the malady. I got into conversation with the boy, and found that he had contrived, shortly
      after you and the others decamped, to free his arms from the cords with which we had bound
      him; and that his first care was to release the surgeon. They neither of them entertained the
      remotest suspicion that any of the pirates were left in the ship, until the boy discovered me
      in the hold shortly after day-break."
"Well—and how did you escape after all?"
"I remained three or four days on board, before I put any scheme into force, although I
      planned a great many. At night I could do nothing, because I was a prisoner in the hold; and
      during the day the police-boat was constantly about, besides the sentinels on land. The
      surgeon always made me go down into the hold while it was still day-light; and never let me
      out again until after sunrise; so that I was always in confinement during the very time that I
      might contrive something to effect my escape from that infernal pest-ship. But the surgeon
      seemed afraid to trust me when it was dark. I never passed such a miserable time in my life.
      The slight touch that I had experienced of the plague—for it could have been nothing else—kept
      me in a constant fear lest it should return with increased force. How often did I mutter the
      most bitter curses against you and the other pals for abandoning me;—but now, in consequence
      of what you told me of the plant that Markham had set a-going against me, I am not sorry to
      think that I was left behind in the plague-ship. One evening—I think it was the fifth after my
      first entrance into the vessel—I observed that it was growing darker and darker; and yet the
      surgeon did not appear on deck with his loaded pistol to send me below. The boy was walking
      about eyeing me suspiciously; and at length he went down into the after-cabin. It struck me
      that the surgeon was probably indulging in a nap, and that the lad would awake him. It was not
      quite dark; but still I fancied that it was dusk enough to leap from the bow of the ship,
      which part of the vessel was high and dry, without alarming the sentinels on shore. At all
      events the chance was worth the trial. Seizing a handspike, I hurried forward, and sprang from
      the ship. Then, without losing a moment, I ran along the bank towards Gravesend, as rapidly as
      I could. In a short time I knew that I was safe. I hurled the handspike into the Thames, and
      walked on to the Lobster Tavern. There I obtained a bed—for I had plenty of ready
      money in my pocket. My only regret was that I had not been able to bring away any of the
      gold-dust with me."
"Why didn't you knock the surgeon and the boy on the head, and help yourself?" demanded the
      Buffer.
"So I should if I had seen a chance," replied the Resurrection Man; "but I was so weak and
      feeble all the time I was on board, that I was no match even for the young lad; and the
      surgeon always kept at such a distance, with a loaded pistol ready cocked in his hand, when I
      was ordered into the hold
      of an evening, or called up of a morning, that there wasn't a shadow of a chance.
      Well, I slept at the Lobster Tavern, and departed very early in the morning—long
      before it was day-light. I thought that London would be too hot for me, after every thing that
      had lately occurred; and I resolved to pay a visit to Walmer—my own native place. I was still
      too weak to walk many miles without resting; and so I took nearly four days to reach Walmer.
      Besides, I kept to the fields, and avoided the high road as much as possible. I took up my
      quarters at a small inn on the top of Walmer hill, and then made inquiries concerning all the
      people I had once known in or about the village. I have often related the former incidents of
      my life to you; and you will therefore recollect the baronet who was exchequered for
      smuggling, and was welcomed with open arms by his friends, when he paid the fine. You also
      remember all that occurred between him and me. I found that he had married his cook-maid, who
      ruled him with a rod of iron; and that the 'very select society' of Walmer and Deal
      had all cut him on account of that connexion, which was much worse in their eyes than all the
      smuggling in which he had been engaged. In fact, he was a hero when prosecuted for smuggling;
      but now no decent persons could associate with him, since he had married his
      scullion. In a word, I learnt that he was as miserable as I could have wished him to be."
"And didn't you inquire after your friend the parson?" demanded the Buffer.
"You may be sure I did," returned the Resurrection Man. "He had made himself very
      conspicuous for refusing the sacrament to a young woman who was seduced by her lover, and had
      an illegitimate child; and the 'select society' of Walmer greatly applauded him for
      his conduct. At length, about a year ago, it appears, this most particular of all clergymen
      was discovered by a neighbouring farmer in too close a conversation with the said farmer's
      wife; and his reverence was compelled to decamp, no one knows where. He, however, left his
      wife and children to the public charity. That charity was so great, that the poor woman and
      family are now inmates of the very workhouse where his reverence's slightest wish was once a
      law. I stayed at Walmer for nearly a week; and then departed suddenly for Ramsgate, with the
      contents of the landlord's till in my pocket. At Ramsgate I put up at a small public-house
      where I was taken dreadfully ill. For four months I was confined to my bed; and both landlord
      and landlady were very kind to me. At length I slowly began to recover; and, when I was well
      enough to walk abroad, I used to go upon the beach to inhale the sea-air. It was then
      summertime; and bathing was all the rage. I never was more amused in my life than to see the
      ladies, old as well as young, sitting on the beach, to all appearance deeply buried in the
      novels which they held in their hands, but in reality watching, with greedy eyes, the men
      bathing scarcely fifty yards off."
"You don't mean to say that?" cried the Buffer.
"I do indeed, though," returned Tidkins. "It was the commonest thing in the world for
      elderly dames and young misses to go out walking along the beach, or to sit down on it, close
      by the very spot where the men bathed, although there were plenty of other places to choose
      either for rambling or reading. Well, I stayed two more months at Ramsgate; and as the
      landlord and landlady of the public-house had behaved so kind to me, I took nothing from them
      when I went away. I merely left my little account unsettled. I walked over to Margate, with
      the intention of taking the steamer to London Bridge; but just as I was stepping on the jetty,
      some one tapped me on the shoulder, and, turning round, I beheld my landlord of the little inn
      on the top of Walmer hill. All my excuses, promises, and entreaties were of no avail: the man
      collared me—a crowd collected—a constable was sent for, and I was taken before a magistrate.
      Of course I was committed for trial, and sent across in a cart to Canterbury gaol. There I lay
      till the day before yesterday, when the sessions came on. By some extraordinary circumstance
      or another, no prosecutor appeared before the Grand Jury; and I was discharged. I resolved to
      come back to London;—for, after all, London is the place for business in our way. With all its
      police, it's the best scene for our labours. So here I am; and the moment I set foot in this
      ken, I find employment waiting for me."
"Well, I'm sorry to hear you've been lumbered, old feller," cried the respectable Mr. John
      Wicks; "but it's a blessin' the prosecutor never come for'ard. Let's, however, think of the
      present; and botheration to the past. I'm heartily glad you've turned up again. I was precious
      nigh going into mourning for you, Tony. Joking apart, though—this business of the Frenchman's
      looks well; and we must be about early to look after the Lully Prig and Long Bob. I know their
      haunts down by Execution Dock, just opposite to Mossop's."
"Where are you hanging out now, Jack?" inquired the Resurrection Man.
"Me and Moll has got a room in Greenhill's Rents—at the bottom of Saint John's Street, you
      know," was the answer.
"Well, I shall sleep here to-night," said the Resurrection Man; "and by six o'clock
      to-morrow morning I shall expect you."
