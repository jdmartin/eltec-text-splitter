CHAPTER CCVII.   THE HUSBAND, THE WIFE, AND THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN.
"Mercy! mercy!" were the words that burst from the lips of the affrighted lady, ere she
      paused to reflect whether the preceding conversation had been overheard or not.
"Rise," said Lord Ravensworth, his quivering lip, flashing eye, hectic cheek, heaving chest,
      and clenched hand denoting a more powerful excitement than he had experienced for a long, long
      time. "Rise, madam: this is a subject which cannot be disposed of in passionate
      ejaculations;—it requires a calmer deliberation—for the honour of two noble families is now at
      stake!"
"Then you know all!" cried Adeline, in an agonising tone, as she embraced her husband's
      knees.
"Yes—I overheard enough to enable me to comprehend the whole truth," returned the nobleman,
      who for the time being seemed to have altogether thrown off the apathetic lethargy which had
      characterised him lately with such few intermissions.
Then, as he was yet speaking, he forcibly raised his wife from her suppliant position, and
      placed her upon the ottoman.
Taking a chair near her, he pointed to another, and, glancing towards Lydia, said in a tone
      rather mournful than angry, "Young woman, be seated."
Lydia obeyed mechanically; for she herself was alarmed at the serious turn which the affair
      had taken.
"Adeline," said the nobleman, after a short pause, during which he evidently endeavoured to
      compose his feelings as much as possible, "before we enter upon this sad topic, I must in
      justice to myself observe that I did not seek your chamber to play the eaves-dropper. I felt
      unwell in the drawing-room ere now, and I retired to my own cabinet to solace myself in the
      usual manner with the meerschaum. But it struck me that I had been better during all
      the early part of the morning than for some weeks past; and, after a long struggle with
      myself, I resolved to renounce the pipe. On my return to the drawing-room, I heard that you
      were suddenly indisposed; and I came hither to inquire after you. But at the moment I reached
      your door, I overheard words which struck me as with a thunderbolt. Then I listened—and
      overheard much—too much!"
"And now you hate—you despise me!" cried Adeline, wildly: "you will thrust me forth from
      your dwelling—you will cover me with shame! No—no," she added hysterically, "death—death
      before such a fate!"
"Calm yourself, Adeline," said Lord Ravensworth, who evidently suppressed his own feelings
      with great difficulty: "I before observed that there is the honour of two families to
      preserve—that of Rossville and of Ravensworth. Give me your Bible."
"My Bible!" exclaimed Adeline, in astonishment mingled with alarm.
"Yes—your Bible. Where is it?"
"There—there!" said Adeline in a faint tone—for she was at a loss to divine the meaning or
      intention of her husband; and that mysterious uncertainty filled her with vague fears.
Lydia rose, and taking the Bible from a small book-case to which Lady Ravensworth pointed,
      handed it to the nobleman.
"Will you swear, Adeline," he said, in a solemn and impressive tone,—"will you swear upon
      this volume which contains the Word of God, that the child you now bear in your bosom is mine,
      and that since your marriage you have never forgotten the fidelity due to a husband? Will you
      swear this, Adeline?"
"I will—I will!" she exclaimed, in almost a joyful tone, as if she were satisfied that her
      conjugal faith should be put to such a test.
"Swear, then," said Lord Ravensworth; "and invoke God to cast you dead—dead this minute at
      my feet—if you swear falsely."
"I do—I do!" cried Lady Ravensworth: then, taking the holy volume in her hand, she said in a
      calmer and more measured tone, "I swear, as I hope for future salvation, that I have never
      been unfaithful, even in thought, to my marriage vow, and that the child I bear in my bosom is
      my husband's. This I swear by every thing sacred and holy; and if I have sworn falsely, may
      the great God cast me dead at your feet."
She then kissed the book.
There was a solemn pause:—Lady Ravensworth was now perhaps the most composed of the three,
      for she saw that her husband was satisfied in all that concerned his own honour since the day
      he had led her to the altar.
As for Lydia—she was overawed and even alarmed at that imposing ceremony of a husband
      administering an oath to his wife; and Lord Ravensworth remained for some moments absorbed in
      deep thought.
"Yes," he suddenly exclaimed, as if continuing aloud the thread of his silent thoughts,—"the
      honour of two families must be preserved! And, after all,—perhaps I am rightly served! A man
      of my years should have sought a partner of a fitting age; but it is the fault—the error—the
      curse of elderly men to believe that their rank and wealth warrant them in seeking some young
      girl who may thus become as it were a victim. Then mothers take advantage of that longing to
      obtain a wife of comparatively tender years; and those worldly-minded parents——"
"My lord—my lord, spare my feelings!" ejaculated Adeline, now painfully excited. "My mother
      knew not of her daughter's frailty——"
"Well—enough on that head!" said Lord Ravensworth, somewhat impatiently. "The past cannot be
      recalled: let us secure the honour of the future. You have erred in your girlhood, Adeline!
      and there," he added, indicating Lydia, "is one who knows that sad secret. You have been
      ungrateful to her—by her accusations and your acknowledgment; and she holds
      you in her power. Not you alone:—but she holds your family and
      mine—for an exposure would create a scandal that must redound upon us all!"
"I have no wish to avail myself of the possession of that secret for such an object," said
      Lydia. "I have two motives for desiring to remain at least a year in her ladyship's
      service."
"Never!" cried Adeline, emphatically. "It is you who have made all this mischief!"
"Silence, Adeline," said Lord Ravensworth,
      sternly; then, turning towards Lydia, he added, "Young woman, proceed—and speak
      frankly."
"I stated that I had two objects to serve in being anxious to remain in her ladyship's
      service for one year," continued Lydia. "In the first place, I have been so unfortunate—so
      very, very miserable, that I wish to earn my livelihood by servitude; and it is my hope to
      remain here until her ladyship can conscientiously give me such a character as will ensure me
      a good situation elsewhere."
"That is naturally understood," observed Lord Ravensworth. "What is your second motive?"
"My second motive!" repeated Lydia, with the least accent of bitterness: "oh! that I will
      explain to her ladyship in private—and she will be satisfied!"
"Now listen to me," said the nobleman. "Lady Ravensworth dislikes the idea that you should
      remain here. I will give you the means of settling yourself comfortably for life, if you will
      leave forthwith, and promise solemnly to preserve that fatal secret which you possess."
"My lord," answered Lydia, respectfully but firmly, "I return you my most sincere thanks for
      that bounteous offer which I am compelled to decline. Were I to accept your lordship's
      conditions, my aims would not be answered. In respect to my first object, I have determined to
      earn a character that may to some extent retrieve the past;—for, as your lordship must have
      gathered from the conversation which you overheard, I have been unfortunate—very
      unfortunate!"
"Merciful heavens!" exclaimed Adeline; "how can I retain you in my service? You have
      belonged to a class—oh! no—it is impossible—impossible!"
"I do not wish to insult your feelings, young woman," said Lord Ravensworth; "especially
      since you manifest so praiseworthy a desire to retrieve your character. But you must perceive
      the impossibility, as her ladyship observes, of retaining you in our service. You might be
      known—recognised——"
"I understand your lordship," interrupted Lydia, bitterly; "I might be recognised as an
      unhappy creature who had once earned a livelihood by parading the public streets. That is
      scarcely probable:—I am much changed since then. The kindness of an excellent lady has enabled
      me to recruit my strength and to recover a healthy appearance. Yes—I must be altered; for your
      lordship does not perceive in me the poor miserable starving wretch who some few months since
      accosted her ladyship in Saint James's Street."
"Ah! I recollect," exclaimed the nobleman, as the incident flashed to his mind. "I only
      observed you for a moment on that occasion; but still—so miserable was your appearance—it made
      an impression on my mind. Yes—you are indeed changed! Nevertheless, those who saw you in an
      unhappy career, before you became so reduced as you were on the occasion which you have
      mentioned, might recognise you. And—pardon my frankness, young woman; but the subject admits
      not of the measurement of words—what would be thought of me—of my wife—of all the other
      members of my household——"
"If I were seen in your establishment, your lordship would add," exclaimed Lydia. "I admit
      the truth of all your lordship states: still my wish to remain a member of that establishment
      is unchanged. For—as your lordship may have ere now gathered from our conversation—it was her
      ladyship who first placed me in those paths which led to my ruin; and it must be her ladyship
      who shall aid me in earning an honourable character once more."
"But this punishment is too severe!" exclaimed Adeline, almost wringing her hands; for she
      perceived how completely the honour of two families was in Lydia's power.
"Consider, I implore you, the position of my wife," said the nobleman: "in a few weeks she
      will become a mother!"
"My lord, her ladyship never had any consideration for me, from the first moment that I
      ceased to be useful to her," returned Lydia, with inexorable firmness; "and I cannot consent
      to sacrifice what I consider to be my own interests to her ladyship's wishes now."
Then Lydia Hutchinson rose, as if to intimate that her determination was unchangeable; and
      that obscure girl was enabled to dictate her own terms to the noble peer and the proud
      peeress.
"It must be so, then—it must be so," said Lord Ravensworth, with a vexation of manner which
      he could not conceal. "You shall have an apartment in my establishment and handsome wages:—all
      I exact is that you do not force your attentions on her ladyship save when she demands
      them."
"If I remain here, it must be in the capacity of her ladyship's principal attendant,"
      returned Lydia: "otherwise I could not fairly earn a good character in the eyes of the other
      dependants of your lordship."
"Perdition! young woman," exclaimed the nobleman; "you demand too much!"
"More than I will ever concede," added Lady Ravensworth, unable to restrain a glance of
      malignity and desperate hate towards Lydia Hutchinson.
"Then your lordship will permit me to take my departure," said she, calmly; and she moved
      towards the door.
"My God! she will reveal every thing!" almost shrieked Lady Ravensworth.
"Yes—every thing," said Lydia, returning the look which Adeline had cast on her a few
      moments before.
"Stay, young woman—this may not be!" ejaculated Lord Ravensworth. "You exercise your power
      with a fearful despotism."
"The world has been a fearful despot towards me, my lord," was the firm but calm reply.
"And with your tyranny in this respect you will kill my wife—kill my yet unborn child!"
      exclaimed the nobleman, rising from his seat and pacing the room in a state of desperate
      excitement. "But the honour of the Rossvilles and the Ravensworths must be preserved—at any
      sacrifice—at any risk!—Yes—though you bring misery into this house, here must you remain—since
      such is your inflexible will. Were an exposure to take place, the consequences—my God! would
      be awful—crushing! The finger of ridicule and scorn would point at me—the elderly man who
      espoused the young and beautiful girl, and who was so proud that he had won her for a wife!
      And then—should the child of which she is so soon to become a mother, prove a son—although the
      law would recognise him as the heir to my name and fortune, yet the scandalous world would
      throw doubts, perhaps, on his legitimacy. Ah! the thought is maddening! And my brother—my
      brother too——"
Lord Ravensworth checked himself in the midst of those musings, into the audible expression
      of which the agitation of his mind had hurried him:—he
      checked himself, for the convulsive sobs which came from his wife's lips suddenly
      reminded him that every word he was uttering pierced like a dagger into her soul.
"Oh! God have mercy upon me!" she exclaimed, in a voice scarcely audible through the
      convulsions of her grief: "how dearly—dearly am I now paying for the errors of my youth!"
"Does that sight not move you, woman?" muttered the nobleman between his grinding teeth, as
      he accosted Lydia, and pointed to the lamentable condition of his wife.
"My lord, I lost all by serving the interests of her who is now Lady Ravensworth; and it is
      time that I should think only of my own."
This reply was given with a frigid—stern—and inexorable calmness, that struck despair to the
      heart of the unhappy nobleman and his still more wretched wife.
"Then be it all as you say—be it all as you wish, despotic woman!" cried Lord Ravensworth.
      "Remain here—command us all—drive us to despair—for our honour is unhappily in your
      remorseless hands."
With these words, the nobleman rushed from the room in a state bordering on distraction.
A few minutes of profound silence elapsed.
Lydia remained standing near the mantel, gazing with joyful triumph on Adeline, whose head
      was buried in her hands, and whose bosom gave vent to convulsive sobs.
Suddenly Lady Ravensworth looked up, and gazed wildly around her.
"He is gone—and you are still there!" she said, in a low and hoarse voice. "Now we are alone
      together—and doubtless I am to look upon you as one determined to drive me to despair. What
      other motive had you for insisting upon remaining here?"
"Lady, I will now explain myself," returned Lydia, speaking slowly and solemnly. "It pierced
      me to the heart to cause so much grief to that good nobleman, of whom you are so utterly
      unworthy; but for you I have no kind consideration—no mercy. Adeline, I hate you—I loathe
      you—I detest you!"
"Merciful heavens!" exclaimed Lady Ravensworth: "and you are to be constantly about my
      person!"
"Yes: and my second motive for remaining here to enjoy that privilege," continued Lydia,
      bitterly, "is vengeance!"
"Vengeance!" repeated Adeline, recoiling as it were from the terrible word, and clasping her
      hands franticly together.
"Vengeance—vengeance!" continued Lydia Hutchinson. "Before the rest of the world I shall
      appear the humble and respectful dependant—yes, even in the presence of your husband. But when
      alone with you, I shall prove a very demon, whose weapons are galling reproaches, ignominies,
      insults, and indignities."
"Oh! this is terrible!" cried Adeline, as if her senses were leaving her. "You cannot be
      such a fiend."
"I can—I will!" returned Lydia. "Have I not undergone enough to make me so? And all was
      occasioned by you! When I was your wretched tool, you promised me the affection of a
      sister; and how did you fulfil your pledge? You came to me at a house where I was a governess,
      and whence I was anxious to remove from the importunities of the master; and there you threw
      off the mask. I then saw the hollowness of your soul. My father died of a broken heart, and my
      brother perished in a duel, in consequence of my iniquity. But who had made me criminal?
       You! I called upon you at Rossville House at a time when a little sympathy on your
      part might have still saved me; for I should have felt that I had one friend still
      left. But you scorned me—you even menaced me; and I then warned you that I was absolved from
      all motives of secrecy on your account. Your black ingratitude drove me to despair; and I
      immediately afterwards fell to the lowest grade in the social sphere—that of a prostitute!
      Yes—for I need use no nice language with you. All the miseries I endured in my wretched career
      I charge upon your head. And ere now you menaced me again: you threatened to accuse me falsely
      of a crime that would render me amenable to the criminal tribunals of the country. It only
      required that to fill the cup of your base ingratitude to the very brim. And think
      you that your malignant—your spiteful glances,—your looks of bitter, burning hate,—were lost
      upon me? No—you would doubtless assassinate me, if you dared! Oh! I have long detested
      you—long loathed your very name! But, never—never, until we met in this room ere now, did I
      believe that my hatred against you was so virulent as it is. And never—never until this hour
      did I appreciate the sweets of vengeance. At present I can revel in those feelings:—I can
      wreak upon you—and I will—that revenge which my own miseries and the death of those
      whom I held dear have excited in my heart! Your ladyship now knows the terms of our connexion,
      for one year; and at the expiration of that period you will be glad—Oh! too glad to rid
      yourself of me by giving me a character that will never fail to procure for me a place in
      future."
With these words Lydia Hutchinson left the room.
Lady Ravensworth sank back in convulsions of anguish upon the ottoman.
And Lord Ravensworth,—who throughout the morning had experienced so much lightness of heart
      and mental calmness that he resolved to wrestle in future with that apathy and gloom which
      drove him to his pipe,—had shut himself up in his private cabinet, to seek solace once more in
      the fatal attractions of the oriental tobacco.
Thus had the presence of Lydia Hutchinson,—once despised, scorned, and trampled on,—brought
      desolation and misery into that lordly dwelling.
O Adeline, Adeline! thou wast now taught a bitter lesson illustrative of the terrible
      consequences of ingratitude!
The aristocracy conceives that it may insult the democracy with impunity. The high-born and
      the wealthy never stop to consider, when they put an affront upon the lowly and the poor,
      whether a day of retribution may not sooner or later come. The peer cannot see the necessity
      of conciliating the peasant: the daughter of the nobility knows not the use of making a friend
      of the daughter of the people.
But the meanest thing that crawls upon the earth may some day be in a position to avenge the
      injuries it has received from a powerful oppressor; and the mightiest lord or the noblest lady
      may be placed in that situation when even the friendship of the humblest son or the most
      obscure daughter of industry
      would be welcome as the drop of water to the lost wanderer of the desert.
Yes! Most solemnly do I proclaim to you, O suffering millions of these islands, that ye
      shall not always languish beneath the yoke of your oppressors! Individually ye shall each see
      the day when your tyrant shall crouch at your feet; and as a mass ye shall triumph over that
      proud oligarchy which now grinds you to the dust!
That day—that great day cannot be far distant; and then shall ye rise—not to wreak a savage
      vengeance on those who have so long coerced you, but to prove to them that ye know how to
      exercise a mercy which they never manifested towards you;—ye shall rise, not to convulse the
      State with a disastrous civil war, nor to hurry the nation on to the deplorable catastrophe of
      social anarchy, confusion, and bloodshed;—but ye shall rise to vindicate usurped rights, and
      to recover delegated and misused power, that ye may triumphantly assert the aristocracy of
      mind, and the aristocracy of virtue!
