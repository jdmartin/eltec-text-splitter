CHAPTER XXIX. THE BLACK CHAMBER.
ONCE more does the scene change.
The reader who follows us through the mazes of our narrative, has yet to be introduced to
      many strange places—many hideous haunts of crime, abodes of poverty, dens of horror, and
      lurking-holes of perfidy—as well as many seats of wealthy voluptuousness and aristocratic
      dissipation.
It will be our task to guide those who choose to accompany us, to scenes and places whose
      very existence may appear to belong to the regions of romance rather than to a city in the
      midst of civilisation, and whose characteristic features are as yet unknown to even those that
      are the best acquainted with the realities of life.
About a fortnight had elapsed since the events related in the preceding chapter.
In a small, high, well-lighted room five individuals were seated at a large round oaken
      table. One of these persons, who appeared to be the superior, was an elderly man with a high
      forehead, and thin white hair falling over the collar of his black coat. He was short and
      rather corpulent: his countenance denoted frankness and good-nature; but his eyes, which were
      small, grey, and sparkling, had a lurking expression of cunning, only perceptible to the acute
      observer. The other three individuals were young and gentlemanly-looking men, neatly dressed,
      and very deferential in their manners towards their superior.
The door of this room was carefully bolted. At one end of the table was a large black tray
      covered with an immense quantity of bread-seals of all sizes. Perhaps the reader may recall to
      mind that, amongst the pursuits and amusements of his school-days, he diverted himself with
      moistening the crumb of bread, and kneading it with his fingers into a consistency capable of
      taking and retaining an accurate impression
       of a seal upon a letter. The seals—or rather blank bread-stamps—now upon the
      tray, were of this kind, only more carefully manufactured, and well consolidated with thick
      gum-water.
Close by this tray, in a large wooden bowl were wafers of all sizes and colours; and in a
      box also standing on the table, were numbers of wafer-stamps of every dimension used. A second
      box contained thin blades of steel, set fast in delicate ivory handles, and sharp as razors. A
      third box was filled with sticks of sealing-wax of all colours, and of foreign as well as
      British manufacture. A small glass retort fixed over a spirit-lamp, was placed near one of the
      young men. A tin-box containing a little cushion covered with printer's red ink in one
      compartment, and several stamps such as the reader may have seen used in post-offices, in
      another division, lay open near the other articles mentioned. Lastly, an immense pile of
      letters—some sealed, and others wafered—stood upon that end of the table at which the elderly
      gentleman was seated.
The occupations of these five individuals may be thus described in a few words.
The old gentleman took up the letters one by one, and bent them open, as it were, in such a
      way, that he could read a portion of their contents when they were not folded in such a manner
      as effectually to conceal all the writing. He also examined the addresses, and consulted a
      long paper of official character which lay upon the table at his right hand. Some of the
      letters he threw, after as careful a scrutiny as he could devote to them without actually
      breaking the seals or wafers, into a large wicker basket at his feet. From time to time,
      however, he passed a letter to the young man who sate nearest to him.
If the letters were closed with wax, an impression of the seal was immediately taken by
      means of one of the bread stamps. The young man then took the letter and held it near the
      large fire which burnt in the grate until the sealing-wax became so softened by the heat that
      the letter could be easily opened without tearing the paper. The third clerk read it aloud,
      while the fourth took notes of its contents. It was then returned to the first young man, who
      re-sealed it by means of the impression taken on the bread stamp, and with wax which precisely
      matched that originally used in closing the letter. When this ceremony was performed, the
      letter was consigned to the same basket which contained those that had passed unopened through
      the hands of the Examiner.
If the letter were fastened with a wafer, the second clerk made the water in the little
      glass retort boil by means of the spirit-lamp; and when the vapour gushed forth from the tube,
      the young man held the letter to its mouth in such a way that the steam played full upon the
      identical spot where the wafer was placed. The wafer thus became moistened in a slight degree;
      and it was only then necessary to pass one of the thin steel blades skilfully beneath the
      wafer, in order to open the letter. The third young man then read this epistle, and the fourth
      took notes, as in the former instance. The contents being thus ascertained, the letter was
      easily fastened again with a very thin wafer of the same colour and size as the original; and
      if the job were at all clumsily done, the tin-box before noticed furnished the means of
      imprinting a red stamp upon the back of the letter, in such a way that a portion of the circle
      fell precisely over the spot beneath which the wafer was placed.
These processes were accomplished in total silence, save when the contents of the letters
      were read; and then, so accustomed were those five individuals to hear the revelations of the
      most strange secrets and singular communications, that they seldom appeared surprised or
      amused—shocked or horrified, at anything which those letters made known to them. Their task
      seemed purely of a mechanical kind: indeed, automatons could not have shewn less passion or
      excitement.
Oh! vile—despicable occupation,—performed, too, by men who went forth, with heads erect and
      confident demeanour, from their atrocious employment—after having violated those secrets which
      are deemed most sacred, and broken the seals which merchants, lovers, parents, relations, and
      friends, had placed upon their thoughts!
Base and diabolical outrage—perpetrated by the commands of the Ministers of the
      Sovereign!
Reader, this small, high, well-lighted room, in which such infamous scenes took place with
      doors well secured by bolts and bars, was the Black Chamber of the General Post-Office,
       Saint Martin's-le-Grand.
And now, reader, do you ask whether all this be true;—whether, in the very heart of the
      metropolis of the civilized world, such a system and such a den of infamy can exist;—whether,
      in a word, the means of transferring thought at a cheap and rapid rate, be really made
      available to the purposes of government and the ends of party policy? If you ask these
      questions, to each and all we confidently and boldly answer "Yes."
The first letter which the Examiner caused to be opened on the occasion when we introduce
      our readers to the Black Chamber, was from the State of Castelcicala, in Italy, to the
      representative of that Grand-Duchy at the English court. Its contents, when translated, ran
      thus:—

City of Montoni, Castelcicala.
"I am desired by my lord the Marquis of Gerrano, his Highness's Secretary of State for
       Foreign Affairs, to inform your Excellency that, in consequence of a general amnesty just
       proclaimed by His Serene Highness, and which includes all political prisoners and emigrants,
       passports to return to the Grand Duchy of Castelcicala, may be accorded to his Highness
       Alberto Prince of Castelcicala, nephew of his Serene Highness the Reigning Grand Duke, as
       well as to all other natives of Castelcicala now resident in England, but who may be desirous
       of returning to their own country,
"I have the honour to renew to your Excellency assurances of my most perfect
       consideration.
"Baron Ruperto, "Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, etc. etc.

The second letter perused upon this occasion, by the inmates of the Black Chamber, was from
      a famous London Banker to his father at Manchester:—

"You will be astounded, my dear father, when your eye meets the statement I am now at
       length compelled to make to you. The world believes my establishment to be as firmly based as
       the rocks themselves: my credit is unlimited, and thousands have confided their funds to my
       care. Alas, my dear father, I am totally insolvent: the least drain upon the bank would
       plunge me into irredeemable ruin and dishonour. I have, however, an opportunity of retrieving
       myself, and building up my fortunes: a certain government operation is proposed to me; and if
       I can undertake it, my profits will be immense. Fifty thousand pounds are absolutely
       necessary for my purposes within six days from the present time. Consider whether you will
       save your son by making him this advance; or allow him to sink into infamy, disgrace and
       ruin, by withholding it. Whichever way you may determine breathe not a word to a soul. The
       authorities in the Treasury have made all possible inquiries concerning me, and believe me to
       be not only solvent, but immensely rich. I expect your answer by return of post.
"Your affectionate but almost heart-broken son,
 "James Tomlinson."



The writer of this letter flattered himself that the government had already made "all
      possible enquiries:"—he little dreamt that his own epistle was to furnish the Treasury,
      through the medium of the Post Office, with the very information which he had so fondly deemed
      unknown to all save himself.
When the third letter was opened, the clerk whose duty it was to read it, looked at the
      signature, and, addressing himself to the Examiner, said, "From whom, sir, did you anticipate
      that this letter came?"
"From Lord Tremordyn. Is it not directed to Lady Tremordyn?" exclaimed the Examiner.
"It is, sir," answered the clerk. "But it is written by that lady's daughter Cecilia."
"I am very sorry for that. The Home Office," said the Examiner, "is particularly anxious to
      ascertain the intention of Lord Tremordyn in certain party matters; and it is known," he
      added, referring to the official paper beside him, "that his lordship communicates all his
      political sentiments to her ladyship, who is now at Bath."
"Then, sir, this letter need not be read?" cried the clerk interrogatively.
"Not read, young man!" ejaculated the Examiner, impatiently. "How often am I to tell you
      that every letter which is once opened, is to be carefully perused? Have we not been able to
      afford the government and the police some very valuable information at different times, by
      noting the contents of letters which we have opened by mistake?"
"Certainly," added the first clerk. "There is that deeply-planned and well-laid scheme of
      Stephens, and his young lady disguised as a man, who lives at Upper Clapton, which we
      discovered by the mere accident of opening a wrong letter."
"I beg your pardon, sir," said the clerk whose duty it was to read the epistles, and whose
      apology to the Examiner was delivered in a most deferential manner. "I will now proceed with
      the letter of the Honourable Miss Cecilia Huntingfield to her mother Lady Tremordyn."
The young clerk then read as follows:—

"Oh! my dear mother, how shall I find words to convey to you the fearful tale of my
       disgrace and infamy of which I am the unhappy and guilty heroine? A thousand times before you
       left London, I was on the point of throwing myself at your feet and confessing all! But, no—I
       could not—I dared not. And now, my dear parent, I can conceal my shame no longer! Oh! how
       shall I make you comprehend me, without actually entrusting this paper with the fearful
       secret! My God! I am almost distracted. Surely you can understand my meaning? If not, learn
       the doleful tidings at once, my dearest and most affectionate parent: I am about to
        become a mother! Oh! do not spurn me from you—do not curse your child! It has cost me
       pangs of anguish ineffable, and of mental agony an idea of which I could not convey to you,
       to sit down and rend your heart with this avowal. But, O heavens! what am I to do?
       Concealment is no longer possible: in three months more I shall be a mother! That
       villain Harborough—the friend of our family, Sir Rupert Harborough,—the man in whom my dear
       father put every confidence,—that wretch has caused my shame! And yet there are times, my
       dear mother, when I feel that I love him;—for he is the father of the child which must soon
       publish my disgrace! And now, my fond—confiding—tender parent, you know all. Oh! come to my
       rescue: adopt some means to conceal my shame;—shield me from my father's wrath! I can write
       no more at present: but my mind feels relieved now I have thus opened my heart to my
       mother.
"Your afflicted and almost despairing daughter,
 "Cecilia Huntingfield."

Thus was a secret involving the honour of a noble family,—a secret compromising the most
      sacred interests—revealed to five men at one moment, by means of the atrocious system pursued
      in the Black Chamber of the General Post Office.
The fourth letter was from Mr. Robert Stephens of London to his brother Mr. Frederick
      Stephens of Liverpool:—

"My dear Brother,
"I write you a few hasty instructions, to which I solicit your earnest attention. You are
       well aware that the 26th instant is my grand day—the day to which I have been so long and so
       anxiously looking forward. All my schemes are so well organised that detection is impossible.
       That fellow Montague gave me a little trouble a fortnight or so ago, by suddenly and most
       unexpectedly declaring that he would not act as the witness of identity; and I was actually
       compelled to give him five hundred pounds to silence him. What could have been his motive for
       shirking out of the affair, I cannot tell. Be that as it may, I have supplied his place with
       another and better man—a lawyer of the name of Mac Chizzle. But now for my instructions. The
       grand blow will be struck soon after mid-day on the 26th instant. Immediately it is done, I
       shall give Walter (I always speak of HER as a man) the ten thousand pounds I have
       promised him; and then off to Liverpool in a post-chaise and four. Now, if there be a packet
       for America on the 27th, secure me a berth; if not, ascertain if there be a vessel sailing
       for Havre or Bordeaux on that day, and then secure me a berth in such ship:—but should there
       be none in this instance also, then obtain a list of all the ships which, according to
       present arrangements, are to leave Liverpool on the 27th, with their places of destination
       and all other particulars.
"Burn this letter the moment you have read it: we then know that it cannot possibly have
       told tales.
"Your affectionate brother,
 "Robert Stephens."

Poor deluded man! he believed that letters confided to the General Post Office
      administration could "tell no tales" during their progress from the sender to the
      receiver:—how miserably was he mistaken!
And here we may observe that if the system of opening letters at the General Post Office
      were merely adopted for the purpose of discovering criminals and preventing crime, we should
      still deprecate the proceeding, although our objections would lose much of their point in
      consideration of the motive: but when we find—and know it to be a fact—that the secrets of
      correspondence are flagrantly violated for political and other purposes, we raise our voice to
      denounce so atrocious a system, and to excite the indignation of the country against the men
      who can countenance or avail themselves of it!
Numerous other letters were read upon the occasion referred to in this chapter; and their
      contents carefully noted down. The whole ceremony was conducted with so much regularity and
      method, that it proceeded with amazing despatch; and the re-fastening of the letters was
      managed with such skill that in few, if any instances, were the slightest traces left to
      excite suspicion of the process to which those epistles had been subjected.
It was horrible to see that old man forgetting the respectability of his years, and those
      four young ones laying aside the fine feelings which ought to have animated their bosoms,—it
      was horrible to see them earnestly, systematically, and skilfully devoting themselves to an
      avocation the most disgraceful, soul-debasing, and morally execrable!
When the ceremony of opening, reading, and re-sealing the letters was concluded, one of the
      clerks conveyed the basket containing them to that department of the establishment where they
      were to undergo the process of sorting and sub-sorting for despatch by the evening mails; and
      the Examiner then proceeded to make his reports to the various offices of the government. The
      notes of the despatch from Castelcicala were forwarded to the Foreign Secretary: the contents
      of the Banker's letter to his father were copied and sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer:
      the particulars of Miss Cecilia Huntingfield's affecting
       epistle to her mother were entered in a private book in case they should be
      required at a future day;—and an exact copy of Robert Stephens' letter to his brother was
      forwarded to the Solicitor of the Bank of England.
