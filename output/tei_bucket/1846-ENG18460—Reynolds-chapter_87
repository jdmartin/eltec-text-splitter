CHAPTER LXXXVII. THE PROFESSOR OF MESMERISM.
ELLEN had already been long enough from home to incur the chance of exciting surprise or
      alarm at her absence; she was therefore compelled to postpone her visit to the Professor of
      Mesmerism until the following day.
On her return to the Place, after an absence of nearly three hours, her fears were to some
      extent realised, her father being uneasy at her disappearance for so long a period. She
      availed herself of this opportunity to acquaint Mr. Monroe with her anxiety to devote her
      talents to some useful purpose, in order to earn at least sufficient to supply them both with
      clothes, and thus spare as much as possible the purse of their benefactor. Her father highly
      approved of this laudable aim; and Ellen assured him that one of the families, for whom she
      had once worked at the West End, had promised to engage her as a teacher of music and drawing
      for a few hours every week. It will be recollected that the old man had invariably been led to
      believe that his daughter was occupied in private houses with her needle, when she was really
      in the service of the statuary, the artist, the sculptor, and the photographer: he therefore
      now readily put faith in the tale which Ellen told him, and even undertook not only to
      communicate her intention to Markham, but also to prevent him from throwing any obstacle in
      its way. This task the old man accomplished that very day; and thus Ellen triumphed over the
      chief difficulty which she had foreseen—namely, that of accounting for the frequent absence
      from home which her new pursuits would render imperative. And this duplicity towards her sire
      she practised without a blush. Oh! what a wreck of virtue and chastity had the mind of that
      young female become!
The Professor of Mesmerism occupied a handsome suite of apartments in New Burlington Street.
      He was a man of about fifty, of prepossessing exterior, elegant manners, and intelligent mind.
      He spoke English fluently, and was acquainted with many continental languages besides his
      own.
It was mid-day when Miss Monroe was ushered into his presence.
The Professor was evidently struck by the beauty of her appearance; but he held her virtue
      at no high estimation, in consequence of the source of her recommendation to him. Little cared
      he, however, whether she were a paragon of moral excellence, or an example of female
      degradation: his connexion with her was to be based upon a purely commercial ground; and he
      accordingly set about an explanation of his views and objects. Ellen listened with attention,
      and agreed to become the patient of the mesmerist.
Thus, having sold her countenance to the statuary, her likeness to the artist, her bust to
      the sculptor, her entire form to the photographer, and her virtue to a libertine, she disposed
      of her dreams to the mesmerist.
Several days were spent in taking lessons and studying her part, under the tutelage of the
      Professor. She was naturally of quick comprehension; and this practice was easy to her. Her
      initiation was therefore soon complete; and the Professor at length resolved upon giving a
      private exhibition of "the truths of Mesmerism practically illustrated" to a few friends.
      Ellen took a feigned name; and all the preliminary arrangements were settled.
The memorable evening arrived; and by eight o'clock the Professor's drawing-room was filled
      with certain select individuals, all of whom were favourably inclined towards the "science" of
      Mesmerism. Some of them, indeed, were perfectly enthusiastic in behalf of this newly-revived
      doctrine. The reporters of the press were rigidly excluded from this meeting, with two or
      three exceptions in favour of journals which were known to be friendly to the principle of
      Animal Magnetism.
When the guests were thus assembled, Ellen was led into the apartment. She was desired to
      seat herself comfortably in an easy arm-chair; and the Professor then commenced his
      manipulations, "with a view to produce coma, or mesmeric sleep." In about five
      minutes Ellen sank back, apparently in a profound sleep, with the eyes tightly closed.
The Professor then expatiated upon the truths of the science of Mesmerism; and the assembled
      guests eagerly drank in every word he uttered. At length he touched upon
      Clairvoyance, which he explained in the following manner:—
"Clairvoyance," he said, "is the most extraordinary result of Animal Magnetism. It
      enables the person magnetised to foretel events relating both to themselves and others; to
      describe places which they have never visited, and houses the interior of which they have
      never seen; to read books opened and held behind their heads; to delineate the leading points
      of pictures in a similar position; to read a letter through its envelope; to describe the
      motions or actions of a person in another room, with a wall intervening; and to narrate events
      passing in far distant places."
The Professor then proposed to give practical illustrations of the phenomena which he had
      just described.
The visitors were now all on the tiptoe of expectation; and the reporters prepared their
      note-books. Meantime Ellen remained apparently wrapped up in a profound slumber; and more than
      one admiring glance was turned upon her beautiful classic features and the exuberant richness
      of her bust.
"I shall now question the patient," said the Professor, "in a manner which will prove the
      first phenomenon of clairvoyance; namely, the power of foretelling events
       relative to themselves and others."
He paused for a moment, performed a few more manipulations, and then said, "Can you tell me
      any thing in reference to future events which are likely to happen to myself?"
"Within a week from this moment you will hear of the death of a relation!" replied Ellen in
      slow and measured terms.
"Of what sex is that relation?"
"A lady: she is now dangerously ill."
"How old is she?"
"Between sixty and seventy. I can see her lying upon her sick-couch with two doctors by her
      side. She has just undergone a most painful operation."
"It is perfectly true," whispered the Professor to his friends, "that I have an aunt of that
      age; but I am not aware that she is even ill—much less at the point of death."
"It is wonderful—truly wonderful!" exclaimed several voices, in a perfect enthusiasm of
      admiration.
      
"Let us now test her in reference to the second phenomenon I mentioned," said the Professor;
      "which will show the power of describing places she has never visited, and houses whose
       interiors she has never seen."
"Ah! that will be curious, indeed," cried several guests.
"Perhaps you, Mr. Wilmot," said the Professor, addressing a gentleman standing next to him,
      "will have the kindness to examine the patient relative to your own abode."
"Certainly," replied Mr. Wilmot then, turning towards Ellen, he said, "Will you visit me at
      my house?"
"With much pleasure," was her immediate answer.
"Where is it situated?"
"In Park Lane."
"Come in with me. What do you see?"
"A splendid hall, with a marble table between two pillars on one side, and a wide flight of
      stairs, also of marble, on the other."
"Come with me into the dining room of my house. Now what do you see?"
"Seven large pictures."
"Where are the windows?"
"There are three at the bottom of the room."
"What colour are the curtains?"
"A rich red."
"What is the subject of the large picture facing the fire-place?"
"The battle of Trafalgar."
"How do you know it is that battle?"
"Because I can read on the flag of one of the ships the words, 'England expects that
       every man will do his duty.'"
"I shall not ask her any more questions," said Mr. Wilmot, evidently quite amazed by these
      answers. "Every one of her replies is true to the very letter. And I think," he added, turning
      towards the other guests, "that you all know me well enough to believe me, when I declare most
      solemnly that this young person has never, to my knowledge, been in my house in her life."
A murmur of satisfaction arose amongst the guests, who were all perfectly astounded at the
      phenomena now illustrated—although they had come, as before said, with a predisposition in
      favour of Mesmerism.
"We will have another proof yet," said the Professor. "Perhaps Mr. Parke will have the
      kindness to question the patient."
Mr. Parke stepped forward, and said, "Will you do me the favour to walk with me to my
      house."
"Thank you, I will," answered Ellen, still apparently remaining in a profound mesmeric
      sleep.
"Where is my house?"
"In Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square."
"How many windows has it in front?"
"Thirteen."
"Where are the two statues of Napoleon?"
"In the library."
"What else do you see in that room?"
"Immense quantities of books on shelves in glass cases."
"Are there any pictures?"
"Yes—seven."
"What is the subject of the one over the mantelpiece?"
"A beautiful view of London, by moonlight, from one of the bridges."
"Wonderful!" ejaculated Mr. Parke. "All she has said is perfectly correct. It is not
      necessary to ask her any more questions on this subject."
"Gentlemen," said the Professor, casting a triumphant glance around him, "I am delighted to
      perceive that you are satisfied with this mode of illustrating the phenomena of
       clairvoyance. I will now prove to you that the patient can read a book held open
       behind her head."
He then performed some more manipulations to plunge his patient into as deep a mesmeric
      sleep as possible, although she had given no symptom of an inclination to awake throughout the
      preceding examination. Having thus confirmed, as he said, her perfect state of coma,
      the Professor took up a book—apparently pitched upon at random amongst a heap of volumes upon
      the table; and, holding it open behind the head of the patient, he said, "What is this?"
"A book," was the immediate reply.
"What book?"
"Milton's Paradise Lost."
"At what page have I opened it?"
"I can read pages 110 and 111."
"Read a few lines."
Ellen accordingly repeated the following passage in a slow and beautifully mellifluous
      tone:—

"Now morn, her rosy steps in th' eastern clime
Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl,
When Adam waked, so 'customed, for his sleep
Was airy light, from pure digestion bred,
And temperate vapours bland, which th' only sound
Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,
Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song
Of birds on every bough." 

"That is sufficient," cried several voices. "Do not fatigue her. We are perfectly satisfied.
      It is really marvellous. Who will now dare to doubt the phenomena of
      clairvoyance?"
"Let us take a picture," said the Professor; "and she will delineate all the leading
       points in it."
The mesmerist took an engraving from a portfolio, and held it behind Ellen's head.
"What is this?" he demanded.
"A picture."
"What is the subject?"
"I do not know the subject; but I can see two figures in the fore-ground, with a camel. The
      back-ground has elevated buildings. Oh! now I can see it plainer: it is a scene in Egypt; and
      those buildings are the pyramids."
"Extraordinary!" cried Mr. Wilmot.
"And that little hesitation was a proof of the fact that she could really see the picture,"
      added Mr. Parke.
"Wonderful! extraordinary!" exclaimed numerous voices.
At this moment a servant entered the room and delivered a letter to his master, the
      Professor, stating that it had just been left by a friend from Paris.
The mesmerist was about to open it, when a sudden idea seemed to strike him.
"Gentlemen," he exclaimed, throwing the letter upon the table, "the arrival of this missive
      affords me an opportunity of proving another phenomenon belonging to clairvoyance.
       The patient shall read this letter through the envelope."
"But if its contents be private?" said a guest.
"Then I am surrounded by gentlemen of honour, who will not publish those contents," returned
      the professor with a smile.
A murmur of approbation welcomed this happy compliment of the Frenchman.
The mesmerist held the letter at a short distance
       from Ellen's countenance, and said, "What is this?"
"A letter," she replied. "It is written in French."
"Read it," cried the mesmerist.
"The writing is obscure, and the lines seem to cross each other."
"That is because the letter is in an envelope and folded," said the Professor. "But try and
      read it."
Ellen then distinctly repeated the contents of the letter, of which the following is a
      translation:—

"Paris.
"Honoured Sir,—I have to acquaint you with the alarming illness of my beloved
       mistress, your aunt Madame Delabarre. She was taken suddenly ill four days ago. Two eminent
       physicians are in constant attendance upon her. It is believed that if she does not get
       better in a few days, the medical attendants will perform an operation upon her. Should your
       leisure and occupation permit, you would do well to hasten to France to comfort your
       venerable relative.
"Your humble servant,

"FELICIE SOLIVEAU."

"Ah! my poor aunt! my poor aunt!" cried the Professor: "she is no more! It was her death
      that the patient foretold ere now! Yes—the two physicians—the painful operation—Oh! my poor
      aunt!"
The mesmerist tore open the letter, hastily glanced over it, and handed it to the gentleman
      who stood nearest to him. This individual perused it attentively, and, turning towards the
      other guests, said, "It is word for word as the patient read it."
The enthusiasm of the disciples of mesmerism present was only damped by the grief into which
      the Professor was now plunged by the conviction of the death of his venerable aunt. They,
      therefore, briefly returned their best thanks for the highly satisfactory illustrations of the
      truths of mesmeric phenomena which they had witnessed upon the occasion, and took their leave,
      their minds filled with the marvels that had been developed to them.
The moment the guests and the reporters had taken their departure, the Professor hastened up
      to Ellen, took her by the hand, and exclaimed in a transport of joy, "You may rise, my good
      young lady; it is all over! You acquitted yourself admirably! Nothing could be better. I am
      delighted with you! My fortune is made—my fortune is made! These English blockheads bite at
      anything!"
Ellen rose from the chair in which she had feigned her mesmeric sleep, and was by no means
      displeased with the opportunity of stretching her limbs, which were dreadfully cramped through
      having remained an hour in one unchanged position. The Professor compelled her to drink a
      glass of wine to refresh her; and in a few minutes she was perfectly at her ease once
      more.
"Yes," repeated the mesmerist; "you conducted yourself admirably. I really could not have
      anticipated such perfection at what I may call a mere rehearsal of your part. You remembered
      every thing I had told you to the very letter. By cleverly selecting to examine you, those
      persons whose houses I have visited myself, and the leading features of which I am able to
      explain to you beforehand, I shall make you accomplish such wonders in this respect, that even
      the most sceptical will be astounded. You have an excellent memory; and that is the essential.
      Moreover, I shall never mislead you. The book and the print agreed upon between us during the
      day, shall always be chosen for illustration at the lecture. By the bye, your little
      hesitation about the engraving was admirable. You may always introduce that piece of
       acting into your part: it appears true. The part then is not over-done. I give
      you great credit for the idea. In a few days I shall tell all my friends that I have received
      a letter announcing my aunt's death; and that her demise took place at the very moment when
      you beheld her death-bed in your mesmeric slumber. This will astound them completely. On the
      next occasion we must introduce into our comedy the scene of the patient describing what
       takes place in another room, with a wall intervening; and as we will settle before-hand
      all that I shall do in another apartment, upon the occasion, that portion of the task will not
      be difficult."
"But suppose, sir," said Ellen, "that a gentleman, concerning whose house you have given me
      no previous description, should wish to examine me,—what must I do in such a case?"
"Remain silent," answered the Professor.
"And would not this excite suspicion?"
"Not a bit of it. I have my answer ready:—'There is no magnetic affinity, no mesmeric
       sympathy, between you and your interlocutor.' That is the way to stave off such a
      difficulty; and it applies equally to a stranger holding books or prints for you to read with
      the back of your head."
"I really can scarcely avoid laughing when I think of the nature of the farce," observed
      Ellen.
"And yet this is not the only doctrine with which the world is duped," said the Professor.
      "But it is growing late; and you are doubtless anxious to return home. I am so well pleased
      with you, that I must beg you to accept this five-pound note as an earnest of my liberal
      intentions. You were very perfect with the poetry and the letter—the letter, by the bye, from
      my poor old aunt, whose existence is only in my own imagination!—Indeed, altogether, I am
      delighted with you!"
Ellen received the money tendered her by the mesmerist, and took her departure.
Thus successfully terminated her first essay as a patient to a Professor of Animal
      Magnetism!
