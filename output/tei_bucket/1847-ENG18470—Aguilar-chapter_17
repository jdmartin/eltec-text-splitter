CHAPTER XI.
THE CHILDREN'S BALL.
If the thought of their promised ball were the first that entered the minds of the young
      party at Oakwood, as they opened their eyes on New Year's day, it was not very unnatural.
      Percy gloried in the anticipation of being master of the ceremonies, and in conducting the
      whole affair with such inimitable grace and gallantry, that every one should declare it was
      far superior to any party, old or young, of the season, except Mr. Howard's; that was beyond
      him, he said, for he could not put Mr. Howard's head on his shoulders. Herbert anticipated the
      enjoyment of Mary Greville's society, talking to and dancing with her undisturbed, and to
      hearing the almost universal remark, what a sweet girl she was. Edward did not exactly know
      what he expected, but he was in such a mood of hilarity and mischief, that the servants all
      declared Master Fortescue was "mazed." To Caroline their ball was almost always
      (though unconfessedly) the happiest evening in the year. She knew she was handsome—Annie
      Grahame had told her how very much she would be admired in London, and that if she were not
      her very dearest friend, she should envy her beauty terribly. She often in secret longed
      painfully for admiration and homage; and child as she still was in years, yet at her own
      house, and as Mr. Hamilton's eldest daughter, in addition to her real attractions, she always
      received both in sufficient measure, as to satisfy even herself. She delighted in those
      evenings when it so chanced that her brothers had young friends with them, making no
      hesitation in confessing that she very much preferred conversing with boys than with girls,
      there was so much more variety, more spirit; and though her mother's heart would actually
      tremble at the fearful ordeal which an introduction to the pleasures of the world would be to
      such a character, still she would not check the open expression of such sentiments by
      reproving them as wrong, and not to be encouraged. She knew that though education might do
      much, very much, it could not make natural characters all alike; nor, in fact, did she wish
      it. She did not grieve and complain that, with all her efforts she could not make Caroline
      give her as little trouble and anxiety as Emmeline, nor did she imagine that she should see
      the effect of her earnest prayers and cares all at once, or without constant relapses in the
      cherished object of her care. She did all she could to counteract a tendency which, situated
      as she would be when she entered life, must, without some strong, high principle, lead to
      suffering, and, perhaps, to sin—for what is coquetry? But she indulged in no idea of security,
      never believed that because she had so tried, so striven to sow the good seed, it could not
      fail to bring forth good fruit. She knew many trials might be in store for her; for how might
      she hope to pass through life blessed as she was then? It might please her Father in Heaven to
      try her faith and duty through those she loved so intensely; but if she failed not in her
      task, he would bring her joy at last.
To Emmeline the idea of dancing was quite enough to be the acme of enjoyment. The only
      drawback was, that in the intervals of rest, there was to be a little music, and though her
      mother had excused her at Mr. Howard's, she knew that if anybody expressed a wish to hear her
      at her own house, play she must; and at those times she was half sorry she had chosen to learn
      the harp instead of the piano, as Caroline played so well on the latter instrument nobody
      would care to hear her; but the harp was rather a novelty, and no little girl who was coming
      played it, and so she was sadly afraid there was no escape for her, and that was very
      disagreeable, but she would not think about it till the time came; the dancing to such music
      as that which Mr. Hamilton had ordered from Plymouth was joy enough.
Ellen though rather afraid of so many strangers, could not resist the general contagion of
      anticipated enjoyment. She did not indeed wake with the thought of the ball, but with the
      determination to learn the verse of the Psalm her aunt had pointed out, and go and say it to
      her in her dressing-room before she went down. And as the first verse was very short she
      learned two, and repeated them without missing a word, and so as if she quite understood them,
      that her aunt was very much pleased; and then Ellen could think of and join her brother's and
      cousins' delight, even though Mrs. Hamilton was obliged to be what she called very cruel, but
      what Ellen knew was very kind, though it did seem a restraint, and keep her very quiet all
      day, instead of letting her run about from room to room, as Emmeline and Edward, and even
      Percy did, for fear of another headache; and so well did quietness succeed, that she looked
      and was unusually well, and so was almost lively by the evening.
Just before dinner, Percy, who had gone to ride, because he said he was sure he should get
      into some scrape if he did not give a natural vent to his spirits, galloped back in company
      with a gentleman, whose presence seemed to occasion him still greater excitement.
"Where is my mother? and is my father at home?" he asked impatiently, flinging his horse's
      rein to Robert, desiring him to take every care of the gentleman's horse, as he should not let
      him leave Oakwood that night; and rushing across the hall threw open the door of their common
      sitting-room, and exclaimed—
"Mother, give me a vote of thanks and praise for my invincible eloquence!—Here is this
      anchorite, this monk of the moor, who, when I first encountered him, seemed so doughty a
      denier of my wishes, actually conquered—led a slave to your feet; reward me by throwing all
      the fascinations you possibly can in his way, that he may only dream of his cold ride and
      desolate cottage on Dartmoor to-night."
"Be quiet, madcap!" replied Mrs. Hamilton, rising with very evident pleasure, and coming
      forward with extended hand; "your noisy welcome will not permit mine to be heard. This is
      indeed, a pleasure, Mr. Morton," she added, addressing the young clergyman with that earnest
      kindness, which always goes to the heart, "and one that Mr. Hamilton will most highly
      appreciate—if, as I trust, the chains my son has thrown over you, are not so heavy as to
      become painful."
"I should rather fear the pain will be in casting them off, Mrs. Hamilton, not in the
      wearing them," replied Mr. Morton, almost sadly; "it is the knowledge, that mingling as often
      in your home circle as Mr. Hamilton and my friend Percy desire, would wholly unfit me for the
      endurance of my loneliness, that keeps me so aloof, believe me. Inclination would act a very
      different part, but there was no resisting such eloquence and such happiness as his to-day,"
      he continued, more gayly.
And Mr. Hamilton and Herbert entering as he spoke, their greeting was quite as warm and
      eager as Percy's and his mother's, and Mr. Morton gave himself up, for the evening at least,
      to enjoyment. His own generous nature had been particularly struck by Percy's manly conduct
      with regard to his satire, and different as were their characters, a warm friendship from that
      moment commenced between them. It was impossible to resist Percy's warm-heartedness of word
      and deed; and that he would sometimes leave his luxurious home, and stay two or three days
      with Mr. Morton, seeming actually to enjoy the rude cottage and its desolate localities, and
      spread such a spirit of mirth within and around, that it was no wonder the afflicted young man
      looked to his society as almost his greatest pleasure, especially as he felt he dared not too
      often accept Mr. Hamilton's continually-proffered invitation. Oakwood was the home which had
      been his beau idéal for long years, but which now seemed wholly unattainable. He felt
      himself doomed to solitude and suffering, and the struggle for content and cheerfulness was
      always more painful after he had been with his friends.
When all preparations for the evening were concluded, even the respective toilets completed,
      Percy and Emmeline found it impossible to resist trying the spring, as they called it, of the
      oaken floors (whence the carpets had been removed), and amused themselves by waltzing in the
      largest circle they could make. The beautiful suite of rooms were all thrown open, and
      perceiving Caroline standing by the piano in an adjoining apartment, Percy called out—
"Play us a waltz, Caroline, there's a love; the very liveliest you can find. Tiny and I want
      to try the boards while we can enjoy them to perfection, that is, when we are the only persons
      in the room."
"You must excuse me, Percy," she replied somewhat pettishly. "I should think you would have
      dancing enough in the course of the evening; and what will our friends think, if they come and
      find me playing?"
"Think? why, that you are very obliging, which at present you are not," answered Percy,
      laughing; "never mind, Emmy; let us try what our united lungs will do."
"You may if you like, Percy, but really I am not clever enough to dance and sing at the same
      time—I should have no breath left," was her as joyous rejoinder.
"Come and dance, Caroline, if you will not play;" exclaimed Edward, who after decorating his
      button-hole with a sprig of holly, seemed seized with Percy's dancing-mania. "Do give me an
      opportunity of practicing the graces before I am called upon to display them."
"My love of dancing is not so great as to attempt it without music, so practice by yourself,
      Edward," was Caroline's quick reply.
"Without spectators, you mean, Lina," observed her brother, very dryly; and as Emmeline
      begged him not to tease her, he asked—
"What has put her in this ill-humor, Emmy?"
"Oh, I don't know exactly; but if you let her alone, she will soon recover it."
"Well, to please you, I will; for you look so pretty to-night, I can not resist you."
"Take care, Percy, if you try to turn my head with such speeches, I shall go to Edward, and
      punish you by not waltzing with you," said his little sister, shaking her head at him with a
      comic species of reproach.
"That's right, Emmy; do not take flattery even from a brother," said her father, coming
      forward with a smile; "but will you not tire yourself by dancing already?"
"Oh, no, papa; I feel as if I could dance all night without stopping."
"Not with me, Emmeline," rejoined Percy, shrugging his shoulders with horror at the idea; "I
      should cry you mercy, before one half the time had elapsed."
"But if you are not to be tired, will you not spoil your dress, and disorder all these
      flowing curls," continued Mr. Hamilton, "and surely that will be a great misfortune."
"Indeed it will not, papa; Percy has surely too much regard for me, to willfully hurt my
      frock, and if my hair should be so troublesome as to get out of order, Fanny will re-arrange
      it in a few minutes."
"If you wish to cause alarm on that score, my dear father," said Percy, with marked
      emphasis, "You must go to Caroline, not to Emmeline. Thank goodness, I have one sister above
      such petty misfortunes."
"Are you not too hard upon Caroline, Percy?"
"Yes, papa, he is indeed; do not mind what he says," answered Emmeline, very eagerly; but
      Percy said impetuously—
"I am not, Emmeline. I would lay any wager that some thing has gone wrong with her dressing,
      to-night, and so made her pettish. Her frock is not smart enough, or she does not wear the
      ornaments she wished, or some such thing."
Caroline had fortunately quitted the music-room, or this speech would not have tended to
      restore her serenity; but before Mr. Hamilton could reply, Edward, who had been to seek Ellen,
      burst into the room exclaiming—
"Now, Percy, we may have a proper waltz; aunt Emmeline says we may have just one before any
      one comes, and here she is to play for us, and Ellen for my partner," and they enjoyed it in
      earnest. Mr. Hamilton watched them for a few minutes, and then went to seek his elder
      girl.
She was alone in a little room prepared for refreshments, tastefully arranging some
      beautiful flowers in a bouquet. She looked up as he entered, and so smiled that her fond
      father thought Percy must be wrong, for there certainly seemed no trace of ill-temper.
"Why are you not with your brothers and sister in the drawing-room, my dear? and why did you
      just now refuse your brother such a trifling favor as playing a waltz?" he asked, but so
      kindly, that Caroline, though she blushed deeply, instantly replied—
"Because, papa, my temper was not quite restored; I went into the music-room to try mamma's
      remedy of solitude for a few minutes, but Percy spoke to me before I had succeeded. I know I
      answered him pettishly, but indeed, papa," she added, looking up earnestly in his face,
      "indeed he is very provoking sometimes."
"I know he is, my love; he does not always know how to time his jokes, or to make sufficient
      allowance for dispositions not exactly like his own; but tell me, what first occasioned temper
      so to fail that solitude was necessary."
Caroline's blush became still deeper, and she turned away her head saying, very
      hesitatingly—
"For such a very, very silly reason, papa, that I do not like to tell you."
"Nay, my dear, do not fear that I shall either laugh at or reproach you. If you feel
      yourself how very silly it was, I am not afraid of its gaining too great ascendency, even if
      you fail again."
"It was only—only—that I was not quite satisfied with the dress mamma desired me to wear
      to-night, papa; that was all, indeed."
"You wished, perhaps, to wear a smarter one, my love," replied her father, kissing her
      glowing cheek so affectionately, that the pain of her confession was instantly soothed; "but,
      indeed, I think mamma has shown a much better taste. It requires more care than you are yet
      perhaps aware of to dress so exactly according to our age and station, as to do ourselves
      justice, and yet excite no unpleasant feelings in those of a lower, and no contempt in those
      of a higher grade. Many of our friends who are coming to-night could not afford to dress their
      children as we might ours, and do you not think it would be both inhospitable and unkind, by
      being over-dressed, to excite any unpleasant feeling of inferiority in their minds, when
      actually none exists? for difference of fortune alone can never constitute inferiority. I am
      wizard enough to guess that was mamma's reason for your being attired so simply and yet so
      prettily to-night, and equally wizard enough to guess your reason for wishing to be
      smarter—shall I tell it you?" he added, playfully. "Because you fancy Miss Grahame will be
      attired in such a very fashionable London costume, that yours will appear so very plain and so
      childish. I see by that conscious smile, I have guessed correctly; but, indeed, I would not
      exchange my dear ingenuous Caroline, even were she attired in the cottager's stuff frock for
      Annie Grahame, did she bring worlds as her dowry. And as you like ornaments, wear this," he
      added, tastefully twining a superb sprig of scarlet geranium in the rich dark hair that shaded
      Caroline's noble brow; "and if mamma inquires, tell her your father placed it there, as a
      token of his approbation, for temper conquered and truth unhesitatingly spoken—spite of
      pain."
Caroline's brilliant eye sparkled with a more delightful sense of pleasure than any triumph
      of dress could have bestowed, and in answer to her father's inquiry, for whom she had arranged
      such a beautiful bouquet, she said—
"It is for mamma, dear papa—Emmeline is always before me; but I think the idea of to-night's
      enjoyment has so bewildered her, that she has forgotten it, so I may just have time to present
      it before any one comes," and she hastened with her father to the drawing-room, where she
      found Mrs. Greville and her two children (for Alfred was at home for a few months), in
      addition to Mr. Morton and their own family group; and the young clergyman could not but
      admire the natural grace with which Caroline, after warmly welcoming her guests, presented her
      flowers to her mother. It was a very little thing, but the joys and griefs of home are almost
      all made up of little things, and Mrs. Hamilton was pleased, not from the attention alone, but
      that it proved, trifling as it was, that the annoyance and discontent which her command had
      occasioned in her child had left no unkind feeling behind them; and the manner with which she
      received it made Caroline very happy, for she had inwardly feared her ill-temper not only
      deserved, but had excited her mother's displeasure.
Emmeline's look of disappointment and self-reproach at her own unusual forgetfulness was so
      irresistibly comic, that Percy and Edward burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, which the
      former only checked to ask Caroline where she had been, and what she had done, to produce such
      an extraordinary change for the better in her appearance in so short a time.
"Oh, you have no right to my secrets, Percy," was her perfectly good-humored reply; "I do
      not think I shall answer you, except by having the charity to refer you to papa, who has
      produced the change."
"By means of this pretty flower then, I imagine," said Mrs. Hamilton; "its power I do not
      pretend to know, but the taste with which it is placed might vie with that of the most
      fashionable artiste of the metropolis. Mrs. Greville, do unite with me in congratulating Mr.
      Hamilton on his new accomplishment."
The rapid succession of arrivals prevented any further remark, and very speedily the
      inspiring sound of the beautiful music, which was stationed in a sort of ante-chamber between
      the drawing-room and ball-room, removed any thing like stiffness or reserve which the younger
      guests might have at first experienced among themselves. After two or three quadrilles, the
      spirit of enjoyment seemed to reign alone, not only among the dancers themselves, but even
      those who sat out and talked, either from preference or because the sets were full. Percy, his
      brother, and cousin, were so active, so universal in their attention and politeness, that all
      had the same measure of enjoyment; there was no sitting down four or five times consecutively
      for any one, and therefore neither weariness nor dissatisfaction. Where there is a great
      desire in the givers of a party to make every one as happy as themselves, and thoroughly to
      enjoy it, they seldom fail to succeed. And there was such a variety of amusements in the
      various rooms that were thrown open, suitable for all ages—from the mammas and papas to the
      youngest child, that it was scarcely possible to feel any thing but pleasure. Very many sets
      had been formed and danced before the Grahame family appeared, and as Caroline glanced at her
      friend and even at her little sister, it required a very vivid recollection of her father's
      words to prevent a feeling of false shame, while Annie looked at Emmeline and even her
      favorite Caroline for a few minutes with almost contempt.
"People talk so very much of Mrs. Hamilton's taste," she thought, "but she can have none in
      dress, that's certain—why no one could distinguish her daughters from the poorest gentleman's
      here!—But no one can mistake my rank. Thank goodness, there is not a dress like mine—how it
      will be envied!"
If looks were evidence of envy, Annie had them to her heart's content, but how would she
      have been mortified, could she have read the secret meaning of those looks, the contrast drawn
      between the manners and appearance of Lady Helen's daughters and those of the Honorable Mrs.
      Hamilton. Lady Helen herself, indeed, when she saw Caroline and Emmeline, was quite provoked
      that she had been so weak as to permit, and even encourage Annie, to select her own and her
      sister's costume.
"You are so late," said Mrs. Hamilton, as she came forward to greet them, "that I almost
      gave you up, fearing I don't exactly know what. I do hope nothing unpleasant has occasioned
      it."
"Oh, no," was Mr. Grahame's reply, and it was almost bitter; "only Miss Grahame was so
      dreadfully afraid of being unfashionably early, that her mother did not choose to come
      before—indeed, my patience and my little Lilla's was so exhausted, that we thought of leaving
      Cecil to be their beau, and coming alone an hour ago." Lady Helen's look of entreaty at Mrs.
      Hamilton was answered by her saying directly—
"I suppose Annie was thinking of her London parties, and forgot how completely Gothic we are
      as to hours and every thing else in Devonshire. But you must try and forget such superior
      pleasures to-night, my dear girl," she added, jestingly, though the young lady felt it rather
      uncomfortably as earnest, "or I fear you will find but little amusement." Alfred Greville at
      that moment came to claim Annie as his partner, and she gladly joined him, for though Mrs.
      Hamilton had "certainly no taste in dress," she never felt quite at her ease in her presence.
      Cecil and Lilla were soon provided with little partners, and dancing with much more real
      delight than their sister.
It was scarcely possible for any one, much less a parent, to look at Caroline that night
      without admiration. She was so animated, so graceful, so pleasing, and as such completely the
      center of attraction (and really without any effort on her part) to all the gentlemen, young
      or old in the room. The lads congregated round her, and it was rather a difficult task to keep
      clear of offense, when so very many more entreated her to dance than the length of the evening
      permitted; but she managed to talk to all, and yet not to neglect any of her own sex, for she
      always refused to dance, if she fancied her being in a quadrille prevented any couple who had
      not danced so much, and at those times contrived to conciliate five or six instead of only
      one. Emmeline took charge of the younger children, often refusing to dance with older boys,
      who would have made her much pleasanter partners, that she might join the little quadrille and
      set them all right.
"I am really glad to see Ellen among us to-night, and seeming truly to enjoy herself," said
      Mrs. Greville, addressing Mrs. Hamilton, who was standing rather apart at the moment, watching
      Caroline with such mingled feelings of pride and dread, that she was quite glad when her
      friend's voice disturbed her train of thought. "She looked so ill in church yesterday, that I
      half feared we should not see her. I told her I was quite grieved that she was too unwell to
      be at Mr. Howard's last Friday, and—"
"What did she say?" inquired Mrs. Hamilton, anxiously.
"That it was not illness which prevented her; but she looked so confused and pained that I
      changed the subject directly, and the smile soon came back."
"You touched on a very painful theme," replied Mrs. Hamilton, with real relief; "Ellen and I
      were not quite as good friends as we usually are, last week, and my poor little girl felt my
      severity more than I imagined or meant. I gave her to your dear Mary's especial care to-night,
      for she is so timid, that left quite to herself, I was afraid it would be more pain than
      pleasure. Mary has taken my hint most admirably, for Ellen seems quite happy."
"It would be rather hard, if your little niece's were the only sad face in this scene of
      enjoyment; surely, if ever there were happiness without alloy, it is here."
"If you think so Mrs. Greville, you will agree with my friend Morton, who has just been half
      poetizing half philosophizing on this scene," said Mr. Hamilton joining them, with the young
      clergyman leaning on his arm. "He says there is something singularly interesting in watching
      the countenances and movements of children, and in tracing the dawnings of respective
      characters."
"You are not one of those, then, who think childhood a mere negative species of existence,"
      rejoined Mrs. Greville.
"Indeed I do not; there is much more pleasure to me in watching such a scene, than a similar
      one of adults. It is full of that kind of poetry, which, from the beauty and freshness of the
      present, creates a future of happiness or sorrow, good or evil, as something in each
      countenance seems dimly to foretell. How many will be the longing thoughts thrown back in
      after years upon to-night!"
"Do you think then childhood the happiest season of life?"
He answered in the affirmative, but Mr. Hamilton shook his head.
"I differ from you, my good friend," he said. "Childhood feels its griefs as bitterly as
      those of maturer years. We are apt to think it was all joy in the retrospect, perhaps because
      it has not the anxiety and cares of riper years, but sorrow itself is felt as keenly. From
      reason not being perfectly formed, the difficulty to control self-will, to acquiesce in the,
      to them, incomprehensible wishes of parents or guardians, the restraint they are often
      compelled to use, must be all trials even to well-regulated children, and to those subject to
      the caprices of weakness, indolence, neglect, indulgence at one time, and tyranny at another,
      feelings disbelieved in, and therefore never studied or soothed—the little heart thrown back
      upon itself—Morton, believe me, these are trials as full of suffering, and as hard to be
      endured, as those which belong to manhood."
"You may be right," replied Morton; "but do you not think there is an elasticity in
      childhood which flings off sorrow, and can realize happiness sooner than older years?"
"Undoubtedly, and most happy it is that they are so constituted, else what would become of
      them if their susceptibilities for either joy or sorrow are equally quick. If the former did
      not balance the latter, how would their tender frames and quick affections bear their burden?
      The idea that childhood is in itself the happiest season in life is so far mischievous, that
      it prevents the necessary care and watchfulness, which alone can make it so. But we must not
      philosophize any more, for it has made us all grave. I see my wife is addressing Miss Grahame,
      and I think it is for music. Come, Morton, take Mrs. Greville to the music-room, and woo
      melody instead of poetry for the next half hour. Miss Grahame promises to be a very fair
      musician, so you will be charmed."
They adjourned to the music-room, where Percy had already gallantly conducted Annie, and
      several of the guests, young and old, seconded the move: Annie Grahame really played
      remarkably well, so far as execution and brilliancy were concerned, and Mrs. Hamilton was
      delighted at the expression of Grahame's face as he listened to his child and the applause she
      excited. "Why will he not try to win his home-affections," she thought, "when he is so formed
      to enjoy them? and why, why has Helen so indolently, so foolishly cast away her happiness?"
      was the thought that followed at the contrast which Lady Helen's face presented to her
      husband's; she knew Annie played well, she had heard it from very superior judges, and how
      could it concern her what the present company thought?
A very pretty vocal duet from the two sisters followed, and soon afterward Caroline
      approached the music-stand, near which Percy and Mr. Morton were talking, and Percy, with his
      usual love of provoking, exclaimed—
"You surely are not going to play after Miss Grahame, Caroline. If your powers deserted you
      a few hours ago, and prevented the execution of a waltz, they would certainly do you a charity
      in deserting you completely now."
Caroline's cheek burned, but she answered, with spirit—
"Mamma desired me to oblige my friends, Percy; and she would not do so, if she thought I
      should disgrace myself or her."
"Do not heed your brother, Miss Hamilton," interposed Mr. Morton, taking the music from her,
      and offering her his arm to lead her to the piano. "I have had the pleasure of hearing you
      often, and those who can not find an equal, if not superior charm in your playing to Miss
      Grahame's do not deserve to listen."
"Nay, you must be flattering, Mr. Morton; think of Annie's advantages."
"Indeed, my dear Miss Hamilton, yours exceed hers; no master's heart is in his pupil's
      progress, as a mother's in her child's, even should she not teach, but merely
      superintend."
Caroline was seated at the instrument as he spoke, and there was something in his few words
      touching a right chord; for as she began to play she certainly thought more of her mother than
      any one else; and determined, if possible, that others should think with Mr. Morton,
      forgetting at the moment that very few, except their own immediate circle, knew whose pupil
      she was, not imagining that the mistress of Oakwood and its large possessions could have time
      or inclination for any part of the education of her daughters. Morton was certainly right as
      to the amount of admiration, equaling, if not surpassing, that bestowed on Miss Grahame; there
      was a soul, a depth of expression and feeling, in Caroline's far simpler piece, that won its
      way to the heart at once, and if it did not surprise as much, it pleased more, and excited an
      earnest wish to listen to her again.
"Does not your younger daughter play?" inquired a lady, who had been much attracted with
      Emmeline.
"Very little, compared with her sister," replied Mrs. Hamilton; "she is not nearly so fond
      of it, and therefore does not devote so much time to its acquirement just yet."
"Do you think it right to permit children to follow their own inclinations with regard to
      their education?" asked another rather stern-looking lady, with much surprise.
"Only with regard to their accomplishments; my Emmeline is as fond of drawing as Caroline is
      of music, and therefore I indulge her by permitting her to give more time to the one, than to
      the other."
"But do you think natural taste can be traced so early? that it can be distinguished from
      idleness or perverseness?"
"Indeed, I do," replied Mrs. Hamilton, earnestly. "If a child be allowed leisure to choose
      its own pursuits, and not always confined to the routine of a school-room, natural taste for
      some employment in preference to another will, I think, always display itself. Not that I
      would depend entirely on that, because I think it right and useful to cultivate a taste for
      all the fine arts, only giving more time to that which is the favorite. My niece has shown no
      decided taste for any particular pursuit yet; but I do not neglect the cultivation of
      accomplishments on that account; if, in a few years, a preference manifests itself, it will be
      quite time enough to work hard at that particular branch."
"Is that pretty little harp used by either of your daughters?" inquired the first speaker.
      "It looks very much as if it were the especial property of my engaging little friend."
"Your guess is correct," replied Mrs. Hamilton, smiling "Emmeline was quite sure she should
      hate music, if she must learn the great ugly piano. If she might only have a harp, she would
      do all she could to learn, and she really has."
"And may we not hear her?"
"When the room is not quite so full: she has not half her sister's confidence, and so large
      an audience would frighten away all her little powers; but I will promise you a very sweet
      song instead," she added, as Herbert approached, and eagerly whispered some request. "That is,
      if my persuasions can prevail on my young friend; Mrs. Greville, must I ask your influence, or
      will mine be enough?"
"What, with Mary? I rather think, your request in this case will be of more weight than
      mine;" and a few minutes afterward Mrs. Hamilton led the blushing, timid girl in triumph to
      the piano. Her voice, which was peculiarly sweet and thrilling, though not strong, trembled
      audibly as she commenced; but Herbert was turning over the leaves of her music, his mother was
      standing close beside her, and after the first few bars her enthusiastic spirit forgot the
      presence of all, save those she loved, and the spirit of her song.
Mrs. Hamilton never listened to and looked at her at such moments without a trembling
      foreboding she vainly struggled to overcome. There was something in those deep blue, earnest
      eyes, the hectic color that with the least exertion rose to her cheek, the transparency of
      complexion, the warm and elevated spirit, the almost angel temper and endurance in her
      peculiarly tried lot, that scarcely seemed of earth; and never was that sad foreboding
      stronger than at that moment, as she looked round the crowd of young and happy faces, and none
      seemed to express the same as Mary's. She could scarcely command her voice and smile
      sufficiently to warmly thank her young favorite as she ceased; but Mary was more than
      satisfied by the fond pressure of her hand.
This little interruption to the actual business of the evening only increased the zest and
      enjoyment, when dancing recommenced. Even the call to supper was obeyed with reluctance, and
      speedily accomplished, that they might return the sooner to the ball-room. The hours had worn
      away, it seemed, on gossamer-wings, and as each happy child felt assured that the delight
      could not last much longer, the longing to dance to the very last moment seemed to increase.
      Emmeline's excitable spirit had thrown off all alloy, for it was quite impossible any one
      would think of asking her to play now; she had arranged all the remaining couples—for the room
      had begun very much to thin—for the favorite haymaker's country dance,[2] and accepting Edward as her own partner, and being unanimously desired to take the
      top, led off her young friends with such spirit and grace, and so little semblance of fatigue,
      that it certainly appeared as if she would verify her own words, and dance all night.
Miss Grahame had declared it was much too great a romp, and declined joining it. Caroline,
      who would have enjoyed it, more out of politeness to her friend than inclination, sat down
      with her, and a cheerful group of some of the older lads, and one or two young ladies, joined
      them. Herbert and Mary finding the quadrille for which they were engaged, changed to a dance
      for which, though they had quite the spirit, they had not the physical strength, enjoyed a
      quiet chat instead, and Ellen seated herself by her favorite Mary, declining, from fatigue,
      Alfred Greville's entreaty that she would second Emmeline.
"I declare I could dance myself with that merry group," exclaimed Mr. Grahame, after
      watching them some time, and all his austerity banished by the kindly spirit of the evening.
      "Mrs. Hamilton, Mrs. Greville, do one of you take pity on me, and indulge my fancy."
Both ladies laughingly begged to be excused, offering, however, to introduce him to a
      partner.
"No; it must be one of you or none at all. That little sylph of yours, Mrs. Hamilton, seems
      inclined to dance for you and herself too. What a pretty couple she and that handsome cousin
      of hers make! And there goes my little Lilla—I do hope I may have one really happy child.
      What, tired, Percy—compelled to give up—absolutely exhausted?"
"Indeed I am," answered Percy, who had waltzed his partner very cleverly out of the line,
      and, after giving her a seat, threw himself on a large ottoman.
"Mother, if you do not put a stop to Emmeline's proceedings, her strength will entirely
      fail, and down she and Edward will go, and the rest follow, just like a pack of cards. Do,
      pray, prevent such a catastrophe, for I assure you it is not in the least unlikely."
The gravity with which he spoke caused a general laugh; but Mrs. Hamilton, feeling by the
      length of time the fatiguing dance had lasted, there was really some truth in his words,
      desired the musicians to stop; causing an exclamation of regret and disappointment from many
      youthful lips, and Emmeline and Edward ran up to her, to entreat that they might go on little
      longer. Mrs. Hamilton, however, refused; and Edward yielded directly, but Emmeline was so much
      excited, that obedience was most unusually difficult; and when her mother desired her to sit
      down quietly for ten minutes, and then come to the music-room, as Mrs. Allan most particularly
      wished to hear her play before she left, she answered, with more petulance than she was at all
      aware of—
"I am sure I can not play a note now—it will be no use trying."
"Emmeline!" exclaimed her mother, adding, gravely, "I am afraid you have danced too much,
      instead of not enough."
The tone, still more than the words, was enough; poor Emmeline was just in that mood when
      tears are quite as near as smiles; her own petulance seemed to reproach her too, and she
      suddenly burst into tears. Many exclamations of sympathy and condolence burst from her
      mother's friends:—"Poor child!" "She has over-tired herself!" "We cannot expect her to play
      now!"—but Mrs. Greville saying, with a smile, that her little friend's tears were always the
      very lightest April showers, successfully turned the attention of many from her; while Mrs.
      Hamilton taking her hand from her face, merely said, in a low voice—
"Do not make me more ashamed of you, Emmeline. What would papa think if he were to see you
      now?" Her little girl's only answer was to bury her face still more closely in her mother's
      dress, very much as if she would like to hide herself entirely; but on Mrs. Allan saying, very
      kindly—
"Do not distress yourself, my dear. I would not have asked to hear you play, if I had
      thought you would dislike it so much. I dare say you are very tired, and so think you will not
      succeed."
She raised her head directly, shook back the fair ringlets that had fallen over her face,
      and though the tears were still on her cheeks and filling her eyes, she said, with a blending
      of childish shyness and yet courageous truth, impossible to be described—
"No, ma'am, I am not too tired to play—I did not cry from fatigue, but because I was angry
      with mamma for not letting me dance any more, and angry with myself for answering her so
      pettishly; and because—because—I thought she was displeased, and that I deserved it."
"Then come and redeem your character," was Mrs. Hamilton's only notice of a reply that
      actually made her heart throb with thankfulness, that her lessons of truth were so fully
      understood and practiced by one naturally so gentle and timid as her Emmeline: while Mrs.
      Allan knew not what to answer, from a feeling of involuntary respect. It would have been so
      easy to escape a disagreeable task by tacitly allowing that she was too tired to play; and
      what careful training must it have been to have so taught truth.
"Mrs. Allan would not ask you before, because she knew you did not like to play while the
      room was so very full; therefore, ought you not to do your very best to oblige her?"
Emmeline looked timidly up in her mother's face to be quite sure that her displeasure had
      subsided, as her words seemed to denote; and quite satisfied, her tears were all checked, and
      taking Mrs. Allan's offered hand, she went directly to the music-room.
Mrs. Hamilton lingered to desire Herbert (who had come up to know the cause of his sister's
      sudden tears) to form the last quadrille, and reserve a place, if he possibly could, for
      Emmeline, as they would not begin till she had done. Her little girl was playing as she
      rejoined her, and it really was a pretty picture, her fairy figure with her tiny harp, and her
      sweet face seeming to express the real feeling with which she played. There was no execution
      in the simple Highland air, but her vivid imagination lent it a meaning, and so, when fairly
      playing, she did not mind it. Mrs. Allan had lost a little girl just at Emmeline's age, who
      had also played the harp, and there was something in her caress and thanks, after she had
      done, that made Emmeline stand quietly at her side, without heeding the praises that were
      lavished round her. Herbert at that moment appeared with one of the young Allans.
"Come, Emmy, we are only waiting for you; Mr. Allan says you have not favored him to-night,
      and he hopes you will now."
"Pray, do," added Mrs. Allan, as her son gayly pleaded his own cause; Emmeline only waited
      to read her mother's consent in her eyes, for she thought that she ought not to dance any
      more; and in another minute the joyous music had resounded, and she was dancing and chatting
      as gayly and happily as if there had been no interruption to her joy.
"And you will leave all these delights to imprison yourself in a man-of-war?" asked Mr.
      Grahame, jestingly of Edward while waiting for his wife and daughters, who were the last
      departures (much to Annie's horror, for it was so unfashionable to be quite the last), to be
      cloaked and shawled.
"Imprison!" was his very indignant reply, "and on the wide, free, glorious ocean! flying on
      the wings of the wind wherever we please, and compelling the flag of every land to acknowledge
      ours! No, Mr. Grahame; you landsmen don't know what liberty is, if you talk of imprisonment in
      a ship! We take our home wherever we go, which you landsmen can not do, though you do so
      poetize on the maternal properties of Old Mother Earth."
"Only hear him, Hamilton," exclaimed Grahame, laughing heartily; "any one would think he had
      been a sailor all his little life. You talk boldly now, my boy, but you may change your tone
      when you have once tried the cockpit."
"I do not think I shall," answered Edward, earnestly; "I know there are many hardships, and
      I dare say I shall find them more disagreeable than I can possibly imagine; but I shall get
      used to them; it is so cowardly to care for hardships."
"And is it no grief to give up all the pleasures of land?"
"I exchange them for others more delightful still."
"And the sea is to be your sister, uncle, aunt, and cousins—altogether?"
"Yes all," replied Edward, laughing; adding, as he put his arm affectionately round Ellen,
      "my sister has so many kind friends that she will be able to spare me till I am old enough to
      do all a brother ought."
"You are a good fellow, Edward, and I see I must not talk of parting, if I would preserve
      this evening's pleasure unalloyed," Grahame said, as he laid his hand kindly on Ellen's head,
      and then turned to obey the summons of his wife.
The young party, no doubt, felt that it would be infinitely more agreeable to sit up all
      night, and talk of the only too quickly concluded enjoyment, than to retire to their
      respective pillows; but the habits of Oakwood were somewhat too well regulated for such
      dissipation, though, no doubt, their dream-land that night, was peopled with the
      pleasant shadows of reality, and, according to their respective sources of enjoyment, brought
      back their evening's happiness again and again.
