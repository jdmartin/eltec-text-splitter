CHAPTER IV.
THE BROKEN DESK
The many secret wishes for an unfavorable wind, that Mr. Hamilton might stay at Oakwood
      still a little longer, were not granted, and he left his family the very day he had fixed, the
      14th of July, just three weeks after his summons, and about ten days before his sons were
      expected home. Without him Oakwood was strange indeed, but with the exception of Emmeline, all
      seemed determined to conquer the sadness and anxiety, which the departure of one so beloved,
      naturally occasioned. Emmeline was so unused to any thing like personal sorrow, that she
      rather seemed to luxuriate in its indulgence.
"Do you wish to both disappoint and displease me, my dear Emmeline?" her mother said, one
      day, about a week after her husband had gone, as she entered the music-room, expecting to find
      her daughter at the harp, but perceiving her instead, listless and dispirited, on the sofa.
      "Indeed, you will do both, if you give way to this most uncalled-for gloom."
"Uncalled for," replied Emmeline, almost pettishly.
"Quite uncalled for, to the extent in which you are indulging it; and even if called for, do
      you not think you would be acting more correctly, if you thought more of others than yourself,
      and tried to become your own cheerful self for their sakes? It is the first time you have ever
      given me cause to suspect you of selfishness; and I am disappointed."
"Selfishness, mamma; and I do hate the thought of it so! Am I selfish?" she repeated, her
      voice faltering, and her eyes filling fast with tears.
"I hope not, my love; but if you do not try to shake off this depression, we must believe
      you to be so. Your father's absence is a still greater trial to Caroline than it is to you,
      for it compels a very bitter disappointment, as well as the loss of his society; and yet,
      though she feels both deeply, she has exerted herself more than I ever saw her do before, and
      so proves, more than any words or tears could do, how much she loves both him and me."
"And do you think I love you both, less than she does?" replied Emmeline, now fairly
      sobbing.
"No, dearest; but I want you to prove it in the same admirable manner. Do you think I do not
      feel your father's absence, Emmeline? but would you like to see me as sad and changed as you
      are?"
Emmeline looked up in her face, for there was something in the tone that appealed to her
      better feelings at once. Throwing her arms round her, she sobbed—
"Dear mamma, do forgive me. I see now I have been very selfish and very weak, but I never,
      never can be as firm and self-controlled as you and Caroline are."
"Do not say never, love, or you will never try to be so. I am quite sure you would not like
      to be one of those weak, selfish characters, who lay all their faults, and all the mischief
      their faults produce, on a supposed impossibility to become like others. I know your
      disposition is naturally less strong and firm than your sister's, but it is more elastic, and
      still more joyous; and so had you not too weakly encouraged your very natural sorrow, you
      would have been enabled to throw it off, and in the comfort such an exertion would have
      brought to us, fully recompensed yourself."
"And if I do try now?"
"I shall be quite satisfied, dearest; though I fear you will find it more difficult than had
      you tried a few days ago. Confess that I am right. Did you not, after the first two or three
      days, feel that you could have been cheerful again, at least at times, but that you fancied
      you had not felt sorry enough, and so increased both sorrow and anxiety by determinedly
      dwelling on them, instead of seeking some pursuit?"
"Dear mamma, shall I never be able to hide a feeling from you?" answered Emmeline, so
      astonished, that her tears half dried. "I did not know I felt so myself till you put it before
      me, and now I know that I really did. Was it very wrong?"
"I will answer your question by another, love. Did you find such pertinacious indulgence of
      gloom, help you to bring the object of your regret and anxiety, and of your own grief before
      your Heavenly Father?"
Emmeline hesitated, but only for a minute, then answered, with a crimson blush—
"No, mamma; I could not pray to God to protect dear papa, or to give me His blessing, half
      as earnestly and believingly as when I was happier; the more I indulged in gloomy thoughts,
      the more difficulty I had to turn them to prayer, and the last few days, I fear I have not
      even tried."
"Then, dearest, is it necessary for me to answer your former question? I see by that
      conscious look that it is not. You have always trusted my experience and affection, my
      Emmeline, trust them now, and try my plan. Think of your dear father, whom you can not love
      too well, or whose compelled absence really regret too much; but so think of him, as to pray
      continually in spirit to your gracious God, to have him always in His holy keeping, either on
      sea or land, in storm or calm, and so prosper his undertaking, as to permit his return to us
      still sooner than we at present expect. The very constant prayer for this, will make you rest
      secure and happy in the belief, that our God is with him wherever he is, as He is with us, and
      so give you cheerfulness and courage to attend to your daily duties, and conquer any thing
      like too selfish sorrow. Will you try this, love, even if it be more difficult now, than it
      would have been a few days ago?"
"I will indeed, mamma," and she raised her head from her mother's shoulder, and tried to
      smile. "When you first addressed me to-day, I thought you were almost harsh, and so cold—so
      you see even there I was thinking wrong—and now I am glad, oh, so glad, you did speak to
      me!"
"And I know who will be glad too, if I have prevented his having a Niobe for his Tiny,
      instead of the Euphrosyne, which I believe he sometimes calls you. I thought there was one
      particular duet that Percy is to be so charmed with, Emmy. Suppose you try it now." And, her
      tears all checked, her most unusual gloom dispersed, Emmeline obeyed with alacrity, and
      finding, when she had once begun, so many things to get perfect for the gratification of her
      brothers, that nearly three hours slipped away quite unconsciously; and when Caroline returned
      from a walk, she was astonished at the change in her sister, and touched by the affectionate
      self-reproach with which Emmeline, looking up in her face, exclaimed—
"Dear Caroline, I have been so pettish and so cross to you since papa left, that I am sure
      you must be quite tired of me; but I am going to be really a heroine now, and not a shy
      sentimental one; and bear the pain of papa's absence as bravely as you do."
And she did so; though at first it was, as her mother had warned her, very difficult to
      compel the requisite exertion, which for employment and cheerfulness, was now needed; but when
      the will is right, there is little fear of failure.
As each day passed, so quickly merging into weeks, that five had now slipped away since that
      fatal letter had been sent to Edward, the difficulty to do as she had intended, entreat Mrs.
      Langford to dispose of her trinkets and watch, became to Ellen, either in reality or seeming,
      more and more difficult. Her illness had confined her to her room for nearly a week, and when
      she was allowed to take the air, the state of nervous debility to which it had reduced her, of
      course prevented her ever being left alone. The day after Mr. Hamilton's appeal to his
      domestics, she had made a desperate attempt, by asking permission to be the bearer of a
      message from her aunt to the widow; and as the girls were often allowed and encouraged to
      visit their nurse, the request was granted without any surprise, though to the very last
      moment she feared one of her cousins or Miss Harcourt would offer to accompany her. They were
      all, however, too occupied with and for Mr. Hamilton, and she sought the cottage, and there,
      with such very evident mental agony, besought Mrs. Langford to promise her secrecy and aid,
      that the widow, very much against her conscience, was won over to accede. She was in most
      pressing want of money, she urged, and dared not appeal to her aunt. Not daring to say the
      whole amount which she so urgently required at once, she had only brought with her the antique
      gold cross and two or three smaller ornaments, which had been among her mother's trinkets, and
      a gold locket Percy had given her. Mrs. Langford was painfully startled. She had no idea her
      promise comprised acquiescence and assistance in any matter so very wrong and mysterious as
      this; and she tried every argument, every persuasion, to prevail on Ellen to confide all her
      difficulties to Mrs. Hamilton, urging that if even she had done wrong, it could only call for
      temporary displeasure, whereas the mischief of her present proceeding might never come to an
      end, and must be discovered at last; but Ellen was inexorable, though evidently quite as
      miserable as she was firm, and Mrs. Langford had too high an idea of the solemn nature of a
      pledged word to draw back, or think of betraying her. She said that, of course, it might be
      some weeks before she could succeed in disposing of them all; as to offer them all together,
      or even at one place, would be exposing herself to the most unpleasant suspicions.
One step was thus gained, but nearly a fortnight had passed, and she heard nothing from the
      widow.
"Will they never come?" exclaimed Emmeline, in mirthful impatience, one evening, about four
      days after her conversation with her mother; "it must be past the hour Percy
      named."
"It still wants half an hour," replied Mrs. Hamilton; adding, "that unfortunate drawing,
      when will it succeed in obtaining your undivided attention?"
"Certainly not this evening, mamma; the only drawing I feel inclined for, is a sketch of my
      two brothers, if they would only have the kindness to sit by me."
"Poor Percy," observed Caroline, dryly; "if you are to be as restless as you have been the
      last hour, Emmeline, he would not be very much flattered by his portrait."
"Now that is very spiteful of you, Caroline, and all because I do not happen to be so quiet
      and sober as you are; though I am sure all this morning, that mamma thought by your unusually
      long absence that you were having a most persevering practice, you were only collecting all
      Percy's and Herbert's favorite songs and pieces, and playing them over, instead of your new
      music."
"And what if I did, Emmeline?"
"Why, it only proves that your thoughts are quite as much occupied by them as mine are,
      though you have so disagreeably read, studied, worked, just as usual, to make one believe you
      neither thought nor cared any thing about them."
"And so, because Caroline can control even joyous anticipation, she is to be thought void of
      feeling, Emmy. I really can pronounce no such judgment; so, though she may have settled to her
      usual pursuits, and you have literally done nothing at all to-day, I will not condemn her as
      loving her brothers less."
"But you will condemn me as an idle, unsteady, hair-brained girl," replied Emmeline,
      kneeling on the ottoman at her mother's feet, and looking archly and fondly in her face. "Then
      do let me have a fellow-sufferer, for I can not stand condemnation alone. Ellen, do put away
      that everlasting sketch, and be idle and unsteady, too!"
"It won't do, Emmy; Ellen has been so perseveringly industrious since her illness, that I
      should rather condemn her for too much application than too great idleness. But you really
      have been stooping too long this warm evening, my love," she added, observing, as Ellen, it
      seemed almost involuntarily, looked up at her cousin's words, that her cheeks were flushed
      almost painfully. "Oblige Emmeline this once, and be as idle as she is: come and talk to me, I
      have scarcely heard a word from you to-day; you have been more silent than ever, I think,
      since your uncle left us; but I must have no gloom to greet your cousins, Ellen."
There was no rejoinder to these kind and playful words. Ellen did indeed put aside her
      drawing, but instead of taking a seat near her aunt, which in former days she would have been
      only too happy to do, she walked to the farthest window, and ensconcing herself in its deep
      recess, seemed determined to hold communion with no one. Miss Harcourt was so indignant as
      scarcely to be able to contain its expression. Caroline looked astonished and provoked.
      Emmeline was much too busy in flying from window to window, to think of any thing else but her
      brothers. Mrs. Hamilton was more grieved and hurt than Ellen had scarcely ever made her feel.
      Several times before, in the last month, she had fancied there was something unusual in her
      manner; but the many anxieties and thoughts which had engrossed her since her husband's
      summons and his departure, had prevented any thing, till that evening, but momentary surprise.
      Emmeline's exclamation that she was quite sure she heard the trampling of horses, and that it
      must be Percy, by the headlong way he rode, prevented any remark, and brought them all to the
      window; and she was right, for in a few minutes a horseman emerged from some distant trees,
      urging his horse to its utmost speed, waving his cap in all sorts of mirthful gesticulations
      over his head, long before he could be quite sure that there was any body to see him. Another
      minute, and he had flung the reins to Robert, with a laughing greeting, and springing up the
      long flight of steps in two bounds, was in the sitting-room and in the arms of his mother,
      before either of his family imagined he could have had even time to dismount.
"Herbert?" was the first word Mrs. Hamilton's quivering lip could speak.
"Is quite well, my dearest mother, and not five minutes' ride behind me. The villagers would
      flock round us, with such an hurrah, I thought you must have heard it here; so I left Bertie
      to play the agreeable, and promised to see them to-morrow, and galloped on here, for you know
      the day we left, I vowed that the firstborn of my mother should have her first kiss."
"Still the same, Percy—not sobered yet, my boy?" said his mother, looking at him with a
      proud smile; for while the tone and manner were still the eager, fresh-feeling boy, the face
      and figure were that of the fine-growing, noble-looking man.
"Sobered! why, mother, I never intend to be," he answered, joyously, as he alternately
      embraced his sisters, Miss Harcourt, and Ellen, who, fearing to attract notice, had emerged
      from her hiding-place; "if the venerable towers of that most wise and learned town, Oxford,
      and all the grave lectures and long faces of sage professors have failed to tame me, there can
      be no hope for my sobriety; but here comes Herbert, actually going it almost as fast as I did.
      Well done, my boy! Mother, that is all your doing; he feels your influence at this distance.
      Why, all the Oxonians would fancy the colleges must be tumbling about their ears, if they saw
      the gentle, studious, steady Herbert Hamilton riding at such a rate." He entered almost as his
      brother spoke; and though less boisterous, the intense delight it was to him to look in his
      mother's face again, to be surrounded by all he loved, was as visible as Percy's; and deep was
      the thankfulness of Mrs. Hamilton's ever anxious heart, as she saw him looking so well—so much
      stronger than in his boyhood. The joy of that evening, and of very many succeeding days, was,
      indeed, great; though many to whom the sanctity and bliss of domestic affection are unknown,
      might fancy there was little to call for it; but to the inmates of Oakwood it was real
      happiness to hear Percy's wild laugh and his inexhaustible stories, calling forth the same
      mirth from his hearers—the very sound of his ever-bounding step, and his boisterous career
      from room to room, to visit, he declared, and rouse all the bogies and spirits that must have
      slept while he was away: Herbert's quieter but equal interest in all that had been done,
      studied, read, even thought and felt, in his absence: the pride and delight of both in the
      accounts of Edward, Percy insisting that to have such a gallant fellow of a brother, ought to
      make Ellen as lively and happy as Emmeline, who was blessed nearly in the same measure—looking
      so excessively mischievous as he spoke, that, though his sister did not at first understand
      the inference, it was speedily discovered, and called for a laughing attack on his outrageous
      self-conceit. Herbert more earnestly regretted to see Ellen looking as sad and pale as when
      she was quite a little girl, and took upon himself gently to reproach her for not being, or,
      at least, trying to make herself more cheerful, when she had so many blessings around her, and
      was so superlatively happy in having such a brave and noble-hearted brother. If he did not
      understand her manner as he spoke, both he and the less observant Percy were destined to be
      still more puzzled and grieved as a few weeks passed, and they at first fancied and then were
      quite sure that she was completely altered, even in her manner to their mother. Instead of
      being so gentle, so submissive, so quietly happy to deserve the smallest sign of approval from
      Mrs. Hamilton, she now seemed completely to shrink from her, either in fear, or that she no
      longer cared either to please or to obey her. By imperceptible, but sure degrees, this painful
      conviction pressed itself on the minds of the whole party, even to the light-hearted,
      unsuspicious Emmeline, to whom it was so utterly incomprehensible, that she declared it must
      be all fancy, and that they were all so happy that their heads must be a little turned.
"Even mamma's!" observed Caroline, dryly.
"No; but she is the only sensible person among us, for she has not said any thing about it,
      and, therefore, I dare say does not even see that which we are making such a wonder
      about."
"I do not agree with you, for I rather think she has both seen and felt it before either of
      us, and that because it so grieves and perplexes her, she can not speculate or even speak
      about it as we do. Time will explain it, I suppose, but it is very disagreeable."
It was, indeed, no fancy; but little could these young observers or even Mrs. Hamilton
      suspect that which was matter of speculation or grief to them, was almost madness in its agony
      of torture to Ellen; who, as weeks passed, and but very trifling returns for her trinkets were
      made her by Mrs. Langford, felt as if her brain must fail before she could indeed accomplish
      her still ardently desired plan, and give back the missing sum to Robert, without calling
      suspicion on herself. She felt to herself as changed as she appeared to those that observed
      her; a black impenetrable pall seemed to have enveloped her heart and mind, closing up both,
      even from those affections, those pursuits, so dear to her before. She longed for some change
      from the dense impenetrable fog, even if it were some heavy blow—tangible suffering of the
      fiercest kind was prayed for, rather than the stagnation which caused her to move, act, and
      speak as if under some fatal spell, and look with such terror on the relation she had so
      loved, that even to be banished from her presence she imagined would be less agony, than to
      associate with her, as the miserable, guilty being she had become.
Mrs. Hamilton watched and was anxious, but she kept both her observations and anxiety to
      herself, for she would not throw even a temporary cloud over the happiness of her children. A
      fortnight after the young men's arrival, letters came most unexpectedly from Mr. Hamilton,
      dated twelve days after he had left, and brought by a Scottish trader whom they had
      encountered near the Shetland Isles, and who had faithfully forwarded them from Edinburgh, as
      he had promised. The voyage had been most delightful, and they hoped to reach Feroe in another
      week. He wrote in the highest terms of Morton; the comfort of such companionship, and the
      intrinsic worth of his character, which could never be known, until so closely thrown
      together.
"I may thank our Percy for this excellent friend," he wrote. "He tells me his brave and
      honest avowal of those verses, which had given him so much pain, attracted him more toward me
      and mine, than even my own efforts to obtain his friendship. Percy little thought when he so
      conquered himself the help he would give his father—so little do we know to what hidden good,
      the straightforward, honest performance of a duty, however painful, may lead."
"My father should thank you, mother, not me," was Percy's rejoinder, with a flushed cheek
      and eye sparkling with animation, as his mother read the passage to him.
"No such thing, Percy; I will not have you give me all the merit of your good deeds. I did
      but try to guide you, my boy; neither the disposition to receive, nor the fruit springing from
      the seeds I planted, is from me."
"They are, mother, more than you are in the least aware of!" replied he, with even more than
      his usual impetuosity, for they happened to be quite alone; "I thought I knew all your worth
      before I went to Oxford, but I have mingled with the world now; I have been a silent listener
      and observer of such sentiments, such actions, as I know would naturally have been mine, and
      though in themselves perhaps of little moment, saw they led to irregularity, laxity of
      principle and conduct, which now I can not feel as other than actual guilt; and what saved me
      from the same? The principle which from my infancy you taught. I have questioned, led
      on in conversation, these young men to speak of their boyhood and their homes, and there were
      none guided, loved as I was; none whose parents had so blended firmness with indulgence, as
      while my wild, free spirits were unchecked, prevented the ascendency of evil. I could not
      do as they did. Mother! love you more, perhaps, I can not, but every time I join the
      world, fresh from this home sanctuary, I must bless and venerate you more! To walk through
      this world with any degree of security, man must have principle based on the highest
      source; and that principle can only be instilled by the constant example of a mother and the
      association of a home!" Mrs. Hamilton could not answer, but—a very unusual sign of weakness
      with her—tears of the most intense happiness poured down on the cheek of her son, as in his
      impetuosity he knelt before her, and ended his very unusually grave appeal by the same loving
      caresses he was wont to lavish on her, in his infancy and boyhood.
The letters from Mr. Hamilton, of course, greatly increased the general hilarity, and the
      arrival of Mr. Grahame's family about the same time, added fresh zest to youthful enjoyment.
      In the few months she spent at Moorlands, Annie actually condescended to be agreeable. Percy,
      and some of Percy's boyish friends, now young men, as himself, were quite different to her
      usual society, and as she very well knew the only way to win Percy's even casual notice was to
      throw off her affectation and superciliousness as much as possible, she would do so, and be
      pleasing to an extent that surprised Mrs. Hamilton, who, always inclined to judge kindly,
      hoped more regarding Annie than she had done yet. Little could her pure mind conceive that, in
      addition to the pleasure of flirting with Percy, Annie acted in this manner actually to throw
      her off her guard, and so give her a wider field for her machinations when Caroline should
      enter the London world; a time to which, from her thirteenth year, she had secretly looked as
      the opportunity to make Caroline so conduct herself, as to cover her mother with shame and
      misery, and bring her fine plans of education to failure and contempt.
Mrs. Greville and Mary were also constantly at the Hall, or having their friends with them;
      Herbert and Mary advancing in words or feelings not much farther than they had ever done as
      boy and girl, but still feeling and acknowledging to their mutual mothers that, next to them,
      they loved each other better than all the world, and enjoyed each other's society more than
      any other pleasure which life could offer. Excursions by land or water, sometimes on
      horseback, sometimes in the carriages, constant little family reunions, either at Oakwood,
      Moorlands, or Greville Manor, passed days and evenings most delightfully, to all but Ellen,
      who did not dare stay at home as often as inclination prompted, and whose forced gayety, when
      in society, did but increase the inward torture when alone. Mrs. Hamilton had as yet refrained
      from speaking to her—still trying to believe she must be mistaken, and there really was
      nothing strange about her. One morning, however, about a month after the young men had been at
      home, her attention was unavoidably arrested by hearing Percy gayly ask his cousin—
"Nelly, Tiny wrote me such a description of your birthday watch, that I quite forgot, I have
      been dying to see it all the time I have been at home; show it me now, there's a dear; it can
      not be much use to you, that's certain, for I have never seen you take it from its
      hiding-place."
Ellen answered, almost inarticulately, it was not in her power to show it him.
"Not in your power! You must be dreaming, Nell, as I think you are very often now. Why, what
      do you wear that chain, and seal and key for, if you have not your watch on too?"
"Where is your watch, Ellen? and why, if you are not wearing it, do you make us suppose you
      are?" interrupted Mrs. Hamilton, startled out of all idea that Ellen was changed only in
      fancy.
Ellen was silent, and to Percy's imagination, so sullenly and insolently so, that he became
      indignant.
"Did you hear my mother speak to you, Ellen? Why don't you answer?"
"Because I thought my watch was my own to do what I liked with, to wear or to put away," was
      the reply; over neither words nor tone of which, had she at that moment any control, for in
      her agonized terror, she did not in the least know what she said.
"How dare you answer so, Ellen? Leave the room, or ask my mother's pardon at once," replied
      Percy, his eyes flashing with such unusual anger that it terrified her still more, and under
      the same kind of spell she was turning to obey him, without attempting the apology he
      demanded.
"Stay, Ellen; this extraordinary conduct must not go on any longer without notice on my
      part. I have borne with it, I fear, too long already. Leave us, my dear Percy; I would rather
      speak with your cousin alone."
"I fear it will be useless, mother; what has come over Ellen I can not imagine, but
      I never saw such an incomprehensible change in my life."
He departed, unconscious that Ellen, who was near the door transfixed at her aunt's words,
      made a rapid movement as to catch hold of his arm, and that the words, "Do not go, Percy, for
      pity's sake!" trembled on her pale lips, but they emitted no sound.
What passed in the interview, which lasted more than an hour, no one knew; but to the
      watchful eyes of her affectionate children, there were traces of very unusual disturbance on
      Mrs. Hamilton's expressive countenance when she rejoined them; and the dark rim round Ellen's
      eyes, the deadly pallor of her cheeks and lips seemed to denote that it had not been deficient
      in suffering to her; though not one sign of penitence, one word of acknowledgment that she
      was, and had been for some weeks in error, by her extraordinary conduct—not even a softening
      tear could her aunt elicit. She had never before so failed—never, not even when the
      disappearance of her allowance had caused extreme displeasure, had Ellen evinced such an
      apparently sullen spirit of determined hardihood. She would not attempt defense or reply to
      the acted falsehood with which she was charged, of appearing to wear her watch when she did
      not, or to say what she had done with it. Mrs. Hamilton spoke to her till she was almost
      exhausted, for her own disappointment was most painful, and she had not a gleam of hope to
      urge her on. Her concluding words were these—
"That you are under the evil influence of some unconfessed and most heinous fault, Ellen, I
      am perfectly convinced; what it is time will reveal. I give you one month to decide on your
      course of action; subdue this sullen spirit, confess whatever error you may have been led
      into, and so change your conduct as to be again the child I so loved, spite of occasional
      faults and errors, and I will pardon all that is past. If, at the end of a month, I find you
      persisting in the same course of rebellion and defiance, regardless alike of your duty to your
      God and to me, I shall adopt some measures to compel submission. I had hoped to bring up all
      my children under my own eye, and by my own efforts; but if I am not permitted so to do, I
      know my duty too well to shrink from the alternative. You will no longer remain under my care;
      some severer guardian and more rigid discipline may bring you to a sense of your duty. I
      advise you to think well on this subject, Ellen; you know me too well, I think, to imagine
      that I speak in mere jest."
She had left the room as she spoke, so, that if Ellen had intended reply, there was no time
      for it. But she could not have spoken. Go from Oakwood, and in anger! Yet it was but just; it
      was better, perhaps, than the lingering torture she was then enduring—better to hide her shame
      and misery among strangers, than remain among the good, the happy—the guilty wretch she was.
      She sat and thought till feeling itself became utterly exhausted, and again the spell, the
      stupor of indifference, crept over her. She would have confessed, but she knew that it could
      never satisfy, as the half confession she would have been compelled to make it; and the dread
      of herself, that she should betray her brother, sealed her lips.
Robert's story, and the strange disappearance of the notes, had of course been imparted to
      Percy and Herbert. In fact, the change in the young man, from being as light-hearted as his
      young master himself, to gravity and almost gloom—for the conviction of his master and
      mistress, as to his innocence could not cheer him, while suspicion against him still actuated
      Morris, and many of the other servants—would have called the young men's attention toward him
      at once. The various paths and glades between the Hall and Mrs. Langford's cottage had been so
      searched, that unless the storm had destroyed them or blown the notes very far away, it seemed
      next to impossible, that they could not be found. Mr. Hamilton knew the number of each note,
      had told them to his wife, and gave notice at his banker's that though he did not wish them
      stopped, he should like to know, if possible, when they had passed. No notice of such a thing
      had been sent to Oakwood, and it seemed curious that, if found and appropriated, they should
      not yet have been used, for ten weeks had now slipped away since their loss, and nearly nine
      since the letters had been sent to Edward and his captain, answers to which had not yet been
      received; but that was nothing remarkable, for Edward seldom wrote above once in three or four
      months.
It was nearing the end of August, when one afternoon Mrs. Hamilton was prevented joining her
      children in a sail up the Dart, though it had been a long promise, and Percy was, in
      consequence, excessively indignant; but certain matters relative to the steward's province
      demanded a reference to his mistress, and Morris was compelled to request a longer interview
      than usual. Ellen had chosen to join the aquatic party, a decision now so contrary to her
      usual habits, that Mrs. Hamilton could not help fancying it was to prevent the chance of being
      any time alone with her. There had been no change in her manner, except a degree more care to
      control the disrespectful or pettish answer; but nothing to give hope that the spirit was
      changing, and that the hidden error, whatever it might be, would be acknowledged and atoned.
      Mrs. Hamilton was nerving her own mind for the performance of the alternative she had placed
      before her niece; passing many a sleepless night in painful meditations. If to send her from
      Oakwood were necessary, would it produce the effect she wished? with whom could she place her?
      and what satisfactory reason could she assign for doing so? She knew there would be a hundred
      tongues to cry shame on her for sending her orphan niece from her roof, but that was but one
      scarcely-tasted bitter drop in the many other sources of anxiety. But still these were but her
      nightly sorrows; she might have been paler when she rose, but though her children felt quite
      sure that Ellen was grieving her exceedingly, her cheerful sympathy in their enjoyments and
      pursuits never waned for a moment.
Morris left her at six o'clock, all his business so satisfactorily accomplished, that the
      old man was quite happy, declaring to Ellis, he had always thought his mistress unlike any one
      else before; but such a clear head for reducing difficult accounts and tangled affairs to
      order, he had never imagined could either be possessed by, or was any business of a woman. Not
      in the least aware of the wondering admiration she had excited, Mrs. Hamilton had called
      Robert and proceeded to the school-room to get a pattern of embroidery and a note, which
      Caroline had requested might be sent to Annie Grahame that evening; the note was on the table,
      but the pattern and some silks she had neglected to put up till her brothers were ready, and
      they so hurried her, that her mother had promised she would see to it for her. The embroidery
      box was in a paneled closet of the school-room, rather high up, and in taking especial care to
      bring it safely down, Robert loosened a desk from its equilibrium, and it fell to the ground
      with such force as to break into several pieces, and scatter all its contents over the floor.
      It was Ellen's! the pretty rosewood desk which had been her gift, that memorable New Year's
      Eve, and was now the repository of her dread secret. It was actually in fragments, especially
      where the ink-stands and pens had been, and the spring broken, the secret drawer burst open,
      and all its contents were disclosed. Robert was much too concerned to think of any thing but
      his own extreme carelessness, and his mistress's reprimand; and he busied himself in hastily
      picking up the contents, and placing them carefully on the table, preparatory to their
      arrangement by Mrs. Hamilton in a drawer of the table which she was emptying for the purpose.
      She laid them carefully in, and was looking over a book of very nicely written French themes,
      glad there was at least one thing for which she might be satisfied with Ellen, when an
      exclamation—
"Why, there is one of them! I am so glad," and as sudden, a stop and half-checked groan from
      Robert startled her. She looked inquiringly at him, but he only covered his face with one
      hand, while the other remained quite unconsciously covering the secret drawer out of which the
      contents had not fallen, but were merely disclosed.
"What is the matter, Robert? what have you found to cause such contradictory
      exclamations? Speak, for God's sake!" escaped from Mrs. Hamilton's lips, for by that lightning
      touch of association, memory, thought, whatever it may be, which joins events together, and
      unites present with past, so that almost a life seems crowded in a moment, such a suspicion
      flashed upon her as to make her feel sick and giddy, and turn so unusually pale, as
      effectually to rouse Robert, and make him spring up to get her a chair.
"Nothing, madam, indeed it can be nothing—I must be mistaken—I am acting like a fool this
      afternoon, doing the most unheard-of mischief, and then frightening you and myself at
      shadows."
"This evasion will not do, Robert; give me the papers at which you were so startled."
He hesitated, and Mrs. Hamilton extended her hand to take them herself; but her hand and arm
      so shook, that to hide it from her domestic, she let it quietly drop by her side, and repeated
      her command in a tone that brooked no farther delay. He placed the little drawer and its
      contents in her hand, and, without a word, withdrew into the farthest window. For full five,
      it might have been ten minutes, there was silence so deep, a pin-fall might have been loudly
      heard. It was broken by Mrs. Hamilton.
"Robert!"
There was neither change nor tremor in the voice, but the fearful expression of
      forcibly-controlled suffering on her deathlike countenance so awed and terrified him, he
      besought her, almost inarticulately, to let him fetch a glass of water—wine—something—
"It is not at all necessary, my good boy; I am perfectly well. This is, I believe, the only
      note that can be identified as one of those you lost; these smaller ones (she pointed to
      three, of one, two, and four pounds each, which Ellen had received at long intervals from Mrs.
      Langford) have nothing to do with it?"
"No, madam, and that—that may not—"
"We can not doubt it, Robert, I have its number; I need not detain you, however, any longer.
      Take care of these broken fragments, and if they can be repaired, see that it is done. Here is
      Miss Hamilton's note and parcel. I believe you are to wait for an answer, at all events
      inquire. I need not ask you to be silent on this discovery, till I have spoken to Miss
      Fortescue, or to trust my promise to make your innocence fully known."
"Not by the exposure of Miss Ellen! Oh, madam, this is but one of them, the smallest one—it
      may have come to her by the merest chance—see how stained it is with damp—for the sake of
      mercy, oh, madam, spare her and yourself too!" and in the earnestness of his supplication
      Robert caught hold of her dress, hardly knowing himself how he had found courage so to speak.
      His mistress's lips quivered.
"It is a kind thought, Robert, and if justice to you and mercy to the guilty can, by any
      extenuating clause unknown to me now, be united, trust me, they shall. Now go."
He obeyed in silence, and still Mrs. Hamilton changed not that outward seeming of rigid
      calm. She continued to put every paper and letter away (merely retaining the notes), locked
      the drawer, took possession of the key, and then retired to her own room, where for half an
      hour she remained alone.
It is not ours to lift the vail from that brief interval. We must have performed our task
      badly indeed, if our readers can not so enter into the lofty character, the inward strivings
      and outward conduct of Mrs. Hamilton, as not to imagine more satisfactorily to themselves than
      we could write it, the heart-crushing agony of that one half hour; and anguish as it was, it
      did but herald deeper. There was not even partial escape for her, as there would have been had
      her husband been at home. Examination of the culprit, whose mysterious conduct was so fatally
      explained, that she did not even dare hope this was the only missing note she had
      appropriated—compelled confession of the use to which it had been applied—public
      acknowledgment of Robert's perfect truth and innocence, all crowded on her mind like fearful
      specters of pain and misery, from which there could be no escape; and from whom did they
      spring? Ellen! the child of her adoption, of her love, whose character she had so tried to
      mold to good—whose young life she had so sought to make happier than its earliest years—for
      whom she had so hoped, so prayed—so trusted—had borne with anxiety and care; tended in
      physical suffering with such untiring gentleness, such exhaustless love: and now!
