CHAPTER X.
MISTAKEN IMPRESSIONS ERADICATED.
It was the seventeenth day of Ellen's illness, and for six-and-thirty hours she had slept
      profoundly, waking only at very long intervals, just sufficiently to swallow a few drops of
      port wine, which Mr. Maitland had ordered to be administered if she woke, and sunk to sleep
      again. It was that deep, still, almost fearful repose, for it is so like death, which we can
      scarcely satisfy ourselves is life, except by holding a glass at intervals to the lips, to
      trace if indeed it receive the moisture of the breath. And nurse Langford, Mrs. Hamilton, and
      Edward had, through these long hours, watched and scarcely stirred. For they knew that on her
      waking hung hope or misery, return of intellect, or its confirmed suspension. Mr. Maitland had
      particularly wished Edward to be with her when she recovered her senses, that his presence
      might seem as natural as either of her cousins; but he warned him that the least display of
      agitation on his part, or reference to the past, in her exhausted state, might be fatal to
      her. It was quite the evening. Widow Langford had lighted the lamp, and sat down by the fire,
      scarcely able to breathe freely, from the intensity of her hope that Ellen would recover. And
      if such were her feelings, what were Edward's and Mrs. Hamilton's? The former was kneeling on
      the right of the bed, his eyes alternately fixed on his sister, and buried in the coverlid.
      Mrs. Hamilton was on the opposite side, close to Ellen's pillow, the curtain drawn so far
      back, that the least change on the patient's countenance was discernible. Hour after hour had
      so passed, the chimes that told their flight were scarcely heard by those anxious watchers. It
      was about eight o'clock, when a slight movement in Ellen made her aunt's heart so throb, as
      almost to deprive her of breath; her eyes unclosed, and a smile, such as Mrs. Hamilton had not
      seen for weeks, nay, months, circled her lips.
"Dear aunt, have I been ill? It seems such a long, long time since I have seen you, and my
      head feels so strange, so light; and this room, it is my own, I know, but I feel as if it did
      not belong to me, somehow. Do make my head clear, I can not think at all."
"Do not try to think yet, darling. You have been very, very ill, and to endeavor to think
      might hurt you. Strength will soon return now, I hope, and then your head will be quite clear
      again," returned Mrs. Hamilton, quietly and caressingly, though she so trembled with the
      change from sickening dread to certain hope, that she herself scarcely knew how she spoke at
      all.
"But what made me so ill, aunt? I feel as if it were some great pain; I can not remember any
      thing clearly, but yet it seems as if I had been very unhappy—and that—that you did not love
      me any more. Did any thing make me ill? Was it really so?"
"That I did not love you, my Ellen! Indeed, that was only fancy. You were very unhappy, as
      we were all, for Edward did not come as soon as we expected him, and the storms were very
      dreadful, and we feared his ship might have been wrecked, or cast ashore, somewhere very far
      off, where we could not hear of him; and when you saw him, and knew he was safe, the anxiety
      and pain you had undergone, made you ill; you know a little thing will do that, dearest."
"But is he really safe, aunt Emmeline? Where is he?"
"Close by you, love. He has been as watchful and anxious a nurse as I have been. Poor
      fellow, you have given him a sad welcome, but you must make up for it, by-and-by."
Ellen looked languidly, yet eagerly round, as her aunt spoke, and her gaze fixed itself on
      her brother, who was struggling violently to suppress the emotion which, at the sound of her
      voice, in connected words, nearly overpowered him; and still more so, when Ellen said, more
      eagerly than she had yet spoken—
"Dear Edward! come and kiss me, and do not look so sad. I shall soon get well."
He bent over her, and kissed her repeatedly, trying in vain to say something, but he felt so
      choked, he could not; and Ellen held his hand, and looked earnestly, searchingly in his face,
      as if trying painfully to define the vague thoughts and memories which seemed all connected
      with him and with pain, but which would not take a distinct form. Her eye wandered from him
      for a moment to nurse Langford, who had come to the foot of the bed, and that seemed another
      face connected with the blank past, and then it fixed itself again on Edward, and her pale
      face so worked with the effort of thought, that Mrs. Hamilton became alarmed. She saw, too,
      that Edward was growing paler and paler, and trembled for the continuance of his control.
      Taking Ellen's hand gently from his, and arranging her pillow at the same time, so as to turn
      her face rather from him, she said, playfully—
"You have looked at Edward long enough, Ellen, to be quite sure he is safe at home. So now I
      shall be jealous if you give him any more of your attention and neglect me; you must take some
      nourishment, and try to go to sleep again, for I must not have you try your strength too
      much."
"If I could but remember clearly," answered Ellen, sadly; "it is all so vague—so dark—but I
      do not think it was only because he did not come, that made me so unhappy."
"You are not going to be disobedient, dearest," replied Mrs. Hamilton, firmly, though
      fondly, as she hastily signed to Edward to leave the room, which he most thankfully did, never
      stopping till he reached his own, and tried to thank God for His great mercy, but could only
      sob. "I told you not to think, because to do so might retard return of strength, and indeed
      you must try and obey me; you know I am very peremptory sometimes." And the fond kiss with
      which she enforced the command seemed to satisfy Ellen, whose natural submissiveness, combined
      with excessive physical weakness, caused her to obey at once, and not attempt to think any
      more. She took the required nourishment with returning appetite, and soon afterward fell
      quietly and happily to sleep again, her aunt's hand closely clasped in hers.
From that day, all fear of disordered intellect departed, and, gradually, the extreme
      exhaustion gave way before Mr. Maitland's judicious treatment. Strength, indeed, returned so
      slowly and almost imperceptibly, that it was necessary to count improvement by weeks, not
      days. And when, six weeks after her first seizure, she was thought well enough to be carried
      to Mrs. Hamilton's dressing-room, and laid on a couch there, it was a source of gratitude and
      rejoicing to all. But Mr. Maitland and Mrs. Hamilton soon saw, with intense anxiety, that with
      physical strength, memory and thought had both fully returned, and that their consequence was
      a depression so deep, as effectually to retard her perfect recovery. She seemed to shrink from
      all attention, all kindness, as utterly undeserved, even from her cousins. She would look at
      Edward for half an hour together, with an expression of suffering that made the heart actually
      ache. At times she would receive Mrs. Hamilton's caressing and judicious tenderness as if it
      were her only comfort, at others, shrink from it, as if she had no right to it.
"This will never do," Mr. Maitland said, about ten days after Ellen's removal into her daily
      quarters, and finding she was losing ground; "there is something on her mind, which must be
      removed, even if to do so, you refer to the past. She remembers it all too clearly, I fear, so
      our not alluding to it does no good. You must be the physician in this case, my dear Mrs.
      Hamilton, for I am powerless."
But though she quite agreed with him, how to approach such a very painful subject required
      no little consideration; but, as is very often the case, chance does that on which we have
      expended so much thought.
One afternoon Ellen lay so still, so pale, on her couch, that Mrs. Hamilton bent over her to
      listen if she breathed, saying as she did so, almost unconsciously—
"My poor Ellen, when shall I have the comfort of seeing you well and happy again?"
Ellen hastily unclosed her eyes, for she was not asleep—it had been only the stupor of
      painfully-engrossing thought, rendering her insensible to all outward things, but her aunt's
      voice aroused her, and it seemed an inexpressible relief to feel they were quite alone. Trying
      to rise, and clasping her hands, she said, in a tone of strong excitement—
"Oh, aunt Emmeline, how can I be happy—how can I be well—when I think—think—that if it had
      not been for my sin, and the misery it brought on me, Edward might be safe still? no one need
      have known his errors. I tried to save—and—and I have only betrayed, and made him wretched.
      All I suffered was for nothing, worse than nothing!"
"Thank God, you have spoken, my dear child! I felt as if I dared not introduce the subject;
      but now that you have yourself, I think I shall be able, if indeed you will listen to me
      patiently, Ellen, to disperse the painful mists, that are still pressing so heavily on this
      poor little heart and brain," she said, fondly, though seriously, as she put her arm round
      Ellen, to support her as she sat up. "I do not tell you it is not a natural feeling, my love,
      but it is a wrong one. Had your sin, in consideration of its being, as I am now convinced it
      was, wholly involuntary—for in the fearful state of mind Edward's desperate letter occasioned,
      you could not have known or thought of any thing, but that relief seemed sent to your hand—had
      it on that account been permitted so far to succeed, as to give him the aid he demanded, and
      never have been traced to you, it would have confirmed him in the path of guilt and error, and
      poisoned your happiness forever. When you recall the agony, almost madness you felt, while
      burdened with the consciousness of such an act, how could you have borne it, if it had
      continued through months, perhaps years? You shudder; yet this must have been the case, and
      Edward would have persisted in error, if your sin had been permitted to succeed. Its
      detection, and the sufferings thence springing, terrible as they have been to you, my poor
      child, have saved him; and will, I trust, only bring securer happiness to you."
"Saved him!" repeated Ellen, half starting up, and scarcely hearing the last words—"saved
      Edward!"
"Yes, dearest, by leading him to a full confession, and giving him not only the
      inexpressible comfort of such a proceeding, but permitting him to see, that great and
      disappointing as his errors are, they can be conquered. They are not of the irremediable,
      guilt-confirming nature, that he was taught to suppose them for Harding's own most guilty
      ends, and so giving him hope and resolution to amend, which a belief that amendment is
      impossible, entirely frustrates. Do not fear for Edward, my own love; he will give you as much
      pride and comfort as he has anxiety and grief; and you, under God's mercy, will have been the
      cause. It is a hard lesson to learn, and yet, Ellen, I think one day, when you can look back
      more calmly on the last few months, you will acknowledge with me, that great as your
      sufferings have been, they were sent in love both to him and to you."
"If they have saved him—saved him from a continuance in error, and so made him happy!—Oh,
      aunt Emmeline, I can think so now, and I will try to bear the rest? but why," she added,
      growing more excited, "oh, why have you been so good, so kind? Why did you not continue cold
      and distant? I could bear it better, then."
"Bear what, love? What have you more to bear? Tell me all without reserve. Why should I be
      cold, when you deserve all my love and kindness?"
"Because—because, am I not to go to Seldon Grange, as soon as I am strong enough? Uncle
      Hamilton said, there could be no excusing cause demanding a complete avoidance of his
      sentence. I thought it was pain enough when you first told me; but now, now every time I think
      about it, it seems as if I could not bear it."
"And you are not called upon to bear it, my dear child. Is it possible you could think for a
      moment that I could send you away from me, when you have borne so much, and been treated with
      far too much severity already? Did I not tell you that the term of your banishment depended
      entirely on the motive of your silence, and do you think there was no excuse in your motive,
      my Ellen, mistaken as it was? Is self-devotion to be of no more account to me, than it seemed
      to you? Come, smile, dearest; I promise you, in your uncle's name and my own, you shall never
      leave us, unless it be of your own free will and pleasure, a few years hence."
Ellen did try to smile, but she was too weak to bear this complete removal of a double
      burden without an emotion that seemed more like pain than joy. She laid her head on her aunt's
      shoulder, and wept without restraint. They were the first tears she had shed since her
      illness, and Mrs. Hamilton thanked God for them. She did not attempt to check them, but the
      few words she did speak, told such affectionate sympathy, such perfect comprehension of that
      young heart, that Ellen felt as if a mountain of lead were dissolving from her.
"And now, my Ellen, that I have relieved you of a painful dread, will you ease my mind of a
      great anxiety?" inquired Mrs. Hamilton, nearly an hour afterward, when Ellen seemed so
      relieved and calmed, that she could talk to her without fear. "You look surprised; but it is a
      subject you alone can explain, and till it is solved, I shall never feel that your happiness
      is secure. What is this promise, to which in your illness you so constantly referred, and
      which, I fear, has strengthened you in the system of self-sacrifice for Edward's sake, in
      addition to your love for him?"
A deep flush rose to Ellen's transparent cheek and brow, as she answered, falteringly—
"Ought I to tell you, dear aunt? You do not know how often, how very often I have longed to
      ask you, if to keep it made me do wrong—whether I ought to break it? And yet it seemed so
      sacred, and it gave poor mamma such comfort!"
"When did you make it, love? Its import I need not ask you, for you betrayed it, when you
      knew not what you said, and it was confirmed by your whole conduct. To shield Edward from
      blame or punishment, by never revealing his faults?"
"Was it wrong?" murmured Ellen, hiding her conscious face.
"Wrong in you! no dearest; for you were too young to know all the pain and evil it was
      likely to bring. Tell me when, and how, it was taken; and I think I can prove to you that your
      poor mother would have recalled it, had she had the least idea of the solemn hold it had taken
      upon you."
Thus encouraged, Ellen narrated the scene that had taken place in widow Morgan's cottage
      just before Mrs. Hamilton arrived; and her mother's fears for Edward, and dread of Mr.
      Hamilton, which it was very evident, and now more than ever, had extended to both her
      children. She said that Mr. Myrvin's assurance, that her mother could see, and would love her
      in Heaven, directly following the promise, had given it still more weight and solemnity. That
      at first she thought it would be very easy to keep, because she loved Edward so dearly; but
      she had not been long at Oakwood before it made her very unhappy, from its constant
      interference with, and prevention of, her obedience and duty to her aunt; that it had often
      caused her violent head aches, only from her vain attempts to satisfy herself as to that which
      she ought to do. When Edward first went to sea, and all seemed so right and happy with him, of
      course she became happier than she had ever been before. Then came his difficulties, and her
      conviction that she must save him and keep his secret. That her reason and her affection often
      urged her to confide all to her aunt, certain that she would not harshly condemn Edward, but
      would forgive and help him far more effectually than she could; but she dared not, for
      whenever she thought thus, the figure of her mother rose before her, seeming to reproach and
      threaten her for exposing the child she so dearly loved to disgrace and ruin; and this was so
      vivid—so constant during his last appeal, that she thought she must be going mad; that nothing
      but the dread of not being firm enough to keep Edward's secret, had withheld her from
      confessing her sin at once to her aunt, especially when her uncle had so solemnly denounced it
      as theft, and that when it was discovered it seemed actual relief, though it brought such
      severe punishment, for she knew no suffering for her could be too severe.
The tale, as Ellen told it, was brief and simple enough, and that there was any merit in
      such a system of self-devotion never seemed to enter her mind for a moment; but to Mrs.
      Hamilton it revealed such an amount of suffering and trial, such a quiet, systematic, heroic
      endurance, that she unconsciously drew that young delicate being closer and closer to her, as
      if her love should protect her in future from any such trial; and from what had it all
      sprung?—the misery of years, at a period when life should be so joyous and so free, that care
      and sorrow flee it as purely and too briefly happy to approach? From a few thoughtless words,
      from a thoughtless, partial mother, whose neglect and dislike had pronounced that disposition
      cold, unloving and inanimate whose nature was so fervid, so imaginative, that the utmost care
      should have been taken to prevent the entrance of a single thought or feeling too precocious,
      too solemn for her years. It may be urged, and with truth, that to an ordinary child the
      promise might have been forgotten, or heedlessly laid aside, without any harm accruing from
      it, but it was from not caring to know the real character of the little being, for whose
      happiness and virtue she was responsible, that the whole mischief sprung; and it is this
      neglect of maternal duty against which we would so earnestly warn those who may not have
      thought about it. It is not enough to educate the mind, to provide bodily
      necessaries, to be indulgent in the gift of pleasure and amusement, the heart must be
      won and taught; and to do so with any hope of success, the character must be transparent as
      the day: and what difficulty, what hinderance, can there, or ought there to be, in obtaining
      this important knowledge to a mother, from whose breast the babe has received its nourishment,
      from whose arms it has gradually slipped away to feel its own independence, from whose lips it
      has received its first lessons, at whose knee lisped its first prayer? How comparatively
      trifling the care, how easy the task to learn the opening disposition and natural character,
      so as to guide with gentleness and love, and create happiness, not for childhood alone, though
      that is much, but for youth and maturity.
All these thoughts passed though Mrs. Hamilton's mind as she listened to her niece, and
      looked at the pale, sweet face lifted up to hers in the earnestness of her simple tale, as if
      unconsciously appealing for her protection against the bewildering and contending feelings of
      her own young heart. How she was effectually to remove these impressions of years indeed she
      knew not; her heart seemed to pray for guidance that peace might at length be Ellen's portion,
      even as she heard.
"You could scarcely have acted otherwise than you have always done toward Edward, my dear
      Ellen, under the influence of such a promise," she said; "your extreme youth, naturally
      enough, could not permit you to distinguish, whether it was called for by a mere impulse of
      feeling in your poor mother, or really intended. But tell me, do you think it would give me
      any comfort or happiness if I could see Emmeline act by Percy as you have done by Edward? To
      see her suffer pain and sorrow, and be led into error, too, sometimes, to conceal Percy's
      faults, and prevent their removal, when, by the infliction of some trifling pain, it would
      save his exposing himself to greater?"
"But it seems so different with my cousins, aunt; they are all such equals. I can not fancy
      Emmeline in my place. You have always loved them all alike."
"And do you not think a mother ought to do to, dearest?"
"But how can she, if they are not all equally deserving? I was so different to Edward: he
      was so handsome and good, and so animated and happy; and I was always fretful and ill, and
      they said so often naughty; and he used to fondle poor mamma, and show his love, which I was
      afraid to do, though I did love her so very much (the tears started to her eyes), so
      I could not help feeling he must be much better than I was, just as I always feel all my
      cousins are, and so it was no wonder poor mamma loved him so much the best."
"Have I ever made any difference between Edward and you, Ellen?" asked Mrs. Hamilton,
      conquering, with no small effort, the emotion called forth by Ellen's simple words.
"Oh, no, no!" and she clung to her in almost painful emotion. "But you are so good, so kind
      to every body; you would love me, and be kind to me as poor papa was, because nobody else
      could.
"My dear Ellen, what can I do to remove these mistaken impressions? I love you, and your
      father loved you, because you have qualities claiming our love quite as powerfully as your
      brother. You must not imagine because you may be less personally and mentally favored, that
      you are inferior to him, either in the sight of your Heavenly Father, or of the
      friends and guardians He has given you. And even if such were the case, and you were as
      undeserving as you so wrongly imagine yourself, my duty, as that of your mother, would be just
      the same. A parent does not love and guide her children according to their individual merits,
      my dear Ellen, but according to the fountain of love which, to enable her to do her duty, God
      has so mercifully placed in her heart; and therefore those who have the least attractions and
      the most faults, demand the greater cherishing to supply the place of the one, and more
      careful guiding to overcome the other. Do you quite understand me, love."
Ellen's earnest face, on which joy and hope seemed struggling with doubt, was sufficient
      answer.
"All mothers do not think of their solemn responsibility in the same light; and many
      causes—sad recollections and self-reproaches for her early life, and separation in coldness
      from her father and myself, might all have tended to weaken your mother's consciousness of her
      duty, and so, without any fault in yourself, my Ellen, have occasioned her too great
      partiality for Edward. But do you remember her last words?"
Ellen did remember them, and acknowledged they had so increased her affection for her
      mother, as to render the promise still more sacred to her.
"I feared so, dearest; but it is just the contrary effect which they should have had. When
      she called you to her, and blessed and kissed you as fondly as she did Edward, she said she
      had done you injustice, had failed in her duty to you, and it so grieved her, for it was too
      late to atone for it then; she could only pray to God to raise you up a kinder parent. I have
      tried to be that, for her sake, as well as your own; and will you not acknowledge, that if she
      had been spared to love and know your affection for her, she could no more have borne to see
      you suffer as you have done for Edward, than I could my Emmeline for Percy? Do you not think,
      when she had learned to feel as I do, which she had already begun to do, that she would have
      recalled that fatal promise, and entreated you not to act upon it? What has it ever done but
      to make you to painfully suffer, lead you often into error, and confirm, by concealment,
      Edward's faults?"
Ellen's tears were falling fast and freely, but they were hardly tears of pain. Her aunt's
      words seemed to disperse a thick mist from her brain and heart, and for the first time, to
      satisfy her that she might dismiss the painful memory of her promise, and dismiss it without
      blame or disobedience to her mother.
Mrs. Hamilton had begun the conversation in trembling, for it seemed so difficult to
      accomplish her object without undue condemnation of her sister; but as Ellen, clasping her
      arms about her neck, tried to thank her again and again, for taking such a heavy load from her
      heart, saying that she would still help Edward just the same, and she would try to guard him
      and herself from doing wrong, that her mother should love her still, she felt she had
      succeeded, and silently, but how fervently, thanked God.
"But will you tell me one thing, aunt Emmeline? Why, if the promise were mistaken, and poor
      mamma would have wished it recalled, did I always seem to see her so distinctly, and fancy she
      so desired me to save Edward from my uncle's displeasure?"
"Because you have a very strong imagination, my love, increased by dwelling on this subject;
      and in your last trial your mind was in such a fearful and unnatural state of excitement, that
      your imagination became actually diseased. It was not at all surprising; for much older and
      stronger, and wiser persons would have experienced the same, under the same pressure of grief,
      and terror, and remorse. But what can I do to cure this morbid imagination, Ellen?" she
      continued playfully; "sentence you, as soon as you get well, to a course of mathematics, six
      hours each day?"
"I am afraid my poor head will be more stupid at figures than ever," replied Ellen, trying
      to smile, too.
"Then I suppose I must think of something else. Will you follow Emmeline's example, and tell
      me every thing, however foolish or unfounded it may seem, that comes into this little
      head—whether it worries or pleases you? You have nothing, and you will have nothing ever
      again, I trust, to conceal from me, my dear Ellen; and if you will do this, you will give me
      more comfort individually, and more security for the furtherance of your happiness, as far as
      my love can promote it, than any other plan."
Her playfulness had given place to renewed earnestness, and Ellen, as if in the very thought
      of such perfect confidence dwelt security and peace, so long unknown to her, gave the required
      assurance so eagerly and gratefully, that Mrs. Hamilton was satisfied and happy.
