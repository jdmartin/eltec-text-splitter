CHAPTER XII.
FOREBODINGS.
The whole of the day Mrs. Hamilton had vainly tried to shake off a most unwonted gloom.
      Convinced herself that it was greatly physical, from the unusual oppressiveness of the weather
      relaxing the nerves, which had so many months been overstrained, yet her thoughts would cling
      to Mr. Maitland's words, that her husband might be coming home himself; but if the accounts of
      Ellen's danger and Edward's confession had recalled him, he ought to have arrived full two or
      three weeks previous. The gale that swept round her—the awful and unnatural darkness—the
      remarkable phenomena, at that season, of lightning—and the long, loud thunder-claps[4] which inland could be fearfully distinguished from the gale,
      appalled the whole household; and therefore it was not much wonder that the vague idea of her
      husband's having left Feroe, and exposure to such a tempest, should become in that fearful
      anxiety almost a certainty of agony. It was well, perhaps, that her unselfish nature had an
      object to draw her in some slight degree out of herself, for her firmness, her trust beyond
      the accidents of earth, all seemed about to fail her, and make her for the time being most
      wretched. As the storm and closeness increased, so did Ellen's feverish restlessness; her
      nerves, not yet fully restored, felt strung almost to torture with every flash, and clap, and
      blast. She tried to laugh at her own folly; for, though often terrified, when a little child,
      at the storms in India, those of England had never affected her at all, and she could not
      understand why she should feel this so childishly. But argument is of little moment in such
      cases; and Mrs. Hamilton, satisfying her that she could no more help her present sensation
      than her physical weakness, tried to soothe and amuse her, and in so doing partially cheered
      herself. She did not leave her till past midnight; and then desiring Mrs. Langford to sit up
      with her till she was comfortably asleep, retired to her own bed-room. Never since her
      husband's absence had its solitude felt so vast—so heavily oppressive; thought after thought
      of him thronged her mind till she fairly gave up the effort to struggle with them. "Will his
      voice ever sound here again, his heart give me the support I need?" rose to her lips, as she
      gazed round her, and the deep stillness, the gloom only broken by a small silver lamp, and the
      fitful light of the fire, seemed but a solemn answer. She buried her face in her clasped
      hands, and the clock struck two before that inward conflict permitted her once more to lift up
      heart and brow in meek, trusting faith to Him who still watched over her and her beloved ones;
      and after an earnest, voiceless prayer, she drew her little table, with its books of devotion,
      to the fire, and read thoughtfully, prayerfully, for another hour, and then sought her couch.
      But she could not sleep; the wind had again arisen, and fearing to lie awake and listen to it
      would only renew her unusual agitation, she rose at four, dressed herself, and throwing on a
      large shawl, softly traversed the passage, and entered her niece's room; finding her, as she
      fully expected, as wakeful and restless as herself, with the addition of an intense headache.
      She had persuaded nurse Langford to go to bed, but the pain had come on since then, and made
      her more restless and feverish than before. She could not lie in any posture to get ease, till
      at last, about six o'clock, completely exhausted, she fell asleep, sitting almost upright in
      her aunt's arms, her head leaning against her, as she stood by the bedside. Fearing to disturb
      her, Mrs. Hamilton would not move, desiring the morning prayers to be said without her, and
      Miss Harcourt and her daughters not to wait breakfast, as she would have it with Ellen when
      she awoke. That she was stiff and exhausted with three hours' standing in one position, she
      did not heed, perhaps scarcely felt, for woman's loveliest attribute, that of a tender and
      utterly unselfish nurse, was hers to perfection. But she did not refuse the cup of chocolate
      Caroline brought her herself, and with affectionate earnestness entreated her to take.
"You look so fatigued and so pale, dearest mother, I wish you would let me take your place;
      I would be so quiet, so gentle, Ellen would not even know her change of nurses."
"I do not doubt your care, love, but I fear the least movement will disturb this poor child,
      and she has had such a restless night, I want her to sleep as long as she can. Your thoughtful
      care has so refreshed me, that I feel quite strong again, so go and finish your breakfast in
      comfort, dearest."
Caroline very unwillingly obeyed, and about a quarter of an hour afterward, Mrs. Hamilton
      was startled by the sound of a carriage advancing with unusual velocity to the house. It
      stopped at the main entrance, and she had scarcely time to wonder who could be such very early
      visitors, when a loud scream, in the voice of Emmeline, rung in her ears; whether of joy or
      grief she could not distinguish, but it was the voice of her child, and the already tortured
      nerves of the wife and mother could not bear it without a sensation of terror, amounting to
      absolute agony. She laid Ellen's head tenderly on the pillow, watched over her, though her
      limbs so trembled she could scarcely support herself, saw with intense relief that the
      movement had not disturbed her quiet sleep, and calling Mrs. Langford from an adjoining room,
      hastily descended the stairs, though how she did so, and entered the breakfast-room, she
      always said she never knew. Many and eager and glad voices were speaking at once; the very
      servants thronged the hall and threshold of the room, but all made way for her.
"Arthur!—my husband!" she did find voice to exclaim, but every object but his figure reeled
      before her, and she fainted in his arms.
It was some time before she recovered, for mind and frame had been too long overtasked; and
      Mr. Hamilton, as he clasped her in his arms, beseeching her only to speak to him, and gazed on
      her deathlike countenance, felt in a moment that great as his anxiety had been for her, he had
      not imagined one-half she had endured. His voice—his kiss—seemed to rouse the scattered
      senses, even more effectually than Miss Harcourt's anxiously proffered remedies; but she could
      not speak, she only looked up in his face, as if to be quite, quite sure he had indeed
      returned; that her vague fancies of danger, even if they had foundation, had merged in the
      most blissful reality, that she was no longer alone; and leaning her head on his
      bosom, was only conscious of a thankfulness too deep for words; a repose that, since his
      departure, she had not known for a single day. Neither she nor her husband could believe that
      it was only six months since they had been separated. It seemed, and to Mrs. Hamilton
      especially, as if she must have lived through years in that time, it had been so fraught with
      sorrow.
"Not one word, my own dearest! and only these pallid cheeks and heavy eyes to greet me. Must
      I reproach you directly I come home, for, as usual, not thinking enough of yourself;
      forgetting how precious is that self to so many, your husband above all?"
"Nay, papa, you shall not scold mamma," said Emmeline, eagerly, as her mother tried to smile
      and speak in answer. "She ought to scold you, for not sending us one line to prepare us for
      your unexpected presence, and frightening us all by coming so suddenly upon us, and making
      mamma faint, as I never saw her do before. Indeed I do not like it, mother darling!" continued
      the affectionate girl, kneeling down by her mother, and clinging to her, adding, in a
      suppressed, terrified voice, "It was so like death."
Mrs. Hamilton read in a moment that Emmeline's playfulness was only assumed to hide strong
      emotion; that she was trying very hard for complete control, but so trembling, that she knelt
      down, literally because she could not stand. It was such a proof of her endeavor to profit by
      her mother's gentle lessons, that even at that moment it not only gave her the sweetest
      gratification, but helped her to rouse herself.
"Indeed, I think you are perfectly right, Emmy," she said, quite in her usual voice, as she
      pressed her child a moment to her, and kissed her cheek, which was almost as pale as her own.
      "I will not submit to any scolding, when papa himself is answerable for my unusual weakness;
      but as we wanted him so very much, why, we will be lenient with him, and only keep
      him prisoner with us for some time to come. But get him breakfast quickly, Caroline, love;
      such an early visitor must want it. When did you arrive, dearest Arthur?" she added, looking
      earnestly in his face, and half wondering at the expression upon it, it seemed to speak so
      many things; "surely not this morning? You were not at sea in yesterday's awful storm?"
"I was indeed, my Emmeline; can you bear to hear it, or have you been agitated enough
      already? I have been in danger, great danger, but our Father's infinite mercy has preserved me
      to you all, making the instrument of my preservation so young a lad and slight a frame, I know
      not how sufficiently to bless God, or to thank my preserver."
Mrs. Hamilton's hand closed convulsively on her husband's; her eyes riveted on his
      countenance as if she would grasp his whole meaning at once, but little did she guess the
      whole.
"I did not come alone," he added, striving for composure, and even playfulness, "though it
      seems I was such an important personage, as to be the only one seen or thought about."
"By-the-by, I did see, or fancied I saw, Edward," rejoined Caroline, who, at the news of her
      father having been in danger, had left the breakfast-table, unable to keep away from him, even
      that short distance, but neither she, nor either of the others, connecting her cousin with Mr.
      Hamilton's words, and not quite understanding why he should have so interrupted the most
      interesting subject. "He has gone to see Ellen, I suppose, and so we have missed him. Was he
      your companion, papa? How and where did you meet him?"
"Let him answer for himself!" replied Mr. Hamilton, still determinately hiding his feelings
      under a tone and manner of jest, and leaving his wife's side for a moment, he drew Edward from
      the recess of the window, where all this time he had been standing quite unobserved, and led
      him forward.
"Good heavens! Edward, what have you been about?" exclaimed Miss Harcourt, and her
      exclamation was echoed by Caroline and Emmeline, while Mrs. Hamilton gazed at him in
      bewildered alarm. He was deadly pale, with every appearance of exhaustion, and a most
      disfiguring patch on his left brow, which he had tried in vain to hide with his hair.
"You have been fighting."
"Only with the elements, Miss Harcourt, and they have rather tired me, that is all; I shall
      be well in a day or two. Don't look so terrified, dear aunt," he answered, with the same
      attempt at jest as his uncle, and throwing himself lightly on an ottoman by Mrs. Hamilton, he
      laid his head very quietly on her lap.
"Fighting—and with the elements? Arthur, dearest Arthur, for pity's sake tell me the whole
      truth at once; it can not be—"
"And why should it not, my beloved?" (there was no attempt at jest now). "He to whom your
      care has preserved a sister—whom your indulgent love has given courage to resolve that error
      shall be conquered, and he will become all we can wish him—whom you took to your heart and
      home when motherless—God has mercifully made the instrument of saving your husband from a
      watery grave, and giving back their father to your children!"
"To be associated in your heart with other thoughts than those of ingratitude, and cruelty,
      and sin! Oh, aunt Emmeline, I can not thank God enough for permitting me this great mercy,"
      were the only words poor Edward could speak, when the first intensity of his aunt's emotion
      was in some degree conquered, and she could look in his young face, though her eyes were
      almost blinded with tears, and putting back the bright hair which the rain and spray had so
      uncurled, as to lay heavy and damp upon his pale forehead, she imprinted a long, silent kiss
      upon it, and looking alternately at him and her husband, seemed powerless to realize any other
      thought.
Mr. Hamilton briefly, but most eloquently, narrated the events of the previous night,
      dwelling only sufficiently on his imminent peril, to evince the real importance of Edward's
      extraordinary exertions, not to harrow the feelings of his listeners more than need be. That
      the young officer's determined opposition to the almost angrily expressed opinions of Captain
      Harvey and old Collins as to the better landing-place, had saved them from the effects of the
      huge wave, which had burst like a water-spout a minute after they had all leaped in safety on
      shore, almost overwhelming the projecting sand to which Collins had wished to direct the boat,
      and so proving at once Edward's far superior nautical knowledge, for had they steered there,
      the frail bark must inevitably have been upset, and its crew washed by the receding torrent
      back to sea. Harvey and Collins acknowledged their error at once, and looked eagerly for
      Edward to say so to him, but he had vanished the moment they had achieved a safe landing, to
      Mr. Hamilton's annoyance, for he had not the least suspicion who he was, and only longed to
      express, if he could not otherwise evince his gratitude, Collins and Grey refusing the
      smallest credit, declaring that if it had not been for this young stranger officer, of whom
      they knew nothing, not even his name, not a man would have stirred; that for any fisherman or
      mere ordinary sailor to have guided the boat to and from the sinking vessel, in such a sea,
      was so impossible, that no one would have attempted it; old Collins ending, with the
      superstition of his class, by a declaration, that his disappearance convinced his already more
      than suspicion, that it was some good angel in a boy's likeness; for Arthur Hamilton would
      never have been permitted so to perish: an explanation, Mr. Hamilton added, laughingly, that
      might suit his Emmy, but was rather too fanciful for him. However, his young preserver was
      nowhere to be found, but, to his extreme astonishment, and no little relief (for now that he
      was so near home, his anxiety to hear of all, especially Ellen, whom he scarcely dared hope to
      find alive, became insupportable), Mr. Howard suddenly stood before him, grasping both his
      hands, without the power, for a minute or two, to speak. Mr. Hamilton overwhelmed him with
      questions, scarcely giving him time to answer one before he asked another. They had nearly
      reached the hotel, when Captain Harvey's bluff voice was heard exclaiming—
"Here he is, Mr. Hamilton; he is too exhausted to escape our thanks and blessings now. What
      could the youngster have tried to hide himself for?"
But before Mr. Hamilton could make any rejoinder, save to grasp the young man's hands
      strongly in his own, Mr. Howard said, eagerly—
"Oblige me, Captain Harvey; take that boy into our hotel, it is only just round the corner;
      make him take off his dripping jacket, and give him some of your sailor's stuff. He is not
      quite strong enough for his exertions to-night, and should rest at once."
Captain Harvey bore him off, almost carrying him, for exertion and a variety of emotions had
      rendered him faint and powerless.
"Do you know him, Howard? who and what is he?" But Mr. Howard did not, perhaps could not
      reply, but hurried his friend on to the hotel; and entered the room, where, having called for
      lights, and all the ingredients of grog-punch, which he vowed the boy should have instead of
      the brandy and water he had called for, they found Edward trying to laugh, and protesting
      against all coddling; he was perfectly well, and he would not go to bed, and could not imagine
      what right Captain Harvey had to be a sailor, if he thought so much of a storm, and a blow,
      and a wetting.
"Nor should I, if you were sailor-rigged; but what business have you with this overgrown
      mast of a figure, and a face pale and delicate as a woman's?"
And so like his dying mother it was, that Mr. Hamilton stood for a moment on the threshold,
      completely stupefied. We leave our readers to imagine the rest; and how Captain Harvey carried
      the seemingly marvelous news that the brave young officer was Mr. Hamilton's own nephew, over
      the town, and in every fisherman's hut, in a miraculously short space of time.
We may as well state here at once, to save farther retrospection, that Mr. Hamilton, by the
      active and admirable assistance of Morton, had, after a three months' residence at Feroe,
      perceived that he might return to England much sooner than he had at first anticipated; still
      he did not like to mention even the probability of such a thing to his family, till perfectly
      certain himself. Morton never ceased persuading him to name a period for his return, knowing
      the comfort it would be to his home; but Mr. Hamilton could not bear the idea of leaving his
      friend in his voluntary banishment so many months sooner than they had reckoned on. When,
      however, the letters came from Oakwood, detailing Edward's return, and the discoveries thence
      proceeding, his anxiety and, let it be owned, his extreme displeasure against his nephew,
      prompted his return at once. Morton not only conquered every objection to his immediate
      departure, but tried, and in some measure succeeded, to soften his anger, by bringing before
      him many points in Mr. Howard's letter, showing real, good, and true repentance in the
      offender, which a first perusal of a narrative of error had naturally overlooked. The seas,
      however, were so fearfully tempestuous and the winds so adverse, that it was impossible either
      to leave Feroe, or get a letter conveyed to Scotland, for a full fortnight after the Siren's
      last voyage. Nothing but the extreme urgency of the case, increased by the fact that the
      detention of the Siren at Wick had given Mr. Hamilton a double packet of letters, but the
      second, though dated ten days later, gave the same hopeless account of Ellen, could have made
      him attempt a voyage home in such weather; yet he felt he could not rest, knowing intuitively
      the misery his wife must be enduring, and scarcely able to bear even the thought of what
      seemed most probable, that Ellen would be taken from her, and the aggravated trial it would
      be. The voyage was a terrible one, for length and heavy gales. More than once they wished to
      put into port, that Mr. Hamilton might continue his journey by land, but their only safety
      seemed keeping out at sea, the storm threatening to dash them on rock or shoal, whenever in
      sight of land.
By the time they reached the Land's End—they had come westward of England, instead of
      eastward, as they went—the vessel was in such a shattered and leaky condition, that Captain
      Harvey felt and acknowledged, she could not weather out another storm. The calm that had
      followed the heavy gales, gave hope to all; even though the constant shiftings of the wind,
      which was now not more than what, in sailor's parlance, is called a cat's-paw, prevented their
      making as much way as they desired. At length they were within twenty miles of Dartmouth, and
      not a doubt of their safety disturbed them, until the darkening atmosphere, the sullen rise
      and suppressed roar of the billows, the wind sobbing and wailing at first, and then bursting
      into that awful gale, which we have before described, banished every human hope at once. The
      rudder snapped; every half-hour the water gained upon the hold, though every man worked the
      pumps. There was not a shred of canvas, but the masts, and yards, and stays bent and snapped
      like reeds before the blast. To guide her was impossible; she was driven on—on—till she struck
      on a reef of rock about a mile, or less, perhaps from Dartmouth. Then came their signals of
      distress, as a last lone hope, for the crew of the Siren were all too good seamen to dare
      believe a boat could either be pushed off, or live in such a sea. Their wonder, their hope,
      their intense thankfulness, when it was discovered, may be imagined. The rest is known.
"And how did you get this disfiguring blow, my dear Edward?" inquired his aunt, whose eyes,
      it seemed, would turn upon him, as if impossible to connect that slight figure with such
      immense exertions—though some time had passed, and a social, happy breakfast, round which all
      still lingered, had enabled them to subdue too painful emotion, and only to be conscious of
      the most deep and grateful joy.
"Pray do not call it disfiguring, aunt; I am quite proud of it. Last night I could have
      dispensed with such a striking mark of affection from the poor Siren, though I really hardly
      felt it, except that the blood would trickle in my eye, and almost blind me, when I wanted all
      my sight and senses too. But this morning Mr. Howard has made such a kind fuss about it, that
      I think it must be something grand."
"But what did you hide yourself for, Ned?" demanded Emmeline, all her high spirits recalled.
      Her cousin hesitated and a flush mounted to his forehead.
"It was fear, Emmeline; absolute fear!"
"Fear!" she repeated, laughing; "of what? of all the bogies and spirits of the winds and
      waves, whose wrath you dared, by venturing to oppose them? Nonsense, Edward! you will never
      make me believe that."
"Because you do not know me," he answered, with startling earnestness. "How can your gentle
      nature understand the incongruities of mine? or loving your father as you do, and as he
      deserves, comprehend the dread, belief in his unpitying sternness to youthful error, which
      from my childhood he held—he holds—my fate, forgiveness or exposure, and how could I meet him
      calmly? Emmeline, Emmeline, if I had been but as morally brave as I may be physically, I
      should have had nothing to dread, nothing to hide. As it is, uncle Hamilton, judge, act,
      decide as you would, if I had not been the undeserved means of saving you—it will be the best
      for me;" and, rising hurriedly, he left the room before any one could reply.
"But you will forgive him, papa; you will try him again; and I am sure he will be morally
      brave, too," pleaded Emmeline; her sister and Miss Harcourt joining in the entreaty and
      belief, and Mrs. Hamilton looking in his face without uttering a word. Mr. Hamilton's answer
      seemed to satisfy all parties.
Ellen meanwhile had awoke, quite refreshed, and all pain gone, been dressed and conveyed to
      her daily quarters, the events of the morning entirely unknown to her; for though the joyful
      news, spreading like wildfire through the house, had reached Mrs. Langford's ears, and made
      her very happy, she had quite judgment enough, even without a message to the effect from her
      mistress, to keep it from Ellen till carefully prepared.
"What can I say to my little Ellen for deserting her so long?" inquired Mrs. Hamilton,
      playfully, as she entered her room, about twelve o'clock, after a long private conversation
      with her husband.
"I wish you would tell me you had been lying down, dear aunt; it would satisfy me better
      than any other reason."
"Because you think it would do me the most good, dearest. But look at me, and tell me if you
      do not think I must have been trying some equally efficacious remedy." Ellen did look, and so
      radiant was that kind face with happiness, that she was startled.
"What has happened, aunt Emmeline? You have heard from my uncle," she added, her
      voice trembling. "What does he say?—will he—"
"He says, you must summon all your smiles to greet him, love; for he hopes to be with us
      very, very shortly, so you will not wonder at my joy?"
Ellen tried to sympathize in it; but Mrs. Hamilton soon saw that her perhaps near dread of
      what should be her uncle's judgment on her brother and herself, prevented all pleasurable
      anticipation of his arrival, and that the only effectual way of removing it was to let them
      meet as soon as possible.
