CHAPTER XV.
A HOME SCENE, AND A PARTING.
"Caroline! Emmeline! come to the music-room, for pity's sake, and give me some delicious
      harmony," exclaimed Percy, as soon as lights came, and the excitement of the last two hours
      had a little subsided. "Sit quiet—unless I have some amusement for my ears—I neither can nor
      will. I will have some music to lull my tired senses, and a waltz to excite my wearied
      frame."
"And rest your limbs," said Edward, dryly.
"Don't you know, master sailor, that when fatigued with one kind of exercise, the best rest
      is to take another? Now I have been standing up, playing the agreeable, for two mortal hours,
      and I mean to have a waltz to bring back the stagnant circulation, and to be pleased for the
      fatigue of pleasing. Caroline and Emmeline, away with you both. Ellen, love, I will only ask
      you to come with us, and be pleased, too. Be off, Edward, no one shall be my cousin's cavalier
      but myself; Herbert has had her all day. Take my mother, if you like. Father, escort Miss
      Harcourt. That's all right, as it always is, when I have my own way!"
His own way, this time, gave universal satisfaction. The talents of his sisters has been so
      cultivated, as a means of enhancing home-happiness, and increasing their own resources, that
      their musical evenings were always perfect enjoyment. Caroline, indeed, improved as she was,
      still retained her love of admiration sufficiently, to find still greater enjoyment in playing
      and singing when there were more to listen to her, than merely her own family, but the
      feeling, in the security and pure atmosphere of Oakwood, was kept under control, and she could
      find real pleasure in gratifying her brothers, though not quite to the same extent as
      Emmeline.
Percy after comfortably settling Ellen, threw himself on the most luxurious chair that he
      could find, stretched out his legs, placed his head in what he called the best position for
      listening and enjoying, and then called for duets on the harp and piano, single pieces on
      both, and song after song with the most merciless rapidity.
"Your sisters shall neither play nor sing to you any more," his mother, at length,
      laughingly said, "unless you rouse yourself from this disgracefully idle fit, and take your
      flute, and join them."
"Mother, you are lost to every sensation of mercy! after all my exertions, where am I to
      find breath?"
"You have had plenty of time to rest, you lazy fellow; letting your sisters fatigue
      themselves without remorse, and refusing your share," expostulated Edward. "Caroline, Emmeline
      take my advice, and strike! don't play another note."
"You young rebel! teaching my sisters to revolt against the authority of such an important
      person as myself. However, I will be condescending for once; Tiny, there's a love, fetch me my
      flute."
It was so very close to him as he approached the piano, that his sister comically took his
      hand, and placed it on it, and two or three very pretty trios were performed, Percy declared
      with professional éclat.
"Now don't go, Percy we want your voice in a song. Emmy, sing that pretty one to your harp,
      that we wish papa so much to hear; Percy and I will join when wanted."
"Caroline, I have not the genius to sing at sight."
"Oh, you have often! and the words will inspire you. Come, Herbert, we want you, too;
      Edward's singing voice, has deserted him, or I should enlist him also. Emmeline, what are you
      waiting for?"
"I can not sing it, dear Caroline; do not ask me," answered Emmeline, with a confusion and
      timidity, which, at home, were perfectly incomprehensible.
"Why, my little Emmy, I am quite curious to hear this new song; do not disappoint me!" said
      her father encouragingly.
"But after Caroline I can not sing worth hearing," still pleaded Emmeline.
"My dear child, I never heard you make such a foolish excuse before; your mother and myself
      never find any difference in the pleasure that listening to your music bestows, however one
      performer may be more naturally gifted than the other."
"I declare I must sing it if it be only for the mystery of Tiny's refusing," said Percy,
      laughing. "Come, Bertie—a MS. too—what a trial for one's nerves!"
The words, however, seemed sufficiently satisfactory for them readily to join in it.
      Emmeline still hesitated, almost painfully; but then gathering courage, she sat down to her
      harp, and, without any notes before her, played a few bars of one of those sweet, thrilling
      Irish melodies so suited to her instrument, and then commenced her song, the sweetness of her
      voice, and clearness of articulation atoning well for her deficiency in the power and
      brilliancy which characterized her sister. The words were exceedingly simple, but sung with
      deep feeling, and heart-appealing as they were, from the subject, we hope our readers will
      judge them as leniently as Emmeline's hearers.

EMMELINE'S SONG.
"Joy! joy! No more shall sorrow cloud
The home by Love enshrined:
The hearts, in Care's cold fetters bow'd,
Now loveliest flowers have twined;
And dove-eyed Peace, with brooding wing,
Hath made her dwelling here;
And Hope and Love sweet incense fling,
To welcome and endear.
"He has return'd!—and starless night
No longer o'er us lowers.
Joy! joy! The future is all bright
With rosy-blossom'd hours.
What gladness with our Father fled!
What gladness He'll restore!
He has return'd, through perils dread,
To bless his own once more!
"Joy' joy! Oh! let our voices raise
Their glad and grateful lay,
And pour forth thanksgiving and praise
That grief hath passed away!
That he was snatched from storm and wave,
To dry pale Sorrow's tear;
Restored! his home from woe to save—
Oh! welcome, Father dear!" 
Emmeline's voice had at first trembled audibly, but seeming to derive courage from her
      sister and brother's accompaniment, which, from their knowledge of music, was so beautifully
      modulated as to permit her sweet voice to be heard above all, and every word clearly
      distinguished, it became firmer and more earnest as she continued, till she forgot every thing
      but the subject of her song. For full a minute there was silence as she ceased, but with an
      irresistible impulse Mr. Hamilton rose from his seat, and, as Emmeline left her harp, he
      clasped her in his arms.
"How can I thank you, my Emmeline, and all my children, for this fond greeting?" he
      exclaimed, with more emotion than he generally permitted to be visible. "Where could you find
      such appropriate words? What! tears, my little girl," he added, as, completely overcome by the
      excitement of her song and her father's praise, Emmeline most unexpectedly burst into tears.
      "What business have they to come when you have given your parents nothing but pleasure? Drive
      them away, love; what! still no smile? We must appeal to mamma's influence, then, to explain
      and soothe them."
"Where did you get them, Tiny? explain, for I am positively faint from curiosity," comically
      demanded Percy, as Emmeline, breaking from her father, sat down on her favorite stool at her
      mother's feet, and hid her face in her lap. Mrs. Hamilton laid her hand caressingly on those
      soft curls, but, though she smiled, she did not speak.
"She will not tell, and you will none of you guess," said Caroline, laughing.
"You are in the secret, so out with it," said Edward.
"Not I; I am pledged to silence."
"Mother, dear, tell us for pity," pleaded Herbert.
"I can only guess, for I am not in her confidence, I assure you," she replied, in the same
      playful tone, and raising Emmeline's lowered head, she looked a moment in those conscious
      eyes. "Dictated by my Emmeline's affectionate little heart, they were found in this pretty
      shape, in the recesses of her own fanciful brain—is not that it, dearest?"
"There, Emmy, I knew mamma would find it out, however we might be silent," said Caroline,
      triumphantly, as her sister's face was again concealed.
"Emmeline turned poet! Angels and ministers of grace defend me! I must hide my diminished
      head!" spouted Percy. "I thought at least I might retain my crown as the poet of the family,
      and to be rivaled by you—a light-footed fawn—wild gazelle—airy sprite—my especial Tiny! it is
      unbearable!"
"But we must all thank you, notwithstanding, Emmy," continued Herbert.
"Ah, but I have very little to do with it; the arrangement of the words to the air, and the
      accompaniment, are Caroline's; I could not have done that," said Emmeline; her tears changed
      to her most joyous smiles.
Percy and his father turned directly to Caroline, the former with a Sir Charles Grandison's
      bow, the other with a most affectionate kiss; and her mother looked at her with such an
      expression of gratified pleasure, that she could not help acknowledging to herself, such pure
      enjoyment was not to be found in the praise and admiration of strangers.
"Now, Emmeline, you have still a mystery to explain," said Edward. "Why did you not own your
      offspring, instead of, by silence, almost denying them?"
"And here I really can not help you," answered Mrs. Hamilton; "I can not imagine why my Emmy
      should conceal a fact that could only give pleasure to us all."
"I think I know," said Ellen, timidly; "Emmeline was thinking of all you said about
      controlling an impulse, and not always encouraging that which she termed inspiration, and
      perhaps she thought you did not quite approve of her writing, and so wished to conceal
      it."
"How could you guess so exactly, Ellen?" hastily answered Emmeline, forgetting, in her
      surprise at her cousin's penetration, that she betrayed herself.
"Because I should have felt the same," said Ellen, simply.
"Then I must have explained myself very badly, my dear children, or you must have both
      misunderstood me. I did not mean you to neglect such on enjoyment as poetry, but only to keep
      it in its proper sphere, and not allow it to take the place of resources, equally
      intellectual, but which have and may still cost you more patience and labor. Poetry is a
      dangerous gift, my dear child; but as long as you bring it to the common treasury of Home, and
      regard it merely as a recreation, only to be enjoyed when less attractive duties and studies
      are completed, you have my full permission to cultivate—and try, by the study of our best
      authors, and whatever other help I can obtain for you, to improve yourself in it. No talent
      that is lent us should be thrown aside, my Emmeline; our only care must be, not—by loving and
      pursuing it too intensely—to abuse it; but I must not lecture you any longer, or
      Percy's patience will fail; I see he has placed Miss Harcourt already at the piano, and Edward
      and Caroline are ready for their waltz."
"And so I transform one Muse into another," exclaimed Percy, who, in his sister's absorbed
      attention, had neared her unobserved, and catching her round the waist, bore her to the upper
      end of the room, and a minute afterward she was enjoying her waltz, with as much childish
      glee, as if neither poetry nor reflection could have any thing to do with her.
"Why is poetry a dangerous gift, dear aunt?" inquired Ellen, who had listened earnestly to
      all Mrs. Hamilton had said.
"Because, my love, it is very apt to excite and encourage an over-excess of feeling; gives a
      habit of seeing things other than they really are, and engenders a species of romantic
      enthusiasm, most dangerous to the young, especially of our sex, whose feelings generally
      require control and repression, even when not joined to poetry. To a well-regulated mind and
      temper, the danger is not of the same serious kind as to the irregulated, but merely consists
      in the powerful temptation it too often presents to neglect duties and employments of more
      consequence, for its indulgence. There is a species of fascination in the composition of even
      the most inferior poetry, which urges its pursuit, as giving so little trouble, compared to
      the perseverance necessary for music and drawing, and such a vast amount of pleasure, that it
      is difficult to withdraw from it. This is still more strongly the case when the young first
      become conscious of the gift, as Emmeline is now. As she gets older, and her taste improves,
      she will not be satisfied with her efforts, unless they are very superior to the present, and
      the trouble she will take in correcting and improving, will remove a great deal of the too
      dangerous fascination attending it now; still I am not anxious, while she retains her
      confidence in my affection and experience, and will so control the enjoyment, as not to permit
      its interference with her other more serious employments."
Ellen listened eagerly, and they continued conversing on many similar topics of interest and
      improvement, till the prayer bell rang, and startled her into the recollection that she had
      always retired nearly an hour before, and so had avoided entering the library, which she still
      quite shrunk from. Percy stopped his dance, which he had converted from a waltz into a most
      inspiring gallopade, the last importation, he declared, from Almack's; Miss Harcourt closed
      the piano; and Herbert paused in his conversation with his father. Nothing like gloom ever
      marked the signal for the hour of devotion, but lighter pleasures always ceased a few minutes
      before, that they might better realize the more serious thought and service.
Mrs. Hamilton had never ceased to regret the disgrace she had inflicted on Ellen, in not
      permitting her to retain her own place with the family, at least in the hours of devotion, for
      it seemed more difficult to remove that impression than any of her other trials. Returning her
      niece's startled look with one of the sincerest affection, she said—
"You will remain with us to-night, my dear Ellen, will you not?"
"If you wish it, aunt."
"I do wish it, dearest, most earnestly. It is so long since I have had the happiness of
      seeing all my children round me in this solemn hour, and till you join us, I can not feel
      quite sure that you have indeed forgiven an act of severity, which, could I but have suspected
      the truth, I should never have inflicted."
"Forgiven!—you!" repeated Ellen, in utter astonishment, but rising instantly. "Aunt
      Emmeline, dear aunt Emmeline, pray, do not speak so; why did you not tell me your wish before?
      I would have conquered my own disinclination to enter the library, weeks ago; indeed, indeed,
      it only seemed associated with my own guilt and misery."
Mrs. Hamilton drew her arm fondly in hers, refusing for her the aid of either of the young
      men, who had all hastened toward her, and led her herself to the library, and to her usual
      place beside Emmeline. Many an eager but respectful look of affectionate admiration was
      directed toward her by the assembled household, the greater part of whom had not seen her
      since the night of Edward's confession; and the alteration in her appearance, the universal
      sympathy which her dangerous illness and its cause had called forth, even in the humblest and
      most ignorant—for it is the heart, not the mind, which is required for the
      comprehension of self-devotion—her very youth seeming to increase its magnitude, had inspired
      such a feeling of love, that could she have known it, would have prevented that painful
      sensation of shyness.
Many, many thoughts thronged her mind, as her uncle's impressive voice fell on her ear;
      thoughts which, though they prevented her following the words of the prayers, and caused the
      tears, spite of every effort, to stream through her slender fingers, yet turned into
      thankfulness and praise, ere the service ceased, that, fiery as the ordeal had been, she could
      still recognize a hand of love, and bless God, not only for the detection of her involuntary
      sin, but for every pang she had endured.
The next day was Sunday, bringing with it all sorts of quiet, sober pleasures of its own,
      only alloyed by the thought that it was the last day of Percy's and Herbert's visit. The
      following morning they started for Oxford, Mr. Hamilton and Edward intending to accompany them
      part of the way, and then to proceed to Ashburton, where the former had business, and then
      make a little tour through Plymouth home. The next day was so beautifully fine and genial,
      that Emmeline declared it would do Ellen the greatest possible good to go with her a few miles
      out of the park, to see a waterfall she had lately discovered, and which she had been longing
      for Ellen to see, as Caroline would not admire it as much as it deserved. Miss Harcourt
      accompanied them, and on their return, its beauties were described to Mrs. Hamilton in the
      most animating strain; Emmeline declaring the air was more deliciously fresh, the trees more
      green, the sky more brilliantly blue, than they had ever been before; and that the very sound
      of the water, as it dashed down a black rock, and threw up spray, which the rays of the sun
      rendered so beautifully iridescent, as to seem like a succession of rainbows, was a whole
      volume of poetry in itself.
"And what extraordinary vision do you think that silly cousin of mine chose to fancy she saw
      coming down the Ashburton road, mamma? Actually the apparitions of papa and Edward. She will
      persist in the fancy. Miss Harcourt and I could only see two men on horseback, at too great a
      distance for any identity to be recognized—but it must be their wraiths, if it be, for they
      had no idea of coming home to-day."
"I am sure I was not mistaken, Emmeline," said Ellen (whom her aunt now observed looked
      agitated and flushed); "and they were riding so fast, something very pressing must have
      recalled them."
"And you are frightening yourself at shadows, my dear! but indeed I think you must be
      mistaken, for your uncle told me, he should be particularly engaged to-day," said Mrs.
      Hamilton.
"She is not mistaken, though," exclaimed Caroline, who was standing at one of the windows;
      "for here they both are, true enough, and riding quite fast down the avenue. However, the
      mystery will soon be solved."
Mr. Hamilton and Edward entered almost immediately afterward, the latter evidently very much
      agitated, the former so tranquil and cheerful that the momentary anxiety of his wife was
      calmed directly. He laughed at their bewilderment, and said that an important letter had
      reached him at Ashburton, summoning him to Plymouth, and so he thought he would just see how
      all was going on at Oakwood first. This was not at all a satisfactory reason from Mr.
      Hamilton. Edward evidently tried to answer Ellen's inquiries quietly, but he could not, and
      exclaiming, "You tell her, my dear uncle! I can not," ran out of the room. Mr. Hamilton
      instantly changed his jesting manner, so far as quietly and affectionately to seat his niece
      beside him, and tell her, cautiously and kindly, the real cause of their unexpected return.
      Orders had been sent to the Sea Queen, to sail much sooner than was expected, and therefore he
      had deferred his business, and returned with Edward directly.
"It is a trial, my dear Ellen, a very hard one just now, under all circumstances; but I am
      sure you will bear it with fortitude, for Edward's sake. The only drawback to his happiness in
      being again permitted to follow his profession, is the thought of the trial, it will be to
      you."
"But when must we part? When must he leave Oakwood?" was all poor Ellen could ask; but in
      such a tone of quiet sorrow, her uncle could not for the moment reply.
"The Sea Queen leaves Plymouth, wind permitting, the end of the week, but—Edward must be on
      board to-morrow."
A low cry escaped involuntarily from Ellen's lips, as she buried her face on the cushion of
      the couch where she was sitting, and an exclamation of surprise and regret broke from all.
      Mrs. Hamilton felt it almost as much as Ellen, from not only her own unspoken anxiety, as to
      whether indeed his home influence would save him from temptation in future, but that she could
      enter into every thought and feeling which in Ellen must so aggravate the actual
      parting—always a sorrow in itself. After a few minutes Ellen raised her head, and, though her
      cheek was perfectly colorless, every tear was checked.
"Tell Edward he need not fear my weakness, dear Emmeline," she said, trying hard to speak
      quite calmly. "Only beg him to come to me, that we may spend the little time we have together;
      I will be as cheerful as himself." And, effort as it was, she kept her word; so controlling
      sorrow, to enter into his naturally glad anticipations, that her brother felt as if he could
      not love, nor venerate her enough.
He was obliged to leave Oakwood (accompanied by his uncle) so early the next morning, that
      all his preparations had to be completed by that night. Ellis's activity, though she could not
      endure the idea of his going, speedily and satisfactorily settled that matter. Robert
      Langford, who had only regained his natural light-heartedness since Ellen had taken her usual
      place in the family, always declaring his carelessness had been the origin of all her misery,
      was another so active in his service, that Edward had only to give a hint of any thing he
      wanted, even if it could only be procured at some distance, and it was instantly obtained.
The hours wore on, the evening devotions were concluded, but still the family lingered in
      the library: so many things there seemed to say, for Mr. Hamilton and Miss Harcourt would not
      let the conversation flag, and Edward would talk and laugh, as if he were only going from home
      for a few days. Midnight chimed, but still Mrs. Hamilton felt as if she could not give the
      signal for separation: but when one struck, there was a general start, and an unanimous
      declaration it could not be so late.
"I assure you it is," Mrs. Hamilton cheerfully said; "and poor Edward will get no sleep, if
      we do not separate at once. He must certainly send you a box of artificial roses, for this
      unusual dissipation will bear all the natural ones away. Ellen, love, I must be cruel enough
      to resist that pleading look; remember, your full strength has not yet returned."
She spoke kindly, but firmly, and there was a general move. Edward laughingly promised to
      send his cousins the very best box of rouge he could procure at Plymouth, and wished them good
      night as gayly as if they should meet as usual the next morning. Once only his voice
      faltered—"Ellen, love, good night! My own sister, God in Heaven bless you!" were all he said,
      the last sentence escaping as if involuntarily, as if he had merely meant to say good night;
      and for more than a minute the brother and sister were clasped in each other's arms. There
      were tears in Mrs. Hamilton's eyes, and her husband's were most unwontedly dim, for words were
      not needed to reveal to them the trial of that moment to those two young hearts. To Ellen's
      especially, for her lot was woman's—to endure until time should prove the reality of
      Edward's resolution, and mark him indeed the noble character his disposition so fondly
      promised. His was active service, the banishment of thought by deed.
      Breaking from her brother, and not daring to address either her aunt or uncle, lest her
      control should fail her too soon, Ellen hastened from the room.
"Go to her, aunt Emmeline; oh, tell her I will never, never cause her to suffer again!"
      implored Edward, as soon as he could speak, and clasping his aunt's hand. "She has been
      struggling with herself the whole evening for my sake, and she will suffer for it to-morrow,
      unless she give it vent, and she will weep less painfully if you speak of comfort."
"She will be better alone a little while, my dear boy; young as she is, she knows where to
      seek and find comfort, and her tears would flow more freely, conscious only of the presence
      and healing of her God. I shall not part from you now. Ellis wanted me for some directions
      about your things, and I will come to you in your room afterward."
Mrs. Hamilton knew the human heart well. When she went to Ellen, the paroxysm of natural
      sorrow had had vent, and her sympathy, her earnestly expressed conviction that the trial of
      beholding error and remorse in one so beloved would not occur again, could bring comfort. The
      tears indeed might still have flowed the faster, perhaps, at the voice of kindness, but there
      was healing in them; and when her aunt left her to go to Edward, she sent him a fond message
      that she was better, and in a few days would be happy, quite happy, for his sake.
It was late before Mrs. Hamilton quitted her nephew. We will not repeat all that passed
      between them, all that that fond watchful relative so earnestly, so appealingly said. Not much
      in actual words of counsel had she ever before addressed to him, feeling that that duty was
      better performed by Mr. Howard and his uncle. She had simply tried to influence him by the
      power of love, of forbearance, of sympathy with his remorse, and pity for his errors. In the
      wretchedness, the fearful anxiety, Ellen's danger and painful illness had occasioned herself
      individually, she had never spoken, or even let fall a sentence which could reproach him as
      the cause of all; and therefore, now that she did give her anxious affection words, they were
      so spoken, that her nephew never forgot them.
"I feel now," he had said, near the conclusion of their interview, "as if nothing could
      tempt me to err again; but oh, aunt Emmeline, so I thought when I left home before; and its
      influences all left me as if they had never been. It may be so again and—and—are there not
      such doomed wretches, making all they love best most miserable?"
"Not, indeed, if they will take their home influences with them, my beloved boy. They
      deserted you before because, by the insidious sentiments of a most unhappy man, your religion
      was shaken, and you flung aside with scorn and misbelief the only safety for the
      young—God's most Holy Word. The influences of your home are based on that alone, my Edward.
      They appear perhaps to the casual observer as only love, indulgence, peace, and the joy
      springing from innocent and happy hearts; but these are mere flowers springing from one
      immortal root. In God's Word alone is our safety, there alone our strength and our joy; and
      that may be yours still, my boy, though far away from us, and in a little world with interests
      and temptations of its own. Take this little Bible; it has been my constant companion for
      eighteen years, and to none but to yourself would I part with it. If you fear your better
      feelings failing, read it, be guided by it, if at first only for the sake of those you love; I
      do not fear, but that very soon you will do so for its own sake. It bears a name within it
      which I think will ever keep it sacred in your care, as it has been in mine."
Edward opened it eagerly, "Charles Manvers!" he exclaimed; "My own sailor-uncle, whose
      memory you have so taught me to love. It is indeed a spell, dear aunt, and you shall never
      regret a gift so precious. But how came it yours?"
"He came to me just before starting for his last trip, entreating me to exchange Bibles with
      him, that in our most serious moments we might think of each other. It was such an unusually
      serious speech for him, that it seemed to thrill me with a vague forboding, which was only too
      soon realized. I never saw him again; and that little book indeed increased in value."
Her voice faltered, for even yet the memory of her brother was so dear to her that she could
      never speak of him without emotion. Edward reiterated his eager assurance that it should be
      equally valuable to him, adding—
"I have often had strange fancies about uncle Charles, aunt, and longed for the command of a
      ship, to scour the coast of Algiers, and learn something more about the Leander. Somehow or
      other, I never can believe he was drowned, and yet to think of him as a slave is
      terrible."
"And not likely, my dear boy; think of the lapse of years. But painful as it is, we must
      separate, Edward: I must not detain you from rest and sleep any longer. Only give me one
      promise—if ever you are led into temptation and error again, and it may be—for our strongest
      resolutions sometimes fail us—write to me without the smallest hesitation, openly, freely;
      tell me all, and if you need aid, ask it, and I will give it; and, if it be possible, avert
      your uncle's displeasure. I have no fear that, in telling you this, I am weakening your
      resolution, but only to prevent one fault becoming many by concealment—from dread of anger,
      and therein the supposed impossibility of amendment. Remember, my beloved boy, you have a
      claim on me which no error nor fault can remove; as, under providence, the preserver of my
      husband, I can never change the anxious love I bear you. You may indeed make me very
      miserable, but I know you will not: you will let me look on your noble deed with all
      the love, the admiration, it deserves. Promise me that, under any difficulty or error, small
      or great, you will write to me as you would have done to your own beloved mother, and I shall
      have no fear remaining."
Edward did promise, but his heart was so full he could not restrain himself any longer, and
      as Mrs. Hamilton folded him to her heart, in a silent but tearful embrace, he wept on her
      shoulder like a child.
