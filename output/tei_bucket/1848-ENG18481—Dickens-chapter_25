CHAPTER XXV
Strange News of Uncle Sol
CAPTAIN CUTTLE, though no sluggard, did not turn out so early on the morning after he had
     seen Sol Gills, through the shop-window, writing in the parlour, with the Midshipman upon the
     counter, and Rob the Grinder making up his bed below it, but that the clocks struck six as he
     raised himself on his elbow, and took a survey of his little chamber. The Captain's eyes must
     have done severe duty, if he usually opened them as wide on awaking as he did that morning; and
     were but roughly rewarded for their vigilance, if he generally rubbed them half as hard. But
     the occasion was no common one, for Rob the Grinder had certainly never stood in the doorway of
     Captain Cuttle's bedroom before, and in it he stood then, panting at the Captain, with a
     flushed and touzled air of bed about him, that greatly heightened both his colour and
     expression. 
`Holloa!´ roared the Captain. `What's the matter?´ 
Before Rob could stammer a word in answer, Captain Cuttle turned out, all in a heap, and
     covered the boy's mouth with his hand. 
`Steady, my lad,´ said the Captain, `don't ye speak a word to me as yet!´ 
The Captain, looking at his visitor in great consternation, gently shouldered him into the
     next room, after laying this injunction upon him; and disappearing for a few moments, forthwith
     returned in the blue suit. Holding up his hand in token of the injunction not yet being taken
     off, Captain Cuttle walked up to the cupboard, and poured himself out a dram; a counterpart of
     which he handed to the messenger. The Captain then stood himself up in a corner, against the
     wall, as if to forestall the possibility of being knocked backwards by the communication that
     was to be made to him; and having swallowed his liquor, with his eyes fixed on the messenger,
     and his face as pale as his face could be, requested him to `heave ahead.´ 
`Do you mean, tell you, Captain?´ asked Rob, who had been greatly impressed by these
     precautions. 
`Aye!´ said the Captain. 
`Well, sir,´ said Rob, `I ain't got much to tell. But look here!´ 
Rob produced a bundle of keys. The Captain surveyed them, remained in his corner, and
     surveyed the messenger. 
`And look here!´ pursued Rob. 
The boy produced a sealed packet, which Captain Cuttle stared at as he had stared at the
     keys. 
`When I woke this morning, Captain,´ said Rob, `which was about a quarter after five, I found
     these on my pillow. The shop-door was unbolted and unlocked, and Mr. Gills gone.´ 
`Gone!´ roared the Captain. 
`Flowed, sir,´ returned Rob. 
The Captain's voice was so tremendous, and he came out of his corner with such way on him,
     that Rob retreated before him into another corner: holding out the keys and packet, to prevent
     himself from being run down. 
`”For Captain Cuttle,” sir,´ cried Rob, `is on the keys, and on the packet too. Upon my word
     and honour, Captain Cuttle, I don't know anything more about it. I wish I may die if I do!
     Here's a sitiwation for a lad that's just got a sitiwation,´ cried the unfortunate Grinder,
     screwing his cuff into his face; `his master bolted with his place, and him blamed for it!´ 
These lamentations had reference to Captain Cuttle's gaze, or rather glare, which was full of
     vague suspicions, threatenings, and denunciations. Taking the proffered packet from his hand,
     the Captain opened it and read as follows: `My dear Ned Cuttle. Enclosed is my will!´ The
     Captain turned it over, with a doubtful look—`and Testament.—Where's the Testament?´ said the
     Captain, instantly impeaching the ill-fated Grinder. `What have you done with that, my lad?´ 
`I never see it,´ whimpered Rod. `Don't keep on suspecting an innocent lad, Captain.
      I never touched the Testament.´ 
Captain Cuttle shook his head, implying that somebody must be made answerable for it; and
     gravely proceeded:— 
`Which don't break open for a year, or until you have decisive intelligence of my dear
     Walter, who is dear to you Ned, too, I am sure.´ The Captain paused and shook his head in some
     emotion; then, as a re-establishment of his dignity in this trying position, looked with
     exceeding sternness at the Grinder. `If you should never hear of me, or see me more, Ned,
     remember an old friend as he will remember you to the last—kindly; and at least until the
     period I have mentioned has expired, keep a home in the old place for Walter. There are no
     debts, the loan from Dombey's house is paid off, and all my keys I send with this. Keep this
     quite, and make no inquiry for me; it is useless. So no more, dear Ned, from your true friend,
     Solomon Gills.´ The Captain took a long breath, and then read these words, written below: `”The
     boy Rob, well recommended, as I told you, from Dombey's house. If all else should come to the
     hammer, take care, Ned, of the little Midshipman.”´ 
 To convey to posterity any idea of the manner in which the Captain, after turning this
     letter over and over, and reading it a score of times, sat down in his chair, and held a
     court-martial on the subject in his own mind, would require the united genius of all the great
     men, who, discarding their own untoward days, have determined to go down to posterity, and have
     never got there. At first the Captain was too much confounded and distressed to think of
     anything but the letter itself; and even when his thoughts began to glance upon the various
     attendant facts, they might, perhaps, as well have occupied themselves with their former theme,
     for any light they reflected on them. In this state of mind, Captain Cuttle having the Grinder
     before the court, and no one else, found it a great relief to decide, generally, that he was an
     object of suspicion: which the Captain so clearly expressed in his visage, that Rob
     remonstrated. 
`Oh, don't, Captain!´ cried the Grinder. `I wonder how you can! what have I done to be looked
     at, like that?´ 
`My lad,´ said Captain Cuttle, `don't you sing out afore you're hurt. And don't you commit
     yourself, whatever you do.´ 
`I haven't been and committed nothing, Captain!´ answered Rob. 
`Keep her free, then,´ said the Captain, impressively, `and ride easy.´ 
With a deep sense of the responsibility imposed upon him, and the necessity of thoroughly
     fathoming this mysterious affair, as became a man in his relations with the parties, Captain
     Cuttle resolved to go down and examine the premises, and to keep the Grinder with him.
     Considering that youth as under arrest at present, the Captain was in some doubt whether it
     might not be expedient to handcuff him, or tie his ankles together, or attach a weight to his
     legs; but not being clear as to the legality of such formalities, the Captain decided merely to
     hold him by the shoulder all the way, and knock him down if he made any objection. 
However, he made none, and consequently got to the Instrument-maker's house without being
     placed under any more stringent restraint. As the shutters were not yet taken down, the
     Captain's first care was to have the shop opened; and when the daylight was freely admitted, he
     proceeded, with its aid, to further investigation. 
The Captain's first care was to establish himself in a chair in the shop, as President of the
     solemn tribunal that was sitting within him; and to require Rob to lie down in his bed under
     the counter, show exactly where he discovered the keys and packet when he awoke, how he found
     the door when he went to try it, how he started off to Brig Place—cautiously preventing the
     latter imitation from being carried farther than the threshold—and so on to the end of the
     chapter. When all this had been done several times, the Captain shook his head and seemed to
     think the matter had a bad look. 
Next, the Captain, with some indistinct idea of finding a body, instituted a strict search
     over the whole house; groping in the cellars with a lighted candle, thrusting his hook behind
     doors, bringing his head into violent contact with beams, and covering himself with cobwebs.
     Mounting up to the old man's bed-room, they found that he had not been in bed on the previous
     night, but had merely lain down on the coverlet, as was evident from the impression yet
     remaining there. 
`And I think, Captain,´ said Rob, looking round the room, `that when Mr. Gills was
     going in and out so often, these last few days, he was taking little things away, piecemeal,
     not to attract attention.´ 
`Aye!´ said the Captain, mysteriously. `When so, my lad?´ 
`Why,´ returned Rob, looking about, `I don't see his shaving tackle. Nor his brushes,
     Captain. Nor no shirts. Nor yet his shoes.´ 
As each of these articles was mentioned, Captain Cuttle took particular notice of the
     corresponding department of the Grinder, lest he should appear to have been in recent use, or
     should prove to be in present possession thereof. But Rob had no occasion to shave, certainly
     was not brushed, and wore the clothes he had worn for a long time past, beyond all possibility
     of mistake. 
`And what should you say,´ said the Captain—`not committing yourself—about his time of
     sheering off? Hey?´ 
`Why, I think, Captain,´ returned Rob, `that he must have gone pretty soon after I began to
     snore.´ 
`What o'clock was that?´ said the Captain, prepared to be very particular about the exact
     time. 
`How can I tell, Captain!´ answered Rob. `I only know that I'm a heavy sleeper at first, and
     a light one towards morning; and if Mr. Gills has come through the shop near daybreak, though
     ever so much on tip-toe, I'm pretty sure I should have heard him shut the door at all events.´ 
On mature consideration of this evidence, Captain Cuttle began to think that the
     Instrument-maker must have vanished of his own accord; to which logical conclusion he was
     assisted by the letter addressed to himself, which, as being unquestionably in the old man's
     handwriting, would seem, with no great forcing, to bear the construction, that he arranged of
     his own will, to go, and so went. The Captain had next to consider where and why? and as there
     was no way whatsoever that he saw to the solution of the first difficulty, he confined his
     media-tuitions to the second. 
Remembering the old man's curious manner, and the farewell he had taken of him; unaccountably
     fervent at the time, but quite intelligible now: a terrible apprehension strengthened on the
     Captain, that, overpowered by his anxieties and regrets for Walter, he had been driven to
     commit suicide. Unequal to the wear and tear of daily life, as he had often professed himself
     to be, and shaken as he no doubt was by the uncertainty and deferred hope he had undergone, it
     seemed no violently strained misgiving, but only too probable. 
Free from debt, and with no fear for his personal liberty, or the seizure of his goods, what
     else but such a state of madness could have hurried him away alone and secretly? As to his
     carrying some apparel with him, if he had really done so—and they were not even sure of that—he
     might have done so, the Captain argued, to prevent inquiry, to distract attention from his
     probable fate, or to ease the very mind that was now revolving all these possibilities. Such,
     reduced into plain language, and condensed within a small compass, was the final result and
     substance of Captain Cuttle's deliberations: which took a long time to arrive at this pass, and
     were, like some more public deliberations, very discursive and disorderly. 
Dejected and despondent in the extreme, Captain Cuttle felt it just to release Rob from the
     arrest in which he had placed him, and to enlarge him, subject to a kind of honourable
     inspection which he still resolved to exercise; and having hired a man, from Brogley the
     Broker, to sit in the shop during their absence, the Captain, taking Rob with him, issued forth
     upon a dismal quest after the mortal remains of Solomon Gills. 
Not a station-house or bone-house, or work-house in the metropolis escaped a visitation from
     the hard glazed hat. Along the wharves, among the shipping on the bank-side, up the river, down
     the river, here, there, everywhere, it went gleaming where men were thickest, like the hero's
     helmet in an epic battle. For a whole week the Captain read of all the found and missing people
     in all the newspapers and handbills, and went forth on expeditions at all hours of the day to
     identify Solomon Gills, in poor little ship-boys who had fallen over-board, an in tall
     foreigners with dark beards who had taken poison—`to make sure,' Captain Cuttle said, `that it
     warn't him.´ It is a sure thing that it never was, and that the good Captain had no other
     satisfaction. 
Captain Cuttle at last abandoned these attempts as hopeless, and set himself to consider what
     was to be done next. After several new perusals of his poor friend's letter, he considered that
     the maintenance of `a home in the old place for Walter´ was the primary duty imposed upon him.
     Therefore, the Captain's decision was, that he would keep house on the premises of Solomon
     Gills himself, and would go into the instrument-business, and see what came of it. 
But as this step involved the relinquishment of his apartments at Mrs. MacStinger's, and he
     knew that resolute woman would never hear of his deserting them, the Captain took the desperate
     determination of running away. 
`Now, look ye here, my lad,´ said the Captain to Rob, when he had matured this notable
     scheme, `to-morrow, I shan't be found in this here roadstead till night—not till arter midnight
     p'rhaps. But you keep watch till you hear me knock, and the moment you do, turn-to, and open
     the door.´ 
`Very good, Captain,´ said Rob. 
`You'll continue to be rated on these here books,´ pursued the Captain condescendingly, `and
     I don't say but what you may get promotion, if you and me should pull together with a will. But
     the moment you hear me knock to-morrow night, whatever time it is, turn-to and show yourself
     smart with the door.´ 
`I'll be sure to do it, Captain,´ replied Rob. 
`Because you understand,´ resumed the Captain, coming back again to enforce this charge upon
     his mind, `there may be, for anything I can say, a chase; and I might be took while I was
     waiting, if you didn't show yourself smart with the door.´ 
Rob again assured the Captain that he would be prompt and wakeful; and the Captain having
     made this prudent arrangement, went home to Mrs. MacStinger's for the last time. 
The sense the Captain had of its being the last time, and of the awful purpose hidden beneath
     his blue waistcoat, inspired him with such a mortal dread of Mrs. MacStinger, that the sound of
     that lady's foot down stairs at any time of the day, was sufficient to throw him into a fit of
     trembling. It fell out, too, that Mrs. MacStinger was in a charming temper—mild and placid as a
     house-lamb; and Captain Cuttle's conscience suffered terrible twinges, when she came up to
     inquire if she could cook him nothing for his dinner. 
`A nice small kidney-pudding now, Cap'en Cuttle,´ said his landlady: `or a sheep's heart.
     Don't mind my trouble.´ 
`No thank'ee, Ma'am,´ returned the Captain. 
`Have a roast fowl,´ said Mrs. MacStinger, `with a bit of weal stuffing and some egg sauce.
     Come, Cap'en Cuttle!Give yourself a little treat!´ 
`No thank'ee, Ma'am,´ returned the Captain very humbly. 
`I'am sure you're out of sorts, and want to be stimulated,´ said Mrs. MacStinger. `Why not
     have, for once in a way, a bottle of sherry wine?´ 
`Well, Ma'am,´ rejoined the Captain, `if you'd be so good as take a glass or two, I think I
     would try that. Would you do me the favour, Ma'am,´ said the Captain, torn to pieces by his
     conscience, `to accept a quarter's rent ahead?´ 
`And why so, Cap'en Cuttle?´ retorted Mrs. MacStinger—sharply, as the Captain thought. 
The Captain was frightened to death. `If you would, Ma'am,´ he said with submission, `it
     would oblige me. I can't keep my money very well. It pays itself out. I should take it kind if
     you'd comply.´ 
`Well, Cap'en Cuttle,´ said the unconscious MacStinger, rubbing her hands, `you can do as you
     please. It's not for me, with my family, to refuse, no more than it is to ask.´ 
`And would you, Ma'am.´ said the Captain, taking down the tin canister in which he kept his
     cash, from the top shelf of the cupboard, `be so good as offer eighteen-pence a-piece to the
     little family all round? If you could make it convenient, Ma'am, to pass the word presently for
     them children to come for'ard, in a body, I should be glad to see 'em.´ 
These innocent MacStingers were so many daggers to the Captain's breast, when they appeared
     in a swarm, and tore at him with the confiding trustfulness he so little deserved. The eye of
     Alexander MacStinger, who had been his favourite, was insupportable to the Captain; the voice
     of Juliana MacStinger, who was the picture of her mother, made a coward of him. 
Captain Cuttle kept up appearances, nevertheless, tolerably well, and for an hour or two was
     very hardly used and roughly handled by the young MacStingers: who in their childish frolics,
     did a little damage also to the glazed hat, by sitting in it, two at a time, as in a nest, and
     drumming on the inside of the crown with their shoes. At length the Captain sorrowfully
     dismissed them: taking leave of these cherubs with the poignant remorse and grief of a man who
     was going to execution. 
In the silence of night, the Captain packed up his heavier property in a chest, which he
     locked, intending to leave it there, in all probability for ever, but on the forlorn chance of
     one day finding a man sufficiently bold and desperate to come and ask for it. Of his lighter
     necessaries, the Captain made a bundle; and disposed his plate about his person, ready for
     flight. At the hour of midnight, when Brig Place was buried in slumber, and Mrs. MacStinger was
     lulled in sweet oblivion, with her infants around her, the guilty Captain, stealing down on
     tiptoe, in the dark, opened the door, closed it softly after him, and took to his heels. 
Pursued by the image of Mrs. MacStinger springing out of bed, and, regardless of costume,
     following and bringing him back; pursued also by a consciousness of his enormous crime; Captain
     Cuttle held on at a great pace, and allowed no grass to grow under his feet, between Brig Place
     and the Instrument-maker's door. It opened when he knocked—for Rob was on the watch—and when it
     was bolted and locked behind him, Captain Cuttle felt comparatively safe. 
`Whew!´ cried the Captain, looking round him. `It's a breather!´ 
`Nothing the matter, is there, Captain?´ cried the gaping Rob. 
`No, no!´ said Captain Cuttle, after changing colour, and listening to a passing footstep in
     the street. `But mind ye, my lad; if any lady, except either of them two as you see t'other
     day, ever comes and asks for Cap'en Cuttle, be sure to report no person of that name known, nor
     never heard of here; observe them orders, will you?´ 
`I'll take care, Captain,´ returned Rob. 
`You might say—if you liked,´ hesitated the Captain, `that you'd read in the paper that a
     Cap'en of that name was gone to Australia, emigrating, along with a whole ship's complement of
     people as had all swore never to come back no more.´ 
Rob nodded his understanding of these instructions; and Captain Cuttle promising to make a
     man of him, if he obeyed orders, dismissed him, yawning, to his bed under the counter, and went
     aloft to the chamber of Solomon Gills. 
What the Captain suffered next day, whenever a bonnet passed, or how often he darted out of
     the shop to elude imaginary MacStingers, and sought safety in the attic, cannot be told. But to
     avoid the fatigues attendant on this means of self-preservation, the Captain curtained the
     glass door of communication between the shop and parlour, on the inside, fitted a key to it
     from the bunch that had been sent to him: and cut a small hole of espial in the wall. The
     advantage of this fortification is obvious. On a bonnet appearing, the Captain instantly
     slipped into his garrison, locked himself up, and took a secret observation of the enemy.
     Finding it a false alarm, the Captain instantly slipped out again. And the bonnets in the
     street were so very numerous, and alarms were so inseparable from their appearance, that the
     Captain was almost incessantly slipping in and out all day long. 
Captain Cuttle found time, however, in the midst of this fatiguing service to inspect the
     stock; in connexion with which he had the general idea (very laborious to Rob) that too much
     friction could not be bestowed upon it, and that it could not be made too bright. He also
     ticketed a few attractive-looking articles at a venture, at prices ranging from ten shillings
     to fifty pounds, and exposed them in the window to the great astonishment of the public. 
After effecting these improvements, Captain Cuttle, surrounded by the instruments, began to
     feel scientific: and looked up at the stars at night, through the skylight, when he was smoking
     his pipe in the little back parlour before going to bed, as if he had established a kind of
     property in them. As a tradesman in the City, too, he began to have an interest in the Lord
     Mayor, and the Sheriffs, and in Public Companies; and felt bound to read the quotations of the
     Funds every day, though he was unable to make out, on any principle of navigation, what the
     figures meant, and could have very well dispensed with the fractions. Florence, the Captain
     waited on, with his strange news of Uncle Sol, immediately after taking possession of the
     Midshipman; but she was away from home. So the Captain sat himself down in his altered station
     of life, with no company but Rob the Grinder; and losing count of time, as men do when great
     changes come upon them, thought musingly of Walter, and of Solomon Gills, and even of Mrs.
     MacStinger herself, as among the things that had been.
