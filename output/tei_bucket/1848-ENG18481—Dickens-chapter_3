CHAPTER III
In which Mr. Dombey, as a Man and a Father, is seen at the Head of the
     Home-Department
THE funeral of the deceased lady having been `performed´ to the entire satisfaction of the
     undertaker, as well as of the neighbourhood at large, which is generally disposed to be
     captious on such a point, and is prone to take offence at any omissions or short-comings in the
     ceremonies, the various members of Mr. Dombey's household subsided into their several places in
     the domestic system. That small world, like the great one out of doors, had the capacity of
     easily forgetting its dead; and when the cook had said she was a quiet-tempered lady, and the
     house-keeper had said it was the common lot, and the butler had said who'd have thought it, and
     the housemaid had said she couldn't hardly believe it, and the footman had said it seemed
     exactly like a dream, they had quite worn the subject out, and began to think their mourning
     was wearing rusty too. 
On Richards, who was established up stairs in a state of honourable captivity, the dawn of
     her new life seemed to break cold and grey. Mr. Dombey's house was a large one, on the shady
     side of a tall, dark, dreadfully genteel street in the region between Portland Place and
     Bryanstone Square. It was a corner house, with great wide areas containing cellars frowned upon
     by barred window, and leered at by crooked-eyed doors leading to dustbins. It was a house of
     dismal state, with a circular back to it, containing a whole suit of drawing-rooms looking upon
     a gravelled yard, where two gaunt trees, with blackened trunks and branches, rattled rather
     than rustled, their leaves were so smoke-dried. The summer sun was never on the street, but in
     the morning about breakfast-time, when it came with the water-carts and the old-clothes men,
     and the people with geraniums, and the umbrella-mender, and the man who trilled the little bell
     of the Dutch clock as he went along. It was soon gone again to return no more that day; and the
     bands of music and the straggling Punch's shows going after it, left it a prey to the most
     dismal of organs, and white mice; with now and then a porcupine, to vary the entertainments;
     until the butlers whose families were dining out, began to stand at the house-doors in the
     twilight, and the lamplighter made his nightly failure in attempting to brighten up the street
     with gas. 
It was as blank a house inside as outside. When the funeral was over, Mr. Dombey ordered the
     furniture to be covered up—perhaps to preserve it for the son with whom his plans were all
     associated—and the rooms to be ungarnished, saving such as he retained for himself on the
     ground floor. Accordingly, mysterious shapes were made of tables and chairs, heaped together in
     the middle of rooms, and covered over with great winding-sheets. Bell-handles, window-blinds,
     and looking-glasses, being papered up in journals, daily and weekly, obtruded fragmentary
     accounts of deaths and dreadful murders. Every chandelier or lustre, muffled in Holland, looked
     like a monstrous tear depending from the ceiling's eye. Odours, as from vaults and damp places,
     came out of the chimneys. The dead and buried lady was awful in a picture-frame of ghastly
     bandages. Every gust of wind that rose, brought eddying round the corner from the neighbouring
     mews, some fragments of the straw that had been strewn before the house when she was ill,
     mildewed remains of which were still cleaving to the neighbourhood; and these, being always
     drawn by some invisible attraction to the threshold of the dirty house to let immediately
     opposite, addressed a dismal eloquence to Mr. Dombey's windows. 
The apartments which Mr. Dombey reserved for his own inhabiting, were attainable from the
     hall, and consisted of a sitting-room; a library, which was in fact a dressing-room, so that
     the smell of hot-pressed paper, vellum morocco, and Russia leather, contended in it with the
     smell of divers pairs of boots; and a kind of conservatory or little glass breakfast-room
     beyond, commanding a prospect of the trees before mentioned, and, generally speaking, of a few
     prowling cats. These three rooms opened upon one another. In the morning, when Mr. Dombey was
     at his breakfast in one or other of the two first-mentioned of them, as well as in the
     afternoon when he came home to dinner, a bell was rung for Richards to repair to this glass
     chamber, and there walk to and fro with her young charge. From the glimpses she caught of Mr.
     Dombey at these times, sitting in the dark distance, looking out towards the infant from among
     the dark heavy furniture—the house had been inhabited for years by his father, and in many of
     its appointments was old-fashioned and grim—she began to entertain ideas of him in his solitary
     state, as if he were a lone prisoner in a cell, or a strange apparition that was not to be
     accosted or understood. 
Little Paul Dombey's foster-mother had led this life herself, and had carried little Paul
     through it for some weeks; and had returned up stairs one day from a melancholy saunter through
     the dreary rooms of state (she never went out without Mrs. Chick, who called on fine mornings,
     usually accompanied by Miss Tox, to take her and Baby for an airing—or in other words, to march
     them gravely up and down the pavement; like a walking funeral); when, as she was sitting in her
     own room, the door was slowly and quietly opened, and a dark-eyed little girl looked in. 
`It's Miss Florence come home from her aunt's, no doubt,´ thought Richards, who had never
     seen the child before. `Hope I see you well, Miss.´ 
`Is that my brother?´ asked the child, pointing to the Baby. 
`Yes, my pretty,´ answered Richards. `Come and kiss him.´ 
But the child, instead of advancing, looked her earnestly in the face, and said: 
`What have you done with my Mama?´ 
`Lord bless the little creeter!´ cried Richards, `what a sad question! I done? Nothing,
     Miss.´ 
`What have they done with my Mama?´ inquired the child. 
`I never saw such a melting thing in all my life!´ said Richards, who naturally substituted
     for this child one of her own, inquiring for herself in like circumstances. `Come nearer here,
     my dear Miss! Don't be afraid of me.´ 
`I am not afraid of you,´ said the child, drawing nearer. `But I want to know what they have
     done with my Mama.´ 
`My darling,´ said Richards, `you wear that pretty black frock in remembrance of your Mama.´ 
`I can remember my Mama,´ returned the child, with tears springing to her eyes, `in any
     frock.´ 
`But people put on black, to remember people when they're gone.´ 
`Where gone?´ asked the child. 
`Come and sit down by me,´ said Richards, `and I'll tell you a story.´ 
With a quick perception that it was intended to relate to what she had asked, little Florence
     laid aside the bonnet she had held in her hand until now, and sat down on a stool at the
     Nurse's feet, looking up into her face. 
`Once upon a time,´ said Richards, `there was a lady—a very good lady, and her little
     daughter dearly loved her.´ 
`A very good lady and her little daughter dearly loved her,´ repeated the child. 
`Who, when Good thought it right that it should be so, was taken ill and died.´ 
The child shuddered. 
`Died, never to be seen again by any one on earth, and was buried in the ground where the
     trees grow.´ 
`The cold ground?´ said the child, shuddering again. 
`No! The warm ground,´ returned Polly, seizing her advantage, `where the ugly little seeds
     turn into beautiful flowers, and into grass, and corn, and I don't know what all besides. Where
     good people turn into bright angels, and fly away to Heaven!´ 
The child, who had drooped her head, raised it again, and sat looking at her intently. 
`So; let me see,´ said Polly, not a little flurried between this earnest scrutiny, her desire
     to comfort the child, her sudden success, and her very slight confidence in her own powers.
     `So, when this lady died, wherever they took her, or wherever they put her, she went to GOD!
     and she prayed to Him, this lady did,´ said Polly, affecting herself beyond measure; being
     heartily in earnest, `to teach her little daughter to be sure of that in her heart: and to know
     that she was happy there and loved her still: and to hope and try—Oh, all her life—to meet her
     there one day, never, never, never to part any more.´ 
`It was my Mama!´ exclaimed the child, springing up, and clasping her round the neck. 
`And the child's heart,´ said Polly, drawing her to her breast: `the little daughter's heart
     was so full of the truth of this, that even when she heard it from a strange nurse that
     couldn't tell it right, but was a poor mother herself and that was all, she found a comfort in
     it—didn't feel so lonely—sobbed and cried upon her bosom—took kindly to the baby lying in her
     lap—and—there, there, there!´ said Polly, smoothing the child's curls and dropping tears upon
     them. `There, poor dear!´ 
`Oh well, Miss Floy! And won't your Pa be angry neither!´ cried a quick voice at the door,
     proceeding from a short, brown, womanly girl of fourteen, with a little snub nose, and black
     eyes like jet beads. `When it was 'tickerlerly given out that you wasn't to go and worrit the
     wet nurse.´ 
`She don't worry me,´ was the surprised rejoinder of Polly. `I am very fond of children.´ 
`Oh! but begging your pardon, Mrs. Richards, that don't matter, you know,' returned the
     black-eyed girl, who was so desperately sharp and biting that she seemed to make one's eyes
     water. `I may be very fond of pennywinkles, Mrs. Richards, but it don't follow that I'm to have
     'em for tea.´ 
`Well, it don't matter,´ said Polly. 
`Oh, thank'ee, Mrs. Richards, don't it!´ returned the sharp girl. `Remembering, however, if
     you'll be so good, that Miss Floy's under my charge, and Master Paul's under your'n.´ 
`But still we needn't quarrel,´ said Polly. 
`Oh no, Mrs. Richards,´ rejoined Spitfire. `Not at all, I don't wish it, we needn't stand
     upon that footing, Miss Floy being a permanency, Master Paul a temporary.´ Spitfire made use of
     none but comma pauses; shooting out whatever she had to say in one sentence, and in one breath,
     if possible. 
`Miss Florence has just come home, hasn't she?´ asked Polly. 
`Yes, Mrs. Richards, just come, and here, Miss Floy, before you've been in the house a
     quarter of an hour, you go a smearing your wet face against the expensive mourning that Mrs.
     Richards is a wearing for your Ma!´ With this remonstrance, young Spitfire, whose real name was
     Susan Nipper, detached the child from her new friend by a wrench—as if she were a tooth. But
     she seemed to do it, more in the excessively sharp exercise of her official functions, than
     with any deliberate unkindness. 
`She'll be quite happy, now she has come home again,´ said Polly, nodding to her with an
     encouraging smile upon her wholesome face, `and will be so pleased to see her dear Papa
     to-night.´ 
`Lork, Mr. Richards!´ cried Miss Nipper, taking up her words with a jerk. `Don't. See her
     dear Papa indeed! I should like to see her do it!´ 
`Won't she then?´ asked Polly. 
`Lork, Mrs. Richards, no, her Pa's a deal too wrapped up in somebody else, and before there
     was a somebody else to be wrapped up in she never was a favourite, girls are thrown away in
     this house, Mrs. Richards, I assure you.´ 
The child looked quickly from one nurse to the other, as if she understood and felt what was
     said. 
`You surprise me!´ cried Polly. `Hasn't Mr. Dombey seen her since—´ 
`No,´ interrupted Susan Nipper. `Not once since, and he hadn't hardly set his eyes upon her
     before that for months and months, and I don't think he'd have known her for his own child if
     he had met her in the streets, or would know her for his own child if he was to meet her in the
     streets to-morrow, Mrs. Richards, as to me,´ said Spitfire, with a giggle, `I doubt if
     he's aweer of my existence.´ 
`Pretty dear!´ said Richards; meaning, not Miss Nipper, but the little Florence. 
`Oh! there's a Tartar within a hundred miles of where we're now in conversation, I can tell
     you, Mrs. Richards, present company always excepted too,´ said Susan Nipper; `wish you good
     morning, Mrs. Richards, now Miss Floy, you come along with me, and don't go hanging back like a
     naughty wicked child that judgments is no example to, don't.´ 
In spite of being thus adjured, and in spite also of some hauling on the part of Susan
     Nipper, tending towards the dislocation of her right shoulder, little Florence broke away, and
     kissed her new friend, affectionately. 
`Good-bye!´ said the child. `God bless you! I shall come to see you again soon, and you'll
     come to see me? Susan will let us. Won't you, Susan?´ 
Spitfire seemed to be in the main a good-natured little body, although a disciple of that
     school of trainers of the young idea which holds that childhood, like money, must be shaken and
     rattled and jostled about a good deal to keep it bright. For, being thus appealed to with some
     endearing gestures and caresses, she folded her small arms and shook her head, and conveyed a
     relenting expression into her very-wide-open black eyes. 
`It ain't right of you to ask it, Miss Floy, for you know I can't refuse you, but Mrs.
     Richards and me will see what can be done, if Mrs. Richards likes, I may wish, you see, to take
     a voyage to Chaney, Mrs. Richards, but I mayn't know how to leave the London Docks.´ 
Richards assented to the proposition. 
`This house ain't so exactly ringing with merry-making,´ said Miss Nipper, `that one need be
     lonelier than one must be. Your Toxes and your Chickses may draw out my two front double teeth,
     Mrs. Richards, but that's no reason why I need offer 'em the whole set.´ 
This proposition was also assented to by Richards, as an obvious one. 
`So I'm agreeable, I'm sure,´ said Susan Nipper, `to live friendly, Mrs. Richards, while
     Master Paul continues a permanency, if the means can be planned out without going openly
     against orders, but goodness gracious ME, Miss Floy, you haven't got your things off yet, you
     naughty child, you haven't, come along!´ 
With these words, Susan Nipper, in a transport of coercion, made a charge at her young ward,
     and swept her out of the room. 
The child, in her grief and neglect, was so gentle, so quiet, and uncomplaining; was
     possessed of so much affection that no one seemed to care to have, and so much sorrowful
     intelligence that no one seemed to mind or think about the wounding of; that Polly's heart was
     sore when she was left alone again. In the simple passage that had taken place between herself
     and the motherless little girl, her own motherly heart had been touched no less than the
     child's; and she felt, as the child did, that there was something of confidence and interest
     between them from that moment. 
Nothwithstanding Mr. Toodle's great reliance on Polly, she was perhaps in point of artificial
     accomplishments very little his superior. But she was a good plain sample of a nature that is
     ever, in the mass, better, truer, higher, nobler, quicker to feel, and much more constant to
     retain, all tenderness and pity, self-denial and devotion, than the nature of men. And,
     perhaps, unlearned as she was, she could have brought a dawning knowledge home to Mr. Dombey at
     that early day, which would not then have struck him in the end like lightning. 
But this is from the purpose. Polly only thought, at that time, of improving on her
     successful propitiation of Miss Nipper, and devising some means of having little Florence
     beside her, lawfully, and without rebellion. An opening happened to present itself that very
     night. 
She had been rung down into the glass room as usual, and had walked about and about it a long
     time, with the baby in her arms, when, to her great surprise and dismay, Mr. Dombey came out,
     suddenly, and stopped before her. 
`Good evening, Richards.´ 
Just the same austere, stiff gentleman, as he had appeared to her on that first day. Such a
     hard-looking gentleman, that she involuntarily dropped her eyes and her curtsey at the same
     time. 
`How is Master Paul, Richards?´ 
`Quite thriving, Sir, and well.´ 
`He looks so,´ said Mr. Dombey, glancing with great interest at the tiny face she uncovered
     for his observation, and yet affecting to be half careless of it. `They give you everything you
     want, I hope?´ 
`Oh yes, thank you, Sir.´ 
She suddenly appended such an obvious hesitation to this reply, however, that Mr. Dombey, who
     had turned away, stopped, and turned round again, inquiringly. 
`I believe nothing is so good for making children lively and cheerful, Sir, as seeing other
     children playing about 'em,´ observed Polly, taking courage. 
`I think I mentioned to you, Richards, when you came here,´ said Mr. Dombey, with a frown,
     `that I wished you to see as little of your family as possible. You can continue your walk if
     you please.´ 
With that, he disappeared into his inner room; and Polly had the satisfaction of feeling that
     he had thoroughly misunderstood her object, and that she had fallen into disgrace without the
     least advancement of her purpose. 
Next night, she found him walking about the conservatory when she came down. As she stopped
     at the door, checked by this unusual sight, and uncertain whether to advance or retreat, he
     called her in. 
`If you really think that sort of society is good the child,´ he said sharply, as if there
     had been no interval since she proposed it, `where's Miss Florence?´ 
`Nothing could be better than Miss Florence, Sir,´ said Polly eagerly, `but I understood from
     her little maid that they were not to—´ 
Mr. Dombey rang the bell, and walked till it was answered. 
`Tell them always to let Miss Florence be with Richards when she chooses, and go out with
     her, and so forth. Tell them to let the children be together, when Richards wishes it.´ 
The iron was now hot, and Richards striking on it boldly—it was a good cause and she was bold
     in it, though instinctively afraid of Mr. Dombey—requested that Miss Florence might be sent down
     then and there, to make friends with here little brother. 
She feigned to be dandling the child as the servant retired on this errand, but she thought
     that she saw Mr. Dombey's colour changed; that the expression of his face quite altered; that
     he turned, hurriedly, as if to gainsay what he had said, or she had said, or both, and was only
     deterred by very shame. 
And she was right. The last time he had seen his slighted child, there had been that in the
     sad embrace between her and her dying mother, which was at once a revelation and a reproach to
     him. Let him be absorbed as he would in the Son on whom he built such high hopes, he could not
     forget that closing scene. He could not forget that he had had no part in it. That, at the
     bottom of its clear depths of tenderness and truth, lay those two figures clasped in each
     other's arms, while he stood on the bank above them, looking down a mere spectator—not a sharer
     with them—quite shut out. 
Unable to exclude these things from his remembrance, or to keep his mind free from such
     imperfect shapes of the meaning with which they were fraught, as were able to make themselves
     visible to him through the mist of his pride, his previous feelings of indifference towards
     little Florence changed into an uneasiness of an extraordinary kind. He almost felt as if she
     watched and distrusted him. As if she held the clue to something secret in his breast, of the
     nature of which he was hardly informed himself. As if she had an innate knowledge of one
     jarring and discordant string within him, and her very breath could sound it. 
His feeling about the child had been negative from her birth. He had never conceived an
     aversion to her: it had not been worth his while or in his humour. She had never been a
     positively disagreeable object to him. But now he was ill at ease about her. She troubled his
     peace. He would have preferred to put her idea aside altogether, if he had known how.
     Perhaps—who shall decide on such mysteries!—he was afraid that he might come to hate her. 
When little Florence timidly presented herself, Mr. Dombey stopped in his pacing up and down
     and looked towards her. Had he looked with greater interest and with a father's eye, he might
     have read in her keen glance the impulses and fears that made her waver; the passionate desire
     to run clinging to him, crying, as she hid her face in his embrace, `Oh father, try to love me!
     there's no one else!´ the dread of a repulse; the fear of being too bold, and of offending him;
     the pitiable need in which she stood of some assurance and encouragement; and how her
     overcharged young heart was wandering to find some natural resting-place, for its sorrow and
     affection. 
But he saw nothing of this. He saw her pause irresolutely at the door and look towards him;
     and he saw no more. 
`Come in,´ he said, `come in: what is the child afraid of?´ 
She came in; and after glancing round her for a moment with an uncertain air, stood pressing
     her small hands hard together, close within the door. 
`Come here, Florence,´ said her father, coldly. `Do you know who I am?´ 
`Yes, Papa.´ 
`Have you nothing to say to me?´ 
The tears that stood in her eyes as she raised them quickly to his face, were frozen by the
     expression it wore. She looked down again, and put out her trembling hand. 
Mr. Dombey took it loosely in his own, and stood looking down upon her for a moment, as if he
     knew as little as the child, what to say or do. 
`There! Be a good girl,´ he said, patting her on the head, and regarding her as it were by
     stealth with a disturbed and doubtful look. `Go to Richards! Go!´ 
His little daughter hesitated for another instant as though she would have clung about him
     still, or had some lingering hope that he might raise her in his arms and kiss her. She looked
     up in his face once more. He thought how like her expression was then, to what it had been when
     she looked round at the Doctor—that night—and instinctively dropped her hand and turned away. 
It was not difficult to perceive that Florence was at a great disadvantage in her father's
     presence. It was not only a constraint upon the child's mind, but even upon the natural grace
     and freedom of her actions. Still Polly persevered with all the better heart for seeing this;
     and, judging of Mr. Dombey by herself, had great confidence in the mute appeal of poor little
     Florence's mourning dress. `It's hard indeed,´ thought Polly, `if he takes only to one little
     motherless child, when he has another, and that a girl, before his eyes.´ 
So, Polly kept her before his eyes, as long as she could, and managed so well with little
     Paul, as to make it very plain that he was all the livelier for his sister's company. When it
     was time to withdraw up stairs again, she would have sent Florence into the inner room to say
     good-night to her father, but the child was timid and drew back: and when she urged her again,
     said, spreading her hands before her eyes, as if to shut out her own unworthiness, `Oh no, no!
     He don't want me. He don't want me!´ 
The little altercation between them had attracted the notice of Mr. Dombey, who inquired from
     the table where he was sitting at his wine, what the matter was. 
`Miss Florence was afraid of interrupting, Sir, if she came in to say good-night,´ said
     Richards. 
`It doesn't matter,´ returned Mr. Dombey. `You can let her come and go without regarding me.´ 
The child shrunk as she listened—and was gone before her humble friend looked round again. 
However, Polly triumphed not a little in the success of her well-intentioned scheme, and in
     the address with which she had brought it to bear: whereof she made a full disclosure to
     Spitfire when she was once more safely intrenched up stairs. Miss Nipper received that proof of
     her confidence, as well as the prospect of their free association for the future, rather
     coldly, and was anything but enthusiastic in her demonstrations of joy. 
`I thought you would have been pleased,´ said Polly. 
`Oh yes, Mrs. Richards, I'm very well pleased, thank you,´ returned Susan, who had suddenly
     become so very upright that she seemed to have put an additional bone in her stays. 
`You don't show it,´ said Polly. 
`Oh! Being only a permanency I couldn't be expected to show it like a temporary,' said Susan
     Nipper. `Temporaries carries it all before 'em here, I find, but though there's a excellent
     party-wall between this house and the next, I mayn't exactly like to go to it, Mrs. Richards,
     notwithstanding!´
