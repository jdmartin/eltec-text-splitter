CHAPTER XXXI.
HOW MARY PASSED THE NIGHT.

"To think
 That all this long interminable night,
Which I have passed in thinking on two words—
 'Guilty'—'Not Guilty!'—like one happy moment
 O'er many a head hath flown unheeded by;
 O'er happy sleepers dreaming in their bliss
 Of bright to-morrows—or far happier still,
 With deep breath buried in forgetfulness.
 O all the dismallest images of death
 Did swim before my eyes!"
Wilson.
And now, where was Mary?
How Job's heart would have been relieved of one of its cares if he could have seen her: for
     he was in a miserable state of anxiety about her; and many and many a time through that long
     night he scolded her and himself; her for her obstinacy, and himself for his weakness in
     yielding to her obstinacy, when she insisted on being the one to follow and find out Will.
She did not pass that night in bed any more than Job; but she was under a respectable roof,
     and among kind, though rough people.
She had offered no resistance to the old boatman, when he had clutched her arm, in order to
     insure her following him, as he threaded the crowded dock-ways, and dived up strange
     bye-streets. She came on meekly after him, scarcely thinking in her stupor where she was going,
     and glad (in a dead, heavy way) that some one was deciding things for her.
He led her to an old-fashioned house, almost as small as house could be, which had been built
     long ago, before all the other part of the street, and had a country-town look about it in the
     middle of that bustling back street. He pulled her into the house-place; and relieved to a
     certain degree of his fear of losing her on the way, he exclaimed,
"There!" giving a great slap of one hand on her back.
The room was light and bright, and roused Mary (perhaps the slap on her back might help a
     little, too), and she felt the awkwardness of accounting for her presence to a little bustling
     old woman who had been moving about the fire-place on her entrance. The boatman took it very
     quietly, never deigning to give any explanation, but sitting down in his own particular chair,
     and chewing tobacco, while he looked at Mary with the most satisfied air imaginable, half
     triumphantly, as if she were the captive of his bow and spear, and half defyingly, as if daring
     her to escape.
The old woman, his wife, stood still, poker in hand, waiting to be told who it was that her
     husband had brought home so unceremoniously; but, as she looked in amazement the girl's cheek
     flushed, and then blanched to a dead whiteness; a film came over her eyes, and catching at the
     dresser for support in that hot whirling room, she fell in a heap on the floor.
Both man and wife came quickly to her assistance. They raised her up, still insensible, and
     he supported her on one knee, while his wife pattered away for some cold fresh water. She threw
     it straight over Mary; but though it caused a great sob, the eyes still remained closed, and
     the face as pale as ashes.
"Who is she, Ben?" asked the woman, as she rubbed her unresisting, powerless hands.
"How should I know?" answered her husband gruffly.
"Well-a-well!" (in a soothing tone, such as you use to irritated children), and as if half to
     herself, "I only thought you might, you know, as you brought her home. Poor thing! we must not
     ask aught about her, but that she needs help. I wish I'd my salts at home, but I lent 'em to
     Mrs. Burton, last Sunday in church, for she could not keep awake through the sermon. Dear-a-me,
     how white she is!"
"Here! you hold her up a bit," said her husband.
She did as he desired, still crooning to herself, not caring for his short, sharp
     interruptions as she went on; and, indeed, to her old, loving heart, his crossest words fell
     like pearls and diamonds, for he had been the husband of her youth; and even he, rough and
     crabbed as he was, was secretly soothed by the sound of her voice, although not for worlds, if
     he could have helped it, would he have shown any of the love that was hidden beneath his rough
     outside.
"What's the old fellow after?" said she, bending over Mary, so as to accommodate the drooping
     head. "Taking my pen, as I've had better nor five year. Bless us, and save us! he's burning it!
     Ay, I see now, he's his wits about him; burnt feathers is always good for a faint. But they
     don't bring her round, poor wench! Now what's he after next? Well! he is a bright one, my old
     man! That I never thought of that, to be sure!" exclaimed she, as he produced a square bottle
     of smuggled spirits, labelled "Golden Wasser," from a corner cupboard in their little room.
"That'll do!" said she, as the dose he poured into Mary's open mouth made her start and
     cough. "Bless the man! It's just like him to be so tender and thoughtful!"
"Not a bit!" snarled he, as he was relieved by Mary's returning colour, and opened eyes, and
     wondering, sensible gaze; "not a bit! I never was such a fool afore."
His wife helped Mary to rise, and placed her in a chair.
"All's right now, young woman?" asked the boatman, anxiously.
"Yes, sir, and thank you. I'm sure, sir, I don't know rightly how to thank you," faltered
     Mary, softly forth.
"Be hanged to you and your thanks." And he shook himself, took his pipe, and went out without
     deigning another word; leaving his wife sorely puzzled as to the character and history of the
     stranger within her doors.
Mary watched the boatman leave the house, and then, turning her sorrowful eyes to the face of
     her hostess, she attempted feebly to rise, with the intention of going away,—where she knew
     not.
"Nay! nay! who e'er thou be'st, thou'rt not fit to go out into the street. Perhaps" (sinking
     her voice a little) "thou'rt a bad one; I almost misdoubt thee, thou'rt so pretty. Well-a-well!
     it's the bad ones as have the broken hearts, sure enough; good folk never get utterly cast
     down, they've always getten hope in the Lord: it's the sinful as bear the bitter, bitter grief
     in their crushed hearts, poor souls; it's them we ought, most of all, to pity and to help. She
     shanna leave the house to-night, choose who she is,—worst woman in Liverpool, she shanna. I
     wished I knew where th' old man picked her up, that I do."
Mary had listened feebly to this soliloquy, and now tried to satisfy her hostess in weak,
     broken sentences.
"I'm not a bad one, missis, indeed. Your master took me out to sea after a ship as had
     sailed. There was a man in it as might save a life at the trial to-morrow. The captain would
     not let him come, but he says he'll come back in the pilot-boat." She fell to sobbing at the
     thought of her waning hopes, and the old woman tried to comfort her, beginning with her
     accustomed,
"Well-a-well! and he'll come back, I'm sure. I know he will; so keep up your heart. Don't
     fret about it. He's sure to be back."
"Oh! I'm afraid! I'm sore afraid he won't," cried Mary, consoled, nevertheless, by the
     woman's assertions, all groundless as she knew them to be.
Still talking half to herself and half to Mary, the old woman prepared tea, and urged her
     visitor to eat and refresh herself. But Mary shook her head at the proffered food, and only
     drank a cup of tea with thirsty eagerness. For the spirits had thrown her into a burning heat,
     and rendered each impression received through her senses of the most painful distinctness and
     intensity, while her head ached in a terrible manner.
She disliked speaking, her power over her words seemed so utterly gone. She used quite
     different expressions to those she intended. So she kept silent, while Mrs. Sturgis (for that
     was the name of her hostess) talked away, and put her tea-things by, and moved about
     incessantly, in a manner that increased the dizziness in Mary's head. She felt as if she ought
     to take leave for the night and go. But where?
Presently the old man came back, crosser and gruffer than when he went away. He kicked aside
     the dry shoes his wife had prepared for him, and snarled at all she said. Mary attributed this
     to his finding her still there, and gathered up her strength for an effort to leave the house.
     But she was mistaken. By-and-bye, he said (looking right into the fire, as if addressing it),
     "Wind's right against them!"
"Ay, ay, and is it so?" said his wife, who, knowing him well, knew that his surliness
     proceeded from some repressed sympathy. "Well-a-well, wind changes often at night. Time enough
     before morning. I'd bet a penny it has changed sin' thou looked."
She looked out of their little window at a weather-cock, near, glittering in the moonlight;
     and as she was a sailor's wife, she instantly recognised the unfavourable point at which the
     indicator seemed stationary, and giving a heavy sigh, turned into the room, and began to beat
     about in her own mind for some other mode of comfort.
"There's no one else who can prove what you want at the trial to-morrow, is there?" asked
     she.
"No one!" answered Mary.
"And you've no clue to the one as is really guilty, if t'other is not?"
Mary did not answer, but trembled all over.
Sturgis saw it.
"Don't bother her with thy questions," said he to his wife. "She mun go to bed, for she's all
     in a shiver with the sea air. I'll see after the wind, hang it, and the weather-cock, too. Tide
     will help 'em when it turns."
Mary went up-stairs murmuring thanks and blessings on those who took the stranger in. Mrs.
     Sturgis led her into a little room redolent of the sea and foreign lands. There was a small bed
     for one son, bound for China; and a hammock slung above for another, who was now tossing in the
     Baltic. The sheets looked made out of sail-cloth, but were fresh and clean in spite of their
     brownness.
Against the wall were wafered two rough drawings of vessels with their names written
     underneath, on which the mother's eyes caught, and gazed until they filled with tears. But she
     brushed the drops away with the back of her hand, and in a cheerful tone went on to assure Mary
     the bed was well aired.
"I cannot sleep, thank you. I will sit here, if you please," said Mary, sinking down on the
     window-seat.
"Come, now," said Mrs. Sturgis, "my master told me to see you to bed, and I mun. What's the
     use of watching? A watched pot never boils, and I see you are after watching that weather-cock.
     Why now, I try never to look at it, else I could do nought else. My heart many a time goes sick
     when the wind rises, but I turn away and work away, and try never to think on the wind, but on
     what I ha' getten to do."
"Let me stay up a little," pleaded Mary, as her hostess seemed so resolute about seeing her
     to bed. Her looks won her suit.
"Well, I suppose I mun. I shall catch it down stairs, I know. He'll be in a fidget till
     you're getten to bed, I know; so you mun be quiet if you are so bent upon staying up."
And quietly, noiselessly, Mary watched the unchanging weather-cock through the night. She sat
     on the little window-seat, her hand holding back the curtain which shaded the room from the
     bright moonlight without; her head resting its weariness against the corner of the
     window-frame; her eyes burning and stiff with the intensity of her gaze.
The ruddy morning stole up the horizon, casting a crimson glow into the watcher's room.
It was the morning of the day of trial!
