CHAPTER VIII.

Like Alexander, I will reign,
   And I will reign alone,
My thoughts shall ever more disdain
   A rival near my throne.
But I must rule and govern still,
   And always give the law,
And have each subject at my will,
   And all to stand in awe.
Montrose.
One very hot afternoon, shortly after the ball, Captain Morville walked to Hollywell,
      accelerating his pace under the influence of anxious reflections.
He could not determine whether Charles had spoken in jest; but, in spite of Guy's extreme
      youth, he feared there was ground for the suspicion excited by the hint, and was persuaded
      that such an attachment could produce nothing but unhappiness to his cousin, considering how
      little confidence could be placed in Guy. He perceived that there was much to inspire
      affection —attractive qualities, amiable disposition, the talent for music, and now this
      recently discovered power of versifying, all were in Guy's favour, besides the ancient name
      and long ancestry which conferred a romantic interest, and caused even Philip to look up to
      him with a feudal feeling as head of the family. There was also the familiar intercourse to
      increase the danger; and Philip, as he reflected on these things, trembled for Laura, and felt
      himself her only protector; for his uncle was nobody, Mrs. Edmonstone was infatuated, and
      Charles would not listen to reason. To make
       everything worse, he had that morning heard that there was to be a grand
      inspection of the regiment and a presentation of colours; Colonel Deane was very anxious, and
      it was plain that in the interval the officers would be allowed little leisure. The whole
      affair was to end with a ball, which would lead to a repetition of what had already disturbed
      him.
Thus meditating, Philip, heated and dusty, walked into the smooth green enclosure of
      Hollywell. Everything, save the dancing clouds of insect youth which whirled in his face, was
      drooping in the heat. The house—every door and window opened—seemed gasping for breath; the
      cows sought refuge in the shade; the pony drooped its head drowsily; the leaves hung wearily;
      the flowers were faint and thirsty; and Bustle was stretched on the stone steps, mouth open,
      tongue out, only his tail now and then moving, till he put back his ears and crested his head
      to greet the arrival. Philip heard the sounds that had caused the motion of the sympathizing
      tail,—the rich tones of Guy's voice. Stepping over the dog, he entered, and heard more
      clearly— 'Two loving hearts may sever, For sorrow fails them never.' And then another
      voice—
In the drawing-room, cool and comfortable in the green shade of the Venetian blinds of the
      bay window, stood Laura, leaning on the piano, close to Guy, who sat on the music-stool,
      looking thoroughly at home in his brown shooting-coat, and loosely-tied handkerchief.
Any one but Philip would have been out of temper, but he shook hands as cordially as usual,
      and would not even be the first to remark on the heat.
Laura told him he looked hot and tired, and invited him to come out to the others, and cool
      himself on the
       lawn. She went for her parasol, Guy ran for her camp stool, and Philip, going to
      the piano, read what they had been singing. The lines were in Laura's writing, corrected, here
      and there, in Guy's hand.

BE STEADFAST.
Two loving hearts may sever,
 Yet love shall fail them never.
 Love brightest beams in sorrow's night,
 Love is of life the light.
 Two loving hearts may sever,
 Yet hope shall fail them never.
 Hope is a star in sorrow's night,—
 Forget-me-not of light.
 Two loving hearts may sever,
 Yet faith may fail them never.
 Trust on through sorrow's night;
 Faith is of love and hope the light.
 Two loving hearts may sever,
 For sorrow fails them never.
 Who knows not love in sorrow's night,
 He knows not love in light.
Philip was by no means pleased. However, it was in anything but a sentimental manner that
      Guy, looking over him, said, 'For sever, read, be separated, but 'a' wouldn't rhyme.'
'I translated it into prose, and Guy made it verse,' ssid Laura; 'I hope you approve of our
      performance.'
'It is that thing of Helm von Chezy, Beharre , is it not?' said Philip,
      particularly civil, because he was so much annoyed. 'You have rendered the spirit very well;
      but you have sacrificed a good deal to your double rhymes.'
'Yes, those last lines are not troubled with any equality of feet,' said Guy; 'but the
      repetition is half the beauty. It put me in mind of those lines of Burns—
       'Had we never loved so kindly, Had we never loved so blindly, Never met and
      never parted, We had ne'er been broken hearted;' but there is a trust in these that is more
      touching than that despair.'
'Yes, the despair is ready to wish the love had never been,' said Laura. 'It does not see
      the star of trust. Why did you use that word 'trust' only once, Guy?'
'I did not want to lose the three—faith, hope, love, —faith keeping the other two
      alive.'
'My doubt was whether it was right to have that analogy.'
'Surely,' said Guy, eagerly, 'that analogy must be the best part of earthly love?'
Here Charlotte came to see if Guy and Laura meant to sing all the afternoon, and they went
      out. They found the others in the arbour, and Charlotte's histories of its construction gave
      Philip little satisfaction. They next proceeded to talk over the ball.
'Ah!' said Philip, 'balls are the fashion just now. What do you say, Amy, [he was more
      inclined to patronize her than any one else] to the gaieties we are going to provide for
      you?'
'You! Are you going to have your new colours? Oh! you are not going to give us a ball?'
'Well! that is fun!' cried Guy. 'What glory Maurice de Courcy must be in!'
'He is gone to Allonby,' said Philip, 'to announce it; saying, he must persuade his father
      to put off their going to Brighton. Do you think he will succeed?'
'Hardly,' said Laura; 'poor Lady Kilcoran was so knocked up by their ball that she is the
      more in want of sea air. Oh, mamma! Eva must come and stay here.'
'That she must,' said Mrs. Edmonstone; 'that will make it easy. She is the only one who will
      care about the ball.'
Philip was obliged to conceal his vexation, and to
       answer the many eager questions about the arrangements. He stayed to dinner, and
      as the others went indoors to dress, he lingered near Charlotte, assuming, with some
      difficulty, an air of indifference, and said,— 'Well, Charlotte, did you tease Guy into
      showing you those verses?'
'O yes,' said Charlotte, with what the French call un air capable.
'Well, what were they?'
'That I mustn't tell. They were very pretty; but I've promised.'
'Promised what?'
'Never to say anything about them. He made it a condition with me, and I assure you I am to
      be trusted.'
'Right,' said Philip; 'I'll ask no more.'
'It would be of no use,' said Charlotte, shaking her head, as if she wished he would prove
      her further.
Philip was in hopes of being able to speak to Laura after dinner, but his uncle wanted him
      to come and look over the plans of an estate adjoining Redclyffe, which there was some idea of
      purchasing. Such an employment would in general have been congenial, but on this occasion it
      was only by a strong force that he could chain his attention, for Guy was pacing the terrace
      with Laura and Amabel, and as they passed and repassed the window, he now and then caught
      sounds of repeating poetry.
In this Guy excelled. He did not read aloud well; he was too rapid, and eyes and thoughts
      were apt to travel still faster than the lips, thus producing confusion; but no one could
      recite better when a passage had taken strong hold of his imagination, and he gave it the full
      effect of the modulations of his fine voice, conveying in its inflections the impressions
      which stirred him profoundly. He was just now enchanted with his first reading of 'Thalaba,'
      where he found all manner of deep meanings, to which the sisters listened with wonder and
      delight. He repeated, in a low, awful,
       thrilling tone, that made Amy shudder, the lines in the seventh book ending
      with—
'You have not been so taken up with any book since Sintram,' said Laura.
'It is like Sintram,' he replied.
'Like it?'
'So it seems to me. A strife with the powers of darkness; the victory, forgiveness,
      resignation, death.'
'I wish you would not speak as if you were Thalaba yourself,' said Amy; 'you bring the whole
      Domdaniel round us.'
'I am afraid he is going to believe himself Thalaba as well as Sintram,' said Laura. 'But
      you know Southey did not see all this himself, and did not understand it when it was pointed
      out.'
'Don't tell us that,' said Amy.
'Nay, I think there is something striking in it,' said Guy; then, with a sudden transition,
      'but is not this ball famous?'
And their talk was of balls and reviews till nine o'clock, when they were summoned to
      tea.
On the whole, Philip returned to Broadstone by no means comforted.
Never had he known so much difficulty in attending with patience to his duties as in the
      course of the next fortnight. They became a greater durance, as he at length looked his
      feelings full in the face, and became aware of their true nature.
He perceived that the loss of Laura would darken his whole existence; yet he thought that,
      were he only secure of her happiness, he could have resigned her in silence. Guy was, however,
      one of the last men in the world whom he could bear to see in possession of her;
       and probably she was allowing herself to be entangled, if not in heart, at least
      in manner. If so, she should not be unwarned. He had been her guide from childhood, and he
      would not fail her now.
Three days before the review, he succeeded in finding time for a walk to Hollywell, not
      fully decided on the part he should act, though resolved on making some remonstrance. He was
      crossing a stile, about a mile and a half from Hollywell, when he saw a lady sitting on the
      stump of a tree, sketching, and found that fate had been so propitious as to send Laura
      thither alone. The rest had gone to gather mushrooms on a down, and had left her sketching the
      view of the spires of Broadstone, in the cleft between the high green hills. She was very glad
      to see him, and held up her purple and olive washes to be criticized; but he did not pay much
      attention to them. He was almost confused at the sudden manner in which the opportunity for
      speaking had presented itself.
'It is a long time since I have seen you,' said he, at last.
'An unheard-of time.'
'Still longer since we have had any conversation.'
'I was just thinking so. Not since that hot haymaking, when Guy came home. Indeed, we have
      had so much amusement lately that I have hardly had time for thought. Guy says we are all
      growing dissipated.'
'Ah! your German, and dancing, and music, do not agree with thought.'
'Poor music!' said Laura, smiling. 'But I am ready for a lecture; I have been feeling more
      like a butterfly than I like.'
'I know you think me unjust about music, and I freely confess that I cannot estimate the
      pleasure it affords, but I doubt whether it is a safe pleasure. It forms common ground for
      persons who would otherwise have little in common, and leads to intimacies which occasion
      results never looked for.'

'Yes,' said Laura, receiving it as a general maxim.
'Laura, you complain of feeling like a butterfly. Is not that a sign that you were made for
      better things?'
'But what can I do? I try to read early and at night, but I can't prevent the fun and
      gaiety, and indeed I don't think I would. It is innocent, and we never had such a pleasant
      summer. Charlie is so—so much more equable, and mamma is more easy about him, and I can't help
      thinking it does them all good, though I do feel idle.'
'It is innocent, it is right for a little while,' said Philip; 'but your dissatisfaction
      proves that you are superior to such things. Laura, what I fear is, that this summer holiday
      may entangle you, and so fix your fate as to render your life no holiday. O Laura! take care;
      know what you are doing!'
'What am I doing?' asked Laura, with an alarmed look of ingenuous surprise.
Never had it been so hard to maintain his composure as now, when her simplicity forced him
      to come to plainer terms. 'I must speak,' he continued, 'because no one else will. Have you
      reflected whither this may tend? This music, this versifying, this admitting a stranger so
      unreservedly into your pursuits?'
She understood now, and hung her head. He would have given worlds to judge of the face
      hidden by her bonnet, but as she did not reply, he spoke on, his agitation becoming so strong,
      that the struggle was perceptible in the forced calmness of his tone. 'I would not say a word
      if he were worthy, but Laura—Laura, I have seen Locksley Hall acted once; do not let me see it
      again in a way which—which would give me infinitely more pain.'
The faltering of his voice, so resolutely subdued, touched her extremely, and a thrill of
      exquisite pleasure glanced through her, on hearing confirmed what she had long felt, that she
      had taken Margaret's place— nay, as she now learnt, that she was even more precious to him.
      She only thought of reassuring him.

'No; you need never fear that . He has no such thought, I am sure.' She blushed
      deeply, but looked in his face. 'He treats us both alike; besides, he is so young.'
'The mischief is not done,' said Philip, trying to resume his usual tone; 'I only meant to
      speak in time. You might let your manner go too far, you might even allow your affections to
      be involved without knowing it, if you were not on your guard.'
'Never!' said Laura. 'Oh, no; I could never dream of that with Guy. I like Guy very
      much; I think better of him than you do; but oh, no; he could never be my first and best; I
      could never care for him in that way. How could you think so, Philip?'
'Laura, I cannot but look on you with what may seem over-solicitude. Since I lost Fanny, and
      worse than lost Margaret, you have been my home; my first, my most precious interest. O,
      Laura,' and he did not even attempt to conceal the trembling and tenderness of his voice,
      'could I bear to lose you, to see you thrown away or changed—you, dearest, best of all?'
Laura did not turn away her head this time, but raising her beautiful face, glowing with
      such a look as had never beamed there before, while tears rose to her eyes, she said, 'Don't
      speak of my changing towards you. I never could; for if there is anything to care for in me,
      it is you that have taught it to me.'
If ever face plainly told another that he was her first and best, Laura's did so now. Away
      went misgivings, and he looked at her in happiness too great for speech; at least, he could
      not speak till he had mastered his emotion, but his countenance was sufficient reply. Even
      then, in the midst of this flood of ecstasy, came the thought, 'What have I done?'
He had gone further than he had ever intended. It was a positive avowal of love; and what
      would ensue? Cessation of intercourse with her, endless vexations, the displeasure of her
      family, loss of influence, contempt, and from Mr. Edmonstone, for the pretensions
       of a penniless soldier. His joy was too great to be damped, but it was rendered
      cautious. 'Laura, my own! (what delight the words gave her,) you have made me very happy. We
      know each other now, and trust each other for ever.'
'O yes, yes; nothing can alter what has grown up with us.'
'It is for ever!' repeated Philip. 'But, Laura, let us be content with our own knowledge of
      what we are to each other. Do not let us call in others to see our happiness.'
Laura looked surprised, for she always considered any communication about his private
      feelings too sacred to be repeated, and wondered he should think the injunction necessary. 'I
      never can bear to talk about the best kinds of happiness,' said she; 'but oh!' and she sprang
      up, 'here they come.'
Poor Mrs. Edmonstone, as she walked back from her mushroom-field, she little guessed that
      words had been spoken which would give the colouring to her daughter's whole life—she little
      guessed that her much-loved and esteemed nephew had betrayed her confidence!
As she and the girls came up, Philip advanced to meet them, that Laura might have a few
      moments to recover, while with an effort he kept himself from appearing absent in the
      conversation that ensued. It was brief, for having answered some questions with regard to the
      doings on the important day, he said, that since he had met them he would not come on to
      Hollywell, and bade them farewell, giving Laura a pressure of the hand which renewed the glow
      on her face.
He walked back, trying to look through the dazzling haze of joy so as to see his situation
      clearly. It was impossible for him not to perceive that there had been an absolute declaration
      of affection, and that he had established a private understanding with his cousin. It was not,
      however, an engagement, nor did he at present desire to make it so. It was impossible for him
      as yet to marry, and he was content to wait without
       a promise, since that could not add to his entire reliance on Laura. He could
      not bear to be rejected by her parents; he knew his poverty would be the sole ground of
      objection, and he was not asking her to share it. He believed sincerely that a long lingering
      attachment to himself would be more for her good than a marriage with one who would have been
      a high prize for worldly aims, and was satisfied that by winning her heart he had taken the
      only sure means of securing her from becoming attached to Guy, while secrecy was the only way
      of preserving his intercourse with her on the same footing, and exerting his influence over
      the family.
It was calmly reflected, for Philip's love was tranquil, though deep and steady, and he
      rather sought to preserve Laura as she was than to make her anything more; and this very
      calmness contributed to his self-deception on this first occasion that he had ever actually
      swerved from the path of right.
With an uncomfortable sensation, he met Guy riding home from his tutor, entirely
      unsuspicious. He stopped and talked of the preparations at Broadstone, where he had been over
      the ground with Maurice de Courcy, and had heard the band.
'What did you think of it?' said Philip, absently.
'They should keep better time! Really, Philip, there is one fellow with a bugle
      that ought to be flogged every day of his life!' said Guy, making a droll, excruciated
      face.
How a few words can change the whole current of ideas! The band was connected with Philip,
      therefore he could not bear to hear it found fault with, and adduced some one's opinion that
      the man in question was one of the best of their musicians.
Guy could not help shrugging his shoulders, as he laughed, and said,—'Then I shall be
      obliged to take to my heels if I meet the rest. Good bye.'
'How conceited they have made that boy about his fine ear,' thought Philip. 'I wonder he is
      not ashamed to parade his music, considering whence it is derived.'
