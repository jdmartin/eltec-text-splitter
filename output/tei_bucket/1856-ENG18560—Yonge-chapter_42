CHAPTER XII.

The heart may ache, but may not burst;
Heaven will not leave thee, nor forsake.Christian Year.
Hector and Tom finished their holidays by a morning's shooting at the Grange, Dr.
      May promising to meet them, and let them drive him home.
Meta was out, when he arrived; and, repairing to the library, he found Mr. Rivers sitting by
      a fire, though it was early in September, with the newspaper before him, but not reading. He
      looked depressed, and seemed much disappointed a having heard that George and Flora had
      accepted some further invitations in Scotland, and did not intend to return for another month.
      Dr. May spoke cheerfully of the hospitality and kindness they had met, but failed to enliven
      him, and, as if trying to assign some cause for his vexation, he lamented over fogs and
      frosts, and began to dread an October in Scotland for Flora, almost as if it were the Arctic
      regions.
He grew somewhat more animated in praising Flora, and speaking of the great satisfaction he
      had in seeing his son married to so admirable a person. He only wished it would be the same
      with his daughter.
'You are a very unselfish father,' said Dr. May. 'I cannot imagine you without your little
      fairy.'
'It would be hard to part,' said Mr. Rivers, sighing; 'yet I should be relieved to see her
      in good hands, so pretty and engaging as she is, and something of an heiress. With our dear
      Flora, she is secure of a happy home when I am gone, but still I should be glad to have seen—'
      and he broke off thoughtfully.
'She is so sensible, that we shall see her make a good choice,' said Dr. May, smiling; 'that
      is, if she choose at all, for I do not know who is worthy of her.'
'I am quite indifferent as to fortune,' continued Mr. Rivers. 'She will have enough of her
      own.'
'Enough not to be dependant, which is the point,' said Dr. May, 'though I should have few
      fears for her any way.'
'It would be a comfort,' harped on Mr. Rivers, dwelling on the
       subject, as if he wanted to say something, 'if she were only safe with a man who
      knew how to value her, and make her happy. Such a young man as your Norman, now—I have often
      thought—'
Dr. May would not seem to hear, but he could not prevent himself from blushing as crimson as
      if he had been the very Norman, as he answered, going on with his own speech, as if Mr.
      Rivers's had been unmade; 'She is the brightest little creature under the sun, and the sparkle
      is down so deep within, that however it may turn out, I should never fear for her
      happiness.'
'Flora is my great reliance,' proceeded Mr. Rivers. 'Her aunt, Lady Leonora, is very kind,
      but somehow she does not seem to suit with Meta.'
O ho, thought the Doctor, have you made that discovery, my good friend?
The voices of the two boys were heard in the hall, explaining their achievements to Meta,
      and Dr. May took his departure, Hector driving him, and embarking in a long discourse on his
      own affairs, as if he had quite forgotten that the Doctor was not his father, and going on
      emphatically, in spite of the absence of mind now and then betrayed by his auditor, who, at
      Dr. Spencer's door, exclaimed, 'Stop, Hector, let me out here—thank you;' and presently
      brought out his friend into the garden, and sat down on the grass, talking low, and earnestly,
      over the disease with which Mr. Rivers had been so long affected; for though Dr. May could not
      perceive any positively unfavourable system, he had been rendered vaguely uneasy by the
      unusual heaviness and depression of manner. So long did they sit conversing, that Blanche was
      sent out, primed with an impertinent message, that two such old Doctors ought to be ashamed of
      themselves for sitting so late in the dew.
Dr. Spencer was dragged in to drink tea, and the meal had just been merrily concluded, when
      the door-bell rang, and a message was brought in. 'The carriage from the Grange, sir—Miss
      Rivers would be much obliged if you would come directly.'
'There!' said Dr. May, looking at Dr. Spencer, as if to say I told you so; in the first
      triumph of professional sagacity; but the next moment exclaiming, 'Poor little Meta!' he
      hurried away.
A gloom fell on those who remained, for, besides their sympathy for Meta, and their liking
      for her kind old father, there was that one unacknowledged heartache, which, though in general
      bravely combated, lay in wait always ready to prey on them. Hector stole round to sit by
      Margaret, and Dr. Spencer muttered, "this will never do," and sent Tom to fetch some papers
      lying on his table, whence he read them some curious accounts that he had just received from
      his Missionary friends in India.

They were interested, but in a listening mood, that caused a universal start when the bell
      again sounded. This time, James reported that the servant from the Grange said his master was
      very ill—he had brought a letter to post for Mr. George Rivers, and here was a note for Miss
      Ethel. It was the only note Ethel had ever received from her father, and only contained these
      few words:—
Dear E.
I believe this attack will be the last. Come to Meta, and bring my things.
R. M.
Ethel put her hands to her forehead. It was as if she had been again plunged into the
      stunned dream of misery of four years ago, and her sensation was of equal bewilderment and
      uselessness, but it was but for a moment—the next she was in a state of over bustle and
      eagerness. She wanted to fly about and hasten to help Meta, and could hardly obey the word and
      gesture by which Margaret summoned her to her side.
'Dear Ethel, you must calm yourself, or you will not be of use.'
'I? I can't be of any use! Oh! if you could go! If Flora were but here! But I must go,
      Margaret.'
'I will put up your father's things,' said Dr. Spencer, in a soothing tone. 'The carriage
      cannot be ready in a moment, so that there will be full time.'
Mary and Miss Bracy prepared Ethel's own goods, which she would otherwise have forgotten;
      and Margaret, meanwhile, detained her by her side, trying to calm and encourage her with
      gentle words of council, that might hinder her from giving way to the flurry of emotion that
      had seized her, and prevent her from thinking herself certain to be useless.
Adams was to drive her thither in the gig, and it presently came to the door. Dr. Spencer
      wrapped her up well in cloaks and shawls, and spoke words of kindly cheer in her ear as she
      set off. The fresh night air blew pleasantly on her, the stars glimmered in full glory over
      head, and now and then her eye was caught by the rocket-like track of a shooting-star. Orion
      was rising slowly far in the east, and bringing to her mind the sailor-boy under the southern
      sky; if, indeed, he were not where sun and stars no more are the light. It was strange that
      the thought came more as soothing than as acute pain; she could bear to think of him thus in
      her present frame, as long as she had not to talk of him. Under those solemn stars, the Life
      Everlasting seemed to overpower the sense of this mortal life, and Ethel's agitation was
      calmed away.
The old cedar-tree stood up in stately blackness against the sky, and the lights in the
      house glanced behind it. The servants looked rather surprised to see Ethel, as if she were not
      expected, and conducted
       her to the great drawing-room, which looked the more desolate and solitary, from
      the glare of lamplight, falling on the empty seats which Ethel had lately seen filled with a
      glad, home party. She was looking round, thinking whether to venture up to Meta's room, and
      there summon Bellairs, when Meta came gliding in, and threw her arms round her. Ethel could
      not speak, but Meta's voice was more cheerful than she had expected. 'How kind of you, dear
      Ethel!'
'Papa sent for me,' said Ethel.
'He is so kind! Can Margaret spare you?'
'Oh, yes! but you must leave me. You must want to be with him.'
'He never lets me come in when he has these attacks,' said Meta. 'If he only would! But will
      you come up to my room. That is nearer.'
'Is papa with him?'
'Yes.'
Meta wound her arms round Ethel, and led her up to her sitting-room, where a book lay on the
      table. She said that her father had seemed weary and torpid, and had sat still until almost
      their late dinner hour, when he seemed to bethink himself of dressing, and had risen. She
      thought he walked weakly, and rather tottering, and had run to make him lean on her, which he
      did, as far as his own room door. There he had kissed her, and thanked her, and murmured a
      word like blessing. She had not, however, been alarmed, until his servant had come to tell her
      that he had another seizure.
Ethel asked whether she had seen Dr. May since he had been with her father. She had; but
      Ethel was surprised to find that she had not taken in the extent of his fears. She had become
      so far accustomed to these attacks, that, though anxious and distressed, she did not apprehend
      more than a few days' weakness, and her chief longing was to be of use. She was speaking
      cheerfully of beginning her nursing to-morrow, and of her great desire that her papa would
      allow her to sit up with him, when there was a slow, reluctant movement of the lock of the
      door, and the two girls sprang to their feet, as Dr. May opened it; and Ethel read his
      countenance at once.
Not so Meta. 'How is he? May I go to him?' cried she.
'Not now, my dear,' said Dr. May, putting his hand on her shoulder, in a gentle, detaining
      manner, that sent a thrill of trembling through her frame, though she did not otherwise move.
      She only clasped her hands together, and looked up into his face. He answered the look. 'Yes,
      my dear, the struggle is over.'

Ethel came near, and put her arm round Meta's waist, as if to strengthen her, as she stood
      quite passive, and still.
Dr. May seemed to think it best that all should be told; but, though intently watching Meta,
      he directed his words to his own daughter. 'Thank Heaven, it has been shorter, and less
      painful, than I had dared to hope.'
Meta tried to speak, but could not bring out the words, and, with an imploring look at
      Ethel, as if to beg her to make them clear for her, she inarticulately murmured, 'Oh! why did
      not you call me!'
'I could not. He would not let me. His last conscious word to me was not to let you see him
      suffer.'
Meta wrung her clasped hands together in mute anguish. Dr. May signed to Ethel to guide her
      back to the sofa, but the movement seemed so far to rouse her, that she said, 'I should like
      to go to bed.'
'Right—the best thing,' said Dr. May; and he whispered to Ethel, 'go with her, but don't try
      to rouse her—don't talk to her. Come back to me, presently.'
He did not even shake hands with Meta, nor wish her good-night, as she disappeared into her
      own room.
Bellairs undressed her, and Ethel stood watching, till the young head, under the load of
      sorrow, so new to it, was laid on the pillow. Bellairs asked her if she would have a
      light.
'No, no, thank you—the dark and alone. Good-night,' said Meta.
Ethel went back to the sitting-room, where her father was standing at the window, looking
      out into the night. He turned as she came in, folded her in his arms, and kissed her forehead.
      'And how is the poor little dear?' he asked.
'The same,' said Ethel. 'I can't bear to leave her alone, and to have said nothing to
      comfort her.'
'It is too soon as yet,' said Dr. May—'her mind has not taken it in. I hope she will sleep
      all night, and have more strength to look at it when she wakens.'
'She was utterly unprepared.'
'I could not make her understand me,' said Dr. May.
'And, oh, papa, what a pity she was not there!'
'It was no sight for her, till the last few minutes; and his whole mind seemed bent on
      sparing her. What tenderness it has been.'
'Must we leave her to herself all night?'
'Better so,' said Dr. May. 'She has been used to loneliness; and to thrust companionship on
      her would be only harassing.'
Ethel, who scarcely knew what it was to be alone, looked as if she did not understand.

'I used to try to force consolation on people,' said Dr. May, 'but I know, now, that it can
      only be done by following their bent.'
'You have seen so many sorrows,' said Ethel.
'I never understood till I felt,' said Dr. May. 'Those few first days were a lesson.'
'I did not think you knew what was passing,' said Ethel.
'I doubt whether any part of my life is more distinctly before me than those two days,' said
      Dr. May. 'Flora coming in and out, and poor Alan sitting by me; but I don't believe I had any
      will. I could no more have moved my mind than my broken arm; and I verily think, Ethel, that,
      but for that merciful torpor, I should have been frantic. It taught me never to disturb
      grief.'
'And what shall we do?'
'You must stay with her till Flora comes. I will be here as much as I can. She is our
      charge, till they come home. I told him, between the spasms, that I had sent for you, and he
      seemed pleased.'
'If only I were anybody else!'
Dr. May again threw his arm round her, and looked into her face. He felt that he had rather
      have her, such as she was, than anybody else; and, together, they sat down, and talked of what
      was to be done, and what was best for Meta, and of the solemnity of being in the house of
      death. Ethel felt and shewed it so much, in her subdued, awe-struck manner, that her father
      felt checked whenever he was about to return to his ordinary manner, familiarized, as he
      necessarily was, with the like scenes. It drew him back to the thought of their own trouble,
      and their conversation recurred to those days, so that each gained a more full understanding
      of the other, and they at length separated, certainly with the more peaceful and soft feelings
      for being in the abode of mourning.
Bellairs promised to call Ethel, to be with her young lady as early as might be, reporting
      that she was sound asleep. And sleep continued to shield her till past her usual hour, so that
      Ethel was up, and had been with Dr. May, before she was summoned to her, and then she found
      her half-dressed, and hastening that she might not make Dr. May late for breakfast, and in
      going to his patients. There was an elasticity in the happily constituted young mind that
      could not be entirely struck down, nor deprived of power of taking thought for others. Yet her
      eyes looked wandering, and unlike themselves, and her words, now and then, faltered, as if she
      was not sure what she was doing or saying. Ethel told her not to mind— Dr. Spencer would take
      care of the patients; but she did not seem to recollect, at first, who Dr, Spencer was, nor to
      care for being reminded.

Breakfast was laid out in in the little sitting-room. Ethel wanted to take the trouble off
      her hands, but she would not let her. She sat behind her urn, and asked about tea or coffee,
      quite accurately, in a low, subdued voice, that nearly overcame Dr. May. When the meal was
      over, and she had rung the bell, and risen up, as if to her daily work, she turned round, with
      that piteous, perplexed air, and stood for a moment, as if confused.
'Cannot we help you?' said Ethel.
'I don't know. Thank you. But, Dr. May, I must not keep you from other people—'
'I have no one to go to this morning,' said Dr. May. 'I am ready to stay with you, my
      dear.'
Meta came closer to him, and murmured, 'Thank you!'
The breakfast things had, by this time, been taken away, and Meta, looking to see that the
      door had shut for the last time, said, in a low voice, 'Now tell me—'
Dr. May drew her down, to sit on the sofa beside him, and, in his soft, sweet voice, told
      her all that she wished to learn of her father's last hours, and was glad to see showers of
      quiet, wholesome tears drop freely down, but without violence, and she scarcely attempted to
      speak. There was a pause at the end, and then she said, gently, 'Thank you, for it all. Dear
      papa!' And she rose up, and went back to her room.
'She has learnt to dwell apart,' said Dr. May, much moved.
'How beautifully she bears up!' said Ethel.
'It has been a life which, as she has used it, has taught her strength and self-dependance
      in the midst of prosperity.'
'Yes,' said Ethel, 'she has trained herself by her dread of self-indulgence, and seeking
      after work. But oh! what a break up it is for her! I cannot think how she holds up. Shall I go
      to her?'
'I think not. She knows the way to the only Comforter. I am not afraid of her after those
      blessed tears.'
Dr. May was right; Meta presently returned to them, in the same gentle subdued sadness,
      enfolding her, indeed, as a flower weighed down by mist, but not crushing nor taking away her
      powers. It was as if she were truly upheld; and thankful to her friends as she was, she did
      not throw herself on them in utter dependance or self-abandonment.
She wrote needful letters, shedding many tears over them, and often obliged to leave off to
      give the blinding weeping its course, but refusing to impose any unnecessary task upon Dr.
      May's lame arm. All that was right, she strove to do; she saw Mr. Charles Wilmot, and was
      refreshed by his reading to her, and when Dr. May desired it, she submissively put on her
      bonnet, and took several
       turns with Ethel in the shrubbery, though it made her cry heartily to look into
      the down-stairs rooms. And she lay on the sofa at last, owning herself strangely tired, she
      did not know why, and glad that Ethel should read to her. By-and-by, she went to dress for the
      evening, and came back, full of the tidings that one of the children in the village had been
      badly burnt. It occupied her very much— she made Ethel promise to go and see about her
      to-morrow, and sent Bellairs at once with every comfort that she could devise.
On the whole, those two days were to Ethel a peaceful and comfortable time. She saw more
      than usual of her father, and had such conversations with him as were seldom practicable at
      home, and that chimed in with the unavowed care which hung on their minds; while Meta was a
      most sweet and loving charge, without being a burthen, and often saying such beautiful things
      in her affectionate resignation, that Ethel could only admire and lay them up in her mind. Dr.
      May went backwards and forwards, and brought good accounts of Margaret and fond messages; he
      slept at the Grange each night, and Meta used to sit in her corner of the sofa and work, or
      not, as best suited her, while she listened to his talk with Ethel, and now and then herself
      joined.
George Rivers' absence was a serious inconvenience in all arrangements; but his sister
      dreaded his grief as much as she wished for his return; and often were the posts and the
      journeys reckoned over, without a satisfactory conclusion, as to when he could arrive from so
      remote a part of Scotland.
At last, as the two girls had finished their early dinner, the butler brought in word that
      Mr. Norman May was there. Meta at once begged that he would come in, and Ethel went into the
      hall to meet him. He looked very man, with the dark rings round his eyes, a deeper purple than
      ever, and he could hardly find utterance to ask 'how is she?'
'As good and sweet as she can be,' said Ethel, warmly; but no more, for Meta herself had
      come to the dining room door, and was holding out her hand. Norman took it in both his, but
      could not speak; Meta's own soft voice was the first. 'I thought you would come—he was so fond
      of you.'
Poor Norman quite gave way, and Meta was the one to speak gentle words of soothing. 'There
      is so much to be thankful for,' she said. 'He has been spared so much of the suffering Dr. May
      feared for him; and he was so happy about George.'
Norman made a great effort to recover himself. Ethel asked for Flora and George. It appeared
      that they had been on an excursion when the first letter arrived at Glenbracken, and thus had
      received both together in the evening, on their return. George had been
       greatly overcome, and they had wished to set off instantly; but Lady Glenbracken
      would not hear of Flora's travelling night and day, and it had at length been arranged that
      Norman Ogilvie should drive Norman across the country that evening, to catch the mail for
      Edinburgh, and he had been on the road ever since. George was following with his wife more
      slowly, and would be at home to-morrow evening. Meantime, he sent full authority to his
      father-in-law to make arrangements.
Ethel went to see the burnt child, leaving Meta to take her walk in the garden under
      Norman's charge. He waited on her with a sort of distant reverence for a form of grief, so
      unlike what he had dreaded for her, when the first shock of the tidings had brought back to
      him the shattered bewildered feelings to which he dared not recur.
To dwell on the details, was, to her, a comfort, knowing his sympathy and the affection
      there had been between him and her father; nor had they parted in such absolute brightness, as
      to make them unprepared for such a meeting as the present. The cloud of suspense was brooding
      lower and lower over the May family, and the need of faith and submission was as great with
      them as with the young orphan herself. Norman said little, but that little was so deep and
      fervent, that after a time, Meta could not help saying, when Ethel was seen in the distance,
      and their talk was nearly over— 'Oh! Norman, these things are no mirage.'
'It is the world that is the mirage,' he answered.
Ethel came up, and Dr. May also, in good time for the post. He was obliged to become very
      busy, using Norman for his secretary, till he saw his son's eyes so heavy, that he remembered
      the two nights that he had been up, and ordered him to go home, and go to bed as soon as tea
      was over.
'May I come back to-morrow?'
'Why—yes—I think you may. No, no,' he added, recollecting himself, 'I think you had better
      not,' and he did not relent, though Norman looked disappointed.
Meta had already expressed her belief that her father would be buried at the suburban
      Church, where lay her mother; and Dr. May, having been desired to seek out the will and open
      it, found it was so; and fixed the day and hour with Meta, who was as submissive and
      reasonable as possible, though much grieved that he thought she could not be present.
Ethel, after going with Meta to her room at night, returned as usual to talk matters over
      with him, and again say how good Meta was.'
'And I think Norman's coming did her a great deal of good,' said Ethel.

'Ha! yes,' said the Doctor, thoughtfully.
'She thinks so much of Mr. Rivers having been fond of him.'
'Yes,' said the Doctor, 'he was. I find, in glancing over the will, which was newly made on
      Flora's marriage, that he has remembered Norman—left him £100 and his portfolio of prints from
      Raffaelle.'
'Has he, indeed? how very kind—how much Norman will value it.'
'It is remarkable,' said Dr. May, and then, as if he could not help it, told Ethel what Mr.
      Rivers had said of his wishes with regard to his daughter. Ethel blushed and smiled, and
      looked so much touched and delighted, that he grew alarmed and said, 'You know, Ethel, this
      must be as if it never had been mentioned.'
'What! you will not tell Norman?'
'No, certainly not, unless I see strong cause. They are very fond of each other, certainly,
      but they dont know, and I dont know, whether it is not like brother and sister. I would not
      have either of them guess at this, or feel bound in any way. Why, Ethel! she has thirty
      thousand pounds, and I dont know how much more.'
'Thirty thousand!' said Ethel, her tone, one of astonishment, while his had been almost of
      objection.
'It would open a great prospect,' continued Dr. May, complacently, 'with Norman's talents,
      and such a lift as that, he might be one of the first men in England, provided he had nerve
      and hardness enough, which I doubt.'
'He would not care for it,' said Ethel.
"No; but the field of usefulness—but what an old fool I am, after all my resolutions not to
      be ambitious for that boy; to be set a going by such a thing as this! Still Norman is
      something out of the common way. I wonder what Spencer thinks of him."
'And you never mean them to hear of it?'
'If they settle it for themselves,' said Dr. May, 'that sanction will come in to give double
      value to mine—or if I should see poor Norman hesitating as to the inequality, I might smooth
      the way; but you see, Ethel, this puts us in a most delicate situation towards this pretty
      little creature. What her father wanted, was only to guard her from fortune-hunters, and if
      she should marry suitably elsewhere,—why—we will be contented.'
'I dont think I should be,' said Ethel.
'She is the most winning of humming birds, and what we see of her now, gives one double
      confidence in her. She is so far from the petted helpless girl, that he, poor man, would fain
      have made her! And she has a bright, brave, temper and elastic spirits that would be the very
      thing for him, poor boy, with that morbid sensitiveness—he would not hurt her, and she would
      brighten him.
       It would be a very pretty thing—but we must never think about it again.'
'If we can help it,' said Ethel.
'Ah! I am sorry I have put it into your head too. We shall not so easily be unconscious now,
      when they talk about each other in the innocent way they do. We have had a lesson against
      being pleased at match-making! But, turning away from the subject, 'You shall not lose your
      Cocksmoor income, Ethel—'
'I had never thought of that. You had taken no fees here since we have been all one
      family.'
'Well, he has been good enough to leave me £500, and Cocksmoor can have the interest, if you
      like.'
'Oh thank you, papa.'
'It is only its due, for I suppose that is for attendance. Personally, to myself, he has
      left that beautiful Claude which he knew I admired so much. He has been very kind! But after
      all, we ought not to be talking of all this—I should not have known it, if I had not been
      forced to read the will. Well, so we are in Flora's house, Ethel! I wonder how poor dear
      little Meta will feel the being a guest here, instead of the mistress. I wish that boy were
      three or four years older! I should like to take her straight home with us—I should like to
      have her for a daughter. I shall always look on her as one.'
'As a Daisy!' said Ethel.
'Don't talk of it!' said Dr. May, hastily; 'this is no time for such things. After all, I am
      glad that the funeral is not here— Flora and Meta might be rather overwhelmed with these three
      incongruous sets of relations. By their letters, those Riverses must be quite as queer a lot
      as George's relations. After all, if we have nothing else, Ethel, we have the best of it, in
      regard to such relations as we have.'
'There is Lord Cosham,' said Ethel.
'Yes, he is Meta's guardian, as well as her brother; but he could not have her to live with
      him. She must depend upon Flora. But we shall see—'
Ethel felt confident that Flora would be very kind to her little sister-in-law, and yet one
      of those gleams of doubt crossed her, whether Flora would not be somewhat jealous of her own
      authority.
Late the next evening, the carriage drove to the door, and George and Flora appeared in the
      hall. Their sisters went out to meet them, and George folded Meta in his arms, and kissing her
      again and again, called her his poor dear little sister, and wept bitterly, and even
      violently. Flora stood beside Ethel, and said, in a low voice, that poor George felt it
      dreadfully, and then came forward, touched him
       gently, and told him that he must not overset Meta; and, drawing her from him,
      kissed her, and said what a grievous time this had been for her, and how sorry they had been
      to leave her so long, but they knew she was in the best hands.
'Yes, I should have been so sorry you had been over-tired. I was quite well off,' said
      Meta.
'And you must look on us as your home,' added Flora.
How can she? thought Ethel. This is taking possession, and making Meta a guest already!
However, Meta did not seem so to feel it—she replied by caresses, and turned again to her
      brother. Poor George was by far the most struck down of all the mourners, and his whole
      demeanour gave his new relations a much warmer feeling towards him than they could ever have
      hoped to entertain. His gentle refined father had softly impressed his duller nature; and his
      want of attention, and many extravagances came back upon him acutely now, in his changed home.
      He could hardly bear to look at his little orphan sister, and lavished every mark of fondness
      upon her; nor could he endure to sit at the bottom of his table; but when they had gone into
      dinner, he turned away from the chair and hid his face. He was almost like a child in his want
      of self-restraint; and with all Dr. May's kind soothing manner, he could not bring him to
      attend to any of the necessary questions as to arrangements, and was obliged to refer to
      Flora, whose composed good sense was never at fault.
Ethel was surprised to find that it would be a great distress to Meta to part with her until
      the funeral was over, though she would hardly express a wish, lest Ethel should be needed at
      home. As soon as Flora perceived this, she begged her sister to stay, and again Ethel felt
      unpleasantly that Meta might have seen, if she had chosen, that Flora took the invitation upon
      herself.
So, while Dr. May, with George, Norman and Tom went to London, she remained, though not
      exactly knowing what good she was doing, unless by making the numbers rather less scanty; but
      both sisters declared her to be the greatest comfort possible; and when Meta shut herself up
      in her own room, where she had long learnt to seek strength in still communing with her own
      heart, Flora seemed to find it a relief to call her sister to hers, and talk over ordinary
      subjects, in a tone that struck on Ethel's ear as a little incongruous— but then Flora had not
      been here from the first, and the impression could not be as strong. She was very kind, and
      her manner, when with others, was perfect, from its complete absence of affectation; but,
      alone with Ethel, there was a little complacency sometimes betrayed, and some curiosity
      whether her father had read the will. Ethel allowed what she had heard of the contents to be
      extracted
       from her, and it certainly did not diminish Flora's secret satisfaction in being
      "somebody."
She told the whole history of her visits; first, how cordial Lady Leonora Langdale had been,
      and then, how happy she had been at Glenbracken. The old Lord and Lady, and Marjorie, all
      equally charming in their various ways; and Norman Ogilvie so good a son, and so highly
      thought of in his own country.
'Did I tell you, Ethel, that he desired to be remembered to you?'
'Yes, you said so.'
'What has Coralie done with it?' continued Flora, seeking in her dressing-case. 'She must
      have put it away with my brooches. Oh, no, here it is. I had been looking for Cairn-gorm
      specimens in a shop, saying I wanted a brooch that you would wear, when Norman
      Ogilvie came riding after the carriage, looking quite hot and eager? He had been to some other
      place, and hunted this one up. Is it not a beauty?'
It was one of the round Bruce brooches, of dark pebble, with a silver fern-leaf lying across
      it, the dots of small Cairn-gorm stones. 'The Glenbracken badge, you know,' continued
      Flora.
Ethel twisted it about in her fingers, and said, 'Was not it meant for you?'
'It was to oblige me, if you choose so to regard it,' said Flora, smiling. 'He gave me no
      injunctions; but, you see, you must wear it now. I shall not wear coloured brooches for a
      year.'
Ethel sighed. She felt as if her black dress ought, perhaps, to be worn for a nearer cause.
      She had a great desire to keep that Glenbracken brooch; and surely it could not be wrong. To
      refuse it would be much worse, and would only lead to Flora's keeping it, and not caring for
      it.
'Then it is your present, Flora?'
'If you like better to call it so, my dear. I find Norman Ogilvie is going abroad in a few
      months. I think we ought to ask him here on his way.'
'Flora! I wish you would not talk about such things!'
'Do you really and truly, Ethel?'
'Certainly not, at such a time as this,' said Ethel.
Flora was checked a little, and sat down to write to Marjorie Ogilvie. 'Shall I say you like
      the brooch, Ethel?' she asked, presently.
'Say what is proper,' said Ethel, impatiently. 'You know what I mean, in the fullest sense
      of the word.'
'Do I?' said Flora.
'I mean,' said Ethel, 'that you may say, simply and rationally,
       that I like the thing, but I won't have it said as a message, or that I
      take it as his present.'
'Very well,' said Flora, 'the whole affair is simple enough, if you would not be so
      conscious, my dear.'
'Flora! I can't stand your calling me my dear!'
'I am very much obliged to you,' said Flora, laughing, more than she would have liked to be
      seen, but recalled by her sister's look. Ethel was sorry at once. 'Flora, I beg your pardon, I
      did not mean to be cross, only please don't begin about that—Indeed, I think you had better
      leave out about the brooch altogether. No one will wonder at your passing it over in such a
      return as this.'
'You are right,' said Flora, thoughtfully.
Ethel carried the brooch to her own room, and tried to keep herself from speculating what
      had been Mr. Ogilvie's views in procuring it, and whether he remembered showing her, at
      Woodstock, which sort of fern was his badge, and how she had abstained from preserving the
      piece shut up in her guide-book.
Meta's patient sorrow was the best remedy for proneness to such musings. How happy poor
      little Meta had been! The three sisters sat together that long day, and Ethel read to the
      others, and by-and-by went to walk in the garden with them, till, as Flora was going in, Meta
      asked, 'Do you think it would be wrong for me to cross the park to see that little burnt girl,
      as Mr. Wilmot is away to-day, and she has no one to go to her.'
Flora could see no reason against it, and Meta and Ethel left the garden, and traversed the
      green park, in its quiet home beauty, not talking much, except that Meta said, 'Well! I think
      there is quite as much sweetness, as sadness, in this evening.'
'Because of this calm autumn sunset beauty?' said Ethel. 'Look at the golden light coming in
      under the branches of the trees.'
'Yes,' said Meta, 'one cannot help thinking how much more beautiful it must be—'
The two girls said no more, and came to the cottage, where so much gratitude was expressed
      at seeing Miss Rivers, that it was almost too much for her. She left Ethel to talk, and only
      said a few soft little words to her sick scholar, who seemed to want her voice and smile to
      convince her that the small mournful face under all that black crape, belonged to her own dear
      bright teacher.
'It is odd,' said Meta, as they went back; 'it is seeing other people that makes one know it
      is all sad and altered—it seems so bewildering, though they are so kind.'
'I know what you mean,' said Ethel.
'One ought not to wish it to go on, because there are other people and other duties,' said
      Meta, 'but quietness is so peaceful.
       Do you know, Ethel, I shall always think of those two first days, before anybody
      came, with you and Dr. May, as something very— very—precious,' she said, at last, with the
      tears rising.
'I am sure I shall,' said Ethel.
'I don't know how it is, but there is something even in this affliction that makes it like—a
      strange sort of happiness,' said Meta, musingly.
'I know what it is!' said Ethel.
'That He is so very good?' said Meta, reverently.
'Yes,' said Ethel, almost rebuked for the first thought, namely, that it was because Meta
      was so very good.
'It does make one feel more confidence,' said Meta.
'"It is good for me to have been in trouble,"' repeated Ethel.
'Yes,' said Meta. 'I hope it is not wrong or unkind in me to feel it, for I think dear papa
      would wish it; but I do not feel as if —miss him always as I shall—the spring of life were
      gone from me. I don't think it can, for I know no more pain or trouble can reach him, and
      there is—don't you think, Ethel, that I may think so? —especial care for the orphan, like a
      compensation. And there is hope, and work here. And I am very thankful! How much worse it
      would have been, if George had not been married! Dear Flora! Will you tell her, Ethel, how
      really I do wish her to take the command of me. Tell her it will be the greatest kindness in
      the world to make me useful to her.'
'I will,' said Ethel.
'And please tell her that I am afraid I may forget, and take upon me, as if I were still
      lady of the house. Tell her I do not mean it, and I hope that she will check it.'
'I think there is no fear of her forgetting that,' said Ethel, regretting the words before
      they were out of her mouth.
'I hope I shall not,' said Meta. 'If I do, I shall drive myself away to stay with Aunt
      Leonora, and I don't want to do that at all. So please to make Flora understand that she is
      head, and I am ready to be hand and foot;' and Meta's bright smile shone out, with the
      pleasure of a fresh and loving service.
Ethel understood the force of her father's words, that it was a brave, vigorous spirit.
Dr. May came back with George, and staid to dinner, after which he talked over business with
      Flora, whose sagacity continually amazed him, and who undertook to make her husband
      understand, and do what was needed.
Meta meanwhile cross-questioned her brother on the pretty village, by the Thames, of which
      she had a fond, childish remembrance, and heard from him of the numerous kind messages from
       all her relations. There were various invitations, but George repeated them
      unwillingly.
'You won't go, Meta,' he said. 'It would be a horrid nuisance to part with you.'
'As long as you think so, dear George.—When I am in your way, or Flora's—'
'That will never be! I say, Flora, will she ever be in our way?'
'No, indeed! Meta and I understand that,' said Flora, looking up. 'Well, I suppose Bruce
      can't be trusted to value the books and prints—'
Dr. May thought it a great relief that Meta had a home with Flora, for, as he said to Ethel,
      as they went home together, 'Certainly, except Lord Cosham, I never saw such an unpresentable
      crew as their relations. You should have heard the boys afterwards! There was Master Tom
      turning up his Eton nose at them, and pronouncing that there never were such a set of snobs,
      and Norman taking him to task as I never heard him do before—telling him that he would never
      have urged his going to Eton, if he had thought it would make him despise respectable folks,
      probably, better than himself, and that this was the last time in the world for such
      observations—whereat poor Tommy was quite annihilated; for a word from Norman goes further
      with him, than a lecture from any one else.'
'Well, I think Norman was right as to the unfitness of the time.'
'So he was. But we had a good deal of them, waiting in the inn parlour. People make
      incongruities when they will have such things done in state. It could not be helped here, to
      be sure; but I always feel, at a grand undertaker's display like this, that, except the
      service itself, there is little to give peace or soothing. I hate what makes a talk! Better be
      little folk.'
'One would rather think of our own dear cloister, and those who cared so much,' said
      Ethel.
'Ah! you were happy to be there!' said Dr. May. 'But it all comes to the same.—' Pausing, he
      looked from the window— then signed to Ethel, to do the same—Orion glittered in the
      darkness.
'One may sleep sound without the lullaby,' said Dr. May, 'and the waves.—'
'Oh! don't papa. You don't give up hope!'
'I believe we ought, Ethel. Don't tell her, but I went to the Admiralty to-day.'
'And what did you hear there?'
'Great cause for fear—but they do not give up. My poor Margaret! But those stars tells us
      they are in the same Hand.'
