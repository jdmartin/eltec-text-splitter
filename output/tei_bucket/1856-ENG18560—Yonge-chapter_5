CHAPTER V.

'Through lawless camp, through ocean wild,
   Her prophet eye pursues her child;
Scans mournfully her poet's strain,
   Fears for her merchant, loss alike and gain.'Lyra Innocentium.
Dr. May took the management of himself into his own hands, and paid so little
      attention to Mr. Ward's recommendations, that his sons and daughters were in continual dread
      of his choosing to do something that might cause injurious agitation.
However, he did not attempt to go farther than Margaret's bedside, where he sat hour after
      hour, his eyes fixed upon her, as she continued in a state bordering on insensibility. He took
      little notice of anything else, and hardly spoke. There were heavy sighs now and then, but
      Richard and Flora, one or other of whom were
       always watching him, could hardly tell whether to ascribe them to the oppression
      of sorrow, or of suffering. Their great fear was of his insisting on seeing his wife's face,
      and it was a great relief that he never alluded to her, except once, to desire Richard to
      bring him her ring. Richard silently obeyed, and, without a word, he placed it on his little
      finger. Richard used to read the Psalms to him in the morning, before he was up, and Flora
      would bring little Daisy and lay her by his side.
To the last moment, they dreaded his choosing to attend the funeral, and Flora had decided
      on remaining at home, though trembling at the thought of what there might be to go through.
      They tried to let him hear nothing about it, but he seemed to know every thing; and when Flora
      came into Margaret's room, without her bonnet, he raised his head, and said, 'I thought you
      were all going.'
'The others are—but may I not stay with you and her, papa?'
'I had rather be alone, my dear. I will take care of her. I should wish you all to be
      there.'
They decided that his wishes ought to be followed, and that the patients must be entrusted
      to old nurse. Richard told Flora, who looked very pale, that she would be glad of it
      afterwards, and she had his arm to lean upon.
The grave was in the cloister attached to the Minster, a smooth green square of turf, marked
      here and there with small flat lozenges of stone, bearing the date and initials of those who
      lay there, and many of them recording former generations of Mays, to whom their descent from
      the head-master had given a right of burial there. Dr. Hoxton, Mr. Wilmot, and the surgeon,
      were the only friends whom Richard had asked to be with them, but the Minster was nearly full,
      for there was a very strong attachment and respect for Dr. and Mrs. May throughout the
      neighbourhood, and every one's feelings were strongly excited.
'In the midst of life, we are in death—' There was a universal sound, as of a sort of sob,
      that Etheldred never disconnected from those words. Yet hardly one tear was shed by the young
      things who stood as close as they could round the grave. Harry and Mary did indeed lock their
      hands together tightly, and the shoulders of the former shook as he stood, bowing down his
      head, but the others were still and quiet, in part from awe and bewilderment, but partly, too,
      from a sense that it was against her whole nature that there should be clamorous mourning for
      her. The calm still day seemed to tell them the same, the sun beaming softly on the grey
      arches and fresh grass, the sky clear and blue, and the trees that shewed over the walls
      bright with autumn colouring, all suitable to the serenity of a life unclouded to its last
      moment. Some of them felt
       as if it were better to be there, than in their saddened desolate home.
But home they must go, and, before going up-stairs, as Flora and Etheldred stood a moment or
      two with Norman, Ethel said in a tone of resolution, and of some cheerfulness, 'Well, we have
      to begin afresh.'
'Yes,' said Flora, 'it is a great responsibility. I do trust we may be enabled to do as we
      ought.'
'And now Margaret is getting better, she will be our stay,' said Ethel.
'I must go to her,' and Flora went up-stairs.
'I wish I could be as useful as Flora,' said Ethel, 'but I mean to try, and if I can but
      keep out of mischief, it will be something.'
'There is an object for all one does, in trying to be a comfort to papa.'
'That's no use,' said Norman, listlessly. 'We never can.'
'O but, Norman, he won't be always as he is now—I am sure he cares for us enough to be
      pleased, if we do right and get on.'
'We used to be so happy!' said Norman.
Ethel hesitated a little, and presently answered, 'I don't think it can be right to lament
      for our own sakes so much, is it?'
'I don't want to do so,' said Norman, in the same dejected way.
'I suppose we ought not to feel it either.' Norman only shook his head. 'We ought to think
      of her gain. You can't? Well, I am glad, for no more can I. I can't think of her liking for
      papa and baby and all of us to be left to ourselves. But that's not right of me, and of course
      it all comes right where she is; so I always put that out of my head, and think what is to
      come next in doing, and pleasing papa, and learning.'
'That's grown horrid,' said Norman. 'There's no pleasure in getting on, nor in
      anything.'
'Don't you care for papa and all of us being glad, Norman?'
As Norman could not just then say that he did, he would not answer.
'I wish—' said Ethel, disappointed, but cheering up the next minute. 'I do believe it is
      having nothing to do. You will be better when you get back to school on Monday.'
'That is worst of all!'
'You don't like going among the boys again? But that must be done some time or other. Or
      shall I get Richard to speak to Dr. Hoxton to let you have another week's leave?'
'No, no, don't be foolish. It can't be helped.'
'I am very sorry, but I think you will be better for it.'
She almost began to fancy herself unfeeling, when she found him so much more depressed than
      she was herself, and unable to feel it a relief to know that the time of rest, and want of
      occupation was
       over. She thought it light-minded, though she could not help it, to look forward
      to the daily studies where she might lose her sad thoughts, and be as if everything were as
      usual. But suppose she should be to blame, where would now be the gentle discipline? Poor
      Ethel's feelings were not such as to deserve the imputation of levity, when this thought came
      over her; but her buoyant mind, always seeking for consolation, recurred to Margaret's
      improvement, and she fixed her hopes on her.
Margaret was more alive to surrounding objects, and, when roused, she knew them all,
      answered clearly when addressed, had even, more than once, spoken of her own accord, and shewn
      solicitude at the sight of her father's bandaged, helpless arm, but he soon soothed this away.
      He was more than ever watchful over her, and could scarcely be persuaded to leave her for one
      moment, in his anxiety to be at hand to answer, when first she should speak of her mother, a
      moment apprehended by all the rest, almost as much for his sake as for hers.
So clear had her perceptions been, and so much more awake did she appear, on this evening,
      that he expected the enquiry to come every moment, and lingered in her room; till she asked
      the hour, and begged him to go to bed.
As he bent over her, she looked up in his face, and said, softly, 'Dear papa.'
There was that in her tone which showed she perceived the truth, and he knelt by her side
      kissing her, but not daring to relax his restraint of feeling.
'Dear papa,' she said again, 'I hope I shall soon be better, and be some comfort to
      you.'
'My best—my own—my comfort,' he murmured, all he could say without giving way.
'Baby—is she well?'
'Yes, thank Heaven, she has not suffered at all.'
'I heard her this morning, I must see her to-morrow. But don't stay, dear, dear papa, it is
      late, and I am sure you are not at all well. Your arm—is it very much hurt?'
'It is nothing you need think about, my dear. I am much better than I could have imagined
      possible.'
'And you have been nursing me all the time! Papa, you must let me take care of you now. Do
      pray go to bed at once, and get up late. Nurse will take good care of me. Good night, dear
      papa.'
When Dr. May had left her, and tried to tell Richard how it had been, the tears cut him
      short, and had their free course; but there was much of thankfulness, for it might be looked
      on as the restoration of his daughter; the worst was over, and the next day he was
       able to think of other things, had more attention to spare for the rest, and when
      the surgeon came, took some professional interest in the condition of his own arm, inquired
      after his patients, and even talked of visiting them.
In the meantime, Margaret sent for her eldest brother, begging him to tell her the whole,
      and it was heard as calmly and firmly as it was told. Her bodily state lulled her mind; and
      besides it was not new; she had observed much while her faculties were still too much benumbed
      for her to understand all, or to express her feelings. Her thoughts seemed chiefly occupied
      with her father. She made Richard explain to her the injury he had suffered, and begged to
      know whether his constant attendance on her, could do him harm. She was much rejoiced when her
      brother assured her that nothing could be better for him and she began to say with a smile,
      that very likely her being hurt had been fortunate. She asked who had taken care of him before
      Richard's arrival, and was pleased to hear that it was Mr. Ernescliffe. A visit from the
      little Gertrude Margaret was happily accomplished, and, on the whole, the day was most
      satisfactory—she herself declaring that she could not see that there was anything the matter
      with her, except that she felt lazy, and did not seem able to move.
Thus the next Sunday morning dawned with more cheerfulness. Dr. May came down stairs for the
      first time, in order to go to Church with his whole flock, except the two Margarets. He looked
      very wan and shattered, but they clustered gladly round him, when he once more stood among
      them, little Blanche securing his hand, and nodding triumphantly to Mr. Ernescliffe, as much
      as to say, 'Now I have him, I don't want you.'
Norman alone was missing; but he was in his place at Church among the boys. Again in
      returning, he slipped out of the party, and was at home the first, and when this recurred in
      the afternoon, Ethel began to understand his motive. The High-street led past the spot where
      the accident had taken place, though neither she nor any of the others knew exactly where it
      was, except Norman, on whose mind the scene was branded indelibly; she guessed that it was to
      avoid it that he went along what was called Randall's Alley, his usual short cut to
      school.
That Sunday brought back to the children that there was no one to hear their hymns; but
      Richard was a great comfort, watching over the little ones more like a sister than a brother.
      Ethel was ashamed of herself when she saw him taking thought for them, tying Blanche's bonnet,
      putting Aubrey's gloves on, teaching them to put away their Sunday toys, as if he meant them
      to be as neat and precise as himself.

Dr. May did not encounter the family dinner, nor attempt a second going to Church; but
      Blanche was very glorious, as she led him down to drink tea, and, before going up again, he
      had a conversation with Alan Ernescliffe, who felt himself obliged to leave Stoneborough early
      on the morrow.
'I can endure better to go now,' said he, 'and I shall hear of you often; Hector will let me
      know, and Richard has promised to write.'
'Aye, you must let us often have a line. I should guess you were a letter writing man.'
'I have hitherto had too few friends who cared to hear of me to write much, but the pleasure
      of knowing that any interest is taken in me here—'
'Well,' said the Doctor, 'mind that a letter will always be welcome, and when you are coming
      southwards, here are your old quarters. 'We cannot lose sight of you any way, especially—' and
      his voice quivered, 'after the help you gave my poor boys and girls in their distress.'
'It would be the utmost satisfaction to think, I had been of the smallest use,' said Alan,
      hiding much under these common-place words.
'More than I know,' said Dr. May; 'too much to speak of— Well, we shall see you again,
      though it is a changed place, and you must come and see your god-daughter—poor child—may she
      only be brought up as her sisters were! They will do their best, poor things, and so must I,
      but it is sad work!'
Both were too much overcome for words, but the Doctor was the first to continue, as he took
      off his dimmed spectacles. He seemed to wish to excuse himself for giving way; saying, with a
      look that would fain have been a smile, 'The world has run so light and easy with me hitherto,
      that you see I don't know how to bear with trouble. All thinking and managing fell to my
      Maggie's share, and I had as little care on my hands as one of my own boys—poor fellows. I
      don't know how it is to turn out, but of all the men on earth to be left with eleven children,
      I should choose myself as the worst.'
Alan tried to say somewhat of 'Confidence—affection—daughters,' and broke down, but it did
      as well as if it had been connected.
'Yes, yes,' said the Doctor, 'they are good children, everyone of them. There's much to be
      thankful for, if one could only pluck up heart to feel it.'
'And you are convinced that Marga—that Miss May is recovering.'
'She has made a great advance to-day. The head is right, at least,' but the Doctor looked
      anxious, and spoke low, as he said, 'I am not satisfied about her yet. That want of power over
      the limbs is more than the mere shock and debility, as it seems to me, though Ward thinks
      otherwise, and I trust he is right; but I cannot tell yet
       as to the spine. If this should not soon mend, I shall have Fleet to see her. He
      was a fellow-student of mine, very clever, and I have more faith in him than in anyone else in
      that line.'
'By all means—Yes—' said Alan, excessively shocked. 'But you will let me know how she goes
      on—Richard will be so kind.'
'We will not fail,' said Dr. May, more and more touched at the sight of the young sailor
      struggling in vain to restrain his emotion; 'you shall hear. I'll write myself, as soon as I
      can use my hand, but I hope she may be all right long before that is likely to be.'
'Your kindness—' Alan attempted to say, but began again. 'Feeling as I must—' then
      interrupting himself. 'I beg your pardon, 'tis no fit time, nor fit— But you'll let me
      hear.'
'That I will,' said Dr. May, and as Alan hastily left the room, he continued, half aloud, to
      himself, 'Poor boy! poor fellow! I see. No wonder! Heaven grant I have not been the breaking
      of their two young hearts, as well as my own! Maggie looked doubtful— as much as she ever did
      when my mind was set on a thing, when I spoke of bringing him here. But after all, she liked
      him as much as the rest of us did—she could not wish it otherwise—he is one of a thousand, and
      worthy of our Margaret. That he is! and Maggie thinks so. If he gets on in his profession, why
      then we shall see—' but the sigh of anguish of mind, here showed that the wound had but been
      forgotten for one moment.
'Pshaw! What am I running on to? I'm all astray for want of her! My poor girl—'
Mr. Ernescliffe set out before sun-rise. The boys were up to wish him good-bye, and so were
      Etheldred and Mary, and some one else, for while the shaking of hands was going on in the
      hall, there was a call 'Mr. Ernthcliffe,' and over the balusters peeped a little rough curly
      head, a face glowing with carnation deepened by sleep, and a round, plump, bare arm and
      shoulder; and down at Alan's feet there fell a construction of white and pink paper, while a
      voice lisped out 'Mr. Ernthcliffe, there's a white rothe for you.'
An indignant 'Miss Blanche!' was heard behind, and there was no certainty that any thanks
      reached the poor little heroine, who was evidently borne off summarily to the nursery, while
      Ethel gave way to a paroxysm of suppressed laughter, joined in, more or less, by all the rest;
      and thus Alan, promising faithfully to preserve the precious token, left Dr. May's door, not
      in so much outward sorrow as he had expected.
Even their father laughed at the romance of the white 'rothe,' and declared Blanche was a
      dangerous young lady; but the story was less successful with Miss Winter, who gravely said it
      was no wonder, since Blanche's elder sister had been setting her the example
       of forwardness in coming down in this way after Mr. Ernescliffe. Ethel was very
      angry, and was only prevented from vindicating herself, by remembering there was no
      peace-maker now, and that she had resolved only to think of Miss Winter's late kindness, and
      bear with her tiresome ways.
Etheldred thought herself too sorrowful to be liable to her usual faults, which would seem
      so much worse now; but she found herself more irritable than usual, and doubly heedless,
      because her mind was pre-occupied. She hated herself, and suffered more from sorrow than even
      at the first moment, for now she felt what it was to have no one to tame her, no eye over her;
      she found herself going à tort et à travers all the morning, and with no one to set
      her right. Since it was so the first day, what would follow?
Mary was on the contrary so far subdued, as to be exemplary in goodness and diligence, and
      Blanche was always steady. Flora was too busy to think of the school-room, for the whole house
      was on her hands, besides the charge of Margaret, while Dr. May went to the hospital, and to
      sundry patients, and they thought he seemed the better for the occupation, as well as
      gratified and affected by the sympathy he everywhere met with, from high and low.
The boys were at school, unseen except when at the dinner play-hour, Norman ran home to ask
      after his father and sister, but the most trying time was at eight in the evening, when they
      came home. That was wont to be the merriest part of the whole day, the whole family collected,
      papa at leisure and ready for talk or for play, mamma smiling over her work-basket, the
      sisters full of chatter, the brothers full of fun, all the tidings of the day discussed, and
      nothing unwelcome but bed-time. How different now! The Doctor was with Margaret, and though
      Richard tried to say something cheerful, as his brothers entered, there was no response, and
      they sat down on the opposite sides of the fire, forlorn and silent, till Richard who was
      printing some letters on card-board to supply the gaps in Aubrey's ivory Alphabet, called
      Harry to help him; but Ethel, as she sat at work, could only look at Norman, and wish she
      could devise anything likely to gratify him.
After a time Flora came down, and laying some sheets of closely written note paper before
      her sister, said, 'Here is dear mama's unfinished letter to aunt Flora. Papa says we elder
      ones are to read it. It is a description of us all, and very much indeed we ought to learn
      from it. I shall keep a copy of it.'
Flora took up her work, and began to consult with Richard, while Ethel moved to Norman's
      side, and kneeling so as to lean against his shoulder, as he sat on a low cushion, they read
      their mother's last letter, by the fire-light, with indescribable feelings, as
       they went through the subjects that had lately occupied them, related by her who
      would never be among them again. After much of this kind, for her letters to Mrs. Arnott were
      almost journals, came,
'You say it is long since you had a portrait gallery of the chicken daisies, and if I do not
      write in these leisure days, you will hardly get it after I am in the midst of business again.
      The new Daisy is like Margaret at the same age—may she continue like her! Pretty creature, she
      can hardly be more charming than at present. Aubrey, the moon-faced, is far from reconciled to
      his deposition from babyhood; he is a sober, solemn gentleman, backward in talking, and with
      such a will of his own, as will want much watching; very different from Blanche, who is Flora
      over again, perhaps prettier, and more fairy-like, unless this is only one's admiration for
      the buds of the present season. None of them has ever been so winning as this little maid, who
      even attracts Dr. Hoxton himself, and obtains sugar-plums and kisses. "Rather she than I,"
      says Harry, but notice is notice to the white Mayflower, and there is my anxiety—I am afraid
      it is not wholesome to be too engaging ever to get a rebuff. I hope having a younger sister,
      and outgrowing baby charms may be salutary. Flora soon left off thinking about her beauty, and
      the fit of vanity does less harm at five than fifteen. My poor Tom has not such a happy life
      as Blanche, he is often in trouble at lessons, and bullied by Harry at play, in spite of his
      champion, Mary; and yet I cannot interfere, for it is good for him to have all this
      preparatory teazing, before he goes into school. He has good abilities, but not much
      perseverance or energy, and I must take the teaching of him into my own hands till his
      school-days begin, in hopes of instilling them. The girlishness and timidity will be knocked
      out of him by the boys, I suppose; Harry is too kind and generous to do more than teaze him
      moderately, and Norman will see that it does not go too far. It is a common saying that Tom
      and Mary made a mistake, that he is the girl, and she the boy, for she is a rough, merry
      creature, the noisiest in the house, always skirmishing with Harry in defence of Tom, and yet
      devoted to him, and wanting to do everything he does. Those two, Harry and Mary, are exactly
      alike, except for Harry's curly mane of lion-coloured wig. The "yellow haired laddie" is
      papa's name for Harry, which he does not mind from him, though furious if the girls attempt to
      call him so. Harry is the thorough boy of the family, all spirit, recklessness, and mischief,
      but so true, and kind, and noble-hearted, that one loves him the better after every freely
      confessed scrape. I cannot tell you how grateful I am to my boy for his perfect confidence,
      the thing that chiefly lessens my anxiety for him in his half-school, half-home life, which
      does not seem to me to work quite well with him. There are two sons of Mrs. Anderson's at the
      school, who are more his friends than I like, and he is too easily led by the desire not to be
      outdone, and to show that he fears nothing. Lately, our sailor-guest has inspired him with a
      vehement wish to go to sea; I wish it was not necessary that the decision should be made so
      early in life, for this fault is just what would make us most fear to send him into the world
      very young, though in some ways it might not do amiss for him.
So much for the younger bairns, whom you never beheld, dear Flora. The three whom you left,
      when people used to waste pity on me for their being all babies together, now look as if any
      pair of them were twins, for Norman is the tallest, almost outgrowing his strength, and
      Ethel's sharp face, so like her papa's, makes her look older than Flora. Norman and Ethel do
      indeed take after their papa, more than any of the others, and are much alike. There is the
      same brilliant cleverness, the same strong feeling, not easy of demonstration, though
      impetuous in action; but poor Ethel's old foibles, her harum-scarum nature, quick temper,
      uncouth manners, and heedlessness of all but one absorbing object, have kept her back, and
      caused her much discomfort; yet I sometimes think these manifest defects have occasioned a
      discipline that is the best thing for the character in the end. They are faults that show
      themselves, and which one can tell how to deal with, and I have full confidence that she has
      the principle within her that will conquer them.'

'If—' mournfully sighed Ethel; but her brother pointed on further.
'My great hope is her entire indifference to praise—not approval, but praise. If she has not
      come up to her own standard, she works on, not always with good temper, but perseveringly, and
      entirely, unheeding of commendation till she has satisfied herself, only thinking it stupid
      not to see the faults. It is this independence of praise that I want to see in her brother and
      sister. They justly earn it, and are rightly pleased with it; but I cannot feel sure whether
      they do not depend on it too much. Norman lives, like all school-boys, a life of emulation,
      and has never met with anything but success. I do believe Dr. Hoxton and Mr. Wilmot are as
      proud of him as we are; and he has never shown any tendency to conceit, but I am afraid he has
      the love of being foremost, and pride in his superiority, caring for what he is, compared with
      others, rather than what he is himself.'
'I know,' said Norman; 'I have done so, but that's over. I see what it is worth. I'd give
      all the quam optimès I ever got in my life to be the help Richard is to papa.'
'You would if you were his age.'
'Not I, I'm not the sort. I'm not like her. But are we to go on about the elders?'
'Oh! yes, don't let us miss a word. There can't be anything but praise of them.'
'Your sweet goddaughter. I almost feel as if I had spoken in disparagement of her, but I
      meant no such thing, dear girl. It would be hard to find a fault in her, since the childish
      love of admiration was subdued. She is so solid and steady, as to be very valuable with the
      younger ones, and is fast growing so lovely, that I wish you could behold her. I do not see
      any vanity, but there lies my dread, not of beauty-vanity, but that she will find temptation
      in the being everywhere liked and sought after. As to Margaret, my precious companion and
      friend, you have heard enough of her to know her, and, as to telling you what she is like, I
      could as soon set about describing her papa. When I thought of not being spared to them this
      time, it was happiness indeed to think of her at their head, fit to be his companion, with so
      much of his own talent as to be more up to conversation with him, than he could ever have
      found his stupid old Maggie. It was rather a trial of her discretion to have Mr. Ernescliffe
      here while I was up-stairs, and very well she seems to have come out of it. Poor Richard's
      last disappointment is still our chief trouble. He has been working hard with a tutor all
      through the vacation, and has not even come home to see his new sister, on his way to Oxford.
