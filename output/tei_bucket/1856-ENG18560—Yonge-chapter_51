CHAPTER XXI.

'O, where dwell ye, my ain sweet bairns?
   I'm woe and weary grown!
O, Lady, we live were woe never is,
   In a land to flesh unknown.'Allan Cunningham.
It had been with a gentle sorrow that Etheldred had expected to go and lay in her
      resting-place, the little niece, who had been kept from the evil of the world, in a manner of
      which she had little dreamt. Poor Flora! she must be ennobled, she thought, by having a child
      where hers is, when she is able to feel anything but the first grief; and Ethel's heart
      yearned to be trying, at least, to comfort her, and to be with her father, who had loved his
      grandchild so fondly.
It was not to be. Margaret had borne so many shocks with such calmness, that Ethel had no
      especial fears for her; but there are some persons who have less fortitude for others than for
      themselves, and she was one of these. Flora had been her own companion-sister, and the baby
      had been the sunbeam of her life, during the sad winter and spring.
In the middle of the night, Ethel knocked at Richard's door. Margaret had been seized with
      faintness, from which they could not bring her back; and, even when Richard had summoned Dr.
      Spencer, it was long ere his remedies took effect; but, at last, she revived enough to thank
      them, and say she was glad that papa was not there.
Dr. Spencer sent them all to bed, and the rest of the night was quiet; but Margaret could
      not deny, in the morning, that she felt terribly shattered, and she was depressed in spirits
      to a degree such as they had never seen in her before. Her whole heart was with Flora; she was
      unhappy at being at a distance from her, almost fretfully impatient for letters, and insisting
      vehemently on Ethel's going to London.
Ethel had never felt so helpless and desolate, as with Margaret thus changed and broken, and
      her father absent.
'My dear,' said Dr. Spencer, 'nothing can be better for both parties than that he should be
      away. If he were here, he ought to leave all attendance to me, and she would suffer from the
      sight of his distress.'

'I cannot think what he will do or feel?' sighed Ethel.
'Leave it to me. I will write to him, and we shall see her better before post time.'
'You will tell him exactly how it was, or I shall,' said Ethel, abruptly, not to say
      fiercely.
'Ho! you don't trust me?' said Dr. Spencer, smiling, so that she was ashamed of her speech.
      'You shall speak for yourself, and I for myself; and I shall say that nothing would so much
      hurt her as to have others sacrificed to her.'
'That is true,' said Ethel; 'but she misses papa.'
'Of course she does; but, depend on it, she would not have him leave your sister, and she is
      under less restraint without him.
'I never saw her like this!'
'The drop has made it overflow. She has repressed more than was good for her, and now that
      her guard is broken down, she gives way under the whole weight.'
'Poor Margaret! I am pertinacious; but, if she is not better by post time, papa will not
      bear to be away.'
'I'll tell you what I think of her by that time. Send up your brother Richard, if you wish
      to do her good. Richard would be a much better person to write than yourself. I perceive that
      he is the reasonable member of the family.'
'Did not you know that before?'
'All I knew of him, till last night, was, that no one could, by any possibility, call him
      Dick.'
Dr. Spencer was glad to have dismissed Ethel smiling; and she was the better able to bear
      with poor Margaret's condition of petulance. She had never before experienced the effects of
      bodily ailments on the temper, and she was slow to understand the change in one usually so
      patient and submissive. She was, by turns, displeased with her sister and with her own
      abruptness; but, though she knew it not, her bluntness had a bracing effect. She thought she
      had been cross in declaring it was nonsense to harp on her going to London; but it made
      Margaret feel that she had been unreasonable, and keep silence.
Richard managed her much better, being gentle and firm, and less ready to speak than Ethel,
      and he succeeded in composing her into a sleep, which restored her balance, and so relieved
      Ethel, that she not only allowed Dr. Spencer to say what he pleased, but herself made light of
      the whole attack, little knowing how perilous was any shock to that delicate frame.
Margaret's whole purpose was to wind herself up for the first interview with Flora; and,
      though she had returned to her usual state, she would not go down-stairs on the evening the
      party were
       expected, believing it would be more grateful to her sister's feelings to meet
      her without witnesses.
The travellers arrived, and Dr. May hurried up to her. She barely replied to his caresses
      and enquiries in her eagerness to hear of Flora, and to convince him that he must not forbid
      the meeting. Nor had he any mind so to do. 'Surely,' said he, when he had seen the
      spiritualized look of her glistening blue eyes, the flush on her transparent cheeks, and her
      hands clasped over her breast, 'surely poor Flora must feel as though an angel were waiting to
      comfort her.'
Flora came, but there was sore disappointment. Fond and tender she was as ever, but, neither
      by word nor gesture, would she admit the most remote allusion to her grief. She withdrew her
      hand when Margaret's pressure became expressive; she avoided her eye, and spoke incessantly of
      indifferent subjects. All the time, her voice was low and hollow, her face had a settled
      expression of wretchedness, and her glances wandered drearily and restlessly anywhere but to
      Margaret's face; but her steadiness of manner was beyond her sister's power to break, and her
      visit was shortened on account of her husband. Poor George had quite given way at the sight of
      Gertrude, whom his little girl had been thought to resemble; and, though Dr. May had soothed
      him almost like a child, no one put any trust in his self-control, and all sat round, fearing
      each word or look, till Flora came down-stairs, and they departed.
Richard and Ethel each offered to go with them; they could not bear to think of their
      spending that first evening in their childless home, but Flora gently, but decidedly refused;
      and Dr. May said that, much as he wished to be with them, he believed that Flora preferred
      having no one but Meta. 'I hope I have done Margaret no harm,' were Flora's last words to him,
      and they seemed to explain her guarded manner; but he found Margaret weeping as she had never
      wept for herself, and palpitation and faintness were the consequence.
Ethel looked on at Flora as a sad and perplexing mystery during the weeks that ensued. There
      were few opportunities of being alone together, and Flora shrank from such as there were—nay,
      she checked all expression of solicitude, and made her very kisses rapid and formal.
The sorrow that had fallen on the Grange seemed to have changed none of the usual habits
      there—visiting, riding, driving, dinners, and music, went on with little check. Flora was sure
      to be found the animated, attentive lady of the house, or else sharing her husband's pursuits,
      helping him with his business, or assisting him
       in seeking pleasure, spending whole afternoons at the coachmaker's, over a
      carriage that they were building, and, it was reported, playing ecarté in the
      evening.
Had grief come to be forgotten and cast aside without effecting any mission? Yet Ethel could
      not believe that the presence of the awful messenger was unfelt, when she heard poor George's
      heavy sigh, or when she looked at Flora's countenance, and heard the peculiar low, subdued
      tone of her voice, which, when her words were most cheerful, always seemed to Ethel the
      resigned accent of despair.
Ethel could not talk her over with Margaret, for all seemed to make it a point that Margaret
      should believe the best. Dr. May turned from the subject with a sort of shuddering grief, and
      said, 'Don't talk of her, poor child—only pray for her!'
Ethel, though shocked by the unwonted manner of his answer, was somewhat consoled by
      perceiving that a double measure of tenderness had sprung up between her father and his poor
      daughter. If Flora had seemed, in her girlhood, to rate him almost cheaply, this was at an end
      now; she met him as if his embrace were peace, the gloom was lightened, the attention less
      strained, when he was beside her, and she could not part with him without pressing for a
      speedy meeting. Yet, she treated him with the same reserve; since that one ghastly revelation
      of the secrets of her heart, the veil had been closely drawn, and he could not guess whether
      it had been but a horrible thought, or were still an abiding impression. Ethel could gather no
      more than that her father was very unhappy about Flora, and that Richard understood why; for
      Richard had told her that he had written to Flora, to try to persuade her to cease from this
      reserve, but that he had no reply.
Norman was not at home; he had undertaken the tutorship of two school-boys for the holidays;
      and his father owned, with a sigh, that he was doing wisely.
As to Meta, she was Ethel's chief consolation, by the redoubled assurances, directed to
      Ethel's unexpressed dread, lest Flora should be rejecting the chastening Hand. Meta had the
      most absolute certainty that Flora's apparent cheerfulness was all for George's sake, and that
      it was a most painful exertion. 'If Ethel could only see how she let herself sink together as
      it were, and her whole countenance relax, as soon as he was out of sight,' Meta said, 'she
      could not doubt what misery these efforts were to her.'
'Why does she go on with them?' said Ethel.
'George,' said Meta. 'What would become of him without her? If he misses her for ten
      minutes, he roams about lost, and he cannot enjoy anything without her. I cannot think how he
      can
       help seeing what hard work it is, and how he can be contented with those
      dreadful sham smiles; but as long as she can give him pleasure, poor Flora will toil for
      him.'
'It is very selfish,' Ethel caught herself saying.
'No, no, it is not,' cried Meta. 'It is not that he will not see, but that he cannot see.
      Good honest fellow, he really thinks it does her good and pleases her. I was so sorry one
      evening when I tried to take her place at that perpetual ecarté , and told him it
      teased her; he went so wistfully to her, and asked whether it did, and she exerted herself
      into such painful enjoyment to persuade him to the contrary; and afterwards she said to me,
      "Let me alone, dearest— is the only thing left me."'
'There is something in being husband and wife that one cannot understand,' slowly said
      Ethel, so much in her quaint way, that Meta laughed.
Had it not been for Norman's absence, Ethel would, in the warm sympathy and accustomed
      manner of Meta Rivers, have forgotten all about the hopes and fears that, in brighter days,
      had centred on that small personage; until one day, as she came home from Cocksmoor, she found
      "Sir Henry Walkinghame's" card on the drawingroom table. 'I should like to bite you! Coming
      here, are you?' was her amiable reflection!
Meta, in her riding-habit, peeped out of Margaret's room. 'O Ethel, there you are! It is
      such a boon that you did not come home sooner, or we should have had to ride home with him! I
      heard him asking for the Miss Mays! And now I am in hopes that he will go home without falling
      in with Flora and George.'
'I did not know he was in these parts.'
'He came to Drydale last week, but the place is forlorn, and George gave him a general
      invitation to the Grange.'
'Do you like him?' said Ethel, while Margaret looked on, amazed at her
      audacity.
'I liked him very much in London,' said Meta; 'he is pleasant enough to talk to, but
      somehow, he is not congruous here—if you understand me. And I think his coming oppresses
      Flora—she turned quite pale when he was announced, and her voice was lower than ever when she
      spoke to him.'
'Does he come often?' said Ethel.
'I don't think he has anything else to do,' returned Meta, 'for our house cannot be as
      pleasant as it was; but he is very kind to George, and for that we must be grateful. One thing
      I am afraid of, that he will persuade us off to the yachtting after all.'
'Oh!' was the general exclamation.
'Yes,' said Meta. 'George seemed to like the plan, and I very
       much fear that he is taking a dislike to the dear old Grange. I heard him say,
      "anything to get away."'
'Poor George, I know he is restless,' said Margaret.
'At least,' said Ethel, 'you can't go till after your birthday, Miss Heiress.'
'No, uncle Cosham is coming,' said Meta. 'Margaret, you must have your stone laid before we
      go!'
'Dr. Spencer promises it before Hector's holidays are over,' said Margaret, blushing, as she
      always did, with pleasure, when they talked of the Church.
Hector Ernescliffe had revived Margaret wonderfully. She was seldom down-stairs before the
      evening, and Ethel thought his habit of making her apartment his sitting-room, must be as
      inconvenient to her, as it was to herself; but Hector could not be de trop for
      Margaret. She exerted herself to fulfil for him all the little sisterly offices that, with her
      brothers, had been transferred to Ethel and Mary; she threw herself into all his schemes,
      tried to make him endure Captain Gordon, and she even read his favourite book of Wild Sports,
      though her feelings were constantly lacerated by the miseries of the slaughtered animals. Her
      couch was to him as a home, and he had awakened her bright soft liveliness which had been only
      dimmed for a time.
The Church was her other great interest, and Dr. Spencer humoured her by shewing her all his
      drawings, consulting her on every ornament, and making many a perspective elevation, merely
      that she might see the effect.
Richard and Tom made it their recreation to construct a model of the Church as a present for
      her, and Tom developed a genius for carving, which proved a beneficial interest to keep him
      from surliness. He had voluntarily propounded his intended profession to his father, who had
      been so much pleased by his choice, that he could not but be gratified; though now and then
      ambitious fancies, and discontent with Stoneborough, combined to bring on his ordinary moody
      fits, the more, because his habitual reserve prevented anyone from knowing what was working in
      his mind.
Finally, the Rivers' party announced their intention of going to the Isle of Wight as soon
      as Meta had come of age; and the council of Cocksmoor, meeting at tea at Dr. May's house,
      decided that the Foundation Stone of the Church should be laid on the day after her birthday,
      when there would be a gathering of the whole family, as Margaret wished. Dr. Spencer had
      worked incredibly hard to bring it forward, and Margaret's sweet smiles, and liquid eyes,
      expressed how personally thankful she felt.
'What a blessing this Church has been to that poor girl,' said
       Dr. Spencer, as he left the house with Mr. Wilmot. 'How it beguiles her out of
      her grief! I am glad she has the pleasure of the foundation; I doubt if she will see the
      Consecration.'
'Indeed!' said Mr. Wilmot, shocked. 'Was that attack so serious?'
'That recumbent position and want of exercise were certain to produce organic disease, and
      suspense and sorrow have hastened it. The death of Mrs. Rivers' poor child was the blow that
      called it into activity, and, if it last more than a year, I shall be surprised.'
'For such as she is, one cannot presume to wish, but her father —Is he aware of this?'
'He knows there is extensive damage; I think he does not open his eyes to the result, but he
      will bear it. Never was there a man to whom it came so naturally to live like the the fowls of
      the air, or the lilies of the field, as it does to dear Dick May,' said Dr. Spencer, his voice
      faltering.
'There is a strength of faith and love in him, that carries him through all,' said Mr.
      Wilmot. 'His childlike nature seems to have the trustfulness that is, in itself, consolation.
      You said how Cocksmoor had been blessed to Margaret—I think it is the same with them all—not
      only Ethel and Richard, who have been immediately concerned; but that one object has been a
      centre and aim to elevate the whole family, and give force and unity to their efforts. Even
      the good Doctor, much as I always looked up to him—much good as he did me in my young days—I
      must confess that he was sometimes very provoking.'
'If you had tried to be his keeper at Cambridge, you might say so!' rejoined Dr.
      Spencer.
'He is so much less impetuous—more consistent—less desultory; I dare say you understand me,'
      said Mr. Wilmot. 'His good qualities do not entangle one another as they used to do.'
'Exactly so. He was far more than I looked for when I came home, though I might have guessed
      that such a disposition, backed by such principles and such—could not but shake off all the
      dross.'
'One thing was,' said Mr. Wilmot, smiling, 'that a man must take himself in hand, at some
      time in his life, and Dr. May only began to think himself responsible for himself, when he
      lost his wife, who was wise for both. She was an admirable person, but not easy to know well.
      I think you knew her at—'
'I say,' interrupted Dr. Spencer, 'it strikes me that we could not do better than get up our
      S. P. G. demonstration on the day of the stone—'
Hitherto the Stoneborough subscribers to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel had
      been few and far between; but, under
       the new dynasty, there was a talk of forming an association, and having a
      meeting to bring the subject forward. Dr. Spencer's proposal, however, took the Vicar by
      surprise.
'Never could there be a better time,' he argued. You have naturally a gathering of
      Clergy—people ought to be liberal on such an occasion, and, as Cocksmoor is provided for, why
      not give the benefit to the missions, in their crying need.'
'True, but there is no time to send for anyone to make a speech.'
'Husband your resources. What could you have better than young Harry and his islanders?'
'Harry would never make a speech.'
'Let him cram Norman. Young Lake tells me Norman made a great sensation at the Union at
      Oxford, and if his heart is in the work, he must not shrink from the face of his
      townsmen.'
'No doubt, he had rather they were savages,' said the Vicar. 'And yourself—you will tell
      them of the Indian Missions.'
'With all my heart,' said Dr. Spencer. 'When my Brahminhee Godson—the Deacon I told you of,
      comes to pay me his promised visit, what doings we shall have! Seriously, I have just had
      letters from him and from others, that speak of such need, that I could feel every moment
      wasted that is not spent on their behalf.'
Mr. Wilmot was drawn into Dr. Spencer's house, and heard the letters, till his heart burnt
      within him.
The meeting was at once decided upon, though Ethel could not see why people could not give
      without speechifying, and her two younger brothers declared it was humbug—Tom saying, he
      wished all blackamoors were out of creation, and Harry, that he could not stand palaver about
      his friend David. Dr. May threatened him with being displayed on the platform as a living
      instance of the effects of Missions, at which he took alarm, and so seriously declared that he
      should join the Bucephalus at once, that they pacified him by promising that he should do as
      he pleased.
The Archdeacon promised a Sermon, and the active Dr. Spencer worked the Nine Muses and all
      the rest of the town and neighbourhood into a state of great enthusiasm and expectation. He
      went to the Grange, as he said, to collect his artillery; primed Flora that she might prime
      the M. P.; made the willing Meta promise to entrap the uncle, who was noted for
      philanthropical speeches; and himself captured Sir Henry Walkinghame, who looked somewhat
      rueful at what he found incumbent on him as a country gentleman, though there might be some
      compensation in the eagerness of Miss Rivers.
Norman had hardly set foot in Stoneborough before he was told what was in store for him,
      and, to the general surprise, submitted as if it were a very simple matter. As Dr. Spencer
      told him, it was
       only a foretaste of the penalty which every Missionary has to pay for coming to
      England. Norman was altogether looking much better than when he had been last at home, and his
      spirits were more even. He had turned his whole soul to the career he had chosen, cast his
      disappointment behind him, or, more truly, made it his offering, and gathered strength and
      calmness, with which to set out on tasks of working for others, with thoughts too much
      absorbed on them, to give way to the propensity of making himself the primary object of study
      and contemplation. The praise of God, and love of man, were the best cures for tendencies like
      his, and he had found it out. His calm, though grave cheerfulness, came as a refreshment to
      those who had been uneasy about him, and mournfully watching poor Flora.
'Yes,' said Dr. Spencer, 'you have taken the best course for your own happiness.
Norman coloured, as if he understood more than met the ear.
Mary and Blanche were very busy preparing presents for Meta Rivers, and everyone was anxious
      to soften to her the thought of this first birthday without her father. Each of the family
      contributed some pretty little trifle, choice in workmanship or kind in device, and each was
      sealed and marked with the initials of the giver, and packed up by Mary, to be committed to
      Flora's charge. Blanche had, however, much tronble in extracting a gift from Norman, and he
      only yielded at last, on finding that all his brothers had sent something, so that his
      omission would be marked. Then he dived into the recesses of his desk, and himself sealed up a
      little parcel, of which he would not allow his sisters to inspect the contents.
Ethel had a shrewd guess. She remembered his having, in the flush of joy at Margaret's
      engagement, rather prematurely caused a seal to be cut with a Daisy, and "Pearl of the meadow"
      as the motto; and his having said that he should keep it as a wedding present. She could
      understand that he was willing to part with it without remark.
Flora met Meta in her sitting room, on the morning of the day, which rose somewhat sadly
      upon the young girl, as she thought of past affection and new responsibilities. If the
      fondness of a sister could have compensated for what she had lost, Meta received it in no
      scanty measure from Flora, who begged to call George, because he would be pleased to see the
      display of gifts.
His own was the only costly one—almost all the rest were homemade treasures of the greater
      price, because the skill and fondness of the maker were evident in their construction; and
      Meta took home the kindness as it was meant, and felt the affection that would not let her
      feel herself lonely. She only wished to go and thank them all at once.

'Do then,' said Flora. 'If Lord Cosham will spare you, and your business should be over in
      time, you could drive in, and try to bring papa home with you.'
'O thank you, Flora. That is a kind treat, in case the morning should be very awful!'
Margaret Agatha Rivers signed her documents, listened to explanations, and was complimented
      by her uncle on not thinking it necessary to be senseless on money matters, like her cousin,
      Agatha Langdale.
Still she looked a little oppressed, as she locked up the tokens of her wealth, and the
      sunshine of her face did not beam out again till she arrived at Stoneborough, and was
      dispensing her pretty thanks to the few she found at home.
'Ethel out and Norman? His seal is only too pretty—'
'They are all helping Dr. Spencer at Cocksmoor.'
'What a pity! But it is so very kind of him to treat me as a Daisy. In some ways I like his
      present for that the best of all,' said Meta.
'I will tell him so,' said Mary.
'Yes—no'—said Meta. 'I am not pretending to be anything half so nice.
Mary and Blanche fell upon her for calling herself anything but the nicest flower in the
      world; and she contended that she was nothing better than a parrot-tulip, stuck up in a
      parterre; and just as the discussion was becoming a game at romps, Dr. May came in, and the
      children shouted to him to say whether his humming-bird were a Daisy or a Tulip.
'That is as she comports herself,' he said, playfully.
'Which means that you don't think her quite done for,' said Meta.
'Not quite,' said the Doctor, with a droll intonation; 'but I have not seen what this
      morning may have done to her.'
'Come and see, then,' said Meta. 'Flora told me to bring you home—and it is my birthday, you
      know. Never mind waiting to tell Ethel. Margaret will let her know that I'll keep you out of
      mischief.'
As usual, Dr. May could not withstand her—and she carried him off in triumph in her pony
      carriage.
'Then you don't give me up yet?' was the first thing she said, as they were off the
      stones.
'What have you been doing to make me?' said he.
'Doing or not doing—one or the other,' she said. 'But indeed I wanted to have you to myself.
      I am in a great puzzle!'
'Sir Henry! I hope she won't consult me!' thought Dr. May, as he answered, 'Well, my
      dear.'

'I fear it is a lasting puzzle,' she said. 'What shall I do with all this money?'
'Keep it in the Bank, or buy railway shares?' said Dr. may, looking arch.
'Thank you. That's question for my cousins in the City. I want you to answer me as no one
      else can do. I want to know what is my duty now that I have that I have my means in my own
      hands?'
'There is need enough around—'
'I do not mean only giving a little here and there, but I want you to hear a few of my
      thoughts. Flora and George are kindness itself—but, you see, I have no duties. They are
      obliged to live a gay sort of life—it is their position; but I cannot make out whether it is
      mine. I don't see that I am like those girls who have to go out as a matter of obedience.'
Dr. May considered, but could only say, 'You are very young.'
'Too young to be independent,' sighed Meta. 'I must grow old enough to be trusted alone, and
      in the mean time—'
'Probably an answer will be found,' said the Doctor. You and your means will find
      their—thier vocation.'
'Marriage,' said Meta, calmly speaking the word that he had avoided. 'I think not.'
'Why?'—he began.
'I do not think good men like heiresses.'
He became strongly interested in a corn-field, and she resumed, 'Perhaps I should only do
      harm. It may be my duty to wait. All I wish to know is, whether it is?'
'I see you are not like girls who know their duty, and are restless, because it is not the
      duty they like.'
'Oh! I like everything. It is my liking it so much that makes me afraid.
'Even going to Ryde?'
'Don't I like the sailing? and seeing Harry too? I don't feel as if that were waste, because
      I can sometimes spare poor Flora a little. We could not let her go alone.'
'You need never fear to be without a mission of comfort,' said Dr. May. Your 'spirit full of
      glee' was given you for something. Your presence is far more to my poor Flora than you or she
      guess.'
'I never meant to leave her now,' said Meta, earnestly. 'I only wished to be clear whether I
      ought to seek for my work.'
'It will seek you, when the time comes.'
'And meantime I must do what comes to hand, and take it as humiliation that it is not in the
      more obviously blessed tasks! A call might come, as Cocksmoor did to Ethel. But, oh! my money!
      Ought it to be laid up for myself?'

'For your call, when it comes,' said Dr. May, smiling—then gravely, 'There are but too many
      calls for the interest. The principal is your trust, till the time comes.'
Meta smiled, and was pleased to think that her first-fruits would be offered to-morrow.
