CHAPTER VIII.
BEFORE THE STORM.
So the dinner at Audley Court was postponed, and Miss Alicia had to wait still longer for an
     introduction to the handsome young widower, Mr. George Talboys.
I am afraid, if the real truth is to be told, there was, perhaps, something of affectation in
     the anxiety this young lady expressed to make George's acquaintance; but if poor Alicia for a
     moment calculated upon arousing any latent spark of jealousy lurking in her cousin's breast by
     this exhibition of interest, she was not so well acquainted with Robert Audley's disposition as
     she might have been. Indolent, handsome, and indifferent, the young barrister took life as
     altogether too absurd a mistake for any one event in its foolish course to be for a moment
     considered seriously by a sensible man.
His pretty, gipsy-faced cousin might have been over head and ears in love with him; and she
     might have told him so, in some charming, roundabout, womanly fashion, a hundred times a day
     for all the three hundred and sixty-five days in the year; but unless she had waited for some
     privileged 29th of February, and walked straight up to him, saying, "Robert, please will you
     marry me?" I very much doubt if he would ever have discovered the state of her feelings.
Again, had he been in love with her himself, I fancy that the tender passion would, with him,
     have been so vague and feeble a sentiment that he might have gone down to his grave with a dim
     sense of some uneasy sensation which might be love or indigestion, and with, beyond this, no
     knowledge whatever of his state.
So it was not the least use, my poor Alicia, to ride about the lanes around Audley during
     those three days which the two young men spent in Essex; it was wasted trouble to wear that
     pretty cavalier hat and plume, and to be always, by the most singular of chances, meeting
     Robert and his friend. The black curls (nothing like Lady Audley's feathery ringlets, but heavy
     clustering locks, that clung about your slender brown throat), the red and pouting lips, the
     nose inclined to be retrousse, the dark complexion, with its bright crimson flush,
     always ready to glance up like a signal light in a dusky sky, when you came suddenly upon your
     apathetic cousin—all this coquettish espiegle, brunette beauty was thrown away upon
     the dull eyes of Robert Audley, and you might as well have taken your rest in the cool
     drawing-room at the Court, instead of working your pretty mare to death under the hot September
     sun.
Now fishing, except to the devoted disciple of Izaak Walton, is not the most lively of
     occupations; therefore, it is scarcely, perhaps, to be wondered that on the day after Lady
     Audley's departure, the two young men (one of whom was disabled by that heart wound which he
     bore so quietly, from really taking pleasure in anything, and the other of whom looked upon
     almost all pleasure as a negative kind of trouble) began to grow weary of the shade of the
     willows overhanging the winding streams about Audley.
"Figtree Court is not gay in the long vacation," said Robert, reflectively: "but I think,
     upon the whole, it's better than this; at any rate, it's near a tobacconist's," he added,
     puffing resignedly at an execrable cigar procured from the landlord of the Sun Inn.
George Talboys, who had only consented to the Essex expedition in passive submission to his
     friend, was by no means inclined to object to their immediate return to London. "I shall be
     glad to get back, Bob," he said, "for I want to take a run down to Southampton; I haven't seen
     the little one for upward of a month."
He always spoke of his son as "the little one;" always spoke of him mournfully rather than
     hopefully. He accounted for this by saying that he had a fancy that the child would never learn
     to love him; and worse even than this fancy, a dim presentiment that he would not live to see
     his little Georgey reach manhood.
"I'm not a romantic man, Bob," he would say sometimes, "and I never read a line of poetry in
     my life that was any more to me than so many words and so much jingle; but a feeling has come
     over me, since my wife's death, that I am like a man standing upon a long, low shore, with
     hideous cliffs frowning down upon him from behind, and the rising tide crawling slowly but
     surely about his feet. It seems to grow nearer and nearer every day, that black, pitiless tide;
     not rushing upon me with a great noise and a mighty impetus, but crawling, creeping, stealing,
     gliding toward me, ready to close in above my head when I am least prepared for the end."
Robert Audley stared at his friend in silent amazement; and, after a pause of profound
     deliberation, said solemnly, "George Talboys, I could understand this if you had been eating
     heavy suppers. Cold pork, now, especially if underdone, might produce this sort of thing. You
     want change of air, my dear boy; you want the refreshing breezes of Figtree Court, and the
     soothing air of Fleet street. Or, stay," he added, suddenly, "I have it! You've been smoking
     our friend the landlord's cigars; that accounts for everything."
They met Alicia Audley on her mare about half an hour after they had come to the
     determination of leaving Essex early the next morning. The young lady was very much surprised
     and disappointed at hearing her cousin's determination, and for that very reason pretended to
     take the matter with supreme indifference.
"You are very soon tired of Audley, Robert," she said, carelessly; "but of course you have no
     friends here, except your relations at the Court; while in London, no doubt, you have the most
     delightful society and—"
"I get good tobacco," murmured Robert, interrupting his cousin. "Audley is the dearest old
     place, but when a man has to smoke dried cabbage leaves, you know, Alicia—"
"Then you are really going to-morrow morning?"
"Positively—by the express train that leaves at 10.50."
"Then Lady Audley will lose an introduction to Mr. Talboys, and Mr. Talboys will lose the
     chance of seeing the prettiest woman in Essex."
"Really—" stammered George.
"The prettiest woman in Essex would have a poor chance of getting much admiration out of my
     friend, George Talboys," said Robert. "His heart is at Southampton, where he has a curly-headed
     little urchin, about as high as his knee, who calls him 'the big gentleman,' and asks him for
     sugar-plums."
"I am going to write to my step-mother by to-night's post," said Alicia. "She asked me
     particularly in her letter how long you were going to stop, and whether there was any chance of
     her being back in time to receive you."
Miss Audley took a letter from the pocket of her riding-jacket as she spoke—a pretty,
     fairy-like note, written on shining paper of a peculiar creamy hue.
"She says in her postcript, 'Be sure you answer my question about Mr. Audley and his friend,
     you volatile, forgetful Alicia!'"
"What a pretty hand she writes!" said Robert, as his cousin folded the note.
"Yes, it is pretty, is it not? Look at it, Robert."
She put the letter into his hand, and he contemplated it lazily for a few minutes, while
     Alicia patted the graceful neck of her chestnut mare, which was anxious to be off once
     more.
"Presently, Atalanta, presently. Give me back my note, Bob."
"It is the prettiest, most coquettish little hand I ever saw. Do you know, Alicia, I have no
     great belief in those fellows who ask you for thirteen postage stamps, and offer to tell you
     what you have never been able to find out yourself; but upon my word I think that if I had
     never seen your aunt, I should know what she was like by this slip of paper. Yes, here it all
     is—the feathery, gold-shot, flaxen curls, the penciled eyebrows, the tiny, straight nose, the
     winning, childish smile; all to be guessed in these few graceful up-strokes and down-strokes.
     George, look here!"
But absent-minded and gloomy George Talboys had strolled away along the margin of the ditch,
     and stood striking the bulrushes with his cane, half a dozen paces away from Robert and
     Alicia.
"Nevermind," said the young lady, impatiently; for she by no means relished this long
     disquisition upon my lady's note. "Give me the letter, and let me go; it's past eight, and I
     must answer it by to-night's post. Come, Atalanta! Good-by, Robert—good-by, Mr. Talboys. A
     pleasant journey to town."
The chestnut mare cantered briskly through the lane, and Miss Audley was out of sight before
     those two big, bright tears that stood in her eyes for one moment, before her pride sent them,
     back again, rose from her angry heart.
"To have only one cousin in the world," she cried, passionately, "my nearest relation after
     papa, and for him to care about as much for me as he would for a dog!"
By the merest of accidents, however, Robert and his friend did not go by the 10.50 express on
     the following morning, for the young barrister awoke with such a splitting headache, that he
     asked George to send him a cup of the strongest green tea that had ever been made at the Sun,
     and to be furthermore so good as to defer their journey until the next day. Of course George
     assented, and Robert Audley spent the forenoon in a darkened room with a five-days'-old
     Chelmsford paper to entertain himself withal.
"It's nothing but the cigars, George," he said, repeatedly. "Get me out of the place without
     my seeing the landlord; for if that man and I meet there will be bloodshed."
Fortunately for the peace of Audley, it happened to be market-day at Chelmsford; and the
     worthy landlord had ridden off in his chaise-cart to purchase supplies for his house—among
     other things, perhaps, a fresh stock of those very cigars which had been so fatal in their
     effect upon Robert.
The young men spent a dull, dawdling, stupid, unprofitable day; and toward dusk Mr. Audley
     proposed that they should stroll down to the Court, and ask Alicia to take them over the
     house.
"It will kill a couple of hours, you know, George: and it seems a great pity to drag you away
     from Audley without having shown you the old place, which, I give you my honor, is very well
     worth seeing."
The sun was low in the skies as they took a short cut through the meadows, and crossed a
     stile into the avenue leading to the archway—a lurid, heavy-looking, ominous sunset, and a
     deathly stillness in the air, which frightened the birds that had a mind to sing, and left the
     field open to a few captious frogs croaking in the ditches. Still as the atmosphere was, the
     leaves rustled with that sinister, shivering motion which proceeds from no outer cause, but is
     rather an instinctive shudder of the frail branches, prescient of a coming storm. That stupid
     clock, which knew no middle course, and always skipped from one hour to the other, pointed to
     seven as the young men passed under the archway; but, for all that, it was nearer eight.
They found Alicia in the lime-walk, wandering listlessly up and down under the black shadow
     of the trees, from which every now and then a withered leaf flapped slowly to the ground.
Strange to say, George Talboys, who very seldom observed anything, took particular notice of
     this place.
"It ought to be an avenue in a churchyard," he said. "How peacefully the dead might sleep
     under this somber shade! I wish the churchyard at Ventnor was like this."
They walked on to the ruined well; and Alicia told them some old legend connected with the
     spot—some gloomy story, such as those always attached to an old house, as if the past were one
     dark page of sorrow and crime.
"We want to see the house before it is dark, Alicia," said Robert.
"Then we must be quick." she answered. "Come."
She led the way through an open French window, modernized a few years before, into the
     library, and thence to the hall.
In the hall they passed my lady's pale-faced maid, who looked furtively under her white
     eyelashes at the two young men.
They were going up-stairs, when Alicia turned and spoke to the girl.
"After we have been in the drawing-room, I should like to show these gentlemen Lady Audley's
     rooms. Are they in good order, Phoebe?"
"Yes, miss; but the door of the anteroom is locked, and I fancy that my lady has taken the
     key to London."
"Taken the key! Impossible!" cried Alicia.
"Indeed, miss, I think she has. I cannot find it, and it always used to be in the door."
"I declare," said Alicia, impatiently, "that is not at all unlike my lady to have taken this
     silly freak into her head. I dare say she was afraid we should go into her rooms, and pry about
     among her pretty dresses, and meddle with her jewelry. It is very provoking, for the best
     pictures in the house are in that antechamber. There is her own portrait, too, unfinished but
     wonderfully like."
"Her portrait!" exclaimed Robert Audley. "I would give anything to see it, for I have only an
     imperfect notion of her face. Is there no other way of getting into the room, Alicia?"
"Another way?"
"Yes; is there any door, leading through some of the other rooms, by which we can contrive to
     get into hers?"
His cousin shook her head, and conducted them into a corridor where there were some family
     portraits. She showed them a tapestried chamber, the large figures upon the faded canvas
     looking threatening in the dusky light.
"That fellow with the battle-ax looks as if he wanted to split George's head open," said Mr.
     Audley, pointing to a fierce warrior, whose uplifted arm appeared above George Talboys' dark
     hair.
"Come out of this room, Alicia," added the young man, nervously; "I believe it's damp, or
     else haunted. Indeed, I believe all ghosts to be the result of damp or dyspepsia. You sleep in
     a damp bed—you awake suddenly in the dead of the night with a cold shiver, and see an old lady
     in the court costume of George the First's time, sitting at the foot of the bed. The old lady's
     indigestion, and the cold shiver is a damp sheet."
There were lighted candles in the drawing-room. No new-fangled lamps had ever made their
     appearance at Audley Court. Sir Michael's rooms were lighted by honest, thick, yellow-looking
     wax candles, in massive silver candlesticks, and in sconces against the walls.
There was very little to see in the drawing-room; and George Talboys soon grew tired of
     staring at the handsome modern furniture, and at a few pictures of some of the
     Academicians.
"Isn't there a secret passage, or an old oak chest, or something of that kind, somewhere
     about the place, Alicia?" asked Robert.
"To be sure!" cried Miss Audley, with a vehemence that startled her cousin; "of course. Why
     didn't I think of it before? How stupid of me, to be sure!"
"Why stupid?"
"Because, if you don't mind crawling upon your hands and knees, you can see my lady's
     apartments, for that passage communicates with her dressing-room. She doesn't know of it
     herself, I believe. How astonished she'd be if some black-visored burglar, with a dark-lantern,
     were to rise through the floor some night as she sat before her looking-glass, having her hair
     dressed for a party!"
"Shall we try the secret passage, George?" asked Mr. Audley.
"Yes, if you wish it."
Alicia led them into the room which had once been her nursery. It was now disused, except on
     very rare occasions when the house was full of company.
Robert Audley lifted a corner of the carpet, according to his cousin's directions, and
     disclosed a rudely-cut trap-door in the oak flooring.
"Now listen to me," said Alicia. "You must let yourself down by the hands into the passage,
     which is about four feet high; stoop your head, walk straight along it till you come to a sharp
     turn which will take you to the left, and at the extreme end of it you will find a short ladder
     below a trap-door like this, which you will have to unbolt; that door opens into the flooring
     of my lady's dressing-room, which is only covered with a square Persian carpet that you can
     easily manage to raise. You understand me?"
"Perfectly."
"Then take the light; Mr. Talboys will follow you. I give you twenty minutes for your
     inspection of the paintings—that is, about a minute apiece—and at the end of that time I shall
     expect to see you return."
Robert obeyed her implicitly, and George submissively following his friend, found himself, in
     five minutes, standing amidst the elegant disorder of Lady Audley's dressing-room.
She had left the house in a hurry on her unlooked-for journey to London, and the whole of her
     glittering toilette apparatus lay about on the marble dressing-table. The atmosphere of the
     room was almost oppressive for the rich odors of perfumes in bottles whose gold stoppers had
     not been replaced. A bunch of hot-house flowers was withering upon a tiny writing-table. Two or
     three handsome dresses lay in a heap upon the ground, and the open doors of a wardrobe revealed
     the treasures within. Jewelry, ivory-backed hair-brushes, and exquisite china were scattered
     here and there about the apartment. George Talboys saw his bearded face and tall, gaunt figure
     reflected in the glass, and wondered to see how out of place he seemed among all these womanly
     luxuries.
They went from the dressing-room to the boudoir, and through the boudoir into the
     ante-chamber, in which there were, as Alicia had said, about twenty valuable paintings, besides
     my lady's portrait.
My lady's portrait stood on an easel, covered with a green baize in the center of the
     octagonal chamber. It had been a fancy of the artist to paint her standing in this very room,
     and to make his background a faithful reproduction of the pictured walls. I am afraid the young
     man belonged to the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, for he had spent a most unconscionable time
     upon the accessories of this picture—upon my lady's crispy ringlets and the heavy folds of her
     crimson velvet dress.
The two young men looked at the paintings on the walls first, leaving this unfinished
     portrait for a bonne bouche.
By this time it was dark, the candle carried by Robert only making one nucleus of light as he
     moved about holding it before the pictures one by one. The broad, bare window looked out upon
     the pale sky, tinged with the last cold flicker of the twilight. The ivy rustled against the
     glass with the same ominous shiver as that which agitated every leaf in the garden, prophetic
     of the storm that was to come.
"There are our friend's eternal white horses," said Robert, standing beside a Wouvermans.
     "Nicholas Poussin—Salvator—ha—hum! Now for the portrait."
He paused with his hand on the baize, and solemnly addressed his friend.
"George Talboys," he said, "we have between us only one wax candle, a very inadequate light
     with which to look at a painting. Let me, therefore, request that you will suffer us to look at
     it one at a time; if there is one thing more disagreeable than another, it is to have a person
     dodging behind your back and peering over your shoulder, when you're trying to see what a
     picture's made of."
George fell back immediately. He took no more interest in any lady's picture than in all the
     other wearinesses of this troublesome world. He fell back, and leaning his forehead against the
     window-panes, looked out at the night.
When he turned round he saw that Robert had arranged the easel very conveniently, and that he
     had seated himself on a chair before it for the purpose of contemplating the painting at his
     leisure.
He rose as George turned round.
"Now, then, for your turn, Talboys," he said. "It's an extraordinary picture."
He took George's place at the window, and George seated himself in the chair before the
     easel.
Yes, the painter must have been a pre-Raphaelite. No one but a pre-Raphaelite would have
     painted, hair by hair, those feathery masses of ringlets, with every glimmer of gold, and every
     shadow of pale brown. No one but a pre-Raphaelite would have so exaggerated every attribute of
     that delicate face as to give a lurid brightness to the blonde complexion, and a strange,
     sinister light to the deep blue eyes. No one but a pre-Raphaelite could have given to that
     pretty pouting mouth the hard and almost wicked look it had in the portrait.
It was so like, and yet so unlike. It was as if you had burned strange-colored fires before
     my lady's face, and by their influence brought out new lines and new expressions never seen in
     it before. The perfection of feature, the brilliancy of coloring, were there; but I suppose the
     painter had copied quaint mediaeval monstrosities until his brain had grown bewildered, for my
     lady, in his portrait of her, had something of the aspect of a beautiful fiend.
Her crimson dress, exaggerated like all the rest in this strange picture, hung about her in
     folds that looked like flames, her fair head peeping out of the lurid mass of color as if out
     of a raging furnace. Indeed the crimson dress, the sunshine on the face, the red gold gleaming
     in the yellow hair, the ripe scarlet of the pouting lips, the glowing colors of each accessory
     of the minutely painted background, all combined to render the first effect of the painting by
     no means an agreeable one.
But strange as the picture was, it could not have made any great impression on George
     Talboys, for he sat before it for about a quarter of an hour without uttering a word—only
     staring blankly at the painted canvas, with the candlestick grasped in his strong right hand,
     and his left arm hanging loosely by his side. He sat so long in this attitude, that Robert
     turned round at last.
"Why, George, I thought you had gone to sleep!"
"I had almost."
"You've caught a cold from standing in that damp tapestried room. Mark my words, George
     Talboys, you've caught a cold; you're as hoarse as a raven. But come along."
Robert Audley took the candle from his friend's hand, and crept back through the secret
     passage, followed by George—very quiet, but scarcely more quiet than usual.
They found Alicia in the nursery waiting for them.
"Well?" she said, interrogatively.
"We managed it capitally. But I don't like the portrait; there's something odd about it."
"There is," said Alicia; "I've a strange fancy on that point. I think that sometimes a
     painter is in a manner inspired, and is able to see, through the normal expression of the face,
     another expression that is equally a part of it, though not to be perceived by common eyes. We
     have never seen my lady look as she does in that picture; but I think that she could
     look so."
"Alicia," said Robert Audley, imploringly, "don't be German!"
"But, Robert—"
"Don't be German, Alicia, if you love me. The picture is—the picture: and my lady is—my lady.
     That's my way of taking things, and I'm not metaphysical; don't unsettle me."
He repeated this several times with an air of terror that was perfectly sincere; and then,
     having borrowed an umbrella in case of being overtaken by the coming storm, left the Court,
     leading passive George Talboys away with him. The one hand of the stupid clock had skipped to
     nine by the time they reached the archway; but before they could pass under its shadow they had
     to step aside to allow a carriage to dash past them. It was a fly from the village, but Lady
     Audley's fair face peeped out at the window. Dark as it was, she could see the two figures of
     the young men black against the dusk.
"Who is that?" she asked, putting out her head. "Is it the gardener?"
"No, my dear aunt," said Robert, laughing; "it is your most dutiful nephew."
He and George stopped by the archway while the fly drew up at the door, and the surprised
     servants came out to welcome their master and mistress.
"I think the storm will hold off to-night," said the baronet looking up at the sky; "but we
     shall certainly have it tomorrow."
