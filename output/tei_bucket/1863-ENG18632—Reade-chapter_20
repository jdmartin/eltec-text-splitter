CHAPTER XIX
WHEN David fell senseless on the floor, Mr. Hardie was somewhat confused by the back-handed
     blow from his convulsed and whirling arm. But Skinner ran to him, held up his head, and whipped
     off his neckcloth.
Then Hardie turned to seize the bell and ring for assistance; but Skinner shook his head and
     said it was useless: this was no faint: old Betty could not help him.
“It is a bad day's work, sir,” said he, trembling: “he is a dead man.”
“Dead? Heaven forbid!”
“Apoplexy!” whispered Skinner.
“Run for a doctor then: lose no time: don't let us have his blood on our hands! Dead?”
And he repeated the word this time in a very different tone, a tone too strange and
     significant to escape Skinner's quick ear. However, he laid David's head gently down and rose
     from his knees to obey.
What did he see now, but Mr. Hardie, with his back turned, putting the notes and bills softly
     into the safe again out of sight. He saw, comprehended, and took his own course with equal
     rapidity.
“Come, run!” cried Mr. Hardie; “I'll take care of him; every moment is precious.”
(“Wants to get rid of me!” thought Skinner.) “No, sir,” said he, “be ruled by me: let us take
     him to his friends: he won't live; and we shall get all the blame if we doctor him.”
Already egotism had whispered Hardie, “How lucky if he should die!” and now a still guiltier
     thought flashed through him: he did not try to conquer it; he only trembled at himself for
     entertaining it.
“At least: give him air!” said he in a quavering voice, consenting to a crime, yet
     compromising with his conscience, feebly.
He threw the window, open with great zeal—with prodigious zeal; for, he wanted to deceive
     himself as well as Skinner. With equal parade he helped carry Dodd to the window; it opened, on
     the ground: this done, the self-deceivers put their heads together, and soon managed matters so
     that two porters, known to Skinner, were introduced into the garden, and informed that a
     gentleman had fallen down in a fit, and they were to take him home to his friends, and not talk
     about it: there might be an inquest, and that was so disagreeable to a gentleman like Mr.
     Hardie. The men agreed at once for a sovereign apiece. It was all done in a great hurry and
     agitation, and while Skinner accompanied the men to see that they did not blab, Mr. Hardie went
     into the garden to breathe and think. But he could do neither.
He must have a look at It.
He stole back, opened the safe, and examined the notes and bills.
He fingered them.
They seemed to grow to his finger.
He lusted after them.
He said to himself, “The matter has gone too far to stop; I must go on borrowing
     this money of the Dodds, and make it the basis of a large fortune: it will be best for all
     parties in the end.”
He put It into his pocket-book; that pocket-book into his breast-pocket; and passed by his
     private door into the house, and to his dressing-room.
Ten minutes later he left the house with a little black bag in his band.
