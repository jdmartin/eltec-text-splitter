CHAPTER XXXIV
SAMPSON'S placard was on Barkington walls, and inside the asylum Alfred was softening hearts
     and buying consciences, as related; so, in fact, he had two strings to his bow.
But mark how strangely things turn; these two strings got entangled. His father, alarmed by
     the placard, had called at the pawnbroker's shop, and told him he must move Alfred directly to
     a London asylum. Baker raised objections; Mr. Hardie crushed them with his purse,
      i.e., with his son's and victim's sweetheart's father's money. So then, as Baker
     after all could not resist the project, but only postpone it for a day or two, he preferred to
     take a handsome present, and cooperate. He even connived at Mr. Hardie's signing the requisite
     name to the new order. This the giddy world calls forgery; but, in these calm retreats, far
     from the public's inquisitive eye, it goes for nothing. Why, Mrs. Archbold had signed Baker's
     name and Dr. Bailey's more than a hundred several times to orders, statements, and
     certificates; depriving Englishmen of their liberty and their property with a gesture of her
     taper fingers; and venting the conventional terms, “Aberration,” “Exaltation,” “Depression,”
     “Debility,” “Paralysis,” “Excitable,” “Abnormal,” as boldly and blindly as any male starling in
     the flock.
On the very night, then, of Alfred's projected escape, two keepers came down from Dr.
     Wycherley's asylum to Silverton station: Baker met them and drove them to Silverton House in
     his dog-cart. They were to take Alfred up by the night train; and, when he came into the
     kitchen with Brown, they suspected nothing, nor did Baker or Cooper, who presently emerged from
     the back kitchen. Brown saw, and recovered his wits partially. “Shall I go for his portmanteau,
     sir?” stammered he, making a shrewd and fortunate guess at what was up. Baker assented; and
     soon after went out to get the horse harnessed. On this Mrs. Archbold, pale, sorrowful, and
     silent hitherto, beckoned Alfred into the back kitchen, and there gave him his watch and his
     loose money. “I took care of them for you,” said she; “for the like have often been stolen in
     this place. Put the money in your shoes; it may be useful to you.”
He thanked her somewhat sullenly; for his disappointment was so deep and bitter that small
     kindnesses almost irritated him.
She sighed. “It is cruel to be angry with me,” she said: “I am not the cause of
     this; it is a heavier blow to me than to you. Sooner or later you will be free—and then you
     will not waste a thought on me, I fear—but I must remain in this odious prison without your
     eyes and your smile to lighten me, yet unable to forget you. Oh, Alfred, for mercy's sake,
     whisper me one kind word at parting; give me one kind look to remember and dote upon.”
She put out both hands as eloquently as she spoke, and overpowered his prudence so far that
     he took her offered hands—they were as cold now as they were burning hot the last time—and
     pressed them, and said—
“I shall be grateful to you while I live.”
The passionate woman snatched her hands away. “Gratitude is too cold for me,” she cried; “I
     scorn even yours. Love me or hate me.”
He made no reply. And so they parted.
“Will you pledge your honour to make no attempt at escape on the road?” asked the pawnbroker
     on his return.
“I'll see you d——d first,” replied the prisoner.
On this he was handcuffed, and helped into the dog-cart.
They went up to town by the midnight train; but, to Alfred's astonishment and delight did not
     take a carriage to themselves.
However, station after station was passed, and nobody came into their carriage. At last they
     stopped at a larger station, and a good many people were on the platform: Alfred took this
     opportunity and appealed in gentle but moving terms to the first good and intelligent face he
     saw. “Sir,” said he, “I implore your assistance.”
The gentleman turned courteously to him. The keepers, to Alfred's surprise, did not
     interrupt.
“I am the victim of a conspiracy, sir; they pretend I am mad: and are taking me by force to a
     madhouse, a living tomb.”
“You certainly don't appear to be mad,” said the gentleman.
The head keeper instantly showed him the order and a copy of the certificates.
“Don't look at them, sir,” cried Alfred; “they are signed by men who were bribed to
     sign them. For pity's sake, sir, judge for yourself. Test my memory, my judgment, by any
     question you please. Use your own good sense; don't let those venal rogues judge for you.”
The gentleman turned cold directly.
“I could not take on me to interfere,” said he. The unsworn affidavits had overpowered his
     senses. He retired with a frigid inclination. Alfred wrung his handcuffed hands, and the
     connecting chain rattled.
The men never complained: his conduct was natural; and they knew their strength. At the next
     station he tested a snob's humanity instead of a gentleman's. He had heard they were more
     tender-hearted. The answer was a broad grin, repeated at intervals.
Being called mad was pretty much the same thing as being mad to a mind of this class: and
     Alfred had admitted he was called mad.
At the next station he implored a silvery-haired old gentleman. Old age, he had heard, has
     known griefs, and learned pity.
The keeper showed the certificates.
“Ah!” said Senex; “poor young man. Now don't agitate yourself. It is all for your good. Pray
     go quietly. Very painful, very painful.” And he hobbled away as fast as he could. It is by
     shirking the painful some live to be silvery old.
Next he tried a policeman. Bobby listened to him erect as a dart.
The certificates were shown him.
He eyed them and said sharply, “All right.” Nor could Alfred's entreaties and appeals to
     common sense attract a word or even a look from him. Alfred cried “Help! murder! If you are
     Englishmen, if you are Christians, help me.”
This soon drew a crowd round him, listening to his fiery tale of wrong, and crying “Shame,
     shame! Let him go.” The keepers touched their heads, winked, and got out and showed the
     certificates; the crowd melted away like wax before those two suns of evidence (unsworn). The
     train moved on.
It was appalling. How could he ever get free? Between his mind and that of his fellows there
     lay a spiritual barrier more impassible than the walls of fortified cities.
Yet, at the very next station, with characteristic tenacity of purpose, he tried again; for
     he saw a woman standing near, a buxom country woman of forty. Then he remembered that the Naked
     Eye was not yet an extinct institution among her sex. He told her his tale, and implored her to
     use her own eyes. She seemed struck, and did eye him far more closely than the men had: and
     told the keepers they ought to be ashamed of themselves; he was no madman, for she had seen
     madmen. They showed her the certificates.
“Oh, I am no scholar!” said she contemptuously; “ye can't write my two eyes out of my
     head.”
The keeper whipped off Alfred's cap and showed his shaven crown.
“La! so he is,” said she, lowering her tone; “dear heart, what a pity. And such a pretty
     young gentleman.” And after that all he could say only drew the dew of patient pity to her
     eyes.
The train went on, and left her standing there, a statue of negative clemency. Alfred lost
     heart. He felt how impotent he was. “I shall die in a madhouse,” he said. He shivered in a
     corner, hating man, and doubting God.
They reached Dr. Wycherley's early in the morning. Alfred was shown into a nice clean
     bedroom, and asked whether he would like to bathe or sleep. “Oh, a bath,” he said; and was
     allowed to bathe himself. He had not been long in the water when Dr. Wycherley's medical
     assistant tapped at the door, and then entered without further ceremony—a young gentleman with
     a longish down on his chin, which, initiated early in the secrets of physiology, he was too
     knowing to shave off and so go to meet his trouble. He came in looking like a machine, with a
     note-book in his hand, and stood by the bath side dictating notes to himself and jotting them
     down.
“Six contusions: two on the thorax, one on the abdomen, two on the thighs, one near the
     patella; turn, please.” Alfred turned in the water. “A slight dorsal abrasion; also of the
     wrists; a severe excoriation of the ankle. Leg-lock, eh?”
“Yes.”
“Iron leg-lock. Head shaved. Large blister. Good! Any other injuries external or internal
     under old system?”
“Yes, sir, confined as a madman though sane, as you, I am sure, have the sense to
     see.”
“Oh, never mind that; we are all sane here—except the governor and I.”
He whipped out, and entered the condition of the new patient's body with jealous minuteness
     in the case-book. As for his mind, he made no inquiry into that: indeed he was little qualified
     for researches of the kind.
At breakfast Alfred sat with a number of mad ladies and gentlemen, who by firmness, kindness,
     and routine, had been led into excellent habits: the linen was clean and the food good. He made
     an excellent meal, and set about escaping: with this view he explored the place. Nobody
     interfered with him; but plenty of eyes watched him. The house was on the non-restraint system.
     He soon found this system was as bad for him as it was good for the insane. Non-restraint
     implied a great many attendants, and constant vigilance. Moreover, the doors were strong, the
     windows opened only eight inches, and that from the top: their framework was iron, painted like
     wood, etc. It was next to impossible to get into the yard at night: and then it looked quite
     impossible to get any further, for the house was encompassed by high walls.
He resigned all hope of escape without connivance. He sounded a keeper; the man fired at the
     first word. “Come, none of that, sir; you should know better than tempt a poor man.”
Alfred coloured to the eyes and sighed deeply. To have honour thrown in his face, and made
     the reason for not aiding him to baffle a dishonourable conspiracy! But he took the reproof so
     sweetly, the man was touched, and by-and-bye, seeing him deeply dejected, said good-naturedly,
     “Don't be down on your luck, sir. If you are really better, which you don't look to have much
     the matter now, why not write to the Commissioners and ask to be let out?”
“Because my letters will be intercepted.”
“Ay, to your friends; but not to the Commissioners of Lunacy. Not in this house, any
     way.”
“God bless you!” cried Alfred impetuously. “You are my benefactor; you are an honest fellow;
     give me your hand.”
“Well, why not? Only you mustn't excite yourself. Take it easy.” (Formula.)
“Oh, no cant among friends!” said Alfred: “wouldn't you be excited at the hope of getting out
     of prison?”
“Well, I don't know but I might. Bound I am as sick of it as you are.”
Alfred got paper and sketched the letter on which so much depended. It took him six hours. He
     tore up two; he cooled down the third, and condensed it severely: by this means, after much
     thought, he produced a close and telling composition. He also weeded it of every trait and
     every term he had observed in mad people's talk, or the letters they had shown him. So there
     was no incoherency, no heat, no prolixity, no “spies,” no “conspiracy,” no italics. A simple,
     honest, earnest story, with bitter truth stamped on every line; a sober, strong appeal from a
     sore heart but hard head to the arbiters of his fate.
To the best of my belief no madman, however slightly touched, or however cunning, ever wrote
     a letter so gentle yet strong, so earnest yet calm, so short yet full, and withal so lucid and
     cleanly jointed as this was. And I am no contemptible judge; for I have accumulated during the
     last few years a large collection of letters from persons deranged in various degrees, and
     studied them minutely, more minutely than most Psychologicals study anything but Pounds,
     Shillings, and Verbiage.
The letter went, and he hoped but scarcely expected an answer by return of post. It did not
     come. He said to his heart, “Be still;” and waited. Another day went by; and another: he gnawed
     his heart and waited: he pined, and waited on. The Secret Tribunal, which was all a shallow
     legislature had left him, “took it easy.” Secret Tribunals always do.
But, while the victim-suitor longed and pined and languished for one sound from the voice of
     Justice and Humanity, and while the Secret Tribunal, not being in prison itself all this time,
     “took it easy,” events occurred at Barkington that bade fair to throw open the prison doors and
     bring father and son, bride and bridegroom, together again under one roof.
But at what a price.
