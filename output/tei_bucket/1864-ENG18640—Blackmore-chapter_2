CHAPTER II.
How that deed was done, I learned at once, and will tell. By whom and why
                            it was done, I have given my life to learn. The evidence laid before the
                            coroner was a cloud and fog of mystery. For days and days my mother lay
                            insensible. Then, for weeks and weeks, she would leap from her bed in
                            fits of terror, stare, and shriek and faint. As for the servants, they
                            knew very little, but imagined a great deal. The only other witnesses
                            were a medical man, a shoemaker, and two London policemen. The servants
                            said that, between one and two in the morning, a clear, wild shriek rang
                            through the house. Large as the building was, this shriek unrepeated
                            awoke nearly all but me. Rushing anyhow forth, they hurried and huddled
                            together at the head of the great staircase, doubting what to do. Some
                            said the cry came one way, some another. Meanwhile Ann Maples, who slept
                            with me in an inner room at the end of a little passage, in the courage
                            of terror went straight to her master and mistress. There, by the light
                            of a dim night-lamp, used to visit me, she saw my mother upright in the
                            bed, and pointing towards my father's breast. My father lay quite still;
                            the bed-clothes were smooth upon him. My mother did not speak. Ann
                            Maples took the lamp, and looked in her master's face. His eyes were
                            open, wide open as in amazement, but the surprise was death. One arm was
                            stiff around his wife, the other lax upon the pillow. As she described
                            it in West-country phrase, "he looked all frore." The woman rushed from
                            the room, and screamed along the passage. The servants ran to her,
                            flurried and haggard, each afraid to be left behind. None except the
                            butler dared to enter. Whispering and trembling they peered in after
                            him, all ready to run away. Thomas Kenwood loved his master dearly,
                            being his foster-brother. He at once removed the bedclothes, and found
                            the fatal wound. So strongly and truly was it dealt, that it pierced the
                            centre of my dear father's heart. One spot of blood and a small
                            three-cornered hole was all that could be seen. The surgeon, who came
                            soon after, said that the weapon must have been a very keen and
                            finely-tempered dagger, probably of foreign make. The murderer must have
                            been quite cool, and well acquainted with the human frame. Death
                            followed the blow on the instant, without a motion or a groan. In my
                            mother's left hand strongly clutched was a lock of long, black, shining
                            hair. A curl very like it, but rather finer, lay on my father's bosom.
                            In the room were no signs of disorder, no marks of forcible
                            entrance.
One of the maids, a timid young thing, declared that soon after the
                            stable-clock struck twelve, she had heard the front balusters creak; but
                            as she was known to hear this every night, little importance was
                            attached to it. The coroner paid more attention to the page (a sharp
                            youth from London), who, being first in the main corridor, after the
                            cry, saw, or thought he saw, a moving figure, where the faint starlight
                            came in at the oriel window. He was the more believed, because he owned
                            that he durst not follow it. But no way of escape could be discovered
                            there, and the eastern window was strongly barred betwixt the mullions.
                            No door, no window was anywhere found open.
Outside the house, the only trace was at one remarkable spot. The time
                            had been chosen well. It was a hard black frost, without, as yet, any
                            snow. The ground was like iron, and an Indian could have spied no trail.
                            But at this one spot, twenty-five yards from the east end of the house,
                            and on the verge of a dense shrubbery, a small spring, scarcely visible,
                            oozed among the moss. Around its very head, it cleared, and kept, a
                            narrow space quite free from green, and here its margin was a thin coat
                            of black mineral mud, which never froze. This space, at the broadest,
                            was but two feet and ten inches across from gravel to turf, yet now it
                            held two distinct footprints, not of some one crossing and re-crossing,
                            but of two successive steps leading from the house into the shrubbery.
                            These footprints were remarkable; the one nearest the house was of the
                            left foot, the other of the right. Each was the impression of a long,
                            light, and pointed boot, very hollow at the instep. But they differed in
                            thisâ€”the left footprint was plain and smooth, without mark of nail, or
                            cue, or any other roughness; while the right one was clearly stamped in
                            the centre of the sole with a small rectangular cross. This mark seemed
                            to have been made by a cruciform piece of metal, or some other hard
                            substance, inlaid into the sole. At least, so said a shoemaker, who was
                            employed to examine it; and he added that the boots were not those of
                            the present fashion, what he called "duck's bills" being then in vogue.
                            This man being asked to account for the fact of the footprints being so
                            close together, did so very easily, and with much simplicity. It was
                            evident, he said, that a man of average stature, walking rapidly, would
                            take nearly twice that distance in every stride; but here the verge of
                            the shrubbery, and the branches striking him in the face, had suddenly
                            curtailed the step. And to this, most likely, and not to any hurry or
                            triumph, was to be ascribed the fact that one so wily and steadfast did
                            not turn back and erase the dangerous tokens. Most likely, he did not
                            feel what was beneath his feet, while he was battling with the tangle
                            above.
Be that as it may, there the marks remained, like the blotting-paper of
                            his crime. Casts of them were taken at once, and carefully have they
                            been stored by me.
The shoemaker, a shrewd but talkative man, said unasked that he had never
                            seen such boots as had left those marks, since the "Young Squire" (he
                            meant Mr. Edgar Vaughan) went upon his travels. For this gratuitous
                            statement, he was strongly rebuked by the coroner.
For the rest, all that could be found out, after close inquiry, was, that
                            a stranger darkly clad had been seen by the gamekeepers, in a copse some
                            half-mile from the house, while the men were beating for woodcocks on
                            the previous day. He did not seem to be following my father, and they
                            thought he had wandered out of the forest road. He glided quickly away,
                            before they could see his features, but they knew that he was tall and
                            swarthy. No footprints were found in that ride like those by the
                            shrubbery spring.
I need not say what verdict the coroner's jury found.
