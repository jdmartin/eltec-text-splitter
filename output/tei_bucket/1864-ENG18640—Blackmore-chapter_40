CHAPTER IV.
Is there any Mocha stone, fortification agate, or Scotch pebble, with
                            half the veins and mottlings, angles, flux and reflux, that chequer one
                            minute of the human mind? Was ever machine invented to throw so many
                            shuttles?
At present I am gauged for little threads of thought—two minutes since,
                            the smallest thing I could think of was myself. Now it is the largest.
                            Must I grope from room to room, shall I never be sure where the table
                            is, where my teacup stands; never read, or write, or draw; never tell
                            when my hands are clean, except by smelling soap; never know (though
                            small the difference) how my dress becomes me, or when my hair is right;
                            never see my own sad face, in which I have been fool enough to glory,
                            never—and this is worst of all—never catch another's smile?
Here am I, a full-grown girl, full of maiden's thoughts and wonderings,
                            knowing well that I am shaped so but to be a link in life; must I never
                            think of loving or of being loved, except with love like Isola's; sweet
                            affection, very sweet; but white sugar only?
When my work is over, and my object gained, when my father's spirit knows
                            the wrong redeemed, as a child I used to think I would lay me down and
                            die. But since I came to woman's fulness, since I ceased to look at men
                            and they began to look at me, some soft change, I know not what, has
                            come across my dream.
Is my purpose altered? Is my tenor broken? Not a whit of either. Rather
                            are they stronger set and better led, as my heart and brain enlarge. Yet
                            I see beyond it all, a thing I never used to see, a glow above the peaks
                            of hate, a possibility of home. "Saw" I should have said, for now what
                            have I to do with seeing?
On the fourteenth morning, I had given up all hope. They told me it was
                            bright and sunny; for I always asked about the weather, and felt most
                            cruelly depressed upon a sunny day. By this time I had learned to dress
                            without Mrs. Shelfer's aid. Still, from force of habit I went to the
                            glass to do my hair, and still drew back, as far as was allowed, the
                            window curtain.
Off with my wet bandage, I am sick of it; let me try no longer to delude
                            myself.
Suddenly a gleam of light, I am sure of it; faint indeed, and like a Will
                            of the Wisp; but I am quite sure it was a gleam of light. I go nearer
                            the window and try again. No, there is no more for the present, it was
                            the sudden change produced it. Never mind; I know what I have seen, a
                            thing that came and cheated me in dreams; this time it has not cheated
                            me; it was a genuine twinkle of the sun.
I can do nothing more. I cannot put another stitch upon me. I am
                            thrilling with the sun, like Memnon. I fall upon my knees, and thank the
                            Father of light.
When the Doctor came that day, and looked into my eyes, he saw a decided
                            change.
"Miss Valence, the crisis is over. With all my heart I congratulate you.
                            Another fortnight, and you will see better than ever."
I laughed, and wept, and, blind as I was, could hardly keep from dancing.
                            Then I wanted to kiss the Doctor, but hearing Mrs. Shelfer's step, made
                            a reckless jump and had it out upon her.
"Bless me, why bless me, my good soul, if I was a young gentleman
                            now—"
"Why, Miss Valence, I am perfectly astonished," said Doctor Franks, but I
                            knew he was laughing; "if I had been requested, only two minutes ago, to
                            pick out the most self-possessed, equable, and courageous young lady in
                            London, I should have said, 'I don't want any looking, I know where to
                            find her,' but now, upon my word—"
"If you are asked to point out the most delighted, grateful, and happy
                            girl in London, you know where to come for her. Let me kiss you, Dr.
                            Franks, only once. I won't rob your daughters. It is to you I owe it
                            all."
"No, to Providence, and yourself, and an uncommonly good conjunctiva. Now
                            be prudent, my dear child; a little ecstasy must be forgiven; but don't
                            imperil your cure by over-excitement. It is, as I hoped it would be, a
                            case of epiphytic sloughing" (I think that was what he said), "and it
                            may become chronic if precipitated. The longer and more thorough the
                            process, the less chance of recurrence."
"Oh I am satisfied with one eye, or half an eye. Can you promise me
                            that?"
"If you will only follow my directions, I can promise you both eyes, more
                            brilliant than ever; and Mrs. Shelfer says they were wonderfully bright.
                            But what I order must be done. Slow and sure."
He gave me short directions, all upon the same principle, that of
                            graduation.
"And now, Miss Valence, good-bye. Henceforth I visit you only as a
                            friend; in which I know you will indulge me, from the interest I feel in
                            the case, and in yourself. Mrs. Shelfer's wonderful young lady may be
                            admitted on Thursday; but don't let her look at your eyes. Girls are
                            always inquisitive. If there is any young gentleman, lucky enough to
                            explain your strange anxiety to see, you will make short work of him,
                            when your sight returns. Your eyes will be the most brilliant in London;
                            which is saying a great deal. But I fear he will hardly know you, till
                            your lashes grow; and all your face and expression are altered for the
                            time."
"One thing will never alter, though it can find no expression, my
                            gratitude to you."
"That is very pretty of you, my dear child. You kissed me just now. Now
                            let me kiss you."
He touched my forehead and was gone. He was the first true gentleman I
                            had met with, since the loss of Farmer Huxtable.
