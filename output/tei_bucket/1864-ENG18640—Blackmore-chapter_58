CHAPTER IV.
The bailiff's discovery, and the pursuit commenced thereon, appeared to
                            me so important, that in reply to the message received the next
                            morning—that my uncle was much the same, and longing for my return—I
                            sent word that my journey was put off until the day after the morrow.
                            This allowed me one day more for tidings from my new scouts, as to the
                            success of their efforts. I was very sorry to disappoint my poor sick
                            uncle, but it seemed still worse to run away all in the dark.
The next thing I did was to arrange with Mrs. Shelfer about the money I
                            had paid for her. It was not the money I cared for, but I had other
                            views. Although she was politely thankful, I perceived that she thought
                            it a very bad job indeed, and a most romantic transaction. Thirty per
                            cent. was the very largest dividend she had ever intended to pay. But
                            the plan which I proposed was so much for her benefit, while it suited
                            me, who otherwise must have lost the money, that it almost recovered her
                            from the shock of having paid a debt. The plan was simply this, that she
                            should reserve my rooms for me, airing and cleaning them duly, and
                            always keeping the bed in a fit state to be slept on at an hour's
                            notice. My previous rent had been twelve shillings a week, the utmost I
                            could afford out of my narrow income; attendance, and linen, and other
                            troubles being now dispensed with, I thought it fair to allow her ten
                            shillings off her debt to me, for every week I should so retain the
                            rooms. The 4*l.* for the expenses of the execution I forgave her
                            altogether; inasmuch as I had paid without consulting her. Directly my
                            payment should be exhausted, to wit in twenty weeks, I would send her a
                            further sum, if I still required the rooms.
She was delighted with this arrangement, which in fact enabled her to
                            have her "sticks" all to herself, to pet them and talk to them every
                            day, and even to clean them, if such a freak of destruction ever should
                            enter her brain. She could use the sitting-room for her own pleasure and
                            pride, as much as ever she chose, so long as it always was ready for me;
                            and already visions were passing before her mind's eye, of letting the
                            parlour downstairs with the onion-room for its dormitory. To me the
                            arrangement was very convenient, as affording a fixed and familiar
                            resort in London, and a pivot of ready communication. Nor was it a small
                            consolation to feel that I still retained a stronghold in the
                            neighbourhood of dear friends.
All this being comfortably settled, Giudice and I went forth to pay our
                            visit in Lucas Street. The whole of that street we found so utterly
                            changed in appearance by a vigorous onset of painters, grainers, and
                            decorators, that it was not easy to know the house we were in quest of.
                            Even the numbers on the doors, which had been illegible, or very nearly
                            so, had now been re-arranged and painted over again upon the fashionable
                            and very sensible mode of marking odd numerals on one side, and even
                            ones on the other. Finding myself in a difficulty, and the houses all
                            alike as the central peas of a pod, I trusted to Judy's delicate nose,
                            and rang the bell of the door at which he halted. Then he drew back, and
                            trembled, and crouched upon the pavement, to wait for my return. As I
                            heard the tinkle, my heart began to flutter: who could tell what new
                            phase of my life might begin with that little pull? After some delay,
                            poor old Cora came, looking as weird and woebegone as ever—fierce would
                            have been that look to any one but me. I knew that I held her by my
                            magic gordit, like the slave of the lamp. After imploring in some
                            mumbled words (which I interpreted only by knowledge of her desire)
                            gracious leave to kiss that potent charm, she led me into the
                            breakfast-parlour, where I found sweet Isola in a passionate flood of
                            tears.
At sight of me, her beautiful smile broke through them, and her quick
                            deep sobs spent themselves in kisses.
"Oh, I am so gug-gug-glad, my own dear Cla-Cla-Clara; and I won't
                            cuc-cuc-cry one bit more, the moment I can stop."
She put her arms around me, and her head upon my breast, as if I had
                            been, at the very least, her brother.
"My pretty dear, what is it all about?"
I had never seen her look so lovely as now, her violet eyes brimming with
                            liquid brightness, the velvet of her cheeks deepened to rich carmine,
                            and the only thing that sweet face ever wanted, the expression of
                            earnest feeling, now radiant through the whole.
"Why, dear, I ought not to tell you; but I must tell somebody, or my
                            heart will break."
Here she pressed her little hand on that pure unfissured casket, where
                            sorrow was as yet an undreamed-of robber.
"You know, dear, it's all about papa and my darling Conny. The only
                            trouble I ever have, but a very great one, big enough and too big for
                            two little folk of my size. Half an hour ago, I went in suddenly to get
                            a book upon the politico-economical science, the very one papa is
                            lecturing about so beautifully; and I did not even know that Conny was
                            in the house. There papa was, white as death with passion; and Conrad
                            with his eyes like coals of sparkling fire; and what do you suppose my
                            papa called his own son Conny?"
"Don't tell me, if it's anything bad. I can't bear it, Isola."
"Oh, I knew you were fond of him, and I am so glad!"
This she said in such an artless way—as if Conrad and I were two dolls
                            which she meant to put in one doll's house—that instead of colouring, I
                            actually laughed.
"Oh, but I must tell you, Clara: it's right for you to know; one of the
                            leading principles of political economy—"
"Don't talk to me of that stuff."
"Well, I won't; because I see that you don't understand it. But he
                            actually called him—and his voice came from a depth, like an Artesian
                            well—he called our darling Conny—"
"What?" And in my passion, I flung off her hand, and stood up.
"A low bastard, a renegade hound, a scandal to his country—and then he
                            even said Rimbecco."
She pronounced the last word almost with a scream, as an insult beyond
                            forgiveness. What it meant I did not ask, I had heard enough
                            already.
"I must leave this house. Where is your brother Conrad?"
"Gone, I believe, to inquire for you. Nothing but that composes him. I
                            wish he would never come here. And he was ordered not to. But it is
                            about some business. Oh, he never will come again." And she began to cry
                            at the thought of the very thing she had wished for.
"Neither will I come again. Where is your father now?"
"Up at his lumbering cabinet, where he always consoles himself, whenever
                            he is put out. But if you are going, dear child, do let me come with
                            you. I shall cry till I die here, all by myself: and Pappy never cares
                            about me, when he is in his black dudgeon."
In a few minutes we left the rude unpleasant house, and even Judy seemed
                            relieved to get away from the door. By the time we reached Mrs.
                            Shelfer's, Idols was in capital spirits again, and pressed me for some
                            account of the wonderful wealth, and the grand house she had heard of.
                            No doubt this rumour had found its way through Ann Maples.
"And the great Lord—what's his name, dear Donna? I wouldn't believe a
                            word of it; though I'm sure you are a deal too good for all the house of
                            peers. But Conny did; and wasn't he in a way? But he ought to be very
                            glad you know—wish you every blessing, as they say in the plays; and a
                            peer is the very highest blessing to an Englishwoman. But one thing I am
                            quite resolved on: Judy belongs to me now, don't you, lovely Judy?"
"No," said the judicious, "I belong to Clara."
"Though Conny pretends, since he was left at your place, that he belongs
                            to him. Now I will give him to you; and so will Conny too. You can
                            afford to keep him now, and I can't, he does eat such a lot; and he does
                            not care a pin for me, but he loves you with all his heart."
"How do you know he does?" I was not attending much, but thinking of some
                            one else.
"Why, can't you see that he does, how he wags his tail every time you
                            even look at him? But I hope poor Conny is here. I should think he would
                            stop, when he finds darling Clara come back."
I had jumped to that hope long ago, before we even left Lucas Street, and
                            that had something to do with my walking so fast.
No, he was not there, he had not been there to-day. It was my turn now to
                            cry; what might he not have done, after that fearful insult, and from
                            his own father too?
The tears, which I confided to no one except the wooden-legged
                            blackbird—for Giudice would have made such a fuss about them—were still
                            upon my cheeks, when I heard the well-known step—not half so elastic as
                            usual. I fled into my bedroom, and pushed the boxes about, to make a
                            goodly noise, and to account for the colour in my face. Then out I came
                            at the side-door, and ran downstairs perversely, though I knew that
                            Conrad and Isola were in my sitting-room.
But this first-rate manoeuvre only outwitted its author, for Isola ran
                            down after me, and sent me upstairs alone. All my little nonsense
                            vanished the moment I looked in Conrad's face. His healthy brown
                            complexion was faded to an opal white; beneath his eyes such dark blue
                            rims, that I thought he had spectacles on; and on either cheek a round
                            red spot was burning. So shocked I was, that when he took my hand, I
                            turned my face away and smothered down a sob. I felt that I had no right
                            to be so fresh and blooming. Nor was it only in health that the contrast
                            between us lay. I was dressed with unusual care, having fidgeted all the
                            morning, and with my utmost taste. Poor Conrad was in his working
                            clothes, full of marble dust, tumbled, threadbare, and even in need of
                            mending; his hair swept anyhow, and his hands not over-lately washed.
                            Yet, for all that, he was as clearly a gentleman, as I was a lady.
Not so would he have been arrayed, I fancy, had he thought to see neat
                            Clara. And yet, who knows? "I trust that you will excuse me," he began
                            to say, "but such things have happened lately—you will not account me
                            rude—I had no sense at all of this great pleasure."
"I fear you have not been very happy." I knew not what to say, or how to
                            keep my voice clear.
"Yes," he replied, "as happy as I deserve. It serves me aright for
                            esteeming so much of myself, before that I do anything. But I will win
                            my way"—and his own proud glance flashed out—"and we shall see how many
                            will scorn me then."
"No one in the world can scorn you," I said very softly, and my voice
                            thrilled through him.
"Ah, you are always kind and gentle:"—am I though, thought I—"but I will
                            no more fatigue you with my different lot in life. I am told that some
                            great nobleman has won you for his own. Perhaps you will give me an
                            order."
His throat was swelling with these bitter words, and he looked at his
                            dusty clothes. Somewhat rude I thought him, but I knew not half his
                            troubles.
"Whoever told you that, has made a great mistake. I am engaged to no one.
                            Your sister knows me better." And I turned away to the window. For a
                            minute he said nothing; but I could hear his heart beat. Stedfastly I
                            looked at the cheesemonger's shop. Oh for a flower, or something on the
                            balcony!
Presently he came round the corner of the sofa. Without being rude, I
                            could not help turning round.
His face was much, much, brighter, and his eyes more kind.
"Have I said any harm—I would not for the world—I knew not it was
                            harm."
"No harm," I said, "to think so ill of me! To believe, for a single
                            moment, that because I am not so poor, I would go and forsake—at least,
                            I mean, forget—any one I cared for!"
"Can I ever hope, if I serve you all my life, that you will ever care for
                            me?"
"Don't you know I do?" And I burst into my violent flood.
When I came to myself, both his arms were round me, and I was looking up
                            at his poor sick face, my hair quite full of marble chips, and he was
                            telling me with glad tears in his eyes, which he never took from mine,
                            how he cared for nothing now, not for all the world, not for glory or
                            fur shame, so long as I only loved him.
"With all my heart and soul," I whispered, "him and no one else whatever,
                            whether in life or death."
All the folly we went through I am not going to repeat, though I remember
                            well every atom of it. Let the wise their wisdom keep, we are babes and
                            sucklings. Neither of us had ever loved before, or ever meant to love
                            again, except of course each other, and that should be for ever.
"One thing I must tell you, my own sweet love, and yet I fear to do it.
                            But you are not like other girls. There is no one like you, nor has
                            there ever been. I think you will not scorn me for another's fault."
"Of course I won't, my own pet Conny. What is this awful thing?"
"I am an illegitimate son."
One moment I sprang from him; the next I despised myself. But in spite of
                            all my troubles, there still lurked in my heart the narrow pride of
                            birth. Down to the earth it fell beneath the foot of true love, and I
                            kissed away from his eyes the mingled reproach and sorrow, assuring him
                            that at least he should have a legitimate wife.
To make amends, I leaned upon him one moment, and put my hand on his
                            shoulder, and let him play awhile with the dark shower of my hair.
"Darling Conny, you have told me yours, now you shall hear my secret.
                            Only promise me you will give tit for tat. You say you loved me ever
                            since you saw me first; then you must have loved your Clara when you
                            saved her life."
"What do you mean, my Clara? Those low ruffians in the Park were not
                            going to kill you."
"No, dearest; I don't mean that at all. But there's a kiss for that, I
                            have owed it you ever since. But what I mean no kisses can repay; no,
                            nor a life of love. You saved a life worth fifty of my own."
Some dark alarm was growing in his eyes, on which I gazed with vague
                            increasing terror.
"Why, dearest, it is nothing. Only your own Clara is not Clara Valence;
                            you must call her 'Clara Vaughan.'"
With actual violence he thrust me from his arms, and stood staring at me,
                            while I trembled from head to foot; his face was one scarlet flame.
"And pray, Sir, what harm have I done? Am I to suppose that you"—special
                            emphasis meant for illegitimacy—"that you are ashamed of my father and
                            me?"
"Yes, I am. Accursed low licentious race! If you knew what you have done,
                            you would tear your heart out rather than give it to me."
"Thank you—I feel obliged—my heart indeed—to a bastard. Take back your
                            ring if you please; kindly restore me mine. May I trouble you for room
                            enough to go by?"
And I swept out of the room, and through the side-door into my bed-room,
                            where I crouched in a corner, with both hands on my heart, and the whole
                            world gone away. "Mad!" I heard him cry, "yes, I must go mad at last!"
                            Away he rushed from the house, and I fell upon the bed, and lay in fits
                            till midnight.
