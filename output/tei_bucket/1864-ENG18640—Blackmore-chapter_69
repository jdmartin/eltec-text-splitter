CHAPTER XV. EDGAR VAUGHAN's STORY CONTINUED. 
Before my own and only love departed, she knew, thank God, she knew as
                            well as I did, that I had never wronged her pure and true affection. But
                            it was long before I learned what had so distressed her. Though she
                            appeared quite sensible, and looked at me, every now and then, with the
                            same reproachful harrowing gaze, it seemed to me ages, it must have been
                            hours, before she could frame her thoughts in words. In an agony of
                            suspense for her, for our children, for our love, I could hardly repress
                            my impatience even at her debility. Many a time she opened her trembling
                            lips, but the words died on them. At last I caught her meaning from a
                            few broken sentences.
"How could he do it? How could he so betray her? And his own Lily that
                            loved him so—no, she must not be Lily any more, she was only Fiordalisa
                            Della Croce. How could he come and pretend to love her, and pretend to
                            marry her, when all the while he had a young wife at home in England?
                            Never would she have believed it but for the proofs, the proofs that
                            hateful man had shown her. How could he shame his own love so, and his
                            children, and the aged father—there was no hope for her but to die—to
                            die and never see him more; and then perhaps he would be sorry, for he
                            must care about her a little."
Then she burst into such a torrent of tears, and pressed both hands on
                            her bounding heart, and grew white with terror. Then as the palpitation
                            passed, she looked at me and knew me, and crept close to me, forgetting
                            all the evil,—and seemed to sleep awhile. Of course I saw what it was;
                            dazed as I was and wild at her sorrow and danger, I slowly perceived
                            what it was. The serpent-like foe had been there, and had hissed in her
                            ear what he thought to be true—that I had done her a dastard's wrong;
                            had won her passionate maiden love, and defiled her by a sham marriage,
                            while my lawful wife was living.
When once I knew my supposed offence, it did not take long to explain the
                            murderer's error, an error which had sprung from my own deceit. But my
                            children, where are my children, Lily?
In her ecstatic joy, she could not think for the moment even of her
                            children; but pressed me to her tumultuous heart, as if I were all she
                            wanted. Then she began to revile herself, for daring to believe any ill
                            of her noble husband.
"And even if it had been true, which you know it never could be, dear,—I
                            must have forgiven you, sweetest darling, because you couldn't have
                            helped it, you did love me so, didn't you?"
This sweet womanly logic, you, Clara, may comprehend—But where are the
                            children, my Lily?
"Oh, in bed I suppose, dear: let me get up, we must go and kiss the
                            darlings. When I first came in, I could not bear to go near them, poor
                            pets; but now—Oh my heart, holy Madonna, my heart!"
She leaped up as if she were shot, and a choking sound rose in her
                            throat.. Her fresh youth fought hard in the clutches of death. "Oh save
                            me, my own husband, save me. Hold me tighter; I cannot die yet. So young
                            and so happy with you. It is gone; but the next pang is death. Hold me
                            so till it comes again. God bless you, my own for ever. You will find me
                            in heaven, won't you? You can never forget your own Lily."
Her large eyes rested on mine, as they did when she first owned her love;
                            and her soul seemed trying to spring into the breast of mine. Closer to
                            me she clung, but with less and less of strength. Her smooth, clear
                            cheek was on mine, her exhausted heart on my wild one. I felt its last
                            throb, as the death-pang came, and she tried to kiss me to show that it
                            was not violent. Frantic, I opened my lips, and received the last breath
                            of hers.
The crush of its anguish her heart might have borne, but not the rebound
                            of its joy.
Her body, the fairest the sun ever saw, was laid beside her father's in
                            the little churchyard at St. Katharine's, with the toy baby on her
                            breast; her soul, the most loving and playful that ever the angels
                            visited, is still in attendance upon me, and mourns until mine rejoins
                            it.
You have heard my greatest but not my only distress. For more than three
                            months, my reason forsook me utterly. I recognised no one, not even
                            myself, but sought high and low for my Lily. At night I used to wander
                            forth and search among the olive-trees, where we so often roved:
                            sometimes the form I knew so well would seem to flit before me, tempting
                            me on from bole to bole, and stretching vain hands towards me. Then as I
                            seemed to have overtaken and brought to bay her coyness, with a faint
                            shriek she would vanish into hazy air. Probably I owed these visions to
                            capricious memory, gleaming upon old hexameters of the Eton clink. True
                            from false I knew not, neither cared to know: everything I did seemed to
                            be done in sleep, with all the world around me gone to sleep as well.
                            One vague recollection I retain of going somewhere, to do something that
                            made me creep with cold. This must have been the funeral of my lost one;
                            when the Corsicans, as I am told, fled from my ghastly stare, and would
                            only stand behind me. They are a superstitious race, and they feared the
                            "evil eye."
All the time I was in this state, faithful Petro waited on me, and
                            watched me like a father. He sent for his wife, old Marcantonia, who was
                            famed for her knowledge of herbs and her power over the witches, who now
                            beyond all doubt had gotten me in possession. Decoctions manifold she
                            gave me at the turn of the moon, and hung me all over with amulets, till
                            I rang like a peal of cracked bells. In spite of all these sovereign
                            charms, Lepardo might at any time have murdered me, if he had thought me
                            happy enough to deserve it. Perhaps he was in some other land, making
                            sure of my children's lives.
Poor helpless darlings, all that was left me of my Lily, as yet I did not
                            know that even they were taken. Petro told me afterwards that I had
                            asked for them once or twice, in a vacant wondering manner, but had been
                            quite content with some illusory answer.
It was my Lily, and no one else, who brought me back to conscious life.
                            What I am about to tell may seem to you a feeble brain's chimera; and so
                            it would appear to me, if related by another. But though my body was
                            exhausted by unsleeping sorrow, under whose strain the mental chords had
                            yielded, yet I assure you that what befell me did not flow from but
                            swept aside both these enervations.
It is the Corsican's belief, that those whom he has deeply mourned, and
                            desolately missed, are allowed to hover near him in the silent night.
                            Then sometimes, when he is sleeping, they will touch his lids and say,
                            "Weep no more, beloved one: in all, except thy sorrow, we are blessed as
                            thou couldst wish." Or sometimes, if the parting be of still more tender
                            sort, (as between two lovers, or a newly wedded couple) in the depth of
                            darkness when the lone survivor cannot sleep for trouble, appears the
                            lost one at the chamber door, holds it open, and calls softly; "Dearest,
                            come; for I as well am lonely." Having thrice implored, it waves its
                            cerements like an angel's wing, and awaits the answer. Answer not, if
                            you wish to live; however the sweet voice thrills your heart, however
                            that heart is breaking. But if you truly wish to die, and hope is
                            quenched in memory; make answer to the well-known voice. Within three
                            days you will be dead, and flit beside the invoking shadow.
Perhaps old Marcantonia had warned me of this appeal, and begged me to
                            keep silence, which for my children's sake I was bound to do. All I know
                            is that one night towards the end of January, I lay awake as usual,
                            thinking—if a mind distempered thus can think—of my own sweet Lily. All
                            the evening I had sought her among the olive-trees, and at St.
                            Katharine's Church, and even on the sad sea-shore by the moaning of the
                            waves. Now the winter moon was high, and through the embrasured window,
                            the far churchyard that held my wife, and the silver sea beyond it,
                            glimmered like the curtain of another world. Sitting up in the widowed
                            bed, with one hand on my aching forehead—for now I breathed perpetual
                            headache—I called in question that old church of one gay wedding and two
                            dark funerals. Was there any such church at all; was it not a dream of
                            moonlight and the phantom love?
Even as I sat gazing now, so on many a moonlight night sat my Lily gazing
                            with me, whispering of her father's grave, and looking for it in the
                            shrouded distance. Her little hand used to quiver in mine, as she
                            declared she had found it; and her dark eyes had so wondrous a gift of
                            sight, that I never would dare to deny, though I could not quite believe
                            it. Had she not in the happy days, when we roamed on the beach together,
                            waiting for the yacht and pretending to seek shells, had she not then
                            told me the stripes and colours of the sailors' caps, and even the names
                            of the men on deck, when I could hardly see their figures?
Ah, could she tell my own name now, could she descry me from that shore
                            which mocks the range of telescope, and the highest lens of thought; was
                            she permitted one glimpse of him from whom in life she could hardly bear
                            to withdraw those gentle eyes? Answer me, my own, in life and death my
                            own one; tell me that you watch and love me, though it be but now and
                            then, and not enough to break the by-laws of the disembodied world.
Calmly as I now repeat it, but in a low melodious tone, sweeter than any
                            mortal's voice, a tone that dwelt I knew not where, like the sighing of
                            the night-wind, came this answer to me:
"True love, for our children's sake, and mine who watch and love you
                            still, quit this grief, the spirit's grave. All your sorrow still is
                            mine, and would you vex your darling, when you cannot comfort her?
                            Though you see me now no more, I am with you more than ever; I am your
                            image and your shadow. At every sigh of yours, I shiver; your smiles are
                            all my sunshine. Let me feel some sunshine, sweetest; you know how I
                            used to love it, and as yet you have sent me none. I shall look for some
                            to-morrow. Lo I, for ever yours, am smiling on you now."
And a golden light, richer than any sunbeam, rippled through the room. I
                            knew the soft gleam like the sunset on a harvest-field. It was my Lily's
                            smile. A glow of warmth was shed on me, and I fell at once into a deep
                            and dreamless sleep. You, my child, who have never known such loss—pray
                            God you never may—very likely you regard all this incident as a dream.
                            Be it so: if it were a dream, Lily's angel brought it.
