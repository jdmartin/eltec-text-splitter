CHAPTER VI.
To our surprise and delight, the genuine Papa, instead of being worse the
                            next day, looked more like himself than he had done at any time since
                            the fever. But in spite of added importance, and the sense of parental
                            dignity, he sat hand in hand with his beautiful daughter by the hour
                            together, playing with her cheeks and hair, as little girls do with
                            dollies. And all the time he was talking to her about her darling
                            mother, and made her answer him in Italian, and made her kiss him every
                            other minute; and found out a thousand times, as a novelty every time,
                            that she was the very image and model of her mother, and yet he was not
                            sure that her smile was quite so sweet; then to make up for depreciation
                            he needs must kiss her again, and say, yes, he thought it was, though it
                            was quite impossible for any other to be so—and thus they went on, till
                            I thought there never would be an end of it; albeit I did my utmost to
                            keep away from them both.
Knowing that I was in their way, and feeling rather out of spirits, I
                            went my old accustomed round of places, sacred in my memory to a certain
                            father and mother of my own. How long I wept at their simple graves, how
                            I knelt to their God and mine, thanking Him from my desolate heart for
                            the light now shed upon me, and how I prayed that they might both be
                            looking down on me now and craving heavenly guidance for me through the
                            peril yet to come—these, and the rest of my doings there, cannot well be
                            told except to the ears of orphans. The clouds of an overcast existence
                            seemed to be opening rapidly, and though they could never disclose my
                            sun and moon again, some happiness it was to know even how those had
                            set. And more than all, the foul aspersion upon my father's memory,
                            which all the while I scorned it so, had lain heavily on my thoughts,
                            this was now proved liar's spittle, and my sweet darling father had
                            offended not even a villain. A thousand times I implored his pardon for
                            the splash having ever descended upon the hem of my garment, though
                            shaken off straight-way with loathing.
In the midst of my dreamy thoughts, and while I sat between the two low
                            headstones, upon the very spot where I hope my own head may lie, the
                            tremulous beauty of the Golden Thuja, which I had planted there, was
                            pushed aside too carelessly, and something far more beautiful planted
                            itself in front. It was my cousin Lily. I have been strictly forbidden
                            ever to call her "Isola," or even "Idols," again, as savouring of the
                            evil one. Lily Vaughan was beaming with young delight and happiness: the
                            fresh west country air, sweet from the tropic gulf-stream, had crowned
                            the April of her cheeks with a June of roses.
"Oh, Donna, I am so glad I have found you at last. What makes you run
                            away from me and my Papa? I have lost my way all over the world. What a
                            lovely world it is, Donna!"
"Don't call me that name here. Do you not see where you stand?"
She glanced at the headstones engraved with initials and dates, and at
                            once understood it all. For a long time she was silent, a long time I
                            mean for her; and her soft eyes glistened at once with awe and pity. At
                            last, she crept close to me, looked at the ground, and whispered with a
                            deep sigh:
"How you must hate me, Clara."
"Hate you, my darling! What for?"
"Oh, because I have got such a dear Papa, and you have none at all. And
                            much worse than that, because—because—oh, I don't know how to tell
                            you."
"Tell me all you mean. Let there be no misunderstanding between us."
"Because my mother and my father seem somehow to have killed—though I am
                            sure they would rather have killed themselves—your poor papa and mamma."
                            And she leaned on my mother's headstone, and sobbed till I feared for
                            her heart.
I put my arm around her waist, drew her towards me, and sat on my
                            father's grave, with his niece upon my lap.
"Dearest, I could not be the child of those who sleep beneath us, if it
                            were in my nature now to feel as you imagine. Years ago, I might have
                            done so; though I hope not even then. Orphan as I am and helpless,
                            already I perceive that I have not lived for nothing. My father, I
                            believe, my mother, I am sure, would have laid down life with pleasure
                            to see me led from wayward childhood even to what I am. Oh, Lily, you
                            can't think how they loved me." And at the tender memory, came tears,
                            the voice of silence.
Lily said not a word, but gathered and plaited a wreath of flowers,
                            wherewith, as in a nuptial tie, she bound the white headstones
                            together—anything so as not to disturb me just then. Even that trifle, a
                            graceful idea born of her Southern origin, even that for the moment
                            touched me deeply. Times there are when our souls seem to have taken hot
                            baths in the springs of memory, and every pore of them is open.
"Darling Lily, come—how proud they would have been of you—come and kiss
                            me in this presence, and promise that, whatever happens, none shall ever
                            thrust cold hands between your heart and mine. That we will bear, and
                            trust, and love; nor, if a shadow steals between us, blink it till the
                            substance follows, but be frank and open—the very breath of
                            friendship—and when doubt begins to grow, for the devil is sure to sow
                            it, have it plucked away at once, each by the other's hand. Kiss me,
                            dear; your weakness is that you are not so outspoken as I am. Never let
                            me vex you, without knowing it."
The innocent creature kissed me, and promised solemnly.
"Oh, Clara," she cried, "how on earth did you find it out? Sometimes you
                            have vexed me dreadfully, for you don't care much what you say; but I
                            always thought it was my fault, and I never told you of it. But it never
                            made me love you a single bit the less."
"Yes, it did for the moment, though you may soon have forgiven it. But a
                            love which is always undergoing forgiveness, is like glass steeped in
                            water, you may cut it in two with a pair of common scissors."
"Well, I should like to see the scissors that would cut me away from you.
                            I'll have a great piece off your hair, Clara, if you talk such nonsense.
                            Now come; my father wants you."
"Have you told him?"
"Yes, everything about dear Conny and you; and he says you are a noble
                            girl, but uncommonly thick-headed about your own concerns, though as
                            quick as lightning for others. Now, I won't have you look so pale; let
                            us run and get some colour. See, I'll get first to that tree."
"Will you indeed?" I won the race by a yard, and was glad that the
                            exercise made excuse for the quick rise of my bosom. After all that had
                            happened, I would not have her imagine that I still cared for her
                            brother. Like a girl all over, she said not another word, determined
                            that I should begin it.
"Let us walk faster, Lily, if my Uncle wishes to see me."
"No, there is plenty of time. It will do him good to sleep a little."
"Oh, then it is nothing important. I rather feared that it might be."
"Don't be at all afraid, darling. He wants to show you how nicely he made
                            the Chalcedony Spalla that used to be round my neck. He made it for my
                            mother, in remembrance of something."
"Oh, nothing more than that. I thought you spoke of something—at least
                            you seemed to imply—"
"Nothing that you need blush about, nor stammer either, proud Donna. You
                            know you proved to me yesterday, when we were in the cab, that you did
                            not care for Conny any more than you did for a flake of London soot,
                            which happened to come in at the window, and fall upon your glove. And
                            you were kind enough to compare him to that individual smut."
"Oh, Judy, Judy," I cried, as the dog came bounding to meet us—"darling
                            Judy, you love Clara, if nobody else has sense enough."
And half an hour ago, Lily and I in dramatic language, vowed eternal
                            affection!
"Oh, Clara, darling Clara, don't you know that I was in fun? I thought
                            you were so clever. And now to see you sobbing over that great muff of a
                            dog! Judy, I hate you, get out of the way"—the judicious would not
                            stir—"take your great hulking paws from cousin Clara's neck. There then,
                            make the most of that! Oh, I have hurt my hand so, and he is only
                            wagging his tail. But I am so delighted, my own pet, that you love poor
                            Conny still."
"And pray, who said I did?"
"Nobody, only me. All dear Papa said was this, that there was a great
                            mistake, and he soon perceived what it was; and I asked him to take my
                            opinion about it, because I was a senior sophist. And he pretended not
                            to know what a senior sophist was. And I told him it was my degree, not
                            from that man, you know, but fairly earned at the College; though they
                            did have the impudence to say that the Professors were going to pluck
                            me, until I gave them a smile."
"True enough, no doubt. But I know all that long ago. What more did my
                            Uncle say?"
"That he would tell you his opinion, but he would rather not talk about
                            it to me. And he could not bear me to go out, for fear I should be
                            stolen again. And I do believe he has had me watched all the way. Here I
                            come, Pappy; large as life you see, and three times as natural."
"Yes, my own treasure, three times as natural to me, as my life has been
                            without you. But wheel me indoors, young maidens. No other man in the
                            world has such a pair of horses. I want to talk to Clara, in my own room
                            alone. Lily, go to Mrs. Fletcher, I can't have you roving about so."
                            Lily obeyed him instantly.
"Wait one minute, Uncle dear; I want to go and fetch something."
I ran to my own rooms, and found the deed of gift, which had not been
                            returned to the lawyers. This I took to his study and placed it in his
                            hands.
"What is the matter, Clara? Have you turned conveyancer, and detected
                            some informality?"
"No, dearest Uncle. But I want you to cancel this. I cannot allow you so
                            to rob your children."
I will not say what he called me in his surprise and delight. It seemed
                            to me quite uncalled for; I had only done what my conscience told me was
                            just. But as for accepting my offer—he would not hear of it twice.
                            "Darling, it would be wrong. It would be downright robbery; and no plea
                            whatever for it, on the score of paternal duty. You are the proper heir,
                            the child of the elder son, the true representative of our ancient
                            family. All the rest is a quibble and quirk, of which, even without your
                            countless benefits, I never intended to take advantage. And my children
                            are, by the mother's side, of a family older even than ours—so far as
                            that nonsense goes—and are heirs to wealth compared to which—if it only
                            be rightly worked—these Vaughan estates are nothing. All I ask you is to
                            do a thing which I am sure you would do without asking—to assist them,
                            if what I have left them is spent before they prove their claims. Here
                            is a letter to Count Gaffori; that excellent man is still alive; and
                            here are the certificates, and my own brief deposition, which I have
                            begged a neighbouring magistrate to come to-day and attest; here is my
                            Lily's Spalla, and perhaps other relics are in my son's possession.
                            Lastly, here are two more letters, one to my old friend Peter Green, who
                            has now much influence in that part of Corsica, the other to James
                            McGregor, once my messmate at Lincoln's Inn, now an acute and rising
                            Counsel, and a leading authority upon municipal law. Take all these, my
                            darling, if you will so far oblige me; for I fear my lovely
                            daughter—isn't she lovely, Clara?"
"The loveliest girl in all the world; and what is far more important, the
                            sweetest, and the best."
"Yes, if you had searched the kingdom, you could not have brought me such
                            another love. But ah! you should have seen her mother! However, I fear
                            the sweet pet is a little careless and random, as her father used to be.
                            At any rate, I prefer entrusting this great budget to your brave and
                            honest hands; at least until my son comes here to claim it. The
                            deposition you shall have, when attested."
"But, Uncle, surely you had better keep it all yourself. No fear of Mrs.
                            Daldy now."
"No, my darling; but these things must not be buried with me."
There was something in his eyes which made me start with terror. But he
                            smiled so sweetly that my terror fled.
"And now, my child, about yourself. Though you have found me another
                            daughter, I look upon you as the eldest; and I venture to speak to you,
                            as a father would. Is it as my Lily tells me? Is it true—God grant it
                            may be—that you love my son, my Lily's son, Henry Conrad? Why don't you
                            answer me, darling? Tell the truth like a real Vaughan. Surely you are
                            not ashamed of him." And he laid his hand on my head. My tears fell
                            fast; and my heart was in a tempest.
"Yes, Uncle," at last I answered, frightened for his suspense, and
                            looking him full in the face, "Yes, Uncle, I do—I mean at least I
                            did—love him very much at one time."
"With all your heart, as we Vaughans love; with all your heart, poor
                            darling?"
"Yes, Uncle," I sobbed, in bitter humiliation; "none of my heart is left
                            me."
"Thank God! what blest news for his mother! My Harry is the happiest
                            fellow alive."
"But, Uncle, he does not think so, he—he—doesn't perceive his
                            blessedness." A flash of my old self-irony came even through my
                            anguish.
"Oh, I have heard all that. But surely you know the absurd mistake he
                            made."
"Indeed, I cannot guess it. Is it my place to do that?"
"Of course it is; when you are in the light, and he is all in the dark.
                            Whom did that kidnapper believe himself to have murdered?"
"You, Uncle, of course."
"And whose child then does he suppose you to be; if he heard of your
                            existence, as he is sure to have done?"
"Merciful God, I see it all! And how bitterly I have wronged him, my own
                            noble Conrad!"
My poor weak Uncle had to manage me, all by himself, in my terrible
                            hysterics. Frightened as he was, for he never before had to deal in that
                            way with a nature resembling mine, he would not even ring for help, lest
                            I should betray my secret to other ears than his own. When at last I
                            came to myself, he kissed me tenderly, and said:
"My poor dear child, remember—when you may be glad to think of it—that
                            whether I see my noble boy or not, I shall die now in perfect happiness.
                            Noble he must be, or Clara could not love him. It would have been the
                            pet scheme of my heart, if I could have had a voice in it. And here it
                            is done without me! How often have I longed and yearned that he could
                            only see you, as you waited day and night by my pestilential bed, that
                            he could only know the tale of your troubles and devotion. At my death,
                            the generation so visited from heaven expires; and you three darlings
                            start anew, with all things in your favour. Now mind that the good old
                            Signor's directions are complied with, and that Harry, if he lives here,
                            abandons the Corsican property to his sister Lily. Promise me this, my
                            Clara."
"Of course I will, dear Uncle—I mean, so far as my influence goes. And he
                            will then be bound to do so under the deed-poll, if I understood you
                            aright. But perhaps he has quite forgotten me now."
"Of course he thinks himself bound to avoid you. But I have written to
                            set him right, and to bring him as soon as possible. And now about—about
                            that horrible—"
"Ah, yes. If I had the right, I would even let him go. My feeling has
                            changed from fierce hatred to utter contempt. And surely his vengeance
                            is satisfied now."
"No, Clara. It will flame more wildly than ever the moment he learns his
                            mistake, and my final triumph over him. Has he any idea where our Lily
                            is?"
"As yet, he can have none. If old Cora went to Albert Street last
                            evening, she would learn nothing from Mrs. Shelfer, I took care of that,
                            except that Lily had been there, and was gone again. The old woman does
                            not speak English enough to attempt to cross-examine. She loves poor
                            Lily, I know, but will be satisfied with the belief that the child had
                            gone to her brother's. And as for that monster, even if he relents, he
                            will be too proud to inquire."
"What had my poor child done, that the brute turned her out, and struck
                            her?"
"Nothing, I believe, beyond defending her brother Conrad, as she always
                            did. I suppose I may call him 'Conrad,' Uncle?"
"Yes, my dear, it is his true name, chosen by his mother. Where are you
                            going so hastily?"
"To London at once. For your sake, Uncle dear, I must not think of
                            sparing him. I must have him in custody to-night. I would have avoided
                            it, if I could for a thousand reasons; but there is no alternative."
"Yes there is. In two days I shall be beyond his reach. Don't ask me what
                            I mean. To-day is Thursday. Promise only to let him go free till
                            Saturday."
"I will. But I must go to London. I cannot rest quiet here."
My Uncle's face brightened beautifully. And he took my hand in his.
"I know what you mean, my darling. You intend to discover my Harry, for
                            fear of any mishap. I will let you go, dear; though the house seems
                            empty without you, its truthful and graceful mistress. But you must not
                            go alone. It is not right for a beautiful girl, however self-possessed
                            and dignified, especially one of your station, to rove about
                            unattended."
"Only one man ever insulted me, Uncle, I mean in a serious way, and he
                            never did it again."
"It does not matter. The example is bad, and all men are not gentlemen.
                            Mrs. Fletcher shall go with you, and our pretty Lily keep house. But I
                            have an especial reason, and a most powerful one, for wishing that you
                            should be here. Don't go till to-morrow, my darling; I am so well
                            to-day, and I must see you once at your own table, with my daughter and
                            me for your guests."
"Oh, Uncle, I hope so a thousand times. I will stop till the morning, if
                            you have set your heart upon it."
"I have indeed. You may go in the morning by the first train, and be back
                            to-morrow night. Will you promise?"
Though I could not understand his motive, and he was pleased to conceal
                            it, I promised all he asked. Then I told him all the story of Conrad and
                            the accident, how he saved my mother's life and mine, with the courage
                            and skill of a true-born mountaineer. My Uncle was moved to tears, not
                            only at the gallantry of his son, but also by the joy of discovering
                            that all the obligations lay not upon one side. I also wept at finding
                            that Lily had never heard of it. Conrad's lofty nature scorned to
                            narrate its own achievements. When, after that adventure, he discovered
                            who we were, he avoided us because he believed that his father had slain
                            mine. It was not till a later date, when he became of age—as the
                            Corsicans reckon manhood—that Lepardo Della
                            Croce told him all he knew of his history, dwelt on the foul shame
                            wrought to the Della Croce by his bigamist father, and tried in vain to
                            force on him the awful oath of Vendetta. The youth had too much English
                            blood in his heart to accept the black inheritance. Thenceforth he could
                            not bear the sight of the man who had killed, as they both supposed, his
                            father, although, in his wrath for his mother's wrongs and his own, he
                            would not resent the deed. What marvel then that he spurned me, and was
                            maddened with himself, at finding that he, the illegitimate, was in love
                            with me, his legitimate sister? But now, we are only half-cousins, and
                            nature has never misled us.
All that evening, my Uncle was in the most glorious spirits, and I am not
                            sure that Lily and I were very far behind him. He played us all sorts of
                            boyish tricks, and we made reprisals with girlish ones, till Lily's
                            joyous laughter rang halfway clown the corridor. I had dressed her with
                            especial care, and she did look such a love! But it was all too sudden,
                            and far too sweet to last. My Uncle indeed seemed quite beside himself,
                            more gladsome than nature allows us to be with impunity. Then the vein
                            dried all of a sudden, and the mind flowed the opposite way. He made his
                            beautiful daughter, who, though not much of a sophist, had a soul that
                            thrilled to music, he made her play the soft Corsican airs, that seem to
                            weep as they breathe, and which she had learned from old Cora. He knew
                            them all; how well he knew them, his face turned from the light
                            betrayed. The depth of melodious sadness, the touch of some nervine
                            chord, which knew not its own existence, and starts to be known and
                            appreciated, as might an unconscious poet, and more than all the
                            trembling spread of the feelers of the heart, these are the proofs of
                            nature's presence in music or in poetry.
Then he begged me to play some of the sweet and simple melodies of Wales.
                            These he declared, and I had already perceived it, these were born of
                            the self-same spirit, though not so highly intensified, as the Corsican
                            romances.
Finally, he told us many a moving tale of his Lily; tales a man is loth
                            to tell to those with whom he expects to live. How she was loved, and
                            how she seemed to love everybody, and pretty answers she made to those
                            who praised her beauty, and more than words or kisses, the loving things
                            she did, the elegance of self-denial, and the innocence of merit.
That night, that memorable night, we stayed up more than two hours over
                            his proper time for going to bed. He seemed so sad to part, that I could
                            not bear to hurry him. One thing he told me which I was glad to
                            hear.
"Clara, darling, I have taken a liberty with your house. This afternoon,
                            I wrote by the London post, for Annie Franks to come back again
                            to-morrow, if she will, as an especial favour to me."
I was rather surprised; but answered him warmly, and in all truth:
"Dear Uncle, you know that I love her; and I cannot see too much of the
                            few whom I really love."
Then, as I was to start at six o'clock in the morning, he wished me "Good
                            bye," in a solemn manner, which seemed to me quite uncalled for. He drew
                            my young face to his own, so marked by sorrow and illness, looked into
                            my eyes as if I were to remember something, then held me in his
                            trembling embrace, and kissed me long and fondly.
"God in heaven bless you, darling, for all you have done to me and
                            mine."
"Mine, you should say, dear Uncle. I count them
                            now my own."
His daughter took him away, with her white arms thrown around him. For
                            now she slept in the closet next to his room, where I had so long been
                            quartered.
