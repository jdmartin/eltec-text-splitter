CHAPTER XII.
VISIT OF BLACK BESS.
Everybody at Botfield was astonished at the change in Stephen's manner; so
                         cheerful was he, and light-hearted, as if his brief manhood had passed
                         away, with its burden of cares and anxieties, and his boyish freedom and
                         gladsomeness had come back again. The secret cause remained undiscovered;
                         for Martha, fluent in tongue as she was, had enough discretion to keep her
                         own counsel, and seal up her lips as close as wax, when it was necessary.
                         The people puzzled themselves in vain; and Black Thompson left off hinting
                         at revenge to Stephen. Even the master, when the boy passed him with a
                         respectful bow, in which there was nothing of resentment or sullenness,
                         wondered how he could so soon forget the great injury he had suffered. Mr.
                         Wyley would have been better satisfied if the whole family could have been
                         driven out of the neighbourhood; but there was no knowing what ugly rumours
                         and inquiries might be set afloat, if the boy went telling his tale to
                         nobody knows whom.
Upon the whole, Martha did not very much regret her change of dwelling,
                         though she made a great virtue of her patience in submitting quietly to it.
                         To be sure, the cinder-hill was unsightly, and the cabin blackened with
                         smoke; and it was necessary to lock little Nan and grandfather safely
                         within the house whenever she went out, lest they should get to the mouth
                         of the open shaft, where Stephen often amused the child by throwing stones
                         down it, and listening to their rebound against the sides. But still Martha
                         had near neighbours; and until now she had hardly even tasted the luxury of
                         a thorough gossip, which she could enjoy in any one of the cottages
                         throughout Botfield. Moreover, she could get work for herself on three days
                         in the week, to help a washerwoman, who gave her ninepence a day, besides
                         letting little Nan go with her, and have, as she said, 'the run of her
                         teeth.' She had her admirers, too—young collier lads, who told her truly
                         enough she was the cleanest, neatest, tidiest lass in all Botfield. So
                         Martha Fern regarded their residence on the cinder-hill with more
                         complacency than could have been expected. The only circumstance which in
                         her secret heart she considered a serious drawback was her very near
                         neighbourhood to Miss Anne.
'Stephen,' said Martha one Saturday night, after their work was done, 'I've
                         been thinking how it's only thee that's trying to keep the commandments.
                         I'm not such a scholar as thee; but I've heard thy chapter read till it's
                         in my head, as well as if I could read it off book myself. So I'm thinking
                         I ought to love my enemies as well as thee; and I've asked Black Bess to
                         come and have a cup of tea with us to-morrow.'
'Black Bess!' exclaimed Stephen, with a feeling of some displeasure.
'Ah,' said Martha, 'she's always calling me—a shame to be heard. But I've
                         quite forgiven her; and to-morrow I'll let her see I can make pikelets as
                         well as her mother; and we'll have out the three china cups; only
                         grandfather and little Nan must have common ones. I thought I'd better tell
                         thee; and then thee'lt make haste home from church in the afternoon.'
'Black Bess isn't a good friend for thee,' answered Stephen, who was better
                         acquainted with the pit-girl's character than was Martha, and felt troubled
                         at the idea of any companionship between them.
'But we are to love our enemies,' persisted Martha, 'and do good to them that
                         hate us. At any rate I asked her, and she said she'd come.'
'I don't think it means we are to ask our enemies to tea,' said Stephen, in
                         perplexity. 'If she was badly off, like, and in want of a meal's meat, it
                         'ud be another thing; I'd do it gladly. And on a Sunday too! Oh, Martha, it
                         doesn't seem right.'
'Oh, nothing's right that I do!' replied Martha pettishly; 'thee'rt afraid
                         I'll get as good as thee, and then thee cannot crow over me. But I'll not
                         spend a farthing of thy money, depend upon it. I'm not without some
                         shillings of my own, I reckon. Thee should let me love my enemies as well
                         as thee, I think; but thee'lt want to go up to heaven alone next.'
Stephen said no more, though Martha continued talking peevishly about Black
                         Bess. She was not at all satisfied in her own mind that she was doing
                         right; but Bess had met her at a neighbour's house, where she was boasting
                         of her skill in making pikelets, and she had been drawn out by her sneers
                         and mocking to give her a kind of challenge to come and taste them. She
                         wanted now to make herself and Stephen believe that she was doing it out of
                         love and forgiveness towards poor Bess; but she could not succeed in the
                         deception. All the Sunday morning she was bustling about, and sadly chafing
                         the grandfather by making him move hither and thither out of the way. It
                         was quite a new experience to have any one coming to tea; and all her
                         hospitable and housekeeping feelings were greatly excited by the
                         approaching event.
When Stephen, with tired little Nan riding on his shoulder, returned from
                         church in the afternoon, they found Bess had arrived, and was sitting in
                         the warmest corner, close to a very large and blazing fire, which filled
                         the cabin with light and heat. Bess had dressed herself up in her best
                         attire, in a bright red stuff gown, and with yellow ribbons tied in her
                         hair, which had been brought to a degree of smoothness wonderful to
                         Stephen, who saw her daily on the pit-bank. She had washed her face and
                         hands with so much care as to leave broad stripes of grime round her neck
                         and wrists, partly concealed by a necklace and bracelets of glass beads;
                         and her green apron was marvellously braided in a large pattern. Martha, in
                         her clean print dress, and white handkerchief pinned round her throat, was
                         a pleasant contrast to the tawdry girl, who looked wildly at Stephen as he
                         entered, as if she scarcely knew what to do.
'Good evening, Bess,' he said, as pleasantly as he could. 'Martha told me
                         thee was coming to eat some pikelets with her, so I asked Tim to come too;
                         and after tea we'll have some rare singing. I often hear thee on the bank,
                         Bess, and thee has a good voice.'
Bess coloured with pleasure, and evidently tried her best to be amiable and
                         well-mannered, sitting up nearer and nearer to the fire until her face
                         shone as red as her dress with the heat. Martha moved triumphantly about
                         the house, setting the tea-table, upon which she placed the three china
                         cups, with a gratified glance at the undisguised admiration of Bess; though
                         three common ones had to be laid beside them, for, as Tim was coming,
                         Stephen must fare like grandfather and little Nan. As soon as Tim arrived,
                         she was very busy beating up the batter for the pikelets, and then baking
                         them over the fire; and very soon the little party were sitting down to
                         their feast—Bess declaring politely, between each piece pressed upon her by
                         Martha, that she had never tasted such pikelets, never!
At last, when tea was quite finished, and the table carefully lifted back to
                         a safe corner at the foot of the bed, though Martha prudently replaced the
                         china cups in the cupboard, Tim and Stephen drew up their stools to the
                         front of the fire, and a significant glance passed between them.
'Now then, Stevie,' said Tim, 'thee learn me the new hymn Miss Anne sings
                         with us; and let's teach Bess to sing too.'
Bess looked round uneasily, as if she found herself caught in a trap; but, as
                         Tim burst off loudly into a hymn tune, in which Stephen joined at the top
                         of his voice, she had no time to make any objection. Martha and the old
                         grandfather, who had been a capital singer in his day, began to help; and
                         little Nan mingled her sweet, clear, childish notes with their stronger
                         tones. It was a long hymn, and, before it was finished, Bess found herself
                         shyly humming away to the tune, almost as if it had been the chorus of one
                         of the pit-bank songs. They sang more and more, until she joined in boldly,
                         and whispered to Martha that she wished she knew the words, so as to sing
                         with them. But the crowning pleasure of the evening was when little Nan,
                         sitting on Stephen's knee, with his fingers stroking her curly hair, sang
                         by herself a new hymn for little children, which Miss Anne had been
                         teaching her. She could not say the words very plainly, but her voice was
                         sweet, and she looked so lovely with her tiny hands softly folded, and her
                         eyes lifted up steadily to Stephen's face, that at last Black Bess burst
                         out into a loud and long fit of crying, and wept so bitterly that none of
                         them could comfort her, until the little child herself, who had been afraid
                         of her before, climbed upon her lap and laid her arms round her neck. She
                         looked up then, and wiped the tears from her face with the corner of her
                         fine apron.
'I had a sister once, just like little Nan,' she said, with a sob, 'and she
                         minded me of her. Miss Anne told me she was singing somewhere among the
                         angels, and I thought she'd look like little Nan. But I'm afraid I shall
                         never go where she is; I'm so bad.'
'We'll teach thee how to be good,' answered Martha. 'Thee come to me, Bess,
                         and I'll teach thee the hymns, and the singing, and how to make pikelets,
                         and keep the house clean on a week-day. I'm going to love my enemies, and
                         do good to them that hate me; so don't thee be shy-like. We'll be friends
                         like Stephen and Tim; and weren't they enemies afore Stephen learned to
                         read?'
That night, as Stephen lay down to sleep, he said to himself, 'I'm glad Black
                         Bess came to eat pikelets with Martha. My chapter says, "Whosoever shall do
                         the commandments, and teach them, the same shall be called great in the
                         kingdom of heaven." Perhaps Martha and me will be called great in heaven,
                         if we teach Bess how to do God's commandments.'
