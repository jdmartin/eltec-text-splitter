CHAPTER XIV.
A BROTHER'S GRIEF.
In a very short time all the people at work on the surface of the mine knew
                         that Stephen Fern's little sister was deadâ€”lying dead in the very pit where
                         he was then labouring for her, with the spirit and strength and love of a
                         father rather than a brother. Every face was overcast and grave; and many
                         of the boys and girls were weeping, for little Nan had endeared herself to
                         them all since she came to live at the cinder-hill cabin. Tim felt faint
                         and heart-sick, almost wishing he could have perished in the child's stead,
                         for poor Stephen's sake; but he had to rouse himself, for one of the
                         banksmen was going to shout the terrible tidings down the shaft; and if
                         Stephen should be near, instead of being at work farther in the pit, the
                         words would fall upon him without any softening or preparation. He implored
                         them to wait until he could run and tell Miss Anne; but while he was
                         speaking they saw Miss Anne herself coming towards the pit, her face very
                         pale and sorrowful, for the rumour had reached the master's house, and she
                         was hastening to meet Stephen, and comfort him, if that were possible.
'Oh, Miss Anne!' cried Tim; 'it will kill poor Stephen, if it come upon him
                         sudden like. I know the way through the old pit to where poor little Nan
                         has fallen; and I'll go and find her. The roof's dropped in, and only a boy
                         could creep along. But who's to tell Stevie? Oh, Miss Anne, couldn't you go
                         down with me, and tell him gently your own self?'
'Yes, I will go,' said Miss Anne, weeping.
Underground, in those low, dark, pent-up galleries, lighted only here and
                         there by a glimmering lamp, the colliers were busy at their labours,
                         unconscious of all that was happening overhead. Stephen was at work at some
                         distance from the others, loading a train of small square waggons with the
                         blocks of coal which he and Black Thompson had picked out of the earth. He
                         was singing softly to himself the hymns that he and little Nan had been
                         learning during the summer in the Red Gravel Pit; and he smiled as he
                         fancied that little Nan was perhaps singing them over as well by the cabin
                         fire. He did not know, poor boy, that at that moment Tim was creeping
                         through the winding, blocked-up passages, so long untrodden, to the bottom
                         of the old shaft; and that when he returned he would be bearing in his arms
                         a sad, sad burden, upon which his tears would fall unavailingly.
Stephen's comrades were all of a sudden very quiet, and their pickaxes no
                         longer gave dull muffled thumps upon the seam of coal; but he was too busy
                         to notice how idle and still they were. It was only when Cole spoke to him,
                         in a tone of extraordinary mildness, that the boy paused in his rough and
                         toilsome employment.
'My lad,' said Cole, 'Miss Anne's come down the pit, and she's asking for
                         thee.'
'She promised she'd come some day,' cried Stephen, with a thrill of pleasure
                         and a quicker throbbing of his heart, as he darted along the narrow paths
                         to the loftier and more open space near the bottom of the shaft, where Miss
                         Anne was waiting for him. The covered lamps gave too little light for him
                         to see how pale and sorrow-stricken she looked; but the solemn tenderness
                         of her voice sank deeply into his heart.
'Stephen, my dear boy,' she said, 'are you sure that I care for you, and
                         would not let any trouble come upon you if I could help it?'
'Yes, surely, Miss Anne,' answered the boy wonderingly.
'Your Father which is in heaven cares much more for you,' she continued; 'but
                         "whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He
                         receiveth." God is dealing with you as His son, Stephen. Can you bear the
                         sorrow which is sent by Him?'
'If the Lord Jesus will help me,' he murmured.
'He will help you, my poor boy,' said Miss Anne 'Oh, Stephen, Stephen, how
                         can I tell you? Our little Nan, our precious little child, has fallen down
                         the old shaft.'
Stephen reeled giddily, and would have sunk to the ground, but Cole held him
                         up in his strong arms, while his comrades gathered about him with tears and
                         sobs, which prevented them uttering any words of consolation. But he could
                         not have listened to them. He fancied he heard the pattering of Nan's
                         little feet, and saw her laughing face. But no! he heard instead the dull
                         and lingering footsteps of Tim, and saw a little lifeless form folded from
                         sight in Tim's jacket.
'The little lass 'ud die very easy,' whispered Cole, passing his arm tighter
                         round Stephen; 'and she's up in heaven among the angels by this time, I
                         reckon.'
Stephen drew himself away from Cole's arm, and staggered forward a step or
                         two to meet Tim; when he took the sad burden from him, and sat down without
                         a word, pressing it closely to his breast. His perfect silence touched all
                         about him. Miss Anne hid her face in her hands, and some of the men groaned
                         aloud.
'The old pit ought to have been bricked up years ago,' said Cole; 'the
                         child's death will be upon the master's head.'
'It'll all go to one reckoning,' muttered Black Thompson. But Stephen seemed
                         not to hear their words. Still, with the child clasped tightly to him, he
                         waited for the lowering of the skip, and when it descended, he seated
                         himself in it without lifting up his head, which was bent over the dead
                         child. Miss Anne and Tim took their places beside him, and they were drawn
                         up to the broad, glittering light of day on the surface, where a crowd of
                         eager bystanders was waiting for Stephen's appearance.
'Don't speak to me, please,' he murmured, without looking round; and they
                         made way for him in his deep, silent grief, as he passed on homewards,
                         followed by Miss Anne. Once she saw him look up to the hills, where, at
                         Fern's Hollow, the new house stood out conspicuously against the snow; and
                         when they passed the shaft, he shuddered visibly; but yet he was silent,
                         and scarcely seemed to know that she was walking beside him.
The cabin was full of women from Botfield, for Martha had fallen into violent
                         fits of hysterics, and none of their remedies had any effect in soothing
                         her. One of them took the dead child from Stephen's arms at the door, and
                         bade him go away and sit in her cottage till she came to him. But he turned
                         off towards the hills; and Miss Anne, seeing that she could say nothing to
                         comfort him just then, watched him strolling along the old road that led to
                         Fern's Hollow, with his arms folded and his head bent down, as if he were
                         still carrying that sad burden which he had borne up from the pit, so
                         closely pressed against his heart.
