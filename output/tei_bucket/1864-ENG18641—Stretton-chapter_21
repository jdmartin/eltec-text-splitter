CHAPTER XXI.
FORGIVENESS.
Bess Thompson started off on her way to her desolate home, almost
                         heart-broken, and with such a wrathful resentment against Stephen, and
                         Martha, and Tim, as seemed to blot out all memory of the lessons she had
                         been learning from Miss Anne since the little child's death. She could
                         never bear to go near them, or speak to them again, since they had sworn
                         against her father; and had not he been good to them when Stephen was ill,
                         often sparing her to watch with Martha, as well as helping to make up his
                         wages? If this was their religion, she did not care to have it; for nobody
                         else in Botfield would have done the same. And now she might as well give
                         up all thoughts of getting to heaven, where little Nan and her baby sister
                         were; for there would be nobody to care for her, and she would be obliged
                         to go back to all her old ways.
These were her bitter thoughts as she walked homewards alone, for Stephen was
                         gone up to the doctor's house to inquire after the master and Miss Anne,
                         and the others were waiting for him in Longville. She heard their voices
                         after a while coming along the turnpike road, and walking quickly as if to
                         overtake her; so she turned aside into a field, and hid herself under a
                         hedge that they might pass by. She crouched down low upon the grass, and
                         covered her red and smarting eyes from the sunshine with her shawl, and
                         then she listened for their footsteps to die away in the distance. But she
                         felt an arm stealing round her, and Martha's voice whispered close in her
                         ear,â€”
'Bess, dear Bess, thee must not hide thyself from us. We love thee, Bess; and
                         we are sore sorry for thee. Stephen is ever so down-hearted about thee and
                         thy father. Oh, Bess, thee must have no spite at us.'
'Bess,' said Stephen, 'thy father owned I was telling the truth, and said he
                         forgave me for speaking agen him; and he shook hands with me afore he went;
                         and he said, "Stephen, thee be a friend to my poor lass!" and I gave him a
                         sure promise that I would.'
'Nobody'll ever look at me now,' cried Bess; 'nobody'll be friends with me if
                         father's transported.'
'We're thy friends,' answered Stephen, 'and thee has a Father in heaven that
                         cares for thee. Listen, Bess; it will do thee good, and poor old
                         grandfather no harm now. He was transported beyond the seas once; and no
                         one casts it up to him now, nor to us; and haven't we got friends? Cheer
                         up, Bess. Miss Anne says, maybe this very trouble will bring thy father to
                         repentance. He said he'd repent some time; and maybe this will be the very
                         time for him. And Miss Anne sends her kind love to thee and thy mother, and
                         she'll come and see thy mother as soon as she can leave the master.'
Thus comforted, poor sorrowful Bess rose from the ground, and walked on with
                         them to Botfield. Most of the house doors were open, and the women were
                         standing at them in order to waylay them with inquisitive questions; but
                         Stephen's grave and steady face, and the presence of Bess, who walked close
                         beside him, as if there was shelter and protection there, kept them silent;
                         and they were compelled to satisfy their curiosity with secondhand reports.
                         Martha went on with Bess to her own cottage to stay all night with her, and
                         help her to console her broken-hearted mother.
Though Martha was truly sorry for Black Thompson's family, she felt her
                         importance as one of the chief witnesses against him; especially as the
                         cinder-hill cabin was visited, not only by the gossips of Botfield, but by
                         more distinguished persons from all the farmhouses around; and her
                         thrilling narrative of her hazardous journey through Botfield along the
                         high road was listened to with greedy interest. In this foolish talking she
                         lost that true sympathy which she ought to have felt for poor Bess, and
                         forfeited the blessing which would have been given to her own soul. But it
                         was very different with Stephen in his lonely work upon the mountains.
                         There he thought over the crimes and punishment of Black Thompson, until
                         his heart was filled with an unutterable pity and fellow-feeling both
                         towards him and his family; and every night, as he went home from his
                         labour, he turned aside to the cottage, to read to Bess and her mother some
                         portion of the Scriptures which he had chosen for their comfort, out of a
                         pocket Bible given to him by Miss Anne.
About a fortnight after these events Stephen received a visitor upon the
                         uplands, where he was seeking a lamb that had strayed into a dwarf forest
                         of gorse-bushes, and was bleating piteously in its bewilderment. A
                         pleasant-sounding voice called 'Stephen Fern!' and when he got free from
                         the entangling thorns, with the rescued lamb in his arms, who should be
                         waiting for him but the lord of the manor himself! Stephen knew his face
                         again in an instant, and dropped the lamb that he might take off his old
                         cap, while the gentleman smiled at him with a hearty smile.
'I am Danesford, of Danesford,' he said gaily; 'and I believe you are Stephen
                         Fern, of Fern's Hollow. I've brought you a message, my boy. Can you guess
                         what young lady has sent me over the hills after you?'
'Miss Anne,' answered Stephen promptly.
'No; there are other young ladies in the world beside Miss Anne!' replied Mr.
                         Danesford. 'Have you forgotten Miss Lockwood? She has not forgotten you;
                         and we are come home ready to give battle to your enemies, and reinstate
                         you in all your rights. She gives Mr. Lockwood and me no rest until we have
                         got Fern's Hollow, and everything else, for you again.'
'Sir,' said Stephen, and his eyes filled with tears, 'nobody can give me back
                         little Nan.'
'No,' answered Mr. Danesford gravely; 'I know how hardly you have been dealt
                         with, my boy. Tell me truly, is your religion strong enough to enable you
                         to forgive Mr. Wyley indeed? Is it possible that you can forgive him from
                         your heart?'
Stephen was silent, looking down at the heath upon which his feet were
                         pressed, but seeing none of its purple blossoms. It was a question that
                         must not be answered rashly, for even that morning he had glanced down the
                         fatal shaft with a deep yearning after little Nan; and as he passed the
                         ruins of his master's house, his memory had recalled the destruction of the
                         old hut with something of a feeling of triumph.
'Sir,' he said, looking up to him, 'I'm afraid I can't explain myself. You
                         know it was for my sake that the Lord Jesus was killed, yet His Father has
                         forgiven me all my sins; and when I think of that, I can forgive the master
                         even for little Nan's death with all my heart. But I don't always remember
                         it; and then I feel a little glad at the fire. I haven't got much religion
                         yet. I don't know everything that's in the Bible.'
'Yet I could learn some lessons from you, Stephen,' said Mr. Danesford, after
                         a pause. 'What do you suppose I should do if anybody tried to take
                         Danesford Hall from me?'
'I don't know, sir,' answered Stephen.
'Nor do I,' he said, smiling; 'at any rate, they should not have it with my
                         consent. Nor shall anybody take Fern's Hollow from you. I have been down to
                         Longville about it, but Mr. Wyley is too ill to see me. By the way, I told
                         Miss Anne I was coming up the hills after you. She wants to see you,
                         Stephen, as soon as possible after your work is done.'
Mr. Danesford rode on over the hills, and Stephen walked some way beside him,
                         to put him into the nearest path for Danesford. After he was gone he
                         watched earnestly for the evening shadows, and when they stretched far away
                         across the plains, he hastened down to the cabin, and then on to Longville,
                         to his appointed interview with Miss Anne.
