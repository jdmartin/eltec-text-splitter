CHAPTER III.
STEPHEN'S FIRST VICTORY.
James Fern did not live many more days, and he was buried the Sunday
                         following his death. All the colliers and pitmen from Botfield walked with
                         the funeral of their old comrade and made a great burial of it. The parish
                         church was two miles on the other side of Botfield, and four miles from
                         Fern's Hollow; so James Fern and his family had never, as he called it,
                         'troubled' the church with their attendance. All the household, even to
                         little Nan, went with their father's corpse, to bury it in the strange and
                         distant churchyard. Stephen felt as if he was in some long and painful
                         dream, as he sat in the cart, with his feet resting upon his father's
                         coffin, with his grandfather on a chair at the head, nodding and laughing
                         at every jolt on the rough road, and Martha holding a handkerchief up to
                         her face, and carrying a large umbrella over herself and little Nan, to
                         keep the dust off their new black bonnets. The boy, grave as he was, could
                         hardly think; he felt in too great a maze for that. The church, too, which
                         he had never entered before, seemed grand and cold and immense, with its
                         lofty arches, and a roof so high that it made him giddy to look up to it.
                         Now and then he heard a few sentences of the burial service sounding out
                         grandly in the clergyman's strange, deep voice; but they were not words he
                         was familiar with, and he could not understand their meaning. At the open
                         grave only, the clergyman said 'Our Father,' which his father had taught
                         him during his illness; and while his tears rolled down his cheeks for the
                         first time that day, Stephen repeated over and over again to himself, 'Our
                         Father! our Father!'
Stephen would have liked to stay in the church for the evening service, for
                         which the bells were already ringing; but this did not at all suit the
                         tastes of his father's old comrades. They made haste to crowd into a
                         public-house, where they sat and drank, and forced Stephen to drink too, in
                         order to 'drown his grief.' It was still a painful dream to him; and more
                         and more, as the long hours passed on, he wondered how he came there, and
                         what all the people about him were doing. It was quite dark before they
                         started homewards, and the poor old grandfather was no longer able to sit
                         up in his chair, but lay helplessly at the bottom of the cart. Even Martha
                         was fast asleep, and leaned her head upon Stephen's shoulder, without any
                         regard for her new black bonnet. The cart was now crowded with as many of
                         the people as could get into it, who sang and shouted along the quiet
                         Sunday road; and, as they insisted upon stopping at every public-house they
                         came to, it was very late before they reached the lane leading up to Fern's
                         Hollow. The grandfather was half dragged and half carried along by two of
                         the men, followed by Stephen bearing sleepy little Nan in his arms, and by
                         Martha, who had wakened up in a temper between crying and scolding. The
                         long, strange, painful dream of father's funeral was not over yet, and
                         Stephen was still trying to think in a stupid, drowsy fashion, when he fell
                         heavily asleep on the bed beside his grandfather.
He awoke by habit very early in the morning, and aroused himself with a great
                         effort against dropping asleep again. He could realize and understand his
                         position better now. Father was dead; and there was no one to earn bread
                         for them all but himself. At this thought he sprang up instantly, though
                         his head was aching in a manner he had never felt before. With some
                         difficulty he awoke Martha to get his breakfast and put up his dinner in a
                         basket which he carried with him to the pit. She also complained bitterly
                         of her head aching, and moved about with a listlessness very different to
                         her usual activity. 'I only wish I knew what was right,' said Stephen to
                         himself; 'they told us we ought to show respect for father, but I don't
                         think he'd like this. Perhaps if I could read the Bible all through, that
                         would tell me everything.'
This thought reminded Stephen that he had promised his father to read his
                         chapter every day of his life till he knew how to read more; and, carrying
                         the old Bible to his favourite seat on the door-sill, a very pleasant place
                         in the cool, fresh summer morning, he read the verses aloud, slowly and
                         carefully, rather repeating than reading them, for he knew his chapter
                         better by heart than by the printed letters in the book. Thank God, Stephen
                         Fern did begin to know it by heart!
It was not a bad day in the pit. All the colliers, men and boys, were more
                         gentle than usual with the fatherless lad; and even Black Thompson, his
                         master since his father's illness, who was in general a fierce bully to
                         everybody about him, spoke as mildly as he could to Stephen. Yet all the
                         day Stephen longed for his release in the evening, thinking how much work
                         there wanted doing in the garden, and how he and Martha must be busy in it
                         till nightfall. The clanking of the chain which drew him up to the light of
                         day sounded like music to him; but little did he guess that an enemy was
                         lying in wait for him at the mouth of the pit. 'Hillo!' cried a voice down
                         the shaft as they were nearing the top; 'one of you chaps have got to carry
                         a sack o' coals one mile.'
The voice belonged to Tim Cole, who was the terror of the pit-bank, from his
                         love of mischief and his insatiable desire for fighting. He was looking
                         down the shaft now, with a grin and a laugh upon his red face, round which
                         his shaggy red hair hung like a rough mane. There were only two other boys
                         besides Stephen in the skip, and as their fathers were with them it might
                         be dangerous to meddle with them; so Tim fixed upon Stephen as his
                         prey.
'Thee has got to carry these coals, Steve,' he said, his eyes dancing with
                         delight.
'I won't,' replied Stephen.
'Thee shalt,' cried Tim, with an oath.
'I won't,' Stephen repeated stedfastly.
'Then we'll fight for it,' said Tim, clenching his fists and squaring his
                         arms, while the men and boys formed a ring round the two lads, and one and
                         another spoke encouragingly to Stephen, who was somewhat slighter and
                         younger than Tim. He had beaten Tim once before, but that was months ago;
                         yet the blood rushed into Stephen's face, and he set his lips together
                         firmly. Up yonder, just within the range of his sight, was Fern's Hollow,
                         with its neglected garden, and his supper waiting for him; and here was the
                         heavy sack of coals to be carried for a mile, or the choice of fighting
                         with Tim.
'I wish I knew what I ought to do,' he said, speaking aloud, though speaking
                         to himself.
'Ay, ay, lad,' cried Black Thompson; 'it's a shame to make thee fight, and
                         thy father not cold in the graveyard yet. I say, Tim, what is it thee
                         wants?'
'These coals,' answered Tim doggedly, 'are to be carried to the New Farm; and
                         if Stevie Fern won't take them one mile, he must fight me afore he goes off
                         this bank.'
'Now, lads, I'll judge between ye this time,' said Black Thompson. 'Stevie
                         shall carry them to the end of Red Lane, and cut across the hill home:
                         that's not much out of the way; and if Tim makes him go one step farther,
                         I'll lick thee myself to-morrow, lad, I promise thee.'
Stephen hoisted the sack upon his shoulders in silence, and strode away with
                         a swelling heart, in which a tumult of anger and perplexity was raging. 'If
                         I had only a commandment about these things!' he thought. He was not quite
                         certain whether it would not have been best and wisest to fight with Tim
                         and have it out; especially as Tim was all the time taunting him for being
                         a coward. But his father had read much to him during the last three months;
                         and though he could not remember any particular commandment, he felt sure
                         that the Bible did not encourage fighting or drunkenness. Suddenly, and
                         before they reached the end of Red Lane, a light burst upon Stephen's
                         mind.
'I say, Tim,' he said, speaking to him for the first time, 'it's four miles
                         to the New Farm, and I'll go with thee a mile farther than Red Lane.'
'Eh!' cried Tim; 'and get Black Thompson to lick me to-morrow?'
'No,' said Stephen earnestly, 'I'll not tell Black Thompson; and if he hears
                         talk of it, I'll say I did it of my own mind. Come thy ways, Tim; let's be
                         sharp, for I've my potatoes to hoe when I get home to-night.'
The boys walked briskly on for a few minutes, past the end of Red Lane,
                         though Stephen cast a wistful glance up it, and gave an impatient jerk to
                         the load upon his shoulders. Tim had been walking beside him in silent
                         reflection; but at last he came to a sudden halt.
'I can't make it out,' he said. 'What art thee up to, Stephen? Tell me out
                         plain, or I'll fight thee here, if Black Thompson does lick me for it.'
'Why, I've been learning to read,' answered Stephen, with some pride, 'and of
                         course I know things I didn't used to know, and what thee doesn't know
                         now.'
'And what's that to do with it?' inquired Tim.
'My chapter says that if any man forces me to go one mile, I am to go two,'
                         replied Stephen; 'it doesn't say why exactly, but I'm going to try what
                         good it will be to me to do everything that my book tells me.'
'It's a queer book,' said Tim, after a pause. 'Does it say a chap may make
                         another chap do his work for him?'
'No,' Stephen answered; 'but it says we are to love our enemies, and do good
                         to them that hate us, that we may be the children of our Father which is in
                         heaven—that is God, Tim. So that is why I am going a mile farther with
                         thee.'
'I don't hate thee,' said Tim uneasily, 'but I do love fighting; I'd liever
                         thee'd fight than come another mile. Don't thee come any farther, I've been
                         bone lazy all day, and thee's been at work. And I say, Stevie, I'll help
                         thee with the potatoes to-morrow, to make up for this bout.'
Stephen thanked him, and accepted his offer heartily. The load was quickly
                         transferred to Tim's broad back, and the boys parted in more good-will than
                         they had ever felt before; Stephen strengthened by this favourable result
                         in his resolution to put in practice all he knew of the Bible; and Tim deep
                         in thought, as was evident from his muttering every now and then on his way
                         to the New Farm, 'Queer book that; and a queer chap too!'
