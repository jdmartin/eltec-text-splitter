CHAPTER XVII. Edgehill.  
Of all sights in the world there is, I think, none more beautiful than that of a pack of
      fox-hounds seated, on a winter morning, round the huntsman, if the place of meeting has been
      chosen with anything of artistic skill. It should be in a grassy field, and the field should
      be small. It should not be absolutely away from all buildings, and the hedgerows should not
      have been clipped and pared, and made straight with reference to modern agricultural economy.
      There should be trees near, and the ground should be a little uneven, so as to mark some
      certain small space as the exact spot where the dogs and servants of the hunt should
      congregate.
There are well-known grand meets in England, in the parks of noblemen, before their houses,
      or even on what are called their lawns; but these magnificent affairs have but little of the
      beauty of which I speak. Such assemblies are too grand and too ornate, and, moreover, much too
      far removed from true sporting proprieties. At them, equipages are shining, and ladies'
      dresses are gorgeous, and crowds of tradesmen from the neighbouring town have come there to
      look at the grand folk. To my eye there is nothing beautiful in that. The meet I speak of is
      arranged with a view to sport, but the accident of the locality may make it the prettiest
      thing in the world.
Such, in a special degree, was the case at Edgehill. At Edgehill the whole village consisted
      of three or four cottages; but there was a small old church, with an old grey tower, and a
      narrow, green, almost dark, churchyard, surrounded by elm-trees. The road from Roebury to the
      meet passed by the church stile, and turning just beyond it came upon the gate which led into
      the little field in which the hounds felt themselves as much at home as in their kennels.
      There might be six or seven acres in the field, which was long and narrow, so that the
      huntsman had space to walk leisurely up and down with the pack clustering round him, when he
      considered that longer sitting might chill them. The church tower was close at hand, visible
      through the trees, and the field itself was green and soft, though never splashing with mud or
      heavy with holes.
Edgehill was a favourite meet in that country, partly because foxes were very abundant in
      the great wood adjacent, partly because the whole country around is grass-land, and partly, no
      doubt, from the sporting propensities of the neighbouring population. As regards my own taste,
      I do not know that I do like beginning a day with a great wood,—and if not beginning it,
      certainly not ending it. It is hard to come upon the cream of hunting, as it is upon the cream
      of any other delight. Who can always drink Lafitte of the finest, can always talk to a woman
      who is both beautiful and witty, or can always find the right spirit in the poetry he reads? A
      man has usually to work through much mud before he gets his nugget. It is so certainly in
      hunting, and a big wood too frequently afflicts the sportsman, as the mud does the miner. The
      small gorse cover is the happy, much-envied bit of ground in which the gold is sure to show
      itself readily. But without the woods the gorse would not hold the foxes, and without the mud
      the gold would not have found its resting-place.
But, as I have said, Edgehill was a popular meet, and, as regarded the meet itself, was
      eminently picturesque. On the present occasion the little field was full of horsemen, moving
      about slowly, chatting together, smoking cigars, getting off from their hacks and mounting
      their hunters, giving orders to their servants, and preparing for the day. There were old
      country gentlemen there, greeting each other from far sides of the county; sporting farmers
      who love to find themselves alongside their landlords, and to feel that the pleasures of the
      country are common to both; men down from town, like our friends of the Roebury club, who made
      hunting their chosen pleasure, and who formed, in number, perhaps the largest portion of the
      field; officers from garrisons round about; a cloud of servants, and a few nondescript
      stragglers who had picked up horses, hither and thither, round the country. Outside the gate
      on the road were drawn up a variety of vehicles, open carriages, dog-carts, gigs, and
      waggonettes, in some few of which were seated ladies who had come over to see the meet. But
      Edgehill was, essentially, not a ladies' meet. The distances to it were long, and the rides in
      Cranby Wood—the big wood—were not adapted for wheels. There were one or two ladies on
      horseback, as is always the case; but Edgehill was not a place popular, even with hunting
      ladies. One carriage, that of the old master of the hounds, had entered the sacred precincts
      of the field, and from this the old baronet was just descending, as Maxwell, Calder Jones, and
      Vavasor rode into the field.

"I hope I see you well, Sir William," said Maxwell, greeting the master. Calder Jones also
      made his little speech, and so did Vavasor.
"Humph—well, yes, I'm pretty well, thank'ee. Just move on, will you? My mare can't stir
      here." Then some one else spoke to him, and he only grunted in answer. Having slowly been
      assisted up on to his horse,—for he was over seventy years of age,—he trotted off to the
      hounds, while all the farmers round him touched their hats to him. But his mind was laden with
      affairs of import, and he noticed no one. In a whispered voice he gave his instructions to his
      huntsman, who said, "Yes, Sir William," "No, Sir William," "No doubt, Sir William." One
      long-eared, long-legged fellow, in a hunting-cap and scarlet coat, hung listening by, anxious
      to catch something of the orders for the morning. "Who the devil's that fellow, that's all
      breeches and boots?" said Sir William aloud to some one near him, as the huntsman moved off
      with the hounds. Sir William knew the man well enough, but was minded to punish him for his
      discourtesy. "Where shall we find first, Sir William?" said Calder Jones, in a voice that was
      really very humble. "How the mischief am I to know where the foxes are?" said Sir William,
      with an oath; and Calder Jones retired unhappy, and for the moment altogether silenced.
And yet Sir William was the most popular man in the county, and no more courteous gentleman
      ever sat at the bottom of his own table. A mild man he was, too, when out of his saddle, and
      one by no means disposed to assume special supremacy. But a master of hounds, if he have long
      held the country,—and Sir William had held his for more than thirty years,—obtains a power
      which that of no other potentate can equal. He may say and do what he pleases, and his tyranny
      is always respected. No conspiracy against him has a chance of success; no sedition will meet
      with sympathy;—that is, if he be successful in showing sport. If a man be sworn at, abused,
      and put down without cause, let him bear it and think that he has been a victim for the public
      good. And let him never be angry with the master. That rough tongue is the necessity of the
      master's position. They used to say that no captain could manage a ship without swearing at
      his men. But what are the captain's troubles in comparison with those of the master of hounds?
      The captain's men are under discipline, and can be locked up, flogged, or have their grog
      stopped. The master of hounds cannot stop the grog of any offender, and he can only stop the
      tongue, or horse, of such an one by very sharp words.
"Well, Pollock, when did you come?" said Maxwell.
"By George," said the literary gentleman, "just down from London by the 8.30 from Euston
      Square, and got over here from Winslow in a trap, with two fellows I never saw in my life
      before. We came tandem in a fly, and did the nineteen miles in an hour."
"Come, Athenian, draw it mild," said Maxwell.
"We did, indeed. I wonder whether they'll pay me their share of the fly. I had to leave
      Onslow Crescent at a quarter before eight, and I did three hours' work before I started."
"Then you did it by candle-light," said Grindley.
"Of course I did; and why shouldn't I? Do you suppose no one can work by candle-light except
      a lawyer? I suppose you fellows were playing whist, and drinking hard. I'm uncommon glad I
      wasn't with you, for I shall be able to ride."
"I bet you a pound," said Jones, "if there's a run, I see more of it than you."
"I'll take that bet with Jones," said Grindley, "and Vavasor shall be the judge."
"Gentlemen, the hounds can't get out, if you will stop up the gate," said Sir William. Then
      the pack passed through, and they all trotted on for four miles, to Cranby Wood.
Vavasor, as he rode on to the wood, was alone, or speaking, from time to time, a few words
      to his servant. "I'll ride the chestnut mare in the wood," he said, "and do you keep near
      me."
"I bean't to be galloping up and down them rides, I suppose," said Bat, almost
      contemptuously.
"I shan't gallop up and down the rides, myself; but do you mark me, to know where I am, so
      that I can change if a fox should go away."
"You'll be here all day, sir. That's my belief."
"If so, I won't ride the brown horse at all. But do you take care to let me have him if
      there's a chance. Do you understand?"
"Oh, yes, I understand, sir. There ain't no difficulty in my understanding;—only I don't
      think, sir, you'll ever get a fox out of that wood to-day. Why, it stands to reason. The
      wind's from the north-east."
Cranby Wood is very large,—there being, in truth, two or three woods together. It was nearly
      twelve before they found; and then for an hour there was great excitement among the men, who
      rode up and down the rides as the hounds drove the fox from one end to another of the
      enclosure. Once or twice the poor animal did try to go away, and then there was great
      hallooing, galloping, and jumping over unnecessary fences; but he was headed back again, or
      changed his mind, not liking the north-east wind of which Bat Smithers had predicted such bad
      things. After one the crowd of men became rather more indifferent, and clustered together in
      broad spots, eating their lunch, smoking cigars, and chaffing each other. It was singular to
      observe the amazing quantity of ham sandwiches and of sherry that had been carried into Cranby
      Wood on that day. Grooms appeared to have been laden with cases, and men were as well armed
      with flasks at their saddle-bows as they used to be with pistols. Maxwell and Pollock formed
      the centre of one of these crowds, and chaffed each other with the utmost industry, till,
      tired of having inflicted no wounds, they turned upon Grindley and drove him out of the
      circle. "You'll make that man cut his throat, if you go on at that," said Pollock. "Shall I?"
      said Maxwell. "Then I'll certainly stick to him for the sake of humanity in general." During
      all this time Vavasor sat apart, quite alone, and Bat Smithers grimly kept his place, about
      three hundred yards from him.
"We shan't do any good to-day," said Grindley, coming up to Vavasor.
"I'm sure I don't know," said Vavasor.
"That old fellow has got to be so stupid, he doesn't know what he's about," said Grindley,
      meaning Sir William.
"How can he make the fox break?" said Vavasor; and as his voice was by no means encouraging
      Grindley rode away.
Lunch and cigars lasted till two, during which hour the hounds, the huntsmen, the whips, and
      old Sir William were hard at work, as also were some few others who persistently followed
      every chance of the game. From that till three there were two or three flashes in the pan, and
      false reports as to foxes which had gone away, which first set men galloping, and then made
      them very angry. After three, men began to say naughty things, to abuse Cranby Wood, to wish
      violently that they had remained at home or gone elsewhere, and to speak irreverently of their
      ancient master. "It's the cussidest place in all creation," said Maxwell. "I often said I'd
      not come here any more, and now I say it again."
"And yet you'll be here the next meet," said Grindley, who had sneaked back to his old
      companions in weariness of spirit.
"Grindems, you know a sight too much," said Maxwell; "you do indeed. An ordinary fellow has
      no chance with you."
Grindley was again going to catch it, but was on this time saved by the appearance of the
      huntsman, who came galloping up one of the rides, with a lot of the hounds at his heels.
"He isn't away, Tom, surely?" said Maxwell.
"He's out of the wood somewheres," said Tom;—and off they all went. Vavasor changed his
      horse, getting on to the brown one, and giving up his chestnut mare to Bat Smithers, who
      suggested that he might as well go home to Roebury now. Vavasor gave him no answer, but,
      trotting on to the point where the rides met, stopped a moment and listened carefully. Then he
      took a path diverging away from that by which the huntsmen and the crowd of horsemen had gone,
      and made the best of his way through the wood. At the end of this he came upon Sir William,
      who, with no one near him but his servant, was standing in the pathway of a little
      hunting-gate.
"Hold hard," said Sir William. "The hounds are not out of the wood yet."
"Is the fox away, sir?"
"What's the good of that if we can't get the hounds out?—Yes, he's away. He passed out where
      I'm standing." And then he began to blow his horn lustily, and by degrees other men and a few
      hounds came down the ride. Then Tom, with his horse almost blown, made his appearance outside
      the wood, and soon there came a rush of men, nearly on the top of one another, pushing on, not
      knowing whither, but keenly alive to the fact that the fox had at last consented to move his
      quarters.
Tom touched his hat, and looked at his master, inquiringly. "He's gone for Claydon's," said
      the master. "Try them up that hedgerow." Tom did try them up the hedgerow, and in half a
      minute the hounds came upon the scent. Then you might see men settling their hats on their
      heads, and feeling their feet in the stirrups. The moment for which they had so long waited
      had come, and yet there were many who would now have preferred that the fox should be headed
      back into cover. Some had but little confidence in their half-blown horses;—with many the
      waiting, though so abused and anathematized, was in truth more to their taste than the run
      itself;—with others the excitement had gone by, and a gallop over a field or two was necessary
      before it would be restored. With most men at such a moment there is a little nervousness,
      some fear of making a bad start, a dread lest others should have more of the success of the
      hunt than falls to them. But there was a great rush and a mighty bustle as the hounds made out
      their game, and Sir William felt himself called upon to use the rough side of his tongue to
      more than one delinquent.
And then certain sly old stagers might be seen turning off to the left, instead of following
      the course of the game as indicated by the hounds. They were men who had felt the air as they
      came out, and knew that the fox must soon run down wind, whatever he might do for the first
      half mile or so,—men who knew also which was the shortest way to Claydon's by the road. Ah,
      the satisfaction that there is when these men are thrown out, and their dead knowledge proved
      to be of no avail! If a fox will only run straight, heading from the cover on his real line,
      these very sagacious gentlemen seldom come to much honour and glory.
In the present instance the beast seemed determined to go straight enough, for the hounds
      ran the scent along three or four hedgerows in a line. He had managed to get for himself full
      ten minutes' start, and had been able to leave the cover and all his enemies well behind him
      before he bethought himself as to his best way to his purposed destination. And here, from
      field to field, there were little hunting-gates at which men crowded lustily, poking and
      shoving each other's horses, and hating each other with a bitterness of hatred which is, I
      think, known nowhere else. No hunting man ever wants to jump if he can help it, and the hedges
      near the gate were not alluring. A few there were who made lines for themselves, taking the
      next field to the right, or scrambling through the corners of the fences while the rush was
      going on at the gates; and among these was George Vavasor. He never rode in a crowd, always
      keeping himself somewhat away from men as well as hounds. He would often be thrown out, and
      then men would hear no more of him for that day. On such occasions he did not show himself, as
      other men do, twenty minutes after the fox had been killed or run to ground,—but betook
      himself home by himself, going through the byeways and lanes, thus leaving no report of his
      failure to be spoken of by his compeers.
As long as the line of gates lasted, the crowd continued as thick as ever, and the best man
      was he whose horse could shove the hardest. After passing some four or five fields in this way
      they came out upon a road, and, the scent holding strong, the dogs crossed it without any
      demurring. Then came doubt into the minds of men, many of whom, before they would venture away
      from their position on the lane, narrowly watched the leading hounds to see whether there was
      indication of a turn to the one side or the other. Sir William, whose seventy odd years
      excused him, turned sharp to the left, knowing that he could make Claydon's that way; and very
      many were the submissive horsemen who followed him; a few took the road to the right, having
      in their minds some little game of their own. The hardest riders there had already crossed
      from the road into the country, and were going well to the hounds, ignorant, some of them, of
      the brook before them, and others unheeding. Foremost among these was Burgo Fitzgerald,—Burgo
      Fitzgerald, whom no man had ever known to crane at a fence, or to hug a road, or to spare his
      own neck or his horse's. And yet poor Burgo seldom finished well,—coming to repeated grief in
      this matter of his hunting, as he did so constantly in other matters of his life.
But almost neck and neck with Burgo was Pollock, the sporting literary gentleman. Pollock
      had but two horses to his stud, and was never known to give much money for them;—and he
      weighed without his boots, fifteen stones! No one ever knew how Pollock did it;—more
      especially as all the world declared that he was as ignorant of hunting as any tailor. He
      could ride, or when he couldn't ride he could tumble,—men said that of him,—and he would ride
      as long as the beast under him could go. But few knew the sad misfortunes which poor Pollock
      sometimes encountered;—the muddy ditches in which he was left; the despair with which he would
      stand by his unfortunate horse when the poor brute could no longer move across some
      deep-ploughed field; the miles that he would walk at night beside a tired animal, as he made
      his way slowly back to Roebury!
Then came Tom the huntsman, with Calder Jones close to him, and Grindley intent on winning
      his sovereign. Vavasor had also crossed the road somewhat to the left, carrying with him one
      or two who knew that he was a safe man to follow. Maxwell had been ignominiously turned by the
      hedge, which, together with its ditch, formed a fence such as all men do not love at the
      beginning of a run. He had turned from it, acknowledging the cause. "By George!" said he,
      "that's too big for me yet awhile; and there's no end of a river at the bottom." So he had
      followed the master down the road.
All those whom we have named managed to get over the brook, Pollock's horse barely
      contriving to get up his hind legs from the broken edge of the bank. Some nags refused it, and
      their riders thus lost all their chance of sport for that day. Such is the lot of men who
      hunt. A man pays five or six pounds for his day's amusement, and it is ten to one that the
      occurrences of the day disgust rather than gratify him! One or two got in, and scrambled out
      on the other side, but Tufto Pearlings, the Manchester man from Friday Street, stuck in the
      mud at the bottom, and could not get his mare out till seven men had come with ropes to help
      him. "Where the devil is my fellow?" Pearlings asked of the countrymen; but the countrymen
      could not tell him that "his fellow" with his second horse was riding the hunt with great
      satisfaction to himself.
George Vavasor found that his horse went with him uncommonly well, taking his fences almost
      in the stride of his gallop, and giving unmistakeable signs of good condition. "I wonder what
      it is that's amiss with him," said George to himself, resolving, however, that he would sell
      him that day if he got an opportunity. Straight went the line of the fox, up from the brook,
      and Tom began to say that his master had been wrong about Claydon's.
"Where are we now?" said Burgo, as four or five of them dashed through the open gate of a
      farmyard.
"This is Bulby's farm," said Tom, "and we're going right away for Elmham Wood."
"Elmham Wood be d––––," said a stout farmer, who had come as far as that with them. "You
      won't see Elmham Wood to-day."
"I suppose you know best," said Tom; and then they were through the yard, across another
      road, and down a steep ravine by the side of a little copse. "He's been through them firs, any
      way," said Tom. "To him, Gaylass!" Then up they went the other side of the ravine, and saw the
      body of the hounds almost a field before them at the top.
"I say,—that took some of the wind out of a fellow," said Pollock.
"You mustn't mind about wind now," said Burgo, dashing on.
"Wasn't the pace awful, coming up to that farmhouse?" said Calder Jones, looking round to
      see if Grindley was shaken off. But Grindley, with some six or seven others, was still there.
      And there, also, always in the next field to the left, was George Vavasor. He had spoken no
      word to any one since the hunt commenced, nor had he wished to speak to any one. He desired to
      sell his horse,—and he desired also to succeed in the run for other reasons than that, though
      I think he would have found it difficult to define them.
Now they had open grass land for about a mile, but with very heavy fences,—so that the
      hounds gained upon them a little, and Pollock's weight began to tell. The huntsman and Burgo
      were leading with some fortunate county gentleman whose good stars had brought him in upon
      them at the farmyard gate. It is the injustice of such accidents as this that breaks the heart
      of a man who has honestly gone through all the heat and work of the struggle! And the hounds
      had veered a little round to the left, making, after all, for Claydon's. "Darned if the Squire
      warn't right," said Tom. Sir William, though a baronet, was familiarly called the Squire
      throughout the hunt.
"We ain't going for Claydon's now?" asked Burgo.
"Them's Claydon's beeches we sees over there," said Tom. "'Tain't often the Squire's
      wrong."
Here they came to a little double rail and a little quick-set hedge. A double rail is a
      nasty fence always if it has been made any way strong, and one which a man with a wife and a
      family is justified in avoiding. They mostly can be avoided, having gates; and this could have
      been avoided. But Burgo never avoided anything, and went over it beautifully. The difficulty
      is to be discreet when the man before one has been indiscreet. Tom went for the gate, as did
      Pollock, who knew that he could have no chance at the double rails. But Calder Jones came to
      infinite grief, striking the top bar of the second rail, and going head-foremost out of his
      saddle, as though thrown by a catapult. There we must leave him. Grindley, rejoicing greatly
      at this discomfiture, made for the gate; but the country gentleman with the fresh horse
      accomplished the rails, and was soon alongside of Burgo.
"I didn't see you at the start," said Burgo.
"And I didn't see you," said the country gentleman; "so it's even."
Burgo did not see the thing in the same light, but he said no more. Grindley and Tom were
      soon after them, Tom doing his utmost to shake off the attorney. Pollock was coming on also;
      but the pace had been too much for him, and though the ground rode light his poor beast
      laboured and grunted sorely. The hounds were still veering somewhat to the left, and Burgo,
      jumping over a small fence into the same field with them, saw that there was a horseman ahead
      of him. This was George Vavasor, who was going well, without any symptom of distress.
And now they were at Claydon's, having run over some seven miles of ground in about
      thirty-five minutes. To those who do not know what hunting is, this pace does not seem very
      extraordinary; but it had been quite quick enough, as was testified by the horses which had
      gone the distance. Our party entered Claydon's Park at back, through a gate in the park
      palings that was open on hunting days; but a much more numerous lot was there almost as soon
      as them, who had come in by the main entrance. This lot was headed by Sir William, and our
      friend Maxwell was with him.
"A jolly thing so far," said Burgo to Maxwell; "about the best we've had this year."
"I didn't see a yard of it," said Maxwell. "I hadn't nerve to get off the first road, and I
      haven't been off it ever since." Maxwell was a man who never lied about his hunting, or had
      the slightest shame in riding roads. "Who's been with you?" said he.
"There've been Tom and I;—and Calder Jones was there for a while. I think he killed himself
      somewhere. And there was Pollock, and your friend Grindley, and a chap whose name I don't know
      who dropped out of heaven about half-way in the run; and there was another man whose back I
      saw just now; there he is,—by heavens, it's Vavasor! I didn't know he was here."
They hung about the Claydon covers for ten minutes, and then their fox went off again,—their
      fox or another, as to which there was a great discussion afterwards; but he who would have
      suggested the idea of a new fox to Sir William would have been a bold man. A fox, however,
      went off, turning still to the left from Claydon's towards Roebury. Those ten minutes had
      brought up some fifty men; but it did not bring up Calder Jones nor Tufto Pearlings, nor some
      half-dozen others who had already come to serious misfortune; but Grindley was there, very
      triumphant in his own success, and already talking of Jones's sovereign. And Pollock was there
      also, thankful for the ten minutes' law, and trusting that wind might be given to his horse to
      finish the run triumphantly.
But the pace on leaving Claydon's was better than ever. This may have come from the fact
      that the scent was keener, as they got out so close upon their game. But I think they must
      have changed their fox. Maxwell, who saw him go, swore that he was fresh and clean. Burgo said
      that he knew it to be the same fox, but gave no reason. "Same fox! in course it was; why
      shouldn't it be the same?" said Tom. The country gentleman who had dropped from heaven was
      quite sure that they had changed, and so were most of those who had ridden the road. Pollock
      confined himself to hoping that he might soon be killed, and that thus his triumph for the day
      might be assured.
On they went, and the pace soon became too good for the poor author. His horse at last
      refused a little hedge, and there was not another trot to be got out of him. That night
      Pollock turned up at Roebury about nine o'clock, very hungry,—and it was known that his animal
      was alive;—but the poor horse ate not a grain of oats that night, nor on the next morning.
      Vavasor had again taken a line to himself, on this occasion a little to the right of the meet;
      but Maxwell followed him and rode close with him to the end. Burgo for a while still led the
      body of the field, incurring at first much condemnation from Sir William,—nominally for
      hurrying on among the hounds, but in truth because he got before Sir William himself. During
      this latter part of the run Sir William stuck to the hounds in spite of his seventy odd years.
      Going down into Marham Bottom, some four or five were left behind, for they feared the soft
      ground near the river, and did not know the pass through it. But Sir William knew it, and
      those who remained close to him got over that trouble. Burgo, who would still lead, nearly
      foundered in the bog;—but he was light, and his horse pulled him through,—leaving a fore-shoe
      in the mud. After that Burgo was contented to give Sir William the lead.
Then they came up by Marham Pits to Cleshey Small Wood, which they passed without hanging
      there a minute, and over the grass lands of Cleshey Farm. Here Vavasor and Maxwell joined the
      others, having gained some three hundred yards in distance by their course, but having been
      forced to jump the Marham Stream which Sir William had forded. The pace now was as good as the
      horses could make it,—and perhaps something better as regarded some of them. Sir William's
      servant had been with him, and he had got his second horse at Claydon's; Maxwell had been
      equally fortunate; Tom's second horse had not come up, and his beast was in great distress;
      Grindley had remained behind at Marham Bottom, being contented perhaps with having beaten
      Calder Jones,—from whom by-the-by I may here declare that he never got his sovereign. Burgo,
      Vavasor, and the country gentleman still held on; but it was devoutly desired by all of them
      that the fox might soon come to the end of his tether. Ah! that intense longing that the fox
      may fail, when the failings of the horse begin to make themselves known,—and the consciousness
      comes on that all that one has done will go for nothing unless the thing can be brought to a
      close in a field or two! So far you have triumphed, leaving scores of men behind; but of what
      good is all that, if you also are to be left behind at the last?
It was manifest now to all who knew the country that the fox was making for Thornden Deer
      Park, but Thornden Deer Park was still two miles ahead of them, and the hounds were so near to
      their game that the poor beast could hardly hope to live till he got there. He had tried a
      well-known drain near Cleshey Farm House; but it had been inhospitably, nay cruelly, closed
      against him. Soon after that he threw himself down in a ditch, and the eager hounds overran
      him, giving him a moment's law,—and giving also a moment's law to horses that wanted it as
      badly. "I'm about done for," said Burgo to Maxwell. "Luckily for you," said Maxwell, "the fox
      is much in the same way."
But the fox had still more power left in him than poor Burgo Fitzgerald's horse. He gained a
      minute's check and then he started again, being viewed away by Sir William himself. The
      country gentleman of whom mention has been made also viewed him, and holloa'd as he did so:
      "Yoicks, tally; gone away!" The unfortunate man! "What the d–––– are you roaring at?" said Sir
      William. "Do you suppose I don't know where the fox is?" Whereupon the country gentleman
      retreated, and became less conspicuous than he had been.
Away they went again, off Cleshey and into Thornden parish, on the land of Sorrel Farm,—a
      spot well to be remembered by one or two ever afterwards. Here Sir William made for a gate
      which took him a little out of the line, but Maxwell and Burgo Fitzgerald, followed by
      Vavasor, went straight ahead. There was a huge ditch and boundary bank there which Sir William
      had known and had avoided. Maxwell, whose pluck had returned to him at last, took it well. His
      horse was comparatively fresh and made nothing of it. Then came poor Burgo! Oh, Burgo, hadst
      thou not have been a very child, thou shouldst have known that now, at this time of the
      day,—after all that thy gallant horse had done for thee,—it was impossible to thee or him. But
      when did Burgo Fitzgerald know anything? He rode at the bank as though it had been the first
      fence of the day, striking his poor beast with his spurs, as though muscle, strength, and new
      power could be imparted by their rowels. The animal rose at the bank and in some way got upon
      it, scrambling as he struck it with his chest, and then fell headlong into the ditch at the
      other side, a confused mass of head, limbs, and body. His career was at an end, and he had
      broken his heart! Poor noble beast, noble in vain! To his very last gasp he had done his best,
      and had deserved that he should have been in better hands. His master's ignorance had killed
      him. There are men who never know how little a horse can do,—or how much!
There was to some extent a gap in the fence when Maxwell had first ridden it and Burgo had
      followed him; a gap, or break in the hedge at the top, indicating plainly the place at which a
      horse could best get over. To this spot Vavasor followed, and was on the bank at Burgo's heels
      before he knew what had happened. But the man had got away and only the horse lay there in the
      ditch. "Are you hurt?" said Vavasor; "can I do anything?" But he did not stop, "If you can
      find a chap just send him to me," said Burgo in a melancholy tone. Then he sat down, with his
      feet in the ditch, and looked at the carcase of his horse.
There was no more need of jumping that day. The way was open into the next field,—a turnip
      field,—and there amidst the crisp breaking turnip-tops, with the breath of his enemies hot
      upon him, with their sharp teeth at his entrails, biting at them impotently in the agonies of
      his death struggle, poor Reynard finished his career. Maxwell was certainly the first
      there,—but Sir William and George Vavasor were close upon him. That taking of brushes of which
      we used to hear is a little out of fashion; but if such honour were due to any one it was due
      to Vavasor, for he and he only had ridden the hunt throughout. But he claimed no honour, and
      none was specially given to him. He and Maxwell rode homewards together, having sent
      assistance to poor Burgo Fitzgerald; and as they went along the road, saying but little to
      each other, Maxwell, in a very indifferent voice, asked him a question.
"What do you want for that horse, Vavasor?"
"A hundred and fifty," said Vavasor.
"He's mine," said Maxwell. So the brown horse was sold for about half his value, because he
      had brought with him a bad character.
