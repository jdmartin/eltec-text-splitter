CHAPTER LXII. Going Abroad.  
One morning, early in May, a full week before Alice's visit to the bankers' at Charing
      Cross, a servant in grand livery, six feet high, got out of a cab at the door in Queen Anne
      Street, and sent up a note for Miss Vavasor, declaring that he would wait in the cab for her
      answer. He had come from Lady Glencora, and had been specially ordered to go in a cab and come
      back in a cab, and make himself as like a Mercury, with wings to his feet, as may be possible
      to a London footman. Mr. Palliser had arranged his plans with his wife that morning,—or, I
      should more correctly say, had given her his orders, and she, in consequence, had sent away
      her Mercury in hot pressing haste to Queen Anne Street. "Do come;—instantly if you can," the
      note said. "I have so much to tell you, and so much to ask of you. If you can't come, when
      shall I find you, and where?" Alice sent back a note, saying that she would be in Park Lane as
      soon as she could put on her bonnet and walk down; and then the Mercury went home in his
      cab.
Alice found her friend in the small breakfast-room up-stairs, sitting close by the window.
      They had not as yet met since the evening of Lady Monk's party, nor had Lady Glencora seen
      Alice in the mourning which she now wore for her grandfather. "Oh, dear, what a change it
      makes in you," she said. "I never thought of your being in black."
"I don't know what it is you want, but shan't I do in mourning as well as I would in
      colours?"
"You'll do in anything, dear. But I have so much to tell you, and I don't know how to begin.
      And I've so much to ask of you, and I'm so afraid you won't do it."
"You generally find me very complaisant."
"No I don't, dear. It is very seldom you will do anything for me. But I must tell you
      everything first. Do take your bonnet off, for I shall be hours in doing it."
"Hours in telling me!"
"Yes; and in getting your consent to what I want you to do. But I think I'll tell you that
      first. I'm to be taken abroad immediately."
"Who is to take you?"
"Ah, you may well ask that. If you could know what questions I have asked myself on that
      head! I sometimes say things to myself as though they were the most proper and reasonable
      things in the world, and then within an hour or two I hate myself for having thought of
      them."
"But why don't you answer me? Who is going abroad with you?"
"Well; you are to be one of the party."
"I!"
"Yes; you. When I have named so very respectable a chaperon for my youth, of course you will
      understand that my husband is to take us."
"But Mr. Palliser can't leave London at this time of the year?"
"That's just it. He is to leave London at this time of the year. Don't look in that way, for
      it's all settled. Whether you go with me or not, I've got to go. To-day is Tuesday. We are to
      be off next Tuesday night, if you can make yourself ready. We shall breakfast in Paris on
      Wednesday morning, and then it will be to us all just as if we were in a new world. Mr.
      Palliser will walk up and down the new court of the Louvre, and you will be on his left arm,
      and I shall be on his right,—just like English people,—and it will be the most proper thing
      that ever was seen in life. Then we shall go on to Basle"—Alice shuddered as Basle was
      mentioned, thinking of the balcony over the river—"and so to Lucerne—. But no; that
      was the first plan, and Mr. Palliser altered it. He spent a whole day up here with maps and
      Bradshaw's and Murray's guide-books, and he scolded me so because I didn't care whether we
      went first to Baden or to some other place. How could I care? I told him I would go anywhere
      he chose to take me. Then he told me I was heartless;—and I acknowledged that I was heartless.
      'I am heartless,' I said. 'Tell me something I don't know.'"
"Oh, Cora, why did you say that?"
"I didn't choose to contradict my husband. Besides, it's true. Then he threw the Bradshaw
      away, and all the maps flew about. So I picked them up again, and said we'd go to Switzerland
      first. I knew that would settle it, and of course he decided on stopping at Baden. If he had
      said Jericho, it would have been the same thing to me. Wouldn't you like to go to
      Jericho?"
"I should have no special objection to Jericho."
"But you are to go to Baden instead."
"I've said nothing about that yet. But you have not told me half your story. Why is Mr.
      Palliser going abroad in the middle of Parliament in this way?"
"Ah; now I must go back to the beginning. And indeed, Alice, I hardly know how to tell you;
      not that I mind you knowing it, only there are some things that won't get themselves told. You
      can hardly guess what it is that he is giving up. You must swear that you won't repeat what
      I'm going to tell you now?"
"I'm not a person apt to tell secrets, but I shan't swear anything."
"What a woman you are for discretion! it is you that ought to be Chancellor of the
      Exchequer; you are so wise. Only you haven't brought your own pigs to the best market, after
      all."
"Never mind my own pigs now, Cora."
"I do mind them, very much. But the secret is this. They have asked Mr. Palliser to be
      Chancellor of the Exchequer, and he has—refused. Think of that!"
"But why?"
"Because of me,—of me, and my folly, and wickedness, and abominations. Because he has been
      fool enough to plague himself with a wife—he who of all men ought to have kept himself free
      from such troubles. Oh, he has been so good! It is almost impossible to make any one
      understand it. If you could know how he has longed for this office;—how he has worked for it
      day and night, wearing his eyes out with figures when everybody else has been asleep, shutting
      himself up with such creatures as Mr. Bott when other men have been shooting and hunting and
      flirting and spending their money. He has been a slave to it for years,—all his life I
      believe,—in order that he might sit in the Cabinet, and be a minister and a Chancellor of the
      Exchequer. He has hoped and feared, and has been, I believe, sometimes half-mad with
      expectation. This has been his excitement,—what racing and gambling are to other men. At last,
      the place was there, ready for him, and they offered it to him. They begged him to take it,
      almost on their knees. The Duke of St. Bungay was here all one morning about it; but Mr.
      Palliser sent him away, and refused the place. It's all over now, and the other man, whom they
      all hate so much, is to remain in."
"But why did he refuse it?"
"I keep on telling you—because of me. He found that I wanted looking after, and that Mrs.
      Marsham and Mr. Bott between them couldn't do it."
"Oh, Cora! how can you talk in that way?"
"If you knew all, you might well ask how I could. You remember about Lady Monk's ball, that
      you would not go to,—as you ought to have done. If you had gone, Mr. Palliser would have been
      Chancellor of the Exchequer at this minute; he would, indeed. Only think of that! But though
      you did not go, other people did who ought to have remained at home. I went for one,—and you
      know who was there for another."
"What difference could that make to you?" said Alice, angrily.
"It might have made a great deal of difference. And, for the matter of that, so it did. Mr.
      Palliser was there too, but, of course, he went away immediately. I can't tell you all the
      trouble there had been about Mrs. Marsham,—whether I was to take her with me or not. However,
      I wouldn't take her, and didn't take her. The carriage went for her first, and there she was
      when we got there; and Mr. Bott was there too. I wonder whether I shall ever make you
      understand it all."
"There are some things I don't want to understand."
"There they both were watching me,—looking at me the whole evening; and, of course, I
      resolved that I would not be put down by them."
"I think, if I had been you, I would not have allowed their presence to make any difference
      to me."
"That is very easily said, my dear, but by no means so easily done. You can't make yourself
      unconscious of eyes that are always looking at you. I dared them, at any rate, to do their
      worst, for I stood up to dance with Burgo Fitzgerald."
"Oh, Cora!"
"Why shouldn't I? At any rate I did; and I waltzed with him for half an hour. Alice, I never
      will waltz again;—never. I have done with dancing now. I don't think, even in my maddest days,
      I ever kept it up so long as I did then. And I knew that everybody was looking at me. It was
      not only Mrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott, but everybody there. I felt myself to be desperate,—mad,
      like a wild woman. There I was, going round and round and round with the only man for whom I
      ever cared two straws. It seemed as though everything had been a dream since the old days. Ah!
      how well I remember the first time I danced with him,—at his aunt's house in Cavendish Square.
      They had only just brought me out in London then, and I thought that he was a god."
"Cora! I cannot bear to hear you talk like that."
"I know well enough that he is no god now; some people say that he is a devil, but he was
      like Apollo to me then. Did you ever see anyone so beautiful as he is?"
"I never saw him at all."
"I wish you could have seen him; but you will some day. I don't know whether you care for
      men being handsome." Alice thought of John Grey, who was the handsomest man that she knew, but
      she made no answer. "I do; or, rather, I used to do," continued Lady Glencora. "I don't think
      I care much about anything now; but I don't see why handsome men should not be run after as
      much as handsome women."
"But you wouldn't have a girl run after any man, would you; whether handsome or ugly?"
"But they do, you know. When I saw him the other night he was just as handsome as ever;—the
      same look, half wild and half tame, like an animal you cannot catch, but which you think would
      love you so if you could catch him. In a little while it was just like the old time, and I had
      made up my mind to care nothing for the people looking at me."
"And you think that was right?"
"No, I don't. Yes, I do; that is. It wasn't right to care about dancing with him, but it was
      right to disregard all the people gaping round. What was it to them? Why should they care who
      I danced with?"
"That is nonsense, dear, and you must know that it is so. If you were to see a woman
      misbehaving herself in public, would not you look on and make your comments? Could you help
      doing so if you were to try?"
"You are very severe, Alice. Misbehaving in public!"
"Yes, Cora. I am only taking your own story. According to that, you were misbehaving in
      public."
Lady Glencora got up from her chair near the window, on which she had been crouching close
      to Alice's knees, and walked away towards the fireplace. "What am I to say to you, or how am I
      to talk to you?" said Alice. "You would not have me tell you a lie?"
"Of all things in the world, I hate a prude the most," said Lady Glencora.
"Cora, look here. If you consider it prudery on my part to disapprove of your waltzing with
      Mr. Fitzgerald in the manner you have described,—or, indeed, in any other manner,—you and I
      must differ so totally about the meaning of words and the nature of things that we had better
      part."
"Alice, you are the unkindest creature that ever lived. You are as cold as stone. I
      sometimes think that you can have no heart."
"I don't mind your saying that. Whether I have a heart or not I will leave you to find out
      for yourself; but I won't be called a prude by you. You know you were wrong to dance with that
      man. What has come of it? What have you told me yourself this morning? In order to preserve
      you from misery and destruction, Mr. Palliser has given up all his dearest hopes. He has had
      to sacrifice himself that he might save you. That, I take it, is about the truth of it,—and
      yet you tell me that you have done no wrong."
"I never said so." Now she had come back to her chair by the window, and was again sitting
      in that crouching form. "I never said that I was not wrong. Of course I was wrong. I have been
      so wrong throughout that I have never been right yet. Let me tell it on to the end, and then
      you can go away if you like, and tell me that I am too wicked for your friendship."
"Have I ever said anything like that, Cora?"
"But you will, I dare say, when I have done. Well; what do you think my senior duenna
      did,—the female one, I mean? She took my own carriage, and posted off after Mr. Palliser as
      hard as ever she could, leaving the male duenna on the watch. I was dancing as hard as I
      could, but I knew what was going on all the time as well as though I had heard them talking.
      Of course Mr. Palliser came after me. I don't know what else he could do, unless, indeed, he
      had left me to my fate. He came there, and behaved so well,—so much like a perfect gentleman.
      Of course I went home, and I was prepared to tell him everything, if he spoke a word to
      me,—that I intended to leave him, and that cart-ropes should not hold me!"
"To leave him, Cora!"
"Yes, and go with that other man whose name you won't let me mention. I had a letter from
      him in my pocket asking me to go. He asked me a dozen times that night. I cannot think how it
      was that I did not consent."
"That you did not consent to your own ruin and disgrace?"
"That I did not consent to go off with him,—anywhere. Of course it would have been my own
      destruction. I'm not such a fool as not to know that. Do you suppose I have never thought of
      it;—what it would be to be a man's mistress instead of his wife. If I had not I should be a
      thing to be hated and despised. When once I had done it I should hate and despise myself. I
      should feel myself to be loathsome, and, as it were, a beast among women. But why did they not
      let me marry him, instead of driving me to this? And though I might have destroyed myself, I
      should have saved the man who is still my husband. Do you know, I told him all that,—told him
      that if I had gone away with Burgo Fitzgerald he would have another wife, and would have
      children, and would—?"
"You told your husband that you had thought of leaving him?"
"Yes; I told him everything. I told him that I dearly loved that poor fellow, for whom, as I
      believe, nobody else on earth cares a single straw."
"And what did he say?"
"I cannot tell you what he said, only that we are all to go to Baden together, and then to
      Italy. But he did not seem a bit angry; he very seldom is angry, unless at some trumpery
      thing, as when he threw the book away. And when I told him that he might have another wife and
      a child, he put his arm round me and whispered to me that he did not care so much about it as
      I had imagined. I felt more like loving him at that moment than I had ever done before."
"He must be fit to be an angel."
"He's fit to be a cabinet minister, which, I'm quite sure, he'd like much better. And now
      you know everything; but no,—there is one thing you don't know yet. When I tell you that,
      you'll want to make him an archangel or a prime minister. 'We'll go abroad,' he said,—and
      remember, this was his own proposition, made long before I was able to speak a word;—'We'll go
      abroad, and you shall get your cousin Alice to go with us.' That touched me more than
      anything. Only think if he had proposed Mrs. Marsham!"
"But yet he does not like me."
"You're wrong there, Alice. There has been no question of liking or of disliking. He thought
      you would be a kind of Mrs. Marsham, and when you were not, but went out flirting among the
      ruins with Jeffrey Palliser, instead—"
"I never went out flirting with Jeffrey Palliser."
"He did with you, which is all the same thing. And when Plantagenet knew of that,—for, of
      course, Mr. Bott told him—"
"Mr. Bott can't see everything."
"Those men do. The worst is, they see more than everything. But, at any rate, Mr. Palliser
      has got over all that now. Come, Alice; the fact of the offer having come from himself should
      disarm you of any such objection as that. As he has held out his hand to you, you have no
      alternative but to take it."
"I will take his hand willingly."
"And for my sake you will go with us? He understands himself that I am not fit to be his
      companion, and to have no companion but him. Now there is a spirit of wisdom about you that
      will do for him, and a spirit of folly that will suit me. I can manage to put myself on a par
      with a girl who has played such a wild game with her lovers as you have done."
Alice would give no promise then. Her first objection was that she had undertaken to go down
      to Westmoreland and comfort Kate in the affliction of her broken arm. "And I must go," said
      Alice, remembering how necessary it was that she should plead her own cause with George
      Vavasor's sister. But she acknowledged that she had not intended to stay long in Westmoreland,
      probably not more than a week, and it was at last decided that the Pallisers should postpone
      their journey for four or five days, and that Alice should go with them immediately upon her
      return from Vavasor Hall.
"I have no objection;" said her father, speaking with that voice of resignation which men
      use when they are resolved to consider themselves injured whatever may be done. "I can get
      along in lodgings. I suppose we had better leave the house, as you have given away so much of
      your own fortune?" Alice did not think it worth her while to point out to him, in answer to
      this, that her contribution to their joint housekeeping should still remain the same as ever.
      Such, however, she knew would be the fact, and she knew also that she would find her father in
      the old house when she returned from her travels. To her, in her own great troubles, the
      absence from London would be as serviceable as it could be to Lady Glencora. Indeed, she had
      already begun to feel the impossibility of staying quietly at home. She could lecture her
      cousin, whose faults were open, easy to be defined, and almost loud in their nature; but she
      was not on that account the less aware of her own. She knew that she too had cause to be
      ashamed of herself. She was half afraid to show her face among her friends, and wept
      grievously over her own follies. Those cruel words of her father rang in her ears
      constantly:—"Things of that sort are so often over with you." The reproach, though cruel, was
      true, and what reproach more galling could be uttered to an unmarried girl such as was Alice
      Vavasor? She had felt from the first moment in which the proposition was made to her, that it
      would be well that she should for a while leave her home, and especially that drawing-room in
      Queen Anne Street, which told her so many tales that she would fain forget, if it were
      possible.
Mr. Palliser would not allow his wife to remain in London for the ten or twelve days which
      must yet elapse before they started, nor could he send her into the country alone. He took her
      down to Matching Priory, having obtained leave to be absent from the House for the remainder
      of the Session, and remained with her there till within two days of their departure. That week
      down at Matching, as she afterwards told Alice, was very terrible. He never spoke a word to
      rebuke her. He never hinted that there had been aught in her conduct of which he had cause to
      complain. He treated her with a respect that was perfect, and indeed with more outward signs
      of affection than had ever been customary with him. "But," as Lady Glencora afterwards
      expressed it, "he was always looking after me. I believe he thought that Burgo Fitzgerald had
      hidden himself among the ruins," she said once to Alice. "He never suspected me, I am sure of
      that; but he thought that he ought to look after me." And Lady Glencora in this had very
      nearly hit the truth. Mr. Palliser had resolved, from that hour in which he had walked out
      among the elms in Kensington Gardens, that he would neither suspect his wife, nor treat her as
      though he suspected her. The blame had been his, perhaps, more than it had been hers. So much
      he had acknowledged to himself, thinking of the confession she had made to him before their
      marriage. But it was manifestly his imperative duty,—his duty of duties,—to save her from that
      pitfall into which, as she herself had told him, she had been so ready to fall. For her sake
      and for his this must be done. It was a duty so imperative, that in its performance he had
      found himself forced to abandon his ambition. To have his wife taken from him would be
      terrible, but the having it said all over the world that such a misfortune had come upon him
      would be almost more terrible even than that.
So he went with his wife hither and thither, down at Matching, allowing himself to be driven
      about behind Dandy and Flirt. He himself proposed these little excursions. They were tedious
      to him, but doubly tedious to his wife, who now found it more difficult than ever to talk to
      him. She struggled to talk, and he struggled to talk, but the very struggles themselves made
      the thing impossible. He sat with her in the mornings, and he sat with her in the evenings; he
      breakfasted with her, lunched with her, and dined with her. He went to bed early, having no
      figures which now claimed his attention. And so the week at last wore itself away. "I saw him
      yawning sometimes," Lady Glencora said afterwards, "as though he would fall in pieces."
