CHAPTER LXXI. Showing How George Vavasor Received a Visit.  
We must go back for a few pages to scenes which happened in London during this summer, so
      that the reader may understand Mr. Grey's position when he reached Lucerne. He had undergone
      another quarrel with George Vavasor, and something of the circumstances of that quarrel must
      be told.
It has been already said that George Vavasor lost his election for the Chelsea Districts,
      after all the money which he had spent,—money which he had been so ill able to spend, and on
      which he had laid his hands in a manner so disreputable! He had received two thousand pounds
      from the bills which Alice had executed on his behalf,—or rather, had received the full value
      of three out of the four bills, and a part of the value of the fourth, on which he had been
      driven to raise what immediate money he had wanted by means of a Jew bill-discounter. One
      thousand pounds he had paid over at once into the hands of Mr. Scruby, his Parliamentary
      election agent, towards the expenses of his election; and when the day of polling arrived had
      exactly in his hands the sum of five hundred pounds. Where he was to get more when this was
      gone he did not know. If he were successful,—if the enlightened constituents of the Chelsea
      Districts, contented with his efforts on behalf of the River Bank, should again send him to
      Parliament, he thought that he might still carry on the war. A sum of ready money he would
      have in hand; and, as to his debts, he would be grandly indifferent to any consideration of
      them. Then there might be pickings in the way of a Member of Parliament of his calibre.
      Companies,—mercantile companies,—would be glad to have him as a director, paying him a guinea
      a day, or perhaps more, for his hour's attendance. Railways in want of vice-chairmen might bid
      for his services; and in the City he might turn that "M.P." which belonged to him to good
      account in various ways. With such a knowledge of the City world as he possessed, he thought
      that he could pick up a living in London, if only he could retain his seat in Parliament.
But what was he to do if he could not retain it? No sooner had Mr. Scruby got the thousand
      pounds into his clutches than he pressed for still more money. George Vavasor, with some show
      of justice on his side, pointed out to this all-devouring agent that the sum demanded had
      already been paid. This Mr. Scruby admitted, declaring that he was quite prepared to go on
      without any further immediate remittance, although by doing so might subject himself to
      considerable risk. But another five hundred pounds, paid at once, would add greatly to the
      safety of the seat; whereas eight hundred judiciously thrown in at the present moment would
      make the thing quite secure. But Vavasor swore to himself that he would not part with another
      shilling. Never had he felt such love for money as he did for that five hundred pounds which
      he now held in his pocket. "It's no use," he said to Mr. Scruby. "I have done what you asked,
      and would have done more had you asked for more at that time. As it is, I cannot make another
      payment before the election." Mr. Scruby shrugged his shoulders, and said that he would do his
      best. But George Vavasor soon knew that the man was not doing his best,—that the man had, in
      truth, abandoned his cause. The landlord of the "Handsome Man" jeered him when he went there
      canvassing. "Laws, Mr. Vavasor!" said the landlord of the "Handsome Man," "you're not at all
      the fellow for us chaps along the river,—you ain't. You're afraid to come down with the
      stumpy,—that's what you are." George put his hand upon his purse, and acknowledged to himself
      that he had been afraid to come down with the stumpy.
For the last five days of the affair George Vavasor knew that his chance was gone. Mr.
      Scruby's face, manner, and words, told the result of the election as plainly as any subsequent
      figures could do. He would be absent when Vavasor called, or the clerk would say that he was
      absent. He would answer in very few words, constantly shrugging his shoulders. He would even
      go away and leave the anxious candidate while he was in the middle of some discussion as to
      his plans. It was easy to see that Mr. Scruby no longer regarded him as a successful man, and
      the day of the poll showed very plainly how right Mr. Scruby had been.
George Vavasor was rejected, but he still had his five hundred pounds in his pocket. Of
      course he was subject to that mortification which a man feels when he reflects that some
      little additional outlay would have secured his object. Whether it might have been so, or not,
      who can say? But there he was, with the gateway between the lamps barred against him,
      ex-Member of Parliament for the Chelsea Districts, with five hundred pounds in his pocket, and
      little or nothing else that he could call his own. What was he to do with himself?
After trying to make himself heard upon the hustings when he was rejected, and pledging
      himself to stand again at the next election, he went home to his lodgings in Cecil Street, and
      endeavoured to consider calmly his position in the world. He had lost his inheritance. He had
      abandoned one profession after another, and was now beyond the pale of another chance in that
      direction. His ambition had betrayed him, and there were no longer possible to him any hopes
      of political activity. He had estranged from himself every friend that he had ever possessed.
      He had driven from him with violence the devotion even of his sister. He had robbed the girl
      whom he intended to marry of her money, and had so insulted her that no feeling of amity
      between them was any longer possible. He had nothing now but himself and that five hundred
      pounds, which he still held in his pocket. What should he do with himself and his money? He
      thought over it all with outer calmness for awhile, as he sat there in his arm-chair.
From the moment in which he had first become convinced that the election would go against
      him, and that he was therefore ruined on all sides, he had resolved that he would be calm
      amidst his ruin. Sometimes he assumed a little smile, as though he were laughing at his own
      position. Mr. Bott's day of rejection had come before his own, and he had written to Mr. Bott
      a drolling note of consolation and mock sympathy. He had shaken hands with Mr. Scruby, and had
      poked his fun at the agent, bidding him be sure to send in his little bill soon. To all who
      accosted him, he replied in a subrisive tone; and he bantered Calder Jones, whose seat was
      quite sure, till Calder Jones began to have fears that were quite unnecessary. And now, as he
      sat himself down, intending to come to some final decision as to what he would do, he
      maintained the same calmness. He smiled in the same way, though there was no one there to see
      the smile. He laughed even audibly once or twice, as he vainly endeavoured to persuade himself
      that he was able to regard the world and all that belonged to it as a bubble.
There came to him a moment in which he laughed out very audibly. "Ha! ha!" he shouted,
      rising up from his chair, and he walked about the room, holding a large paper-knife in his
      hand. "Ha! ha!" Then he threw the knife away from him, and thrusting his hands into his
      trousers-pockets, laughed again—"Ha! ha!" He stood still in the centre of the room, and the
      laughter was very plainly visible on his face, had there been anybody there to see it.
But suddenly there was a change upon his face, as he stood there all alone, and his eyes
      became fierce, and the cicatrice that marred his countenance grew to be red and ghastly, and
      he grinned with his teeth, and he clenched his fists as he still held them within his pockets.
      "Curse him!" he said out loud. "Curse him, now and for ever!" He had broken down in his
      calmness, when he thought of that old man who had opposed him during his life, and had ruined
      him at his death. "May all the evils which the dead can feel cling to him for ever and ever!"
      His laughter was all gone, and his assumed tranquillity had deserted him. Walking across the
      room, he struck his foot against a chair; upon this, he took the chair in his hands, and threw
      it across the room. But he hardly arrested the torrent of his maledictions as he did so. What
      good was it that he should lie to himself by that mock tranquillity, or that false laughter?
      He lied to himself no longer, but uttered a song of despair that was true enough. What should
      he do? Where should he go? From what fountain should he attempt to draw such small draughts of
      the water of comfort as might support him at the present moment? Unless a man have some such
      fountain to which he can turn, the burden of life cannot be borne. For the moment, Vavasor
      tried to find such fountain in a bottle of brandy which stood near him. He half filled a
      tumbler, and then, dashing some water on it, swallowed it greedily. "By ––––!" he said, "I
      believe it is the best thing a man can do."
But where was he to go? to whom was he to turn himself? He went to a high desk which stood
      in one corner of the room, and unlocking it, took out a revolving pistol, and for a while
      carried it about with him in his hand. He turned it up, and looked at it, and tried the lock,
      and snapped it without caps, to see that the barrel went round fairly. "It's a beggarly thing
      to do," he said, and then he turned the pistol down again; "and if I do do it, I'll use it
      first for another purpose." Then he poured out for himself more brandy-and-water, and having
      drunk it, he threw himself upon the sofa, and seemed to sleep.
But he did not sleep, and by-and-by there came a slight single knock at the door, which he
      instantly answered. But he did not answer it in the usual way by bidding the comer to come in.
      "Who's there?" he said. Then the comer attempted to enter, turning the handle of the door. But
      the door had been locked, and the key was on Vavasor's side. "Who's there?" he asked again,
      speaking out loudly, but in an angry voice. "It is I," said a woman's voice. "D––––ation!"
      said George Vavasor.
The woman heard him, but she made no sign of having heard him. She simply remained standing
      where she was till something further should be done within. She knew the man well, and knew
      that she must bide his time. She was very patient,—and for the time was meek, though it might
      be that there would come an end to her meekness. Vavasor, when he had heard her voice, and
      knew who was there, had again thrown himself on the sofa. There flashed across his mind
      another thought or two as to his future career,—another idea about the pistol, which still lay
      upon the table. Why should he let the intruder in, and undergo the nuisance of a disagreeable
      interview, if the end of all things might come in time to save him from such trouble? There he
      lay for ten minutes thinking, and then the low single knock was heard again. He jumped upon
      his feet, and his eyes were full of fire. He knew that it was useless to bid her go and leave
      him. She would sit there, if it were through the whole night. Should he open the door and
      strangle her, and pass out over her with the pistol in his hand, so that he might make that
      other reckoning which he desired to accomplish, and then never come back any more?
He took a turn through the room, and then walked gently up to the door, and undid the lock.
      He did not open the door, nor did he bid his visitor enter, but having made the way easy for
      her if she chose to come in, he walked back to the sofa and threw himself on it again. As he
      did so, he passed his hand across the table so as to bring the pistol near to himself at the
      place where he would be lying. She paused a moment after she had heard the sound of the key,
      and then she made her way into the room. He did not at first speak to her. She closed the door
      very gently, and then, looking around, came up to the foot of the sofa. She paused a moment,
      waiting for him to address her; but as he said nothing, but lay there looking at her, she was
      the first to speak. "George," she said, "what am I to do?"
She was a woman of about thirty years of age, dressed poorly, in old garments, but still
      with decency, and with some attempt at feminine prettiness. There were flowers in the bonnet
      on her head, though the bonnet had that unmistakable look of age which is quite as distressing
      to bonnets as it is to women, and the flowers themselves were battered and faded. She had long
      black ringlets on each cheek, hanging down much below her face, and brought forward so as to
      hide in some degree the hollowness of her jaws. Her eyes had a peculiar brightness, but now
      they left on those who looked at her cursorily no special impression as to their colour. They
      had been blue,—that dark violet blue, which is so rare, but is sometimes so lovely. Her
      forehead was narrow, her mouth was small, and her lips were thin; but her nose was perfect in
      its shape, and, by the delicacy of its modelling, had given a peculiar grace to her face in
      the days when things had gone well with her, when her cheeks had been full with youth and good
      living, and had been dimpled by the softness of love and mirth. There were no dimples there
      now, and all the softness which still remained was that softness which sorrow and continual
      melancholy give to suffering women. On her shoulders she wore a light shawl, which was
      fastened to her bosom with a large clasp brooch. Her faded dress was supported by a wide
      crinoline, but the under garment had lost all the grace of its ancient shape, and now told
      that woman's tale of poverty and taste for dress which is to be read in the outward garb of so
      many of Eve's daughters. The whole story was told so that those who ran might read it. When
      she had left her home this afternoon, she had struggled hard to dress herself so that
      something of the charm of apparel might be left to her; but she had known of her own failure
      at every twist that she had given to her gown, and at every jerk with which she had settled
      her shawl. She had despaired at every push she had given to her old flowers, vainly striving
      to bring them back to their old forms; but still she had persevered. With long tedious care
      she had mended the old gloves which would hardly hold her fingers. She had carefully hidden
      the rags of her sleeves. She had washed her little shrivelled collar, and had smoothed it out
      painfully. It had been a separate grief to her that she could find no cuffs to put round her
      wrists;—and yet she knew that no cuffs could have availed her anything. Nothing could avail
      her now. She expected nothing from her visit; yet she had come forth anxiously, and would have
      waited there throughout the whole night had access to his room been debarred to her. "George,"
      she said, standing at the bottom of the sofa, "what am I to do?"
As he lay there with his face turned towards her, the windows were at her back, and he could
      see her very plainly. He saw and appreciated the little struggles she had made to create by
      her appearance some reminiscence of her former self. He saw the shining coarseness of the long
      ringlets which had once been softer than silk. He saw the sixpenny brooch on her bosom where
      he had once placed a jewel, the price of which would now have been important to him. He saw it
      all, and lay there for a while, silently reading it.
"Don't let me stand here," she said, "without speaking a word to me."
"I don't want you to stand there," he said.
"That's all very well, George. I know you don't want me to stand here. I know you don't want
      to see me ever again."
"Never."
"I know it. Of course I know it. But what am I to do? Where am I to go for money? Even you
      would not wish that I should starve?"
"That's true, too. I certainly would not wish it. I should be delighted to hear that you had
      plenty to eat and plenty to drink, and plenty of clothes to wear. I believe that's what you
      care for the most, after all."
"It was only for your sake,—because you liked it."
"Well;—I did like it; but that has come to an end, as have all my other likings. You know
      very well that I can do nothing more for you. What good do you do yourself by coming here to
      annoy me? Have I not told you over and over again that you were never to look for me here? Is
      it likely that I should give you money now, simply because you have disobeyed me!"
"Where else was I to find you?"
"Why should you have found me at all? I don't want you to find me. I shall give you
      nothing;—not a penny. You know very well that we've had all that out before. When I put you
      into business I told you that we were to see no more of each other."
"Business!" she said. "I never could make enough out of the shop to feed a bird."
"That wasn't my fault. Putting you there cost me over a hundred pounds, and you consented to
      take the place."
"I didn't consent. I was obliged to go there because you took my other home away from
      me."
"Have it as you like, my dear. That was all I could do for you;—and more than most men would
      have done, when all things are considered." Then he got up from the sofa, and stood himself on
      the hearthrug, with his back to the fireplace. "At any rate, you may be sure of this,
      Jane;—that I shall do nothing more. You have come here to torment me, but you shall get
      nothing by it."
"I have come here because I am starving."
"I have nothing for you. Now go;" and he pointed to the door. Nevertheless, for more than
      three years of his life this woman had been his closest companion, his nearest friend, the
      being with whom he was most familiar. He had loved her according to his fashion of loving, and
      certainly she had loved him. "Go," he said repeating the word very angrily. "Do as I bid you,
      or it will be the worse for you."
"Will you give me a sovereign?"
"No;—I will give you nothing. I have desired you not to come to me here, and I will not pay
      for you coming."
"Then I will not go;" and the woman sat down upon a chair at the foot of the table. "I will
      not go till you have given me something to buy food. You may put me out of the room if you
      can, but I will lie at the door of the stairs. And if you get me out of the house, I will sit
      upon the door-step."
"If you play that game, my poor girl, the police will take you."
"Let them. It has come to that with me, that I care for nothing. Out of this I will not go
      till you give me money—unless I am put out."
And for this she had dressed herself with so much care, mending her gloves, and darning her
      little fragments of finery! He stood looking at her, with his hands thrust deep into his
      pockets,—looking at her and thinking what he had better do to rid himself of her presence. If
      he even quite resolved to take that little final journey of which we have spoken, with the
      pistol in his hand, why should he not go and leave her there? Or, for the matter of that, why
      should he not make her his heir to all remainder of his wealth? What he still had left was
      sufficient to place her in a seventh heaven of the earth. He cared but little for her, and was
      at this moment angry with her; but there was no one for whom he cared more, and no friend with
      whom he was less angry. But then his mind was not quite made up as to that final journey.
      Therefore he desired to rid himself and his room of the nuisance of her presence.
"Jane," he said, looking at her again with that assumed tranquillity of which I have spoken,
      "you talk of starving and of being ruined,—"
"I am starving. I have not a shilling in the world."
"Perhaps it may be a comfort to you in your troubles to know that I am, at any rate, as
      badly off as you are? I won't say that I am starving, because I could get food to eat at this
      moment if I wanted it; but I am utterly ruined. My property,—what should have been mine,—has
      been left away from me. I have lost the trumpery seat in Parliament for which I have paid so
      much. All my relations have turned their backs upon me—"
"Are you not going to be married?" she said, rising quickly from her chair and coming close
      to him.
"Married! No;—but I am going to blow my brains out. Look at that pistol, my girl. Of course
      you won't think that I am in earnest,—but I am."
She looked up into his face piteously. "Oh! George," she said, "you won't do that?"

"But I shall do that. There is nothing else left for me to do. You talk to me about
      starving. I tell you that I should have no objection to be starved, and so be put an end to in
      that way. It's not so bad as some other ways when it comes gradually. You and I, Jane, have
      not played our cards very well. We have staked all that we had, and we've been beaten. It's no
      good whimpering after what's lost. We'd better go somewhere else and begin a new game."
"Go where?" said she.
"Ah!—that's just what I can't tell you."
"George," she said, "I'll go anywhere with you. If what you say is true,—if you're not going
      to be married, and will let me come to you, I will work for you like a slave. I will indeed. I
      know I'm poorly looking now—"
"My girl, where I'm going, I shall not want any slave; and as for your looks—when you go
      there too,—they'll be of no matter, as far as I am able to judge."
"But, George, where are you going?"
"Wherever people do go when their brains are knocked out of them; or, rather, when they have
      knocked out their own brains,—if that makes any difference."
"George,"—she came up to him now, and took hold of him by the front of his coat, and for the
      moment he allowed her to do so,—"George, you frighten me. Do not do that. Say that you will
      not do that!"
"But I am just saying that I shall."
"Are you not afraid of God's anger? You and I have been very wicked."
"I have, my poor girl. I don't know much about your wickedness. I've been like Topsy;—indeed
      I am a kind of second Topsy myself. But what's the good of whimpering when it's over?"
"It isn't over; it isn't over,—at any rate for you."
"I wish I knew how I could begin again. But all this is nonsense, Jane, and you must
      go."
"You must tell me, first, that you are not going to—kill yourself."
"I don't suppose I shall do it to-night,—or, perhaps, not to-morrow. Very probably I may
      allow myself a week, so that your staying here can do no good. I merely wanted to make you
      understand that you are not the only person who has come to grief."
"And you are not going to be married?"
"No; I'm not going to be married, certainly."
"And I must go now?"
"Yes; I think you'd better go now." Then she rose and went, and he let her leave the room
      without giving her a shilling! His bantering tone, in speaking of his own position, had been
      successful. It had caused her to take herself off quietly. She knew enough of his usual manner
      to be aware that his threats of self destruction were probably unreal; but, nevertheless, what
      he had said had created some feeling in her heart which had induced her to yield to him, and
      go away in peace.
