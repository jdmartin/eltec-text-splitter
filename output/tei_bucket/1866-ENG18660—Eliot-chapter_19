CHAPTER XVIII.

The little, nameless, unremembered acts
Of kindness and of love.
Wordsworth : Tintern Abbey.
Jermyn did not forget to pay his visit to the minister in Malthouse Yard that
      evening. The mingled irritation, dread, and defiance which he was feeling towards Harold
      Transome in the middle of the day, depended on too many and far-stretching causes to be
      dissipated by eight o'clock; but when he left Mr Lyon's house he was in a state of comparative
      triumph in the beleif that he, and he alone, was now in possession of facts which, once
      grouped together, made a secret that gave him new power over Harold.
Mr Lyon, in his need for help from one who had that wisdom of the serpent which, he argued,
      is not forbidden, but is only of hard acquirement to dove-like innocence, had been gradually
      led to pour out to the attorney all the reasons which made him
       desire to know the truth about the man who called himself Maurice Christian: he
      had shown all the precious relics, the locket, the letters, and the marriage certificate. And
      Jermyn had comforted him by confidently promising to ascertain, without scandal or premature
      betrayals, whether this man were really Annette's husband, Maurice Christian Bycliffe.
Jermyn was not rash in making this promise, since he had excellent reasons for believing
      that he had already come to a true conclusion on the subject. But he wished both to know a
      little more of this man himself, and to keep Mr Lyon in ignorance—not a difficult
      precaution—in an affair which it cost the minister so much pain to speak of. An easy
      opportunity of getting an interview with Christian was sure to offer itself before long—might
      even offer itself to-morrow. Jermyn had seen him more than once, though hitherto without any
      reason for observing him with interest; he had heard that Philip Debarry's courier was often
      busy in the town, and it seemed especially likely that he would be seen there when the Market
      was to be agitated by politics, and the new candidate was to show his paces.
The world of which Treby Magna was the centre
       was naturally curious to see the young Transome, who had come from the East, was
      as rich as a Jew, and called himself a Radical; characteristics all equally vague in the minds
      of various excellent ratepayers, who drove to market in their taxed carts, or in their
      hereditary gigs. Places at convenient windows had been secured beforehand for a few best
      bonnets; but, in general, a Radical candidate excited no ardent feminine partisanship, even
      among the Dissenters in Treby, if they were of the prosperous and long-resident class. Some
      chapel-going ladies were fond of remembering that "their family had been Church;" others
      objected to politics altogether as having spoiled old neighbourliness, and sundered friends
      who had kindred views as to cowslip wine and Michaelmas cleaning; others, of the melancholy
      sort, said it would be well if people would think less of reforming Parliament and more of
      pleasing God. Irreproachable Dissenting matrons, like Mrs Muscat, whose youth had been passed
      in a short-waisted boddice and tight skirt, had never been animated by the struggle for
      liberty, and had a timid suspicion that religion was desecrated by being applied to the things
      of this world. Since Mr Lyon had been in Malthouse Yard there had been far too much mixing up
      of politics with religion;
       but, at any rate, these ladies had never yet been to hear speechifying in the
      market-place, and they were not going to begin that practice.
Esther, however, had heard some of her feminine acquaintances say that they intended to sit
      at the druggist's upper window, and she was inclined to ask her father if he could think of a
      suitable place where she also might see and hear. Two inconsistent motives urged her. She knew
      that Felix cared earnestly for all public questions, and she supposed that he held it one of
      her deficiencies not to care about them: well, she would try to learn the secret of this
      ardour, which was so strong in him that it animated what she thought the dullest form of life.
      She was not too stupid to find it out. But this self-correcting motive was presently displaced
      by a motive of a different sort. It had been a pleasant variety in her monotonous days to see
      a man like Harold Transome, with a distinguished appearance and polished manners, and she
      would like to see him again: he suggested to her that brighter and more luxurious life on
      which her imagination dwelt without the painful effort it required to conceive the mental
      condition which would place her in complete sympathy with Felix Holt. It was this less
      unaccustomed prompting of which she was chiefly
       conscious when she awaited her father's coming down to breakfast. Why, indeed,
      should she trouble herself so much about Felix?
Mr Lyon, more serene now that he had unbosomed his anxieties and obtained a promise of help,
      was already swimming so happily in the deep water of polemics in expectation of Philip
      Debarry's answer to his challenge, that, in the occupation of making a few notes lest certain
      felicitous inspirations should be wasted, he had forgotten to come down to breakfast. Esther,
      suspecting his abstraction, went up to his study, and found him at his desk looking up with
      wonder at her interruption.
"Come, father, you have forgotten your breakfast."
"It is true, child; I will come," he said, lingering to make some final strokes.
"O you naughty father!" said Esther, as he got up from his chair, "your coat-collar is
      twisted, your waistcoat is buttoned all wrong, and you have not brushed your hair. Sit down
      and let me brush it again as I did yesterday."
He sat down obediently, while Esther took a towel, which she threw over his shoulders, and
      then brushed the thick long fringe of soft auburn hair. This very trifling act, which she had
      brought herself
       to for the first time yesterday, meant a great deal in Esther's little history.
      It had been her habit to leave the mending of her father's clothes to Lyddy; she had not liked
      even to touch his cloth garments; still less had it seemed a thing she would willingly
      undertake to correct his toilette, and use a brush for him. But having once done this, under
      her new sense of faulty omission, the affectionateness that was in her flowed so pleasantly,
      as she saw how much her father was moved by what he thought a great act of tenderness, that
      she quite longed to repeat it. This morning, as he sat under her hands, his face had such a
      calm delight in it that she could not help kissing the top of his bald head; and afterwards,
      when they were seated at breakfast, she said, merrily,
"Father, I shall make a petit maître of you by-and-by; your hair looks so pretty
      and silken when it is well brushed."
"Nay, child, I trust that while I would willingly depart from my evil habit of a somewhat
      slovenly forgetfulness in my attire, I shall never arrive at the opposite extreme. For though
      there is that in apparel which pleases the eye, and I deny not that your neat gown and the
      colour thereof—which is that of certain little flowers that spread themselves
       in the hedgerows, and make a blueness there as of the sky when it is deepened in
      the water,—I deny not, I say, that these minor strivings after a perfection which is, as it
      were, an irrecoverable yet haunting memory, are a good in their proportion. Nevertheless, the
      brevity of our life, and the hurry and crush of the great battle with error and sin, often
      oblige us to an advised neglect of what is less momentous. This, I conceive, is the principle
      on which my friend Felix Holt acts; and I cannot but think the light comes from the true
      fount, though it shines through obstructions."
"You have not seen Mr Holt since Sunday, have you, father?"
"Yes; he was here yesterday. He sought Mr Transome, having a matter of some importance to
      speak upon with him. And I saw him afterward in the street, when he agreed that I should call
      for him this morning before I go into the market-place. He will have it," Mr Lyon went on,
      smiling, "that I must not walk about in the crowd without him to act as my special
      constable."
Esther felt vexed with herself that her heart was suddently beating with unusual quickness,
      and that her last resolution not to trouble herself about what Felix thought, had transformed
      itself with magic
       swiftness into mortification that he evidently avoided coming to the house when
      she was there, though he used to come on the slightest occasion. He knew that she was always
      at home until the afternoon on market days; that was the reason why he would not call for her
      father. Of course, it was because he attributed such littleness to her that he supposed she
      would retain nothing else than a feeling of offence towards him for what he had said to her.
      Such distrust of any good in others, such arrogance of immeasurable superiority, was extremely
      ungenerous. But presently she said,
"I should have liked to hear Mr Transome speak, but I suppose it is too late to get a place
      now."
"I am not sure; I would fain have you go if you desire it, my dear," said Mr Lyon, who could
      not bear to deny Esther any lawful wish. "Walk with me to Mistress Holt's, and we will learn
      from Felix, who will doubtless already have been out, whether he could lead you in safety to
      Friend Lambert's."
Esther was glad of the proposal, because, if it answered no other purpose, it would be an
      easy way of obliging Felix to see her, and of showing him that it was not she who cherished
      offence. But when, later in the morning, she was walking
       towards Mrs Holt's with her father, they met Mr Jermyn, who stopped them to ask,
      in his most affable manner, whether Miss Lyon intended to hear the candidate, and whether she
      had secured a suitable place. And he ended by insisting that his daughters, who were presently
      coming in an open carriage, should call for her, if she would permit them. It was impossible
      to refuse this civility, and Esther turned back to await the carriage, pleased with the
      certainty of hearing and seeing, yet sorry to miss Felix. There was another day for her to
      think of him with unsatisfied resentment, mixed with some longings for a better understanding;
      and in our spring-time every day has its hidden growths in the mind, as it has in the earth
      when the little folded blades are getting ready to pierce the ground.
