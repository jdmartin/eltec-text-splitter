CHAPTER XL.

"She's beautiful; and therefore to be wooed:
She is a woman; therefore to be won."—
Henry VI.

If Denner had had a suspicion that Esther's presence at Transome Court was not
      agreeable to her mistress, it was impossible to entertain such a suspicion with regard to the
      other members of the family. Between her and little Harry there was an extraordinary
      fascination. This creature, with the soft broad brown cheeks, low forehead, great black eyes,
      tiny well-defined nose, fierce biting tricks towards every person and thing he disliked, and
      insistance on entirely occupying those he liked, was a human-specimen such as Esther had never
      seen before, and she seemed to be equally original in Harry's experience. At first sight her
      light complexion and her blue gown, probably also her sunny smile and her hands stretched out
      towards him, seemed to make a show for him as of a new
       sort of bird: he threw himself backward against his "Gappa," as he called old Mr
      Transome, and stared at this new-comer with the gravity of a wild animal. But she had no
      sooner sat down on the sofa in the library than he climbed up to her, and began to treat her
      as an attractive object in natural history, snatched up her curls with his brown fist, and,
      discovering that there was a little ear under them, pinched it and blew into it, pulled at her
      coronet of plaits, and seemed to discover with satisfaction that it did not grow at the summit
      of her head, but could be dragged down and altogether undone. Then finding that she laughed,
      tossed him back, kissed, and pretended to bite him—in fact, was an animal that understood
      fun—he rushed off and made Dominic bring a small menagerie of white-mice, squirrels, and
      birds, with Moro, the black spaniel, to make her acquaintance. Whomsoever Harry liked, it
      followed that Mr Transome must like: "Gappa," along with Nimrod the retriever, was part of the
      menagerie, and perhaps endured more than all the other live creatures in the way of being
      tumbled about. Seeing that Esther bore having her hair pulled down quite merrily, and that she
      was willing to be harnessed and beaten, the old man began to confide to her, in his feeble,
      smiling, and
       rather jerking fashion, Harry's remarkable feats: how he had one day, when Gappa
      was asleep, unpinned a whole drawerful of beetles, to see if they would fly away; then
      disgusted with their stupidity, was about to throw them all on the ground and stamp on them,
      when Dominic came in and rescued these valuable specimens; also, how he had subtly watched Mrs
      Transome at the cabinet where she kept her medicines, and, when she had left it for a little
      while without locking it, had gone to the drawers and scattered half the contents on the
      floor. But what old Mr Transome thought the most wonderful proof of an almost preternatural
      cleverness was, that Harry would hardly ever talk, but preferred making inarticulate noises,
      or combining syllables after a method of his own.
"He can talk well enough if he likes," said Gappa, evidently thinking that Harry, like the
      monkeys, had deep reasons for his reticence.
"You mind him," he added, nodding at Esther, and shaking with low-toned laughter. "You'll
      hear: he knows the right names of things well enough, but he likes to make his own. He'll give
      you one all to yourself before long."
And when Harry seemed to have made up his mind distinctly that Esther's name was "Boo," Mr
       Transome nodded at her with triumphant satisfaction, and then told her in a low
      whisper, looking round cautiously beforehand, that Harry would never call Mrs Transome
      "Gamma," but always "Bite."
"It's wonderful!" said he, laughing slyly.
The old man seemed so happy now in the new world created for him by Dominic and Harry, that
      he would perhaps have made a holocaust of his flies and beetles if it had been necessary in
      order to keep this living, lively kindness about him. He no longer confined himself to the
      library, but shuffled along from room to room, staying and looking on at what was going
      forward wherever he did not find Mrs Transome alone.
To Esther the sight of this feeble-minded, timid, paralytic man, who had long abdicated all
      mastery over the things that were his, was something piteous. Certainly this had never been
      part of the furniture she had imagined for the delightful aristocratic dwelling in her Utopia;
      and the sad irony of such a lot impressed her the more because in her father she was
      accustomed to age accompanied with mental acumen and activity. Her thoughts went back in
      conjecture over the past life of Mr and Mrs Transome, a couple so strangely different from
       each other. She found it impossible to arrange their existence in the seclusion
      of this fine park and in this lofty large-roomed house, where it seemed quite ridiculous to be
      anything so small as a human being, without finding it rather dull. Mr Transome had always had
      his beetles, but Mrs Transome—? It was not easy to conceive that the husband and wife had ever
      been very fond of each other.
Esther felt at her ease with Mrs Transome: she was gratified by the consciousness—for on
      this point Esther was very quick—that Mrs Transome admired her, and looked at her with
      satisfied eyes. But when they were together in the early days of her stay, the conversation
      turned chiefly on what happened in Mrs Transome's youth—what she wore when she was presented
      at Court—who were the most distinguished and beautiful women at that time—the terrible
      excitement of the French Revolution—the emigrants she had known, and the history of various
      titled members of the Lingon family. And Esther, from native delicacy, did not lead to more
      recent topics of a personal kind. She was copiously instructed that the Lingon family was
      better than that even of the elder Transomes, and was privileged with an explanation of the
      various quarterings,
       which proved that the Lingon blood had been continually enriched. Poor Mrs
      Transome, with her secret bitterness and dread, still found a flavour in this sort of pride;
      none the less because certain deeds of her own life had been in fatal inconsistency with it.
      Besides, genealogies entered into her stock of ideas, and her talk on such subjects was as
      necessary as the notes of the linnet or the blackbird. She had no ultimate analysis of things
      that went beyond blood and family—the Herons of Fenshore or the Badgers of Hillbury. She had
      never seen behind the canvass with which her life was hung. In the dim background there was
      the burning mount and the tables of the law; in the foreground there was Lady Debarry
      privately gossiping about her, and Lady Wyvern finally deciding not to send her invitations to
      dinner. Unlike that Semiramis who made laws to suit her practical licence, she lived, poor
      soul, in the midst of desecrated sanctities, and of honours that looked tarnished in the light
      of monotonous and weary suns. Glimpses of the Lingon heraldry in their freshness were
      interesting to Esther; but it occurred to her that when she had known about them a good while
      they would cease to be succulent themes of converse or meditation, and Mrs Transome, having
      known
       them all along, might have felt a vacuum in spite of them.
Nevertheless it was entertaining at present to be seated on soft cushions with her netting
      before her, while Mrs Transome went on with her embroidery, and told in that easy phrase, and
      with that refined high-bred tone and accent which she possessed in perfection, family stories
      that to Esther were like so many novellettes: what diamonds were in the Earl's family, own
      cousins to Mrs Transome; how poor Lady Sara's husband went off into jealous madness only a
      month after their marriage, and dragged that sweet blue-eyed thing by the hair; and how the
      brilliant Fanny, having married a country parson, became so niggardly that she had gone about
      almost begging for fresh eggs from the farmers' wives, though she had done very well with her
      six sons, as there was a bishop and no end of interest in the family, and two of them got
      appointments in India.
At present Mrs Transome did not touch at all on her own time of privation, or her troubles
      with her eldest son, or on anything that lay very close to her heart. She conversed with
      Esther, and acted the part of hostess as she performed her toilette and went on with her
      embroidery: these things were
       to be done whether one were happy or miserable. Even the patriarch Job, if he
      had been a gentleman of the modern West, would have avoided picturesque disorder and poetical
      laments; and the friends who called on him, though not less disposed than Bildad the Shuhite
      to hint that their unfortunate friend was in the wrong, would have sat on chairs and held
      their hats in their hands. The harder problems of our life have changed less than our manners;
      we wrestle with the old sorrows, but more decorously. Esther's inexperience prevented her from
      divining much about this fine grey-haired woman, whom she could not help perceiving to stand
      apart from the family group, as if there were some cause of isolation for her both within and
      without. To her young heart there was a peculiar interest in Mrs Transome. An elderly woman,
      whose beauty, position, and graceful kindness towards herself, made deference to her
      spontaneous, was a new figure in Esther's experience. Her quick light movement was always
      ready to anticipate what Mrs Transome wanted; her bright apprehension and silvery speech were
      always ready to cap Mrs Transome's narratives or instructions even about doses and liniments,
      with some lively commentary. She must have behaved charmingly; for one day when she had
      tripped
       across the room to put the screen just in the right place, Mrs Transome said,
      taking her hand, "My dear, you make me wish I had a daughter!"
That was pleasant; and so it was to be decked by Mrs Transome's own hands in a set of
      turquoise ornaments, which became her wonderfully, worn with a white Cashmere dress, which was
      also insisted on. Esther never reflected that there was a double intention in these pretty
      ways towards her; with young generosity, she was rather preoccupied by the desire to prove
      that she herself entertained no low triumph in the fact that she had rights prejudicial to
      this family whose life she was learning. And besides, through all Mrs Transome's perfect
      manners there pierced some indefinable indications of a hidden anxiety much deeper than
      anything she could feel about this affair of the estate—to which she often alluded slightly as
      a reason for informing Esther of something. It was impossible to mistake her for a happy
      woman; and young speculation is always stirred by discontent for which there is no obvious
      cause. When we are older, we take the uneasy eyes and the bitter lips more as a matter of
      course.
But Harold Transome was more communicative about recent years than his mother was. He
       thought it well that Esther should know how the fotune of his family had been
      drained by law expenses, owing to suits mistakenly urged by her family; he spoke of his
      mother's lonely life and pinched circumstances, of her lack of comfort in her elder son, and
      of the habit she had consequently acquired of looking at the gloomy side of things. He hinted
      that she had been accustomed to dictate, and that, as he had left her when he was a boy, she
      had perhaps indulged the dream that he would come back a boy. She was still sore on the point
      of his politics. These things could not be helped, but, so far as he could, he wished to make
      the rest of her life as cheerful as possible.
Esther listened eagerly, and took these things to heart. The claim to an inheritance, the
      sudden discovery of a right to a fortune held by others, was acquiring a very distinct and
      unexpected meaning for her. Every day she was getting more clearly into her imagination what
      it would be to abandon her own past, and what she would enter into in exchange for it; what it
      would be to disturb a long possession, and how difficult it was to fix a point at which the
      disturbance might begin, so as to be contemplated without pain.
Harold Transome's thoughts turned on the same
       subject, but accompanied by a different state of feeling and with more definite
      resolutions. He saw a mode of reconciling all difficulties, which looked pleasanter to him the
      longer he looked at Esther. When she had been hardly a week in the house, he had made up his
      mind to marry her; and it had never entered into that mind that the decision did not rest
      entirely with his inclination. It was not that he thought slightly of Esther's demands; he saw
      that she would require considerable attractions to please her, and that there were
      difficulties to be overcome. She was clearly a girl who must be wooed; but Harold did not
      despair of presenting the requisite attractions, and the difficulties gave more interest to
      the wooing than he could have believed. When he had said that he would not marry an
      Englishwoman, he had always made a mental reservation in favour of peculiar circumstances; and
      now the peculiar circumstances were come. To be deeply in love was a catastrophe not likely to
      happen to him; but he was readily amorous. No woman could make him miserable, but he was
      sensitive to the presence of women, and was kind to them; not with grimaces, like a man of
      mere gallantry, but beamingly, easily, like a man of genuine good-nature.
       And each day that he was near Esther, the solution of all difficulties by
      marriage became a more pleasing prospect; though he had to confess to himself that the
      difficulties did not diminish on a nearer view, in spite of the flattering sense that she
      brightened at his approach.
Harold was not one to fail in a purpose for want of assiduity. After an hour or two devoted
      to business in the morning, he went to look for Esther, and if he did not find her at play
      with Harry and old Mr Transome, or chatting with his mother, he went into the drawing-room,
      where she was usually either seated with a book on her knee and "making a bed for her cheek"
      with one little hand, while she looked out of the window, or else standing in front of one of
      the full-length family portraits with an air of rumination. Esther found it impossible to read
      in these days; her life was a book which she seemed herself to be constructing—trying to make
      character clear before her, and looking into the ways of destiny.
The active Harold had almost always something definite to propose by way of filling the
      time: if it were fine, she must walk out with him and see the grounds; and when the snow
      melted and it was no longer slippery, she must get on horseback and learn
       to ride. If they stayed indoors, she must learn to play at billiards, or she
      must go over the house and see the pictures he had had hung anew, or the costumes he had
      brought from the East, or come into his study and look at the map of the estate, and hear
      what—if it had remained in his family—he had intended to do in every corner of it in order to
      make the most of its capabilities.
About a certain time in the morning Esther had learned to expect him. Let every wooer make
      himself strongly expected; he may succeed by dint of being absent, but hardly in the first
      instance. One morning Harold found her in the drawing-room, leaning against a consol table,
      and looking at the full-length portrait of a certain Lady Betty Transome, who had lived a
      century and a half before, and had the usual charm of ladies in Sir Peter Lely's style.
"Don't move, pray," he said on entering; "you look as if you were standing for your own
      portrait."
"I take that as an insinuation," said Esther, laughing, and moving towards her seat on an
      ottoman near the fire, "for I notice almost all the portraits are in a conscious, affected
      attitude. That fair Lady Betty looks as if she had been drilled into that posture, and had not
      will enough of her
       own ever to move again unless she had a little push given to her."
"She brightens up that panel well with her long satin skirt," said Harold, as he followed
      Esther, "but alive I daresay she would have been less cheerful company."
"One would certainly think that she had just been unpacked from silver paper. Ah, how
      chivalrous you are!" said Esther, as Harold, kneeling on one knee, held her silken
      netting-stirrup for her to put her foot through. She had often fancied pleasant scenes in
      which such homage was rendered to her, and the homage was not disagreeable now it was really
      come; but, strangely enough, a little darting sensation at that moment was accompanied by the
      vivid remembrance of some one who had never paid the least attention to her foot. There had
      been a slight blush, such as often came and went rapidly, and she was silent a moment. Harold
      naturally believed that it was he himself who was filling the field of vision. He would have
      liked to place himself on the ottoman near Esther, and behave very much more like a lover; but
      he took a chair opposite to her at a circumspect distance. He dared not do otherwise. Along
      with Esther's playful charm she conveyed an impression
       of personal pride and high spirit which warned Harold's acuteness that in the
      delicacy of their present position he might easily make a false move and offend her. A woman
      was likely to be credulous about adoration, and to find no difficulty in referring it to her
      intrinsic attractions; but Esther was too dangerously quick and critical not to discern the
      least awkwardness that looked like offering her marriage as a convenient compromise for
      himself. Beforehand, he might have said that such characteristics as hers were not lovable in
      a woman; but, as it was, he found that the hope of pleasing her had a piquancy quite new to
      him.
"I wonder," said Esther, breaking her silence in her usual light silvery tones—"I wonder
      whether the women who looked in that way ever felt any troubles. I see there are two old ones
      up-stairs in the billiard-room who have only got fat; the expression of their faces is just of
      the same sort."
"A woman ought never to have any trouble. There should always be a man to guard her from
      it." (Harold Transome was masculine and fallible; he had incautiously sat down this morning to
      pay his addresses by talk about nothing in particular; and, clever experienced man as he was,
      he fell into nonsense.)

"But suppose the man himself got into trouble— you would wish her to mind about that. Or
      suppose," added Esther, suddenly looking up merrily at Harold, "the man himself was
      troublesome?"
"O you must not strain probabilities in that way. The generality of men are perfect. Take
      me, for example."
"You are a perfect judge of sauces," said Esther, who had her triumphs in letting Harold
      know that she was capable of taking notes.
"That is perfection number one. Pray go on."
"O, the catalogue is too long—I should be tired before I got to your magnificent ruby ring
      and your gloves always of the right colour."
"If you would let me tell you your perfections, I should not be tired."
"That is not complimentary; it means that the list is short."
"No; it means that the list is pleasant to dwell upon."
"Pray don't begin," said Esther, with her pretty toss of the head; "it would be dangerous to
      our good understanding. The person I liked best in the world was one who did nothing but scold
      me and tell me of my faults."
When Esther began to speak, she meant to do no
       more than make a remote unintelligible allusion, feeling, it must be owned, a
      naugthy will to flirt and be saucy, and thwart Harold's attempts to be felicitous in
      compliment. But she had no sooner uttered the words than they seemed to her like a confession.
      A deep flush spread itself over her face and neck, and the sense that she was blushing went on
      deepening her colour. Harold felt himself unpleasantly illuminated as to a possibility that
      had never yet occurred to him. His surprise made an uncomfortable pause, in which Esther had
      time to feel much vexation.
"You speak in the past tense," said Harold, at last; "yet I am rather envious of that
      person. I shall never be able to win your regard in the same way. Is it any one at Treby?
      Because in that case I can inquire about your faults."
"O you know I have always lived among grave people," said Esther, more able to recover
      herself now she was spoken to. "Before I came home to be with my father I was nothing but a
      school-girl first, and then a teacher in different stages of growth. People in those
      circumstances are not usually flattered. But there are varieties in fault-finding. At our
      Paris school the master I liked best was an old man who stormed at me terribly
       when I read Racine, but yet showed that he was proud of me."
Esther was getting quite cool again. But Harold was not entirely satisfied; if there was any
      obstacle in his way, he wished to know exactly what it was.
"That must have been a wretched life for you at Treby," he said,—"a person of your
      accomplishments."
"I used to be dreadfully discontented," said Esther, much occupied with mistakes she had
      made in her netting. "But I was becoming less so. I have had time to get rather wise, you
      know; I am two-and-twenty."
"Yes," said Harold, rising and walking a few paces backwards and forwards, "you are past
      your majority; you are empress of your own fortunes— and more besides."
"Dear me," said Esther, letting her work fall, and leaning back against the cushions; "I
      don't think I know very well what to do with my empire."
"Well," said Harold, pausing in front of her, leaning one arm on the mantelpiece, and
      speaking very gravely, "I hope that in any case, since you appear to have no near relative who
      understands affairs, you will confide in me, and trust me with all your intentions as if I had
      no other personal
       concern in the matter than a regard for you. I hope you believe me capable of
      acting as the guardian of your interest, even where it turns out to be inevitably opposed to
      my own."
"I am sure you have given me reason to believe it," said Esther, with seriousness, putting
      out her hand to Harold. She had not been left in ignorance that he had had opportunities twice
      offered of stifling her claims.
Harold raised the hand to his lips, but dared not retain it more than an instant. Still the
      sweet reliance in Esther's manner made an irresistible temptation to him. After standing still
      a moment or two, while she bent over her work, he glided to the ottoman and seated himself
      close by her, looking at her busy hands.
"I see you have made mistakes in your work," he said, bending still nearer, for he saw that
      she was conscious, yet not angry.
"Nonsense! you know nothing about it," said Esther, laughing, and crushing up the soft silk
      under her palms. "Those blunders have a design in them."
She looked round, and saw a handsome face very near her. Harold was looking, as he felt,
      thoroughly enamoured of this bright woman, who was not at
       all to his preconceived taste. Perhaps a touch of hypothetic jealousy now helped
      to heighten the effect. But he mastered all indiscretion, and only looked at her as he
      said,
"I am wondering whether you have any deep wishes and secrets that I can't guess."
"Pray don't speak of my wishes," said Esther, quite overmastered by this new and apparently
      involuntary manifestation in Harold; "I could not possibly tell you one at this moment—I think
      I shall never find them out again. O yes," she said, abruptly, struggling to relieve herself
      from the oppression of unintelligible feelings—"I do know one wish distinctly. I want to go
      and see my father. He writes me word that all is well with him, but still I want to see
      him."
"You shall be driven there when you like."
"May I go now—I mean as soon as it is convenient?" said Esther, rising.
"I will give the order immediately, if you wish it," said Harold, understanding that the
      audience was broken up.
