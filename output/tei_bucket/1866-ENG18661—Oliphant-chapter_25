Chapter XXV
The fruit of Lucilla's long and mature reflection was that next morning being fine and all
     the clouds dispersed, she went out with her usual firm step and self-possession, and, what was
     rather unusual with her, except on necessary occasions of ceremony, knocked at Mrs Woodburn's
     door.
Mrs Woodburn and Miss Marjoribanks had never, as people say, taken to each other. They were
     as different in their ways as it is possible to imagine. The mimic was a little indolent, and
     would not take the trouble to make any exertions for the good of the community, except in the
     exercise of her peculiar talent, though she had been known, when excited, to go through real
     fatigue for that; but she had none of the steady force, the persevering energy—or, to sum up
     all in one word, the genius—of Miss Marjoribanks, who, for her part, recognised the
      use of such an instrument of entertainment as Mrs Woodburn possessed without
     appreciating it in her own person; for Lucilla had no sense of humour, as she candidly
     admitted, with that consciousness of her own faults, and slight disposition to consider them
     virtues, which is common to persons of great endowments. It was accordingly with a slight sense
     of effort on both sides that they met thus in the familiarity of an early visit, at a moment
     when people doing their duty to each other in a ceremonial way would not have thought of
     calling. She was aware that Mrs Woodburn regarded her, even when she kissed her in the most
     neighbourly and affectionate manner, with a look which seemed to say, "What can she want,
     coming here so early?" As for Lucilla, she was too wise to pretend that it was a mere visit of
     regard. She was too wise, and her interlocutor was too clever, and prone to catch every touch
     of expression, though Miss Marjoribanks flattered herself she had sufficient experience to
     enable her to dismiss, when there was occasion for it, all expression from her face. But such
     was not her policy at this moment. When the two faces had touched each other in that loving and
     sisterly salutation, their owners immediately separated, and regarded each other from two
     opposite chairs, without decided hostility, it is true, but with the watchful air of two people
     whom the fates may range on different sides, and whom it behoves to be mutually watchful. And
     Lucilla thought it the most expedient course, under the circumstances, to begin her
     investigations at once.
"I have come to make an inquisition," she said; "I may as well confess it at once, for you
     would find me out if I didn't. Mrs Woodburn, where is Mr Cavendish? I am not going to put up
     with it any longer. He must be written to, and had back again. The only man that was to be
     depended upon in Carlingford!" said Lucilla; "and to think he should disappear like this and
     never say a word!"
Mrs Woodburn fairly gasped in her companion's face. She could no more tell what this meant,
     than if she had been a person utterly unacquainted with human motives and ways of working; and,
     indeed, it was only the tricks of the surface for which she had any real insight. "My brother!"
     she exclaimed, with something between an impulse of defence and denial, and a quite opposite
     instinct of confidence. Had he proposed, after all, without telling his sister? Had Lucilla a
     right to ask the question she uttered so frankly? Had he been prudent for once in his life, and
     secured this sensible alliance and prop to his position? All these questions rushed at
     lightning-speed through Mrs Woodburn's mind; but she was not so prompt as Miss Marjoribanks
     would have been under the circumstances, and all she did was to open her eyes wide, and give a
     start on her chair, and say, "My brother?" with a voice which trembled, and was half
     extinguished by surprise.
"Yes; Mr Cavendish," said Lucilla. "Do tell me his address. There is not a man in Carlingford
     who is good for anything, now that he is gone. You must see that as well as I do. As for
     flirting, I have always said he was the only man that knew anything about it. Do tell me where
     he is, and I will write to him; or, please, send him word for me, that absolutely he must come
     back. We are all dying for him, you may say."
Mrs Woodburn had recovered a little, and found a moment to think, but her faculties were not
     so handy, except in her own particular way, as might have been expected from such a clever
     woman. She could even at that moment have taken off Miss Marjoribanks to the life, but she was
     in the most profound bewilderment as to what Lucilla could mean; whether she was really laying
     herself out to "catch" Mr Cavendish, or whether she was merely talking nonsense without any
     particular meaning; or whether she was feigning indifference by way of getting information; and
     the stupidest person in Carlingford would have acquitted herself as well as Mrs Woodburn felt
     able to do in the emergency. "I should think he would rather hear that some of you were willing
     to live for him," she said, in a tremulous way; finding nothing better come to her lips than
     the echo of an old compliment, which went against her nature, but yet with an instinct of
     serving her brother so far as it might be in her power.
"Not me," said Lucilla frankly. "Some people once thought so, you know; but I can't say I
     ever thought so. There never will be anything about living or dying between him and me. I hope
     we know better," said Miss Marjoribanks; "besides, if I were so much as to think of that sort
     of thing I should feel I was swindling papa. Oh, no; I assure you I am quite disinterested. I
     want him for my Thursdays. Do write, and say he must come home."
"I don't like people to be too disinterested," said Mrs Woodburn; "and I don't think Harry
     would be at all glad to hear it. I wish he would come back, I am sure. I am always bullying him
     about it. I thought perhaps some of you young ladies had been unkind to him," said the anxious
     sister, who had recovered her head, and thought it might be possible to get at the secret, if
     there was a secret, by means like this.
"No," said Miss Marjoribanks; "I have not been unkind to him; and there is nobody
     else I know of," said the candid Lucilla, "unless poor Barbara; and she will never be
     unkind, you know. I will write him a letter if you will give me his address. Is it true that
     somebody has left him a great deal of money, and he is going to change his name?"
"His name!" said Mrs Woodburn, with a little cry, like an imprudent woman; and then she
     recovered herself. "I have not heard of anything of the kind," she said, "and he would be sure
     to tell me of it; but in Carlingford people know things before they happen. I should be very
     glad to know that somebody was going to leave him a great deal of money; but I don't know about
     the name——"
"Oh, I heard it only in a confused sort of way," said Lucilla, "or that he had
     changed his name. I am sure I don't know if it was past or present. Did he ever make any change
     to be somebody's heir? Oh, I beg your pardon; but you know people do it every day."
Mrs Woodburn had grown quite pale—perhaps because she began to see that there was some method
     in these questions, perhaps with simple and unreasonable fright at the suggestion. She could
     not say a word for a moment, so startling was the question; and then there was something in
     Lucilla's early visit, and in her instant onslaught upon Mr Cavendish, which was alarming. She
     was so frightened and driven into a corner that she could not tell how to answer. It occurred
     to her all at once that perhaps Mr Cavendish had opened his heart to Miss Marjoribanks and
     given her an inkling of his secret; and what would Lucilla think if she contradicted her
     brother? Never was a poor woman in a greater difficulty. All her fun and her mimicry collapsed.
     She no more noticed the peculiarities of Lucilla's look and manner than if she had been an
     ordinary inhabitant of Grange Lane. "Changed his name?" she faltered, in a blank sort of
     interrogative way; and in spite of herself faltered and shook, and conveyed to Lucilla the most
     perfect assurance that what she supposed was true.
"When it is for a great deal of money there is some sense in it; when it is only for a
     prettier name it is dreadfully stupid. Don't you think so? As if we all could have pretty
     names!" said Lucilla. "I should like so much to have a talk with Mr Cavendish. I picked up some
     very, very old friends of his the other day—people who used to know him long ago. I am sure he
     would be interested if he were to know."
"I don't think it could be him," said Mrs Woodburn, with something like the instinct of
     despair; "I don't remember any very old friends he has; it is so long a time ago——" and then
     the poor lady stopped short, as if she had something choking her in her throat. "I don't think
     it could be he."
"Not such a very long time," said Lucilla, in her easy way. "It is dreadful to give him a
     character for being old. Do write him, please, and tell him about those people. He is sure to
     be interested if you say it is a lady, and a pretty woman, and a widow," continued Miss
     Marjoribanks. "She says he was once very kind to her when her poor husband was alive."
Mrs Woodburn recovered herself a little as Lucilla spoke. "It must have been some other Mr
     Cavendish," she said. "Harry was—so much abroad—so long away from home——" At that moment there
     was a sound in the house of a heavy step, and Mr Woodburn's whistle became audible in the
     distance. Then the poor woman, who had a secret, fixed haggard eyes upon Miss Marjoribanks. She
     dared not say, "Don't speak of this before my husband." She dared not utter a word to awaken
     suspicion on one side or the other. She knew very well that if Mr Woodburn heard of the
     existence of any old friends of his brother-in-law, he would insist upon having them produced,
     and "paying them some attention"; and at the same time Mrs Woodburn could not so far confide in
     Lucilla as to beg her to keep silent. This was what her brother's poltroonery brought upon the
     unfortunate woman. And when the emergency came she was not as equal to it as she expected to
     be. Her talents were not of a nature to do her any good in such a strait. She collapsed
     entirely, and looked round her in a flutter of fright and despair, as if to find some means of
     escape.
But this terror all arose from the fact that she did not know Miss Marjoribanks, who was
     generous as she was strong, and had no intention of going to extremities. Lucilla got up from
     her chair when she heard Mr Woodburn's whistle coming nearer. "I hear somebody coming," she
     said, "and I must not stay, for I have quantities of things to do. Only mind you tell Mr
     Cavendish I have something quite serious to say to him from his old friend; and from me, please
     to tell him, that it is impossible to get on without him," continued Lucilla, as Mr
     Woodburn entered the room. "There is not a soul that can flirt or do anything. I should write
     to him myself if I knew his address."
And then, as was natural, Woodburn, with his usual absurdity, as his wife explained
     afterwards, struck in with some boisterous badinage. As for Mrs Woodburn, in her
     mingled terror and relief, she was too much excited to know what he said. But when Lucilla,
     serenely smiling, was gone, the mimic, with her nerves strung to desperation, burst into the
     wildest comic travesty of Miss Marjoribanks's looks and manners, and her inquiries about Harry,
     and sent her unsuspicious husband into convulsions of laughter. He laughed until the tears ran
     down his cheeks—the unconscious simpleton; and all the time his wife could have liked to throw
     him down and trample on him, or put pins into him, or scratch his beaming, jovial countenance.
     Perhaps she would have gone into hysterics instead if she had not possessed that other
     safety-valve, for Mrs Woodburn had not that supreme composure and self-command which belonged
     to Lucilla's higher organisation. She wrote a long letter that afternoon, and had a dreadful
     headache all the evening after it, which, considering all things, was to be expected under the
     circumstances, and was a weak-minded woman's last resource.
No headache, however, disturbed Miss Marjoribanks's beneficent progress. She went home
     conscious that, if she had not acquired any distinct information, she had at least gained a
     moral certainty. And besides, she had measured the forces of Mr Cavendish's bodyguard, and had
     found them utterly unequal to any prolonged resistance. All that was wanted was prudence and
     care, and that good luck which was as much an endowment in its way as the other qualities by
     which Lucilla might be said to have secured it. She went home meditating her next step, and
     with a certain enjoyment in the sense of difficulty and the consciousness of how much skill and
     power would be required to carry on three different threads of innocent intrigue with the three
     different persons in the drama, without ever letting the general web get confused, or
     confounding one strand with another. She had to frighten the Archdeacon with the idea that Mrs
     Mortimer might marry the impostor, and she had to keep the widow in the profoundest ignorance
     of this suggestion, and she had to manage and guide the impostor himself, to save his position,
     and deliver him from his enemies, and make his would-be persecutor for ever harmless. If by
     chance she should forget herself for a moment, and say to Mr Beverley what she meant for Mr
     Cavendish, or betray her mode of dealing with either to the third person interested, then
     farewell to all her hopes. But when all that was required was skill and self-possession and
     courage, Miss Marjoribanks knew herself too well to be afraid.
She came in with that sense of having done her duty which is so sweet to a well-regulated
     mind. But it was not to that internal satisfaction alone that Providence limited Lucilla's
     reward. There are exceptional cases to be found here and there even in this world, in which
     virtue finds its just acknowledgment, and disinterested well-doing is recompensed as it
     deserves. While Miss Marjoribanks was still occupied with the arrangement of her plans she was
     interrupted by a visitor, who entered with a brow clouded by care, and yet exalted by the sense
     of a charge and dignity which is not afforded to every woman. It was Mrs Centum who thus came
     to unfold to Lucilla the new event which was about to happen in Carlingford. She had a great
     deal to say first, as was natural, of the dreadful vexation of such a thing happening in
     holiday-time when the boys were all at home, and when she did not know what to do.
"But you know, Lucilla, it will be delightful for all you young ladies to have the officers,"
     said Mrs Centum; "it keeps a place lively; though, for my part, I always say in six months
     there will not be a servant in the house that one can depend upon. It is dreadful for
     servants—especially young ones, and if they are nice-looking, you know; but it is very nice for
     the young ladies, and for all the picnics and dances and everything——"
"What officers?" said Lucilla, pricking up her ears—for to tell the truth, the very name of
     officers in a place like Carlingford, where nobody could flirt but Mr Cavendish, was as water
     in the desert to Miss Marjoribanks's soul.
"Has not the Doctor told you?" said Mrs Centum—"but, to be sure, very few people know as yet.
     Mr Centum says it must be all on your account, because you give such nice parties—but of course
     that is only his fun, you know. However, I suppose somebody has told Lord Palmerston of all
     those great buildings that were meant for the factories, and of Carlingford being such a
     healthy place. And so the General is coming to us to-morrow, Lucilla—General Travers, you know,
     that was in all the papers for something he did in India; Charles used to know him at school.
     He is quite handsome, and has ever so many medals and things. It is a dreadful addition to
     one's troubles in holiday-time, you know; but, my dear, I hope you will ask him to your
     Thursdays, and help us to make Carlingford pleasant to him. It all depends upon him," said Mrs
     Centum solemnly;—"if he likes the place, and thinks it will do, and finds nice society—whether
     it is here or at Hampton that they establish the depot."
"At Hampton!" cried Miss Marjoribanks naturally excited—"the stupidest, wretchedest little
     place——"
"That is just what Mr Centum says," said the visitor, with a sigh; "what I am nervous about
     is the servants, Lucilla; and you know that under-nurse of mine, what a nice steady girl she
     has always been, and such a comfort—but as soon as the soldiers come it turns their heads. I
     want you to tell me, if you'll be so very good, Lucilla, how Nancy makes that paté
     that Mr Centum is so fond of. I know it is a good deal to ask; but I am sure you are one to
     stand by your friends; and if the General should take a dislike to Carlingford through any
     fault of mine, I never could forgive myself; and I want you to ask him to your Thursdays,
     Lucilla—there's a dear."
"Dear Mrs Centum," cried Miss Marjoribanks, "papa must call on the General and ask him to
     dinner: as for my Thursdays, I always say they are not parties; they are only
     evenings," said Lucilla sweetly, "and not worth a gentleman's while."
"And about the paté, Lucilla," said Mrs Centum anxiously, "I hope you won't think it
     too much of me to ask;—you are so clever, you know, and so is Nancy: and what with the noise,
     and the nursery dinners, and all those big boys home from school——"
Mrs Centum fixed her eyes with true solicitude on Lucilla's face. Miss Marjoribanks was
     magnanimous, but the paté in question was one of the greatest triumphs of the Doctor's
     table. She thought, and with truth, that it was a great deal for any one to ask; but
     then it is true that genius has duties as well as privileges; and to impress upon mediocrity
     the benefit of loyally following and copying superior intelligence, is of itself a moral effect
     of the greatest importance. And besides, the woman who at such a moment produced a live General
     in Carlingford, and held out hopes of officers, was not a woman to be denied.
"I will write it down for you," said Lucilla graciously, "if you think your cook will
     understand; or perhaps Nancy might step in and show her how—if I can persuade Nancy. Dear Mrs
     Centum, I hope you will always feel sure that I am ready to do anything for my friends."
"Oh, thank you, dear," cried the grateful woman; "I knew you were not one to mind; and if
     Nancy would be so very kind——I am sure you will like the General," added Mrs Centum, with
     effusion; "he will live here, you know, if the depot comes, and be such an addition! I said to
     Charles, the moment he told me, That would just be the very thing for Lucilla! And he is quite
     young looking, and so nice and pleasant," she added, in the fulness of her enthusiasm and
     gratitude. As for Miss Marjoribanks, she shook her head, but nevertheless received the
     assurance with a smile.
"It is not that sort of thing I am thinking of," said Lucilla: "if it had been, I need never
     have come home; and now, after papa has been so kind about the drawing-room——; but I am always
     glad to hear of nice new people," said Miss Marjoribanks; "and to meet a man that has been in
     the world is such a pleasure to papa."
With this benign acknowledgment of the General's merits, Lucilla received Mrs Centum's
     affectionate leave-takings. To be sure, she knew nothing, and did not occupy herself much at
     that moment about General Travers. But at the same time Miss Marjoribanks, with her usual
     piety, recognised the approval of Providence in this new occurrence, and was naturally both
     encouraged and exhilarated. It is but in rare cases, as has been said, that the reward of
     virtue is given so promptly, and with such beautiful discrimination: and there are even people
     in the world who profess to have no faith in any prompt or visible recompense. But Lucilla was
     not of that new and heretical school. For her own part, she felt it very natural that her
     exertions for the good of her kind should thus be recognised and acknowledged, and returned to
     her plans with that sweet and exhilarating sense of moral harmony, which an approving Heaven,
     and a sense of blessings earned and goodness recompensed, are so well calculated to give.
