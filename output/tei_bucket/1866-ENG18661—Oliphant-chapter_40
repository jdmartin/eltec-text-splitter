Chapter XL
The result of Miss Marjoribanks's wise precaution and reticence was that Sir John Richmond
     and the Doctor and Colonel Chiley were all on Mr Ashburton's committee. They might not agree
     with his principles; but then when a man does not state any very distinct principles, it is
     difficult for any one, however well disposed, to disagree with him; and the fact that he was
     the man for Carlingford was so indisputable, that nobody attempted to go into the minor
     matters. "Mr Ashburton is a gentleman known to us all," Sir John said, with great effect, in
     his nomination speech; and it was a sentence which went to the hearts of his audience. The
     other candidate had been a long time from home, and it was longer still since anybody in
     Carlingford could be said to have benefited by his residence there. He had had all his things
     down from town, as Mr Holden, the upholsterer, pithily remarked—and that made a great
     difference to start with. As for Mr Ashburton, though it is true nobody knew what he thought
     about Reform or the Income-tax, everybody knew that he lived at the Firs, and was supplied in a
     creditable way by George Street tradesmen. There was no mystery whatever about him. People knew
     how much he had a year, and how much he paid for everything, and the way in which his accounts
     were kept, and all about him. Even when he had his wine direct from the growers (for naturally
     his own county could not supply the actual liquor), it was put in Carlingford bottles, and
     people knew the kinds he had, and how much, and a hundred agreeable details. And then, "he was
     a gentleman as was always ready to give his advice," as some of the people said. All this
     furnished an immense body of evidence in his favour, and made Sir John's remark eloquent. And
     then Carlingford, as a general rule, did not care the least in the world about Reform. There
     were a few people who had once done so, and it was remarked in Grove Street that Mr Tozer had
     once been in a dreadful state of mind about it. But he was quite tranquil on the subject now,
     and so was the community in general. And what was really wanted, as Lucilla's genius had seen
     at a glance, was not this or that opinion, but a good man.
But at the same time it would be vain to deny that Miss Marjoribanks looked forward to a
     possible visit from Mr Cavendish with a certain amount of anxiety. She was not frightened, for
     she knew her own powers; but she was a little excited and stimulated by the idea that he might
     come in at any minute, bringing back a crowd of recollections with him; and it was a perpetual
     wonder to her how he would take the inevitable difference, whether he would accept it as
     natural, or put on the airs of an injured man. Lucilla did not go out the two afternoons after
     her meeting with Mrs Woodburn, partly that she might not miss him if he called—for it was
     better to have it over; but Mr Cavendish did not come on either of these days. After that, of
     course, she did not wait for him any longer. But on the third or fourth day, when she was in
     Miss Brown's photographing room (the eldest Miss Brown was not married, and was a mother to the
     younger girls, and always enthusiastic about sitters), Mr Ashburton called about business, and
     Thomas came to fetch Miss Marjoribanks. She was sitting with the greatest good-nature for half
     a dozen pictures, knowing in her secret heart all the time that she would look a perfect
     fright, and that all Carlingford would see her grinning with imbecile amiability out of the
     hazy background of Miss Brown's cartes. Lucilla knew this, and had hitherto avoided
     the process with success; but now she gave in; and as the Major was there, of course they
     talked of the coming election, which, indeed, at present was almost the only topic of
     conversation in Grange Lane.
"Of course, you are on Mr Ashburton's committee," said Lucilla; "you must be, or going to be,
     after what you said the other day at lunch——"
"What did I say?" asked Major Brown, with an air of dismay; for, to tell the truth, his heart
     inclined a little towards poor Mr Cavendish, who was an old neighbour, and to whom Major Brown
     could not but think the Marjoribanks and others had behaved rather cruelly. But then in these
     electioneering matters one never knows what one may have done to compromise oneself without
     meaning it; and the Major was a little anxious to find out what he had said.
"Dear Major Brown," said Lucilla, seriously, "I am so sorry if you did not mean it. I am sure
     it was that as much as anything that influenced Mr Ashburton. He was turning it all over in his
     mind, you know, and was afraid the people he most esteemed in Carlingford would not agree with
     him, and did not know what to do; and then you said, What did it matter about opinions, if it
     was a good man?—that was what decided him," said Miss Marjoribanks, with sad yet gentle
     reproachfulness. "I am so sorry if you did not mean what you said——"
"Good heavens! I don't remember saying anything of the sort," said Major Brown. "I—I am sure
     I never thought of influencing anybody. It is true enough about a good man, you know; but if I
     had imagined for an instant that any one was paying attention——By George! it was you that said
     it, Lucilla—I remember now."
"Please don't make fun of me," said Miss Marjoribanks; "as if anybody cared what I
     say about politics. But I know that was what decided poor Mr Ashburton. Indeed, he told me so;
     and when he finds you did not mean anything——"
"But, good heavens!—I—I did mean something," cried the accused, with dismay. And he grew
     quite inarticulate in his confusion, and red in the face, and lost his head altogether, while
     Lucilla sat calmly looking on with that air of virtue at once severe and indulgent, which
     pities, and blames, and hopes that perhaps there is not so much harm done as might have been
     expected. This was the position of affairs when Thomas came to say that Miss Marjoribanks was
     wanted, as she had told him to do when her candidate came; for, to be sure, it was only next
     door. It was terrible to hear the soft sigh she gave when she shook hands with Major Brown. "I
     hope he will not feel it so much as I think; but I should be afraid to tell him," said Lucilla;
     and she went away, leaving the good man in a state of bewilderment and embarrassment and doubt,
     which would have been much more unpleasant if he had not felt so flattered at the same time. "I
     never meant to influence anybody, I am sure!" he said, with a comical mixture of complacence
     and dismay, when Lucilla was gone. "I have always said, papa, that you don't think enough of
     the weight people give to your opinion," Miss Brown replied, as she gave the final bath to her
     negatives; and they both left off work with a certain glow of comforted amour propre,
     and the most benevolent sentiments towards Mr Ashburton, who, to tell the truth, until he got
     his lesson from Miss Marjoribanks, had never once thought about the opinion of Major Brown.
He was sitting with Aunt Jemima when Lucilla came in, and talking to her in a steady sort of
     a way. Nothing could have made Mr Ashburton socially attractive, but still there are many
     people to whom this steady sort of talk is more agreeable than brilliancy. When a man is
     brilliant there is always a doubt in some minds whether he is trustworthy, or sincere, or to be
     relied upon; but an ordinary commonsense sort of talker is free from such suspicion. Mr
     Ashburton was very sorry to hear that Mrs John Marjoribanks had bad nights, and suggested that
     it might be nervousness, and hoped that the air of Carlingford would do her good, and was very
     glad to hear that her son was getting on so well in India; and Aunt Jemima could not help
     approving of him, and feeling that he was a person of substance and reflection, and not one of
     those fly-away young men who turn girls' heads, and never mean anything. Lucilla herself gained
     something in Mrs John's eyes from Mr Ashburton's high opinion; but at the same time it was
     quite clear that he was not thinking of anything sentimental, but was quite occupied about his
     election, as a man of sense should be. Lucilla came in with a fine bloom on her cheeks, but
     still with a shade of that sadness which had had so great an effect upon Major Brown. She had
     taken off her hat before she came in, and dropped into her chair with an air of languor and
     fatigue which was quite unusual to her. "It makes such a difference in life when one has
     something on one's mind," said Lucilla, and she sighed, as was but natural; for though that did
     not affect the energy of her proceedings, she knew and remembered at moments of discouragement
     how seldom one's most disinterested exertions are appreciated at the end.
"You want your lunch, my dear," said Mrs John.
"Perhaps I do," said Miss Marjoribanks, with a mournful affectionate smile. "I have been
     sitting to Maria Brown. She has taken six, and I am sure they are every one more hideous than
     the other; and they will go all over England, you know, for the Browns have hosts of people
     belonging to them; and everybody will say, 'So that is Miss Marjoribanks.' I don't
     think I am vain to speak of," said Lucilla, "but that sort of thing goes to one's heart."
"These amateurs are terrible people," said Mr Ashburton, in his steady way; "and photographs
     are a regular nuisance. For my part——"
"Don't say that," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I know what you are going to say; and you
      must sit to her, please. I have said already she must do one of you; and I will tell
     you presently about the Major. But wait and talk to Aunt Jemima a little, for I am so tired,"
     said Lucilla. She was lying back negligently in her seat, with that air of languor which so
     many young ladies excel in, but which was for her a novel indulgence. Her hand hung over the
     arm of her chair as if there was no longer any force in it. Her head fell back, her eyes were
     half closed; it was a moment of abandonment to her sensations, such as a high-principled young
     woman like Miss Marjoribanks seldom gives way to. But Lucilla went into it conscientiously, as
     into everything she did, that she might regain her strength for the necessary duties that were
     before her.
And it was at this moment that Thomas appeared at the door with a suspicion of a grin
     appearing at the corners of his sober mouth, and announced Mr Cavendish, who came in before an
     ordinary woman would have had time to open her eyes. This was the moment he had chosen for his
     first visit; and yet it was not he who had chosen it, but fate, who seemed to have in this
     respect a spite against Lucilla. It was not only the embarrassing presence of his rival, but
     the fact that neither of the two people in the room knew or had ever seen Mr Cavendish, that
     put a climax to the horror of the situation. She alone knew him, and had to take upon herself
     to present and introduce him, and bridge over for him the long interval of absence, and all
     this with the sense of being in the enemy's interest, and to a certain extent false to Mr
     Cavendish! Lucilla rose at once, but she was not a woman to make pretences. She did not throw
     off all in a moment her fatigue, and dash into spasmodic action. She held out her hand silently
     to Mr Cavendish, with a look which spoke only affectionate satisfaction in a friend's return.
     She did not even speak at all for the first moment, but contented herself with a look, which
     indeed, if he had been younger and less preoccupied, would no doubt have touched his very
     heart.
"So you have really come back," she said. "I am so glad! after all that people said about
     your being married and dead and ever so many stupid things. Oh! don't look at me, please. It
     doesn't matter with a gentleman, but I know as well as if you had told me that you think me
     dreadfully gone off——"
"I entertain such a profane idea!" said Mr Cavendish; but he was considerably
     embarrassed, and he was a great deal stouter, and altogether different from what he used to be,
     and he had not the light hand of his youth for a compliment. And then he sat down on the chair
     Thomas had given him; and he looked uncomfortable, to say the least of it; and he was getting
     large in dimensions and a little red in the face, and had by no means the air of thinking that
     it didn't matter for a gentleman. As for Miss Marjoribanks, it would be impossible to say what
     mists of illusion dropped away from her mind at the sight of him. Even while she smiled upon
     the new-comer, she could not but ask herself, with momentary dismay—Had she really
     gone off as much in the same time?
"I have been looking for you," Miss Marjoribanks resumed; "I waited in for you Tuesday and
     Wednesday, and it is so odd you should have come just at this minute. Aunt Jemima, this is Mr
     Cavendish, whom you have heard so much about—and don't go, please, Mr Ashburton—you two must
     know each other. You will be hearing of each other constantly; and I suppose you will have to
     shake hands or something on the hustings—so it will be much the best to begin it here."
But the two candidates did not shake hands: they bowed to each other in an alarming way,
     which did not promise much for their future brotherliness, and then they both stood bolt
     upright and stared at Miss Marjoribanks, who had relapsed, in the pleasantest way in the world,
     into her easy-chair.
"Now, please sit down and talk a little," said Lucilla; "I am so proud of having you both
     together. There never has been anybody in the world that I have missed so much as
     you—you knew that when you went away, but you didn't mind. Mr Ashburton is very nice,
     but he is of no use to speak of in an evening," said Miss Marjoribanks, turning a reflective
     glance upon her own candidate with a certain sadness; and then they both laughed as if it was a
     joke; but it was no joke, as one of them at least must have known.
"Lucilla," said Mrs John, with consternation, "I never heard anybody talk as you do; I am
     sure Mr Ashburton is the very best of society, and as for Mr Cavendish——"
"Dear Aunt Jemima," said Lucilla, "would you mind ringing the bell? I have been sitting to
     Maria Brown, and I am almost fainting. I wish you gentlemen would sit to her; it would please
     her, and it would not do you much harm; and then for your constituents, you
     know——"
"I hope you don't wish me to look like one of Maria Brown's photographs to my constituents,"
     said Mr Cavendish; "but then I am happy to say they all know me pretty well." This was said
     with a slight touch of gentlemanly spite, if there is such a thing; for, after all, he
      was an old power in Carlingford, though he had been so long away.
"Yes," said Lucilla reflectively, "but you are a little changed since then; a little
     perhaps—just a little—stouter, and——"
"Gone off?" said Mr Cavendish, with a laugh; but he felt horribly disconcerted all the same,
     and savage with Miss Marjoribanks, and could not think why "that fellow" did not go away. What
     had he to do in Lucilla's drawing-room? what did he mean by sitting down again and
     talking in that measured way to the old lady, as if all the ordinary rules of good breeding did
     not point out to him that he should have gone away and left the field clear?
"Oh, you know it does not matter for a gentleman," said Lucilla; and then she turned to Mr
     Ashburton—"I am sure the Major wants to see you, and he thinks that it was he who put it into
     your head to stand. He was here that day at lunch, you know, and it was something he
     said——"
"Quite true," said Mr Ashburton in his business way. "I shall go to see him at once. Thank
     you for telling me of it, Miss Marjoribanks; I shall go as soon as I leave here."
And then Mr Cavendish laughed. "This is what I call interesting," he said. "I hope Mr
     Ashburton sees the fun; but it is trying to an old friend to hear of that day at
     lunch, you know. I remember when these sort of allusions used to be pleasant enough; but when
     one has been banished for a thousand years——"
"Yes," said Lucilla, "one leaves all that behind, you know—one leaves ever so many things
     behind. I wish we could always be twenty, for my part. I always said, you know, that I should
     be gone off in ten years."
"Was it the only fib you ever told that you repeat it so?" said Mr Cavendish; and it was with
     this pretty speech that he took her downstairs to the well-remembered luncheon. "But you
      have gone off in some things when you have to do with a prig like that," he said in
     her ear, as they went down together, "and cast off old friends. It was a thing a fellow did not
     expect of you."
"I never cast off old friends," said Miss Marjoribanks. "We shall look for you on Thursday,
     you know, all the same. Must you go, Mr Ashburton, when lunch is on the table? But then, to be
     sure, you will be in time at the Browns'," said Lucilla sweetly, and she gave the one rival her
     hand while she held the arm of the other, at the door of the dining-room, in which Mr Ashburton
     had gallantly deposited Aunt Jemima before saying good-bye. They were both looking a little
     black, though the gloom was moderate in Mr Ashburton's case; but as for Lucilla, she stood
     between them a picture of angelic sweetness and goodness, giving a certain measure of her
     sympathy to both—Woman the Reconciler, by the side of those other characters of Inspirer and
     Consoler, of which the world has heard. The two inferior creatures scowled with politeness at
     each other, but Miss Marjoribanks smiled upon them both. Such was the way in which she overcame
     the difficulties of the meeting. Mr Ashburton went away a little annoyed, but still
     understanding his instructions, and ready to act upon them in that businesslike way he had, and
     Mr Cavendish remained, faintly reassured in the midst of his soreness and mortification, by at
     least having the field to himself and seeing the last (for the present) of his antagonist—which
     was a kind of victory in its way.
"I thought I knew you better than to think you ever would have anything to do with
      that sort of thing," said Mr Cavendish. "There are people, you know, whom I could
     have imagined—but a prig like that." He became indeed quite violent, as Aunt Jemima said
     afterwards, and met with that lady's decided disapproval, as may be supposed.
"Mr Ashburton is very well-bred and agreeable," Mrs John said, with emphasis. "I wish all the
     young men I see nowadays were as nice."
"Young men!" said Mr Cavendish. "Is that what people call young nowadays? And he must be
     insane, you know, or he would never dream of representing a town without saying a single word
     about his principles. I dare say he thinks it is original," said the unhappy man. He thought he
     was pointing out his rival's weakness to Lucilla, and he went on with energy—"I know you better
     than to think you can like that milk-and-water sort of thing."
"Oh, I don't pretend to know anything about politics," said Lucilla. "I hear you gentlemen
     talk, but I never pretend to understand. If we were not to leave you that all to
     yourselves, I don't know what you could find to do," Miss Marjoribanks added compassionately;
     and as she spoke she looked so like the Lucilla of old, who had schemed and plotted for Mr
     Cavendish, that he could not believe in her desertion in his heart.
"That is a delusion like the going off," he said. "I can't believe you have gone over to the
     enemy. When I remember how I have been roving about all those ten years, and how different it
     might have been, and whose fault it all was——"
This Mr Cavendish said in a low voice, but it did not the less horrify Aunt Jemima, who felt
     prepared for any atrocity after it. She would have withdrawn, in justice to her own sense of
     propriety; but then she thought it was not impossible that he might propose to Lucilla on the
     spot, or take her hand or something, and for propriety's sake she stayed.
"Yes," said Lucilla—and her heart did for one little moment give a faint thump against her
     breast. She could not help thinking what a difference it might have made to him, poor fellow,
     had he been under her lawful and righteous sway these ten years. But as she looked at him it
     became more and more apparent to Miss Marjoribanks that Mr Cavendish had gone off,
     whatever she herself might have done. The outlines of his fine figure had changed considerably,
     and his face was a little red, and he had the look of a man whose circumstances, spiritual and
     temporal, would not quite bear a rigid examination. As she looked at him her pity became tinged
     by a certain shade of resentment to think that after all it was his own fault. She could not,
     notwithstanding her natural frankness of expression, say to him, "You foolish soul, why didn't
     you marry me somehow, and make a man of yourself?" Lucilla carried honesty very far, but she
     could not go as far as that. "Yes," she said, turning her eyes upon him with a sort of abstract
     sympathy, and then she added softly, "Have you ever seen Her again?" with a lowering of her
     voice.
This interesting question, which utterly bewildered Aunt Jemima, drove Mr Cavendish wild with
     rage. Mrs John said afterwards that she felt a shiver go through her as he took up the
     carving-knife, though it was only to cut some cold beef. He grew white all at once, and pressed
     his lips tightly together, and fixed his eyes on the wall straight before him. "I did not
     think, after what I once said to you, Miss Marjoribanks, that you would continue to insult my
     judgment in that way," he said, with a chill which fell upon the whole table, and took the life
     out of everything, and dimmed the very fire in the chimney. And after that the conversation was
     of a sufficiently ordinary description until they went back again into the drawing-room, by
     which time Mr Cavendish seemed to have concluded that it was best to pocket the affront.
"I am going to begin my canvass to-morrow," he said. "I have not seen anybody yet. I have
     nobody but my sister to take me in hand, you know. There was once a time when it might
     have been different"—and he gave Lucilla a look which she thought on the whole it was best to
     meet.
"Yes," said Miss Marjoribanks, with cruel distinctness, "there was a time when you were the
     most popular man in Grange Lane—everybody was fond of you. I remember it as if it had been
     yesterday," said Lucilla, with a sigh.
"You don't give a man much encouragement, by Jove!" said the unlucky candidate. "You remember
     it like yesterday? It may be vanity, but I flatter myself I shall still be found the most
     popular man in Grange Lane."
Miss Marjoribanks sighed again, but she did not say anything. On the contrary she turned to
     Aunt Jemima, who kept in the background an alarmed and alert spectator, to consult her about a
     shade of wool; and just then Mr Cavendish, looking out of the window, saw Major Brown
     conducting his rival through his garden, and shaking hands with him cordially at the door. This
     was more than the patience of the other candidate could bear. A sudden resolution, hot and
     angry, as are the resolutions of men who feel themselves to have a failing cause, came into his
     mind. He had been badgered and baited to such an extent (as he thought) that he had not time to
     consider if it was wise or not. He, too, had sat to Maria Brown, and commanded once the warmest
     admiration of the household. He thought he would put it to the test, and see if after all his
     popularity was only a thing to be remembered like yesterday;—and it was with this intention
     that he bade a hurried good-bye to Lucilla, and, rushing out, threw himself at once upon the
     troubled waves of society, which had once been as smooth as glass to the most popular man in
     Grange Lane.
