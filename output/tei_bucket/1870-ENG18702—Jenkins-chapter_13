V.—Magistrate's Law.
The personnel of the magistrate to whom Mr. Dignam Bailey, Q. C., (with him Mr.
            Adolphus Stigma), applied in the case of re an infant, exparte Ginx, is not material to
            this history. He was like his fellow stipendiaries—mild as to humor, vigilant in his
            duties, opinionated in his views, resenting the troublesome intrusion into his court of
            a barrister, apt to treat him with about one-eighth of the courtesy extended to the
            humblest junior by the Queen's Bench, and curiously unequal both with himself and his
            brother magistrates in adjusting punishment. It will be most convenient to insert the
            report of the Daily Electric Meteor:—
 “WESTMINSTER. 
“Mr. Dignam Bailey, Q.C., (with whom was Mr. Adolphus Stigma), applied for a summons
            against Mary Dens, commonly called Sister Suspiciosa, of the convent of the Sisters of
            Misery, in Winkle Street, for abducting and detaining a male child of John Ginx and Mary
            his wife.
“Mr. D'ACERBITY. On whose behalf do you apply?
“The learned counsel stated that he was instructed by the Protestant Detectoral
            Association to apply on behalf of the mother. The case was also watched by the
            solicitors of the Society for Preventing the Suppression of Women and Children.
“Mr. D'ACERBITY. Does the father join in the application?
“Mr. BAILEY. No, sir.
“Mr. D'ACERBITY. Why? He ought to be joined if living.
“Mr. BAILEY. Perhaps you will allow me, sir, to state the case. The circumstances are
            peculiar. The fact is——
“Mr. D'ACERBITY. I cannot understand why the father should not be represented if the
            child has been abducted. Where was it taken from?
“Mr. Bailey proceeded to state that the child had been taken by a nun from No. 5,
            Rosemary Street, without the mother's consent, and was now imprisoned in the convent.
            The father appeared to be indifferent, or to have given a sort of general acquiescence.
            This was Mrs. Ginx's thirteenth child, around whom gathered the concentrated
            affections
“Mr. D'ACERBITY (interrupting the learned gentleman). We have no time for sentiment
            here, Mr. Bailey. If the father consented, can you call it abduction? It looks like
            reduction. (Laughter.)
“Mr. Bailey called attention to the consolidated statutes of criminal law, and said he
            was going for illegal detention rather than abduction, and argued at great length from
            section 56. At the conclusion of the argument, after refusing to hear Mr. Stigma,
“Mr. D'Acerbity said that the case clearly did not come within the section, and he was
            afraid the learned counsel knew it. The father had been a consenting party, on the
            counsel's own statement, to the child's removal, and no suggestion had been made that he
            had withdrawn his consent. He should refuse a summons.
“Mr. Bailey endeavored to address the magistrate but was stopped.
“Mr. D'ACERBITY. I have no more to say. You can apply to the Queen's Bench. I have no
            sympathy with you whatever.”
Mr. D'Acerbity's law was good, but—what has justice to do with “sympathies?” Surely the
            day after this report appeared the magistrate must have had a letter from the Home
            Secretary?
