VI-Popery and Protestantism in the Queen's Bench.
The application to the magistrate was far from satisfactory. There had not even been an
            exposure, and the Windmill Bulletin gayly bantered the Detectoral Association. Meanwhile
            had happened the grand christening, of which a circumstantial account was in the hands
            of the council of the Detectoral Association shortly after the ceremony had been
            performed. Here was a monstrous indignity to a Protestant child! The account was at once
            printed, together with a verbatim report of the application to the magistrate as well as
            one of “a conversation held with the mother by an agent of the Association.” Board-men
            paraded the great thoroughfares carrying this appeal:—
PROTESTANT DETECTORAL ASSOCIATION.
 NO POPERY! Abduction Of an Infant! Assault on the Liberty of the Subject!
              Mysterious and Awful Proceedings! Baptism of a Protestant Child in a Convent! OUTRAGE
              Upon the Nation by Foreign Mercenaries! Every Father and Mother is Invited to
              Co-operate in Maintaining the PROTESTANT RELIGION, The Sanctity of Home, and the
              Inviolability of BRITISH FREEDOM! NO SURRENDER! 
If there was no coherency in this production, it should be noted how little that is of
            the essence of popular appeal. The metropolis was in an uproar. Meetings were held,
            subscriptions poured in, dangerous crowds collected in Winkle Street. When Mr. Dignam
            Bailey, Q. C., went down to Westminster, to move the Court of Queen's Bench, multitudes
            besieged it. Protestant champions and Papal ecclesiastics vied in their efforts to get
            seats. The writ had gone from judge's chambers returnable to the full court. Sister
            Suspiciosa, bearing the infant Ambrosius, and supported by two novices and Father
            Certificatus, had been smuggled into court through mysterious passages in its rear. Mrs.
            Ginx also, brought from Rosemary Street by the little man who provided her with a bonnet
            trimmed with orange-colored ribbons, sat staring with red eyes at her child, now
            enveloped in a robe that was embroidered with little crosses.
Why need I tell you, how dead silence fell upon the Court after the stir caused by the
            entrance of the judges; how everybody knew what was coming when a master beneath the
            bench rose, and called out, “Re Ginx, an infant, Exparte Mary Ginx!” How the Chief
            Justice, fresh and rosy-looking, then blew his nose in a delicate mauve-colored silk
            handkerchief: how he tried and discarded half-a-dozen pens, amid breathless silence; how
            in his blandest manner he said: “Who appears for the Respondent?” and Mr. Dignam Bailey,
            Q. C., and Mr. Octavius Ernestus, Q. C., rose together to say that Mr. Ernestus did!
Mr. Ernestus was a Catholic. He was assisted by half-a-dozen counsel. He riddled the
            affidavits on the other side, and read voluminous ones on his own; bitterly animadverted
            upon the absence of an affidavit by the father; held up to the scorn of a civilized
            world the course pursued towards his meek and gentle clients by the “fanatical zealots
            of the Protestant Detectoral Association;” in moving tones referred to the shrinking of
            “quiet recluses, from the gaze of a rude, unsympathizing world;” cited cases from the
            time of Magna Charta, down; called upon the Court to vindicate Protestant justice,
            ending his peroration with the aphorism of Lord Mansfield, Fiat justitia ruat
            caelum.
One cannot do Justice to Mr. Dignam Bailey's argument, when after lunch he rose to
            reply. He was logical and passionate, vindictive and pathetic by turns. He inveighed
            against the Lady Superior, against her attorneys, against Father Certificatus, against
            Ginx,—“craven to his heaven-born rights of political and religious freedom,”—against the
            Roman Catholic religion, the Pope, the Archbishop of Westminster, the Virgin Mary. The
            Court knew, and every one else knew, that this was pure pyrotechny, and Mr. Bailey knew
            that best of all; but, though the Bench is swift to speak, slow to hear, it felt
            obliged, in a case of this public interest, to sit by, and be witnesses of the
            exhibition. Mr. Bailey concluded by a play on the aphorism cited by his learned friend.
            “He would say that if such justice were to be done, as his friend had urged, the Kingdom
            of Heaven in England would rush to its fall.”
The Court at once decided that, as the father had confided the custody of the infant to
            the Sisters of Misery, and did not appear to desire that it should be withdrawn, they,
            disregarding the religious clouds in which the subject had been too carefully involved
            on both sides, gave judgment for the defendant, with costs.
As they passed out of Court, Mr. Stigma said to his clients, “Quite as I anticipated;
            you remember I told you so in my Opinion.”
