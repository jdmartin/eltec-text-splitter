III.—“The World is my Parish.”
When Mr. Phillpotts called upon Doll, the cheesemonger, the latter straightway gave him
            the facts as they had occurred. He pointed out the exact spot on which the bundle had
            lain; he gave an estimate of the number of inches on each side of the line occupied by
            it, and declared that the head and shoulders of the infant lay in the parish of the
            solicitor's clients. Ginx's Baby, under the title “Re a Foundling,” was once more
            submitted for the opinion of counsel. They advised the Board that as the child was in
            both parishes when found, but had been taken up by a ratepayer of St. Simon Magus, the
            latter parish was bound to support him. Whereupon the Guardians of St. Bartimeus at
            their next meeting resolved that the Vestry of the other parish should have a written
            notice to remove the child, failing which application should be made to the Queen's
            Bench for a mandamus to compel them to do it.
On receiving the challenge the Guardians of St. Simon Magus also took counsel's
            opinion. They were advised that as the greater part, and especially the head of the
            infant, was when discovered in the parish of St. Bartimeus, the latter was clearly
            chargeable. Both parties then proceeded to swear affidavits. The Attorney-General and
            Solicitor-General, the two great law-officers of the crown, were retained on opposite
            sides, and took fees—not for an Imperial prosecution, but as petty Queen's Counsel in an
            inter-parochial squabble.
