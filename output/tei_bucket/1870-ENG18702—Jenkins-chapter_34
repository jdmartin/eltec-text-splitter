The Last Chapter.
Our hero was nearly fifteen years old when he left the Club to plunge into the world.
            He was not long in converting his spoils into money, and a very short time in spending
            it. Then he had to pit his wits against starvation, and some of his throws were
            desperate. Wherever he went the world seemed terribly full. If he answered an
            advertisement for an errand-boy, there were a score kicking their heels at the
            rendezvous before him. Did he try to learn a useful trade, thousands of adepts were not
            only ready to underbid him, but to knock him on the head for an interloper. Even the
            thieves, to whom he gravitated, were jealous of his accession, because there were too
            many competitors already in their department. Through his career of penury, of honest
            and dishonest callings, of 'scapes and captures, imprisonments and other punishments, a
            year's reading of Metropolitan Police Reports would furnish the exact counterpart.
I don't know how many years after his flight from Pall Mall, one dim midnight, I,
            returning from Richmond, lounged over Vauxhall Bridge, listening to the low lapping of
            the current beneath the arches—looking above to the stars and along the dark polished
            surface that reflected a thousand lights in its undulations,—feeling the awfulness of
            the dense, suppressed life that was wrapt within the gloom and calm of the hour. I
            suddenly saw a shadow, a human shadow, that at the sound of my footstep quickly crossed
            my dreamy vision—quickly, noiselessly came and went before my eyes until it stood up
            high and outlined against the strangely-mingled haze. It looked like the ghost of a
            slight-formed man, hatless and coatless, and for a moment I saw at its upper extremity
            the dull flash as of a human face in the gloom, before the shadow leaped out far into
            the night. Splash! When my startled eyes looked down upon the glancing, waving ebony, I
            thought I could trace a white coruscation of foam spreading out into the darkness,
            instantly to dissipate and be lost for ever. I did not then know what form it was that
            swilled down below the glistening current. Had I known that it was Ginx's Baby I should
            perhaps have thought “Society, which, in the sacred names of Law and Charity, forbad the
            father to throw his child over Vauxhall Bridge, at a time when he was alike unconscious
            of life and death, has at last itself driven him over the parapet into the greedy
            waters”——
Philosophers, Philanthropists, Politicians, Papists and Protestants, Poor-Law Ministers
            and Parish Officers—while you have been theorizing and discussing, debating, wrangling,
            legislating and administering—Good God! gentlemen, between you all, where has Ginx's
            Baby gone to?
