VIII.â€”The Baby's First Translation.
The stonemason had been the hero of the moment; now attention centred on our own hero.
            Ginx hurried off again, but as the crowd opened before him, he was met, and his mad
            career stayed, by a slight figure, feminine, draped in black to the feet, wearing a
            curiously framed white-winged hood above her pale face, and a large cross suspended from
            her girdle. He could not run her down.
NUN. Stop, MAN! Are you mad? Give me the child.
He placed the little bundle in her arms. She uncovered the queer, ruby face, and kissed
            it. Ginx had not looked at the face before, but after seeing it, and the act of this
            woman, he could not have touched a hair of his child's head. His purpose died from that
            moment, though his perplexity was still alive.
NUN. Let me have it. I will take it to the Sisters' Home, and it shall live there. Your
            wife may come and nurse it. We will take charge of it.
GINX. And you won't send it back again? You'll take it for good and all?
NUN. O, yes.
GINX. Good. Give us yer hand.
A little white hand came out from under her burthen, and was at once half-crushed in
            Ginx's elephantine grasp.
GINX. Done. Thank'ee, missus. Come, mates, I'll stand a drink.
A few minutes after, the woman of the cross, who had been up to comfort the poor
            mother, fluttered with her white wings down Rosemary Street, carrying in her arms Ginx's
            Baby.
