CHAPTER XIII.
But the next noon-time brought him to the market stall, and the next also, and so the summer
     days slipped away, and Bébée was quite happy if she saw him in the morning time, to give him a
     fresh rose, or at evening by the gates, or under the beech-trees, when he brought her a new
     book, and sauntered awhile up the green lane beside her.
An innocent, unconscious love like Bébée's wants so little food to make it all content. Such
     mere trifles are beautiful and sweet to it. Such slender stray gleams of light suffice to make
     a broad, bright golden noon of perfect joy around it.
All the delirium, and fever, and desire, and despair, that are in maturer passion, are far
     away from it: far as is the flash of the meteor across sultry skies from the blue forget-me-not
     down in the brown meadow brook.
It was very wonderful to Bébée that he, this stranger from Rubes' fairyland, could come at
     all to keep pace with her little clattering wooden shoes over the dust and the grass in the dim
     twilight time. The days went by in a trance of sweet amaze, and she kept count of the hours no
     more by the cuckoo-clock of the mill-house, or the deep chimes of the Brussels belfries; but
     only by such moments as brought her a word from his lips, or even a glimpse of him from afar,
     across the crowded square.
She sat up half the nights reading the books he gave her, studying the long cruel
     polysyllables, and spelling slowly through the phrases that seemed to her so cramped and
     tangled, and which yet were a pleasure to unravel forsake of the thought they held.
For Bébée, ignorant little simple soul that she was, had a mind in her that was eager,
     observant, quick to acquire, skilful to retain; and it would happen in certain times that
     Flamen, speaking to her of the things which he gave to her to read, would think to himself that
     this child had more wisdom than was often to be found in schools.
Meanwhile he pondered various studies in various stages of a Gretchen, and made love to
     Bébée—made love at least by his eyes and by his voice, not hurrying his pleasant task, but
     hovering about her softly, and mindful not to scare her, as a man will gently lower his hand
     over a poised butterfly that he seeks to kill, and which one single movement, a thought too
     quick, may scare away to safety.
Bébée knew where he lived in the street of Mary of Burgundy: in an old palace that belonged
     to a great Flemish noble, who never dwelt there himself; but to ask anything about him—why he
     was there? what his rank was? why he stayed in the city at all?—was a sort of treason that
     never entered her thoughts.
Psyche, if she had been as simple and loyal as Bébée was, would never have lighted her own
     candle; but even Psyche would not have borrowed any one else's lamp to lighten the love
     darkness.
To Bébée he was sacred, unapproachable, unquestionable; he was a wonderful, perfect happiness
     that had fallen into her life; he was a gift of God, as the sun was.
She took his going and coming as she took that of the sun, never dreaming of reproaching his
     absence, never dreaming of asking if in the empty night he shone on any other worlds than
     hers.
It was hardly so much a faith with her as an instinct; faith must reason ere it know itself
     to be faith. Bébée never reasoned any more than her roses did.
The good folks in the market place watched her a little anxiously; they thought ill of that
     little moss-rose that every day found its way to one wearer only; but after all they did not
     see much, and the neighbors nothing at all. For he never went home to her, nor with her, and
     most of the time that he spent with Bébée was in the quiet evening shadows, as she went up with
     her empty basket through the deserted country roads.
Bébée was all day long in the city, indeed, as other girls were, but with her it had always
     been different. Antoine had always been with her up to the day of his death; and after his
     death she had sat in the same place, surrounded by the people she had known from infancy, and
     an insult to her would have been answered by a stroke from the cobbler's strap or from the
     tinker's hammer. There was one girl only who ever tried to do her any harm—a good-looking stout
     wench, who stood at the corner of the Montagne de la Cour with a stall of fruit in the summer
     time, and in winter time drove a milk cart over the snow. This girl would get at her sometimes,
     and talk of the students, and tell her how good it was to get out of the town on a holiday, and
     go to any one of the villages where there was Kermesse and dance, and drink the little blue
     wine, and have trinkets bought for one, and come home in the moonlight in a char-à-banc, with
     the horns sounding, and the lads singing, and the ribbons flying from the old horse's ears.
"She is such a little close sly thing!" thought the fruit girl, sulkily. To vice, innocence
     must always seem only a superior kind of chicanery.
"We dance almost every evening, the children and I," Bébée had answered when urged fifty
     times by this girl to go to fairs, and balls at the wine shops. "That does just as well. And I
     have seen Kermesse once at Malines—it was beautiful. I went with Mère Dax, but it cost a great
     deal I know, though she did not let me pay."
"You little fool!" the fruit girl would say, and grin, and eat a pear.
But the good honest old women who sat about in the Grande Place, hearing, had always taken
     the fruit girl to task, when they got her by herself.
"Leave the child alone, you mischievous one," said they. "Be content with being base
     yourself. Look you, Lisette; she is not one like you to make eyes at the law students, and
     pester the painter lads for a day's outing. Let her be, or we will tell your mother how you
     leave the fruit for the gutter children to pick and thieve, while you are stealing up the
     stairs into that young French fellow's chamber. Oh, oh! a fine beating you will get when she
     knows!"
Lisette's mother was a fierce and strong old Brabantoise who exacted heavy reckoning with her
     daughter for every single plum and peach that she sent out of her dark sweet-smelling fruit
     shop to be sunned in the streets, and under the students' love-glances.
So the girl took heed, and left Bébée alone.
"What should I want her to come with us for?" she reasoned with herself. "She is twice as
     pretty as I am; Jules might take to her instead—who knows?"
So that she was at once savage and yet triumphant when she saw, as she thought, Bébée
     drifting down the high flood of temptation.
"Oh, oh, you dainty one!" she cried one day to her. "So you would not take the nuts and
     mulberries that do for us common folk, because you had a mind for a fine pine out of the
     hothouses! That was all, was it? Eh, well; I do not begrudge you. Only take care; remember, the
     nuts and mulberries last through summer and autumn, and there are heaps of them on every
     fair-stall and street corner; but the pine, that is eaten in a day, one springtime, and its
     like does not grow in the hedges. You will have your mouth full of sugar an hour,—and then,
     eh!—you will go famished all the year."
"I do not understand," said Bébée, looking up, with her thoughts far away, and scarcely
     hearing the words spoken to her.
"Oh, pretty little fool! you understand well enough," said Lisette, grinning, as she rubbed
     up a melon. "Does he give you fine things? You might let me see."
"No one gives me anything."
"Chut! you want me to believe that. Why Jules is only a lad, and his father is a silk mercer,
     and only gives him a hundred francs a month, but Jules buys me all I want—somehow—or do you
     think I would take the trouble to set my cap straight when he goes by? He gave me these
     ear-rings, look. I wish you would let me see what you get."
But Bébée had gone away—unheeding—dreaming of Juliet and of Jeanne d'Arc, of whom he had told
     her tales.
He made sketches of her sometimes, but seldom pleased himself.
It was not so easy as he had imagined that it would prove to portray this little flower-like
     face, with the clear eyes and the child's open brow. He who had painted Phryne so long and
     faithfully had got a taint on his brush—he could not paint this pure, bright, rosy dawn—he who
     had always painted the glare of midnight gas on rouge or rags. Yet he felt that if he could
     transfer to canvas the light that was on Bébée's face he would get what Scheffer had missed.
     For a time it eluded him. You shall paint a gold and glistening brocade, or a fan of peacock's
     feathers, to perfection, and yet, perhaps, the dewy whiteness of the humble little field daisy
     shall baffle and escape you.
He felt, too, that he must catch her expression flying as he would do the flash of a
     swallow's wing across a blue sky; he knew that Bébée, forced to studied attitudes in an
     atelier, would be no longer the ideal that he wanted.
More than once he came and filled in more fully his various designs in the little hut garden,
     among the sweet gray lavender and the golden disks of the sunflowers; and more than once Bébée
     was missed from her place in the front of the Broodhuis.
The Varnhart children would gather now and then open-mouthed at the wicket, and Mère Krebs
     would shake her head as she went by on her sheepskin saddle, and mutter that the child's head
     would be turned by vanity; and old Jehan would lean on his stick and peer through the
     sweetbrier, and wonder stupidly if this strange man who could make Bébée's face beam over again
     upon that panel of wood could not give him back his dead daughter who had been pushed away
     under the black earth so long, long before, when the red mill had been brave and new, the red
     mill that the boys and girls called old.
But except these, no one noticed much.
Painters were no rare sights in Brabant.
The people were used to see them coming and going, making pictures of mud and stones, and
     ducks and sheep, and of all common and silly things.
"What does he pay you, Bébée?" they used to ask, with the shrewd Flemish thought after the
     main chance.
"Nothing," Bébée would answer, with a quick color in her face; and they would reply in
     contemptuous reproof, "Careless little fool; you should make enough to buy you wood all winter.
     When the man from Ghent painted Trine and her cow, he gave her a whole gold bit for standing
     still so long in the clover. The Krebs would be sure to lend you her cow, if it be the cow that
     makes the difference."
Bébée was silent, weeding her carnation bed;—what could she tell them that they would
     understand?
She seemed so far away from them all—those good friends of her childhood—now that this
     wonderful new world of his giving had opened to her sight.
She lived in a dream.
Whether she sat in the market place taking copper coins, or in the moonlight with a book on
     her knees, it was all the same. Her feet ran, her tongue spoke, her hands worked; she did not
     neglect her goat or her garden, she did not forsake her house labor or her good deeds to old
     Annémie; but all the while she only heard one voice, she only felt one touch, she only saw one
     face.
Here and there—one in a million—there is a female thing that can love like this, once and
     forever.
Such an one is dedicated, birth upwards, to the Mater Dolorosa.
He had something nearer akin to affection for her than he had ever had in his life for
     anything, but he was never in love with her—no more in love with her than with the
     moss-rosebuds that she fastened in his breast. Yet he played with her, because she was such a
     little, soft, tempting female thing; and because, to see her face flush, and her heart heave,
     to feel her fresh feelings stir into life, and to watch her changes from shyness to confidence,
     and from frankness again into fear, was a natural pastime in the lazy golden weather.
That he spared her as far as he did,—when after all she would have married Jeannot
     anyhow,—and that he sketched her face in the open air, and never entered her hut and never
     beguiled her to his own old palace in the city, was a new virtue in himself for which he hardly
     knew whether to feel respect or ridicule; anyway, it seemed virtue to him.
So long as he did not seduce the body, it seemed to him that it could never matter how he
     slew the soul,—the little, honest, happy, pure, frank soul, that amidst its poverty and
     hardships was like a robin's song to the winter sun.
"Hoot, toot, pretty innocent, so you are no better than the rest of us," hissed her enemy,
     Lisette, the fruit girl, against her as she went by the stall one evening as the sun set.
     "Prut! so it was no such purity after all that made you never look at the student lads and the
     soldiers, eh? You were so dainty of taste, you must needs pick and choose, and, Lord's sake,
     after all your coyness, to drop at a beckoning finger as one may say—pong!—in a minute, like an
     apple over-ripe! Oh hé, you sly one!"
Bébée flushed red, in a sort of instinct of offence; not sure what her fault was, but vaguely
     stung by the brutal words.
Bébée walked homeward by him, with her empty baskets: looked at him with grave wondering
     eyes.
"What did she mean? I do not understand. I must have done some wrong—or she thinks so. Do you
     know?"
Flamen laughed, and answered her evasively,—
"You have done her the wrong of a fair skin when hers is brown, and a little foot while hers
     is as big as a trooper's; there is no greater sin, Bébée, possible in woman to woman."
"Hold your peace, you shrill jade," he added, in anger to the fruiterer, flinging at her a
     crown piece, that the girl caught, and bit with her teeth with a chuckle. "Do not heed her,
     Bébée. She is a coarse-tongued brute, and is jealous, no doubt."
"Jealous?—of what?"
The word had no meaning to Bébée.
"That I am not a student or a soldier, as her lovers are."
As her lovers were! Bébée felt her face burn again. Was he her lover then? The child's
     innocent body and soul thrilled with a hot, sweet delight and fear commingled.
Bébée was not quite satisfied until she had knelt down that night and asked the Master of all
     poor maidens to see if there were any wickedness in her heart, hidden there like a bee in a
     rose, and if there were to take it out and make her worthier of this wonderful new happiness in
     her life.
