CHAPTER II.
AT about the same hour on the same day in which the Englishman held the conference with the
      Parisian detective just related, the Marquis de Rochebriant found himself by appointment in
      the cabinet d’affaires of his avoue M. Gandrin that gentleman had hitherto not found time to
      give him a definite opinion as to the case submitted to his judgment. The avoue received Alain
      with a kind of forced civility, in which the natural intelligence of the Marquis, despite his
      inexperience of life, discovered embarrassment.
“Monsieur le Marquis,” said Gandrin, fidgeting among the papers on his bureau, “this is a
      very complicated business. I have given not only my best attention to it, but to your general
      interests. To be plain, your estate, though a fine one, is fearfully encumbered—fearfully—
      frightfully.”
“Sir,” said the Marquis, haughtily, “that is a fact which was never disguised from you.”
“I do not say that it was, Marquis; but I scarcely realized the amount of the liabilities
      nor the nature of the property. It will be difficult—nay, I fear, impossible—to find any
      capitalist to advance a sum that will cover the mortgages at an interest less than you now
      pay. As for a Company to take the whole trouble off your hands, clear off the mortgages,
      manage the forests, develop the fisheries, guarantee you an adequate income, and at the end of
      twenty-one years or so render up to you or your heirs the free enjoyment of an estate thus
      improved, we must dismiss that prospect as a wild dream of my good friend M. Hebert. People in
      the provinces do dream; in Paris everybody is wide awake.”
“Monsieur,” said the Marquis, with that inborn imperturbable loftiness of sang froid which
      has always in adverse circumstances characterized the French noblesse, “be kind enough to
      restore my papers. I see that you are not the man for me. Allow me only to thank you, and
      inquire the amount of my debt for the trouble I have given.”
“Perhaps you are quite justified in thinking I am not the man for you, Monsieur le Marquis;
      and your papers shall, if you decide on dismissing me, be returned to you this evening. But as
      to my accepting remuneration where I have rendered no service, I request M. le Marquis to put
      that out of the question. Considering myself, then, no longer your avoue, do not think I take
      too great a liberty in volunteering my counsel as a friend,—or a friend at least to M. Hebert,
      if you do not vouchsafe my right so to address yourself.”
M. Gandrin spoke with a certain dignity of voice and manner which touched and softened his
      listener.
“You make me your debtor far more than I pretend to repay,” replied Alain. “Heaven knows I
      want a friend, and I will heed with gratitude and respect all your counsels in that
      character.”
“Plainly and briefly, my advice is this: M. Louvier is the principal mortgagee. He is among
      the six richest capitalists of Paris. He does not, therefore, want money, but, like most
      self-made men, he is very accessible to social vanities. He would be proud to think he had
      rendered a service to a Rochebriant. Approach him, either through me, or, far better, at once
      introduce yourself, and propose to consolidate all your other liabilities in one mortgage to
      him, at a rate of interest lower than that which is now paid to some of the small mortgagees.
      This would add considerably to your income and would carry out M. Hebert’s advice.”
“But does it not strike you, dear M. Gandrin, that such going cap-in-hand to one who has
      power over my fate, while I have none over his, would scarcely be consistent with my
      self-respect, not as Rochebriant only, but as Frenchman?”
“It does not strike me so in the least; at all events, I could make the proposal on your
      behalf, without compromising yourself, though I should be far more sanguine of success if you
      addressed M. Louvier in person.”
“I should nevertheless prefer leaving it in your hands; but even for that I must take a few
      days to consider. Of all the mortgagees M. Louvier has been hitherto the severest and most
      menacing, the one whom Hebert dreads the most; and should he become sole mortgagee, my whole
      estate would pass to him if, through any succession of bad seasons and failing tenants, the
      interest was not punctually paid.”
“It could so pass to him now.”
“No; for there have been years in which the other mortgagees, who are Bretons and would be
      loath to ruin a Rochebriant, have been lenient and patient.”
“If Louvier has not been equally so, it is only because he knew nothing of you, and your
      father no doubt had often sorely tasked his endurance. Come, suppose we manage to break the
      ice easily. Do me the honour to dine here to meet him; you will find that he is not an
      unpleasant man.”
The Marquis hesitated, but the thought of the sharp and seemingly hopeless struggle for the
      retention of his ancestral home to which he would be doomed if he returned from Paris
      unsuccessful in his errand overmastered his pride. He felt as if that self-conquest was a duty
      he owed to the very tombs of his fathers. “I ought not to shrink from the face of a creditor,”
      said he, smiling somewhat sadly, “and I accept the proposal you so graciously make.”
“You do well, Marquis, and I will write at once to Louvier to ask him to give me his first
      disengaged day.”
The Marquis had no sooner quitted the house than M. Gandrin opened a door at the side of his
      office, and a large portly man strode into the room,—stride it was rather than step,—firm,
      self-assured, arrogant, masterful.
“Well, mon ami,” said this man, taking his stand at the hearth, as a king might take his
      stand in the hall of his vassal, “and what says our petit muscadin?”
“He is neither petit nor muscadin, Monsieur Louvier,” replied Gandrin, peevishly; “and he
      will task your powers to get him thoroughly into your net. But I have persuaded him to meet
      you here. What day can you dine with me? I had better ask no one else.”
“To-morrow I dine with my friend O——-, to meet the chiefs of the Opposition,” said M.
      Louvier, with a sort of careless rollicking pomposity. “Thursday with Pereire; Saturday I
      entertain at home. Say Friday. Your hour?”
“Seven.”
“Good! Show me those Rochebriant papers again; there is something I had forgotten to note.
      Never mind me. Go on with your work as if I were not here.”
Louvier took up the papers, seated himself in an armchair by the fireplace, stretched out
      his legs, and read at his ease, but with a very rapid eye, as a practised lawyer skims through
      the technical forms of a case to fasten upon the marrow of it.
“Ah! as I thought. The farms could not pay even the interest on my present mortgage; the
      forests come in for that. If a contractor for the yearly sale of the woods was bankrupt and
      did not pay, how could I get my interest? Answer me that, Gandrin.”
“Certainly you must run the risk of that chance.”
“Of course the chance occurs, and then I foreclose, seize,—Rochebriant and its seigneuries
      are mine.”
As he spoke he laughed, not sardonically,—a jovial laugh,—and opened wide, to reshut as in a
      vice, the strong iron hand which had doubtless closed over many a man’s all.
“Thanks. On Friday, seven o’clock.” He tossed the papers back on the bureau, nodded a royal
      nod, and strode forth imperiously as he had strode in.
