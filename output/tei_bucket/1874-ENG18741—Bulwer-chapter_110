CHAPTER V.
The time now came when all provision of food or of fuel failed the modest household of
      Isaura; and there was not only herself and the Venosta to feed and warm—there were the
      servants whom they had brought from Italy, and had not the heart now to dismiss to the
      ‘certainty of famine. True, one of the three, the man, had returned to his native land before
      the commencement of the siege; but the two women had remained. They supported themselves now
      as they could on the meagre rations accorded by the Government. Still Isaura attended the
      ambulance to which she was attached. From the ladies associated with her she could readily
      have obtained ample supplies: but they had no conception of her real state of destitution; and
      there was a false pride generally prevalent among the respectable classes, which Isaura
      shared, that concealed distress lest alms should be proffered.
The destitution of the household had been carefully concealed from the parents of Gustave
      Rameau, until, one day, Madame Rameau, entering at the hour at which she generally, and her
      husband sometimes, came for a place by the fireside and a seat at the board, found on the one
      only ashes, on the other a ration of the black nauseous compound which had become the
      substitute for bread.
Isaura was absent on her duties at the ambulance hospital,—purposely absent, for she shrank
      from the bitter task of making clear to the friends of her betrothed the impossibility of
      continuing the aid to their support which their son had neglected to contribute; and still
      more from the comment which she knew they would make on his conduct, in absenting himself so
      wholly of late, and in the time of such trial and pressure, both from them and from herself.
      Truly, she rejoiced at that absence so far as it affected herself. Every hour of the day she
      silently asked her conscience whether she were not now absolved from a promise won from her
      only by an assurance that she had power to influence for good the life that now voluntarily
      separated itself from her own. As she had never loved Gustave, so she felt no resentment at
      the indifference his conduct manifested. On the contrary, she hailed it as a sign that the
      annulment of their betrothal would be as welcome to him as to herself. And if so, she could
      restore to him the sort of compassionate friendship she had learned to cherish in the hour of
      his illness and repentance. She had resolved to seize the first opportunity he afforded to her
      of speaking to him with frank and truthful plainness. But, meanwhile, her gentle nature
      recoiled from the confession of her resolve to appeal to Gustave himself for the rupture of
      their engagement.
Thus the Venosta alone received Madame Rameau; and while that lady was still gazing round
      her with an emotion too deep for immediate utterance, her husband entered with an expression
      of face new to him—the look of a man who has been stung to anger, and who has braced his mind
      to some stern determination. This altered countenance of the good-tempered bourgeois was not,
      however, noticed by the two women. The Venosta did not even raise her eyes to it, as with
      humbled accents she said, “Pardon, dear Monsieur, pardon, Madame, our want of hospitality; it
      is not our hearts that fail. We kept our state from you as long as we could. Now it speaks for
      itself; ‘la fame e una bretta festin.’”
“Oh, Madame! and oh, my poor Isaura!” cried Madame Rameau, bursting into tears. “So we have
      been all this time a burden on you,—aided to bring such want on you! How can we ever be
      forgiven? And my son—to leave us thus,—not even to tell us where to find him!”
“Do not degrade us, my wife,” said M. Rameau, with unexpected dignity, “by a word to imply
      that we would stoop to sue for support to our ungrateful child. No, we will not starve! I am
      strong enough still to find food for you. I will apply for restoration to the National Guard.
      They have augmented the pay to married men; it is now nearly two francs and a half a-day to a
      pere de famille, and on that pay we all can at least live. Courage, my wife! I will go at once
      for employment. Many men older than I am are at watch on the ramparts, and will march to the
      battle on the next sortie.”
“It shall not be so,” exclaimed Madame Rameau, vehemently, and winding her arm round her
      husband’s neck. “I loved my son better than thee once—more shame to me. Now, I would rather
      lose twenty such sons than peril thy life, my Jacques! Madame,” she continued, turning to the
      Venosta, “thou wert wiser than I. Thou wert ever opposed to the union between thy young friend
      and my son. I felt sore with thee for it—a mother is so selfish when she puts herself in the
      place of her child. I thought that only through marriage with one so pure, so noble, so holy,
      Gustave could be saved from sin and evil. I am deceived. A man so heartless to his parents, so
      neglectful of his affianced, is not to be redeemed. I brought about this betrothal: tell
      Isaura that I release her from it. I have watched her closely since she was entrapped into it.
      I know how miserable the thought of it has made her, though, in her sublime devotion to her
      plighted word, she sought to conceal from me the real state of her heart. If the betrothal
      bring such sorrow, what would the union do! Tell her this from me. Come, Jacques, come
      away!”
“Stay, Madame!” exclaimed the Venosta, her excitable nature much affected by this honest
      outburst of feeling. “It is true that I did oppose, so far as I could, my poor Piccola’s
      engagement with M. Gustave. But I dare not do your bidding. Isaura would not listen to me. And
      let us be just! M. Gustave may be able satisfactorily to explain his seeming indifference and
      neglect. His health is always very delicate; perhaps he may be again dangerously ill. He
      serves in the National Guard; perhaps—” she paused, but the mother conjectured the word left
      unsaid, and, clasping her hands, cried out in anguish, “Perhaps dead!—and we have wronged him!
      Oh, Jacques, Jacques! how shall we find out-how discover our boy? Who can tell us where to
      search? at the hospital—or in the cemeteries?” At the last word she dropped into a seat, and
      her whole frame shook with her sobs.
Jacques approached her tenderly, and kneeling by her side, said:
“No, m’amie, comfort thyself, if it be indeed comfort to learn that thy son is alive and
      well. For my part, I know not if I would not rather he had died in his innocent childhood. I
      have seen him—spoken to him. I know where he is to be found.”
“You do, and concealed it from me? Oh, Jacques!”
“Listen to me, wife, and you, too, Madame; for what I have to say should be made known to
      Mademoiselle Cicogna. Some time since, on the night of the famous sortie, when at my post on
      the ramparts, I was told that Gustave had joined himself to the most violent of the Red
      Republicans, and had uttered at the Club de la Vengeance sentiments, of which I will only say
      that I, his father and a Frenchman, hung my head with shame when they were repeated to me. I
      resolved to go to the club myself. I did. I heard him speak—heard him denounce Christianity as
      the instrument of tyrants.”
“Ah!” cried the two women, with a simultaneous shudder.
“When the assembly broke up, I waylaid him at the door. I spoke to him seriously. I told him
      what anguish such announcement of blasphemous opinions would inflict on his pious mother. I
      told him I should deem it my duty to inform Mademoiselle Cicogna, and warn her against the
      union on which he had told us his heart was bent. He appeared sincerely moved by what I said;
      implored me to keep silence towards his mother and his betrothed; and promised, on that
      condition, to relinquish at once what he called ‘his career as an orator,’ and appear no more
      at such execrable clubs. On this understanding I held my tongue. Why, with such other causes
      of grief and suffering, should I tell thee, poor wife, of a sin that I hoped thy son had
      repented and would not repeat? And Gustave kept his word. He has never, so far as I know,
      attended, at least spoken, at the Red clubs since that evening.”
“Thank heaven so far,” murmured Madame Rameau.
“So far, yes; but hear more. A little time after I thus met him he changed his lodging, and
      did not confide to us his new address, giving as a reason to us that he wished to avoid a clue
      to his discovery by that pertinacious Mademoiselle Julie.”
Rameau had here sunk his voice into a whisper, intended only for his wife, but the ear of
      the Venosta was fine enough to catch the sound, and she repeated, “Mademoiselle Julie! Santa
      Maria! who is she?”
“Oh!” said M. Rameau, with a shrug of his shoulders, and with true Parisian sangfroid as to
      such matters of morality, “a trifle not worth considering. Of course, a good-looking garcon
      like Gustave must have his little affairs of the heart before he settles for life. Unluckily,
      amongst those of Gustave was one with a violent-tempered girl who persecuted him when he left
      her, and he naturally wished to avoid all chance of a silly scandal, if only out of respect to
      the dignity of his fiancee. But I found that was not the true motive, or at least the only
      one, for concealment. Prepare yourself, my poor wife. Thou hast heard of these terrible
      journals which the decheance has let loose upon us. Our unhappy boy is the principal writer of
      one of the worst of them, under the name of ‘Diderot le Jeune.”’
“What!” cried the Venosta. “That monster! The good Abbe Vertpre was telling us of the
      writings with that name attached to them. The Abbe himself is denounced by name as one of
      those meddling priests who are to be constrained to serve as soldiers or pointed out to the
      vengeance of the canaille. Isaura’s fiancee a blasphemer!”
“Hush, hush!” said Madame Rameau, rising, very pale but self-collected. “How do you know
      this, Jacques?”
“From the lips of Gustave himself. I heard first of it yesterday from one of the young
      reprobates with whom he used to be familiar, and who even complimented me on the rising fame
      of my son, and praised the eloquence of his article that day. But I would not believe him. I
      bought the journal—here it is; saw the name and address of the printer—went this morning to
      the office—was there told that ‘Diderot le Jeune’ was within revising the press—stationed
      myself by the street door, and when Gustave came out I seized his arm, and asked him to say
      Yes or No if he was the author of this infamous article,—this, which I now hold in my hand. He
      owned the authorship with pride; talked wildly of the great man he was—of the great things he
      was to do; said that, in hitherto concealing his true name, he had done all he could to defer
      to the bigoted prejudices of his parents and his fiancee; and that if genius, like fire, would
      find its way out, he could not help it; that a time was rapidly coming when his opinions would
      be uppermost; that since October the Communists were gaining ascendancy, and only waited the
      end of the siege to put down the present Government, and with it all hypocrisies and shams,
      religious or social. My wife, he was rude to me, insulting! but he had been drinking—that made
      him incautious: and he continued to walk by my side towards his own lodging, on reaching which
      he ironically invited me to enter, saying, ‘I should meet there men who would soon argue me
      out of my obsolete notions.’ You may go to him, wife, now, if you please. I will not, nor will
      I take from him a crust of bread. I came hither, determined to tell the young lady all this,
      if I found her at home. I should be a dishonoured man if I suffered her to be cheated into
      misery.
“There, Madame Venosta, there! Take that journal, show it to Mademoiselle; and report to her
      all I have said.”
M. Rameau, habitually the mildest of men, had, in talking, worked himself up into positive
      fury.
His wife, calmer but more deeply affected, made a piteous sign to the Venosta not to say
      more; and without other salutation or adieu took her husband’s arm, and led him from the
      house.
