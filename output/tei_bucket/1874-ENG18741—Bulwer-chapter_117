CHAPTER XII.
Three days after the evening thus spent by Gustave Rameau, Isaura was startled by a visit
      from M. de Mauleon. She had not seen him since the commencement of the siege, and she did not
      recognise him at first glance in his military uniform.
“I trust you will pardon my intrusion, Mademoiselle,” he said, in the low sweet voice
      habitual to him in his gentler moods, “but I thought it became me to announce to you the
      decease of one who, I fear, did not discharge with much kindness the duties her connection
      with you imposed. Your father’s second wife, afterwards Madame Selby, is no more. She died
      some days since in a convent to which she had retired.”
Isaura had no cause to mourn the dead, but she felt a shock in the suddenness of this
      information; and in that sweet spirit of womanly compassion which entered so largely into her
      character, and made a part of her genius itself, she murmured tearfully, “The poor Signora!
      Why could I not have been with her in illness? She might then have learned to love me. And she
      died in a convent, you say? Ah, her religion was then sincere! Her end was peaceful?”
“Let us not doubt that, Mademoiselle. Certainly she lived to regret any former errors, and
      her last thought was directed towards such atonement as might be in her power. And it is that
      desire of atonement which now strangely mixes me up, Mademoiselle, in your destinies. In that
      desire for atonement, she left to my charge, as a kinsman distant indeed, but still, perhaps,
      the nearest with whom she was personally acquainted—a young ward. In accepting that trust, I
      find myself strangely compelled to hazard the risk of offending you.”
“Offending me? How? Pray speak openly.”
“In so doing, I must utter the name of Gustave Rameau.”
Isaura turned pale and recoiled, but she did not speak. “Did he inform me rightly that, in
      the last interview with him three days ago, you expressed a strong desire that the engagement
      between him and yourself should cease; and that you only, and with reluctance, suspended your
      rejection of the suit he had pressed on you, in consequence of his entreaties, and of certain
      assurances as to the changed direction of the talents of which we will assume that he is
      possessed?”
“Well, well, Monsieur,” exclaimed Isaura, her whole face brightening; “and you come on the
      part of Gustave Rameau to say that on reflection he does not hold me to our engagement—that in
      honour and in conscience I am free?”
“I see,” answered De Mauleon, smiling, “that I am pardoned already. It would not pain you if
      such were my instructions in the embassy I undertake?”
“Pain me? No. But—”
“But what?”
“Must he persist in a course which will break his mother’s heart, and make his father
      deplore the hour that he was born? Have you influence over him, M. de Mauleon? If so, will you
      not exert it for his good?”
“You interest yourself still in his fate, Mademoiselle?”
“How can I do otherwise? Did I not consent to share it when my heart shrank from the thought
      of our union? And now when, if I understand you rightly, I am free, I cannot but think of what
      was best in him.”
“Alas! Mademoiselle, he is but one of many—a spoilt child of that Circe, imperial Paris.
      Everywhere I look around, I see but corruption. It was hidden by the halo which corruption
      itself engenders. The halo is gone, the corruption is visible. Where is the old French
      manhood? Banished from the heart, it comes out only at the tongue. Were our deeds like our
      words, Prussia would beg on her knee to be a province of France. Gustave is the fit poet for
      this generation. Vanity—desire to be known for something, no matter what, no matter by
      whom—that is the Parisian’s leading motive power;—orator, soldier, poet, all alike. Utterers
      of fine phrases; despising knowledge, and toil, and discipline; railing against the Germans as
      barbarians, against their generals as traitors; against God for not taking their part. What
      can be done to weld this mass of hollow bubbles into the solid form of a nation—the nation it
      affects to be? What generation can be born out of the unmanly race, inebriate with brag and
      absinthe? Forgive me this tirade; I have been reviewing the battalion I command. As for
      Gustave Rameau,—if we survive the siege, and see once more a Government that can enforce
      order, and a public that will refuse renown for balderdash,—I should not be surprised if
      Gustave Rameau were among the prettiest imitators of Lamartine’s early Meditations. Had he
      been born under Louis XIV. how loyal he would have been! What sacred tragedies in the style of
      Athalie he would have written, in the hope of an audience at Versailles! But I detain you from
      the letter I was charged to deliver you. I have done so purposely, that I might convince
      myself that you welcome that release which your too delicate sense of honour shrank too long
      from demanding.”
Here he took forth and placed a letter in Isaura’s hand; and, as if to allow her to read it
      unobserved, retired to the window recess.
Isaura glanced over the letter. It ran thus:
“I feel that it was only to your compassion that I owed your consent to my suit. Could I
      have doubted that before, your words when we last met sufficed to convince me. In my selfish
      pain at the moment, I committed a great wrong. I would have held you bound to a promise from
      which you desired to be free. Grant me pardon for that; and for all the faults by which I have
      offended you. In cancelling our engagement, let me hope that I may rejoice in your friendship,
      your remembrance of me, some gentle and kindly thought. My life may henceforth pass out of
      contact with yours; but you will ever dwell in my heart, an image pure and holy as the saints
      in whom you may well believe-they are of your own kindred.”
“May I convey to Gustave Rameau any verbal reply to his letter?” asked De Mauleon, turning
      as she replaced the letter on the table.
“Only my wishes for his welfare. It might wound him if I added, my gratitude for the
      generous manner in which he has interpreted my heart, and acceded to its desires.”
“Mademoiselle, accept my congratulations. My condolences are for the poor girl left to my
      guardianship. Unhappily she loves this man; and there are reasons why I cannot withhold my
      consent to her union with him, should he demand it, now that, in the letter remitted to you,
      he has accepted your dismissal. If I can keep him out of all the follies and all the evils
      into which he suffers his vanity to mislead his reason, I will do so;—would I might say, only
      in compliance with your compassionate injunctions. But henceforth the infatuation of my ward
      compels me to take some interest in his career. Adieu, Mademoiselle! I have no fear for your
      happiness now.”
Left alone, Isaura stood as one transfigured. All the bloom of her youth seemed suddenly
      restored. Round her red lips the dimples opened, countless mirrors of one happy smile. “I am
      free, I am free,” she murmured—“joy, joy!” and she passed from the room to seek the Venosta,
      singing clear, singing loud, as a bird that escapes from the cage and warbles to the heaven it
      regains the blissful tale of its release.
