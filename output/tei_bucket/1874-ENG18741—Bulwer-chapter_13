CHAPTER V.
CONFORMABLY with his engagement to meet M. Louvier, Alain found himself on the day and at
      the hour named in M. Gandrin’s salon. On this occasion Madame Gandrin did not appear. Her
      husband was accustomed to give diners d’hommes. The great man had not yet arrived. “I think,
      Marquis,” said M. Gandrin, “that you will not regret having followed my advice: my
      representations have disposed Louvier to regard you with much favour, and he is certainly
      flattered by being permitted to make your personal acquaintance.”
The avoue had scarcely finished this little speech, when M. Louvier was announced. He
      entered with a beaming smile, which did not detract from his imposing presence. His flatterers
      had told him that he had a look of Louis Philippe; therefore he had sought to imitate the
      dress and the bonhomie of that monarch of the middle class. He wore a wig, elaborately piled
      up, and shaped his whiskers in royal harmony with the royal wig. Above all, he studied that
      social frankness of manner with which the able sovereign dispelled awe of his presence or
      dread of his astuteness. Decidedly he was a man very pleasant to converse and to deal with—so
      long as there seemed to him something to gain and nothing to lose by being pleasant. He
      returned Alain’s bow by a cordial offer of both expansive hands, into the grasp of which the
      hands of the aristocrat utterly disappeared. “Charmed to make your acquaintance, Marquis;
      still more charmed if you will let me be useful during your sejour at Paris. Ma foi, excuse my
      bluntness, but you are a fort beau garcon. Monsieur your father was a handsome man, but you
      beat him hollow. Gandrin, my friend, would not you and I give half our fortunes for one year
      of this fine fellow’s youth spent at Paris? Peste! what love-letters we should have, with no
      need to buy them by billets de banque!” Thus he ran on, much to Alain’s confusion, till dinner
      was announced. Then there was something grandiose in the frank bourgeois style wherewith he
      expanded his napkin and twisted one end into his waistcoat; it was so manly a renunciation of
      the fashions which a man so repandu in all circles might be supposed to follow,—as if he were
      both too great and too much in earnest for such frivolities. He was evidently a sincere bon
      vivant, and M. Gandrin had no less evidently taken all requisite pains to gratify his taste.
      The Montrachet served with the oysters was of precious vintage; that vin de madere which
      accompanied the potage a la bisque would have contented an American. And how radiant became
      Louvier’s face when amongst the entrees he came upon laitances de carpes! “The best thing in
      the world,” he cried, “and one gets it so seldom since the old Rocher de Cancale has lost its
      renown. At private houses, what does one get now? blanc de poulet, flavourless trash. After
      all, Gandrin, when we lose the love-letters, it is some consolation that laitances de carpes
      and sautes de foie gras are still left to fill up the void in our hearts. Marquis, heed my
      counsel; cultivate betimes the taste for the table,—that and whist are the sole resources of
      declining years. You never met my old friend Talleyrand—ah, no! he was long before your time.
      He cultivated both, but he made two mistakes. No man’s intellect is perfect on all sides. He
      confined himself to one meal a day, and he never learned to play well at whist. Avoid his
      errors, my young friend,—avoid them. Gandrin, I guess this pineapple is English,—it is
      superb.”
“You are right,—a present from the Marquis of H———-.”
“Ah! instead of a fee, I wager. The Marquis gives nothing for nothing, dear man! Droll
      people the English. You have never visited England, I presume, cher Rochebriant?” The affable
      financier had already made vast progress in familiarity with his silent fellow-guest.
When the dinner was over and the three men had reentered the salon for coffee and liqueurs,
      Gandrin left Louvier and Alain alone, saying he was going to his cabinet for cigars which he
      could recommend. Then Louvier, lightly patting the Marquis on the shoulder, said with what the
      French call effusion, “My dear Rochebriant, your father and I did not quite understand each
      other. He took a tone of grand seigneur that sometimes wounded me; and I in turn was perhaps
      too rude in asserting my rights—as creditor, shall I say?—no, as fellow-citizen; and Frenchmen
      are so vain, so over-susceptible; fire up at a word; take offence when none is meant. We two,
      my dear boy, should be superior to such national foibles. Bref—I have a mortgage on your
      lands. Why should that thought mar our friendship? At my age, though I am not yet old, one is
      flattered if the young like us, pleased if we can oblige them, and remove from their career
      any little obstacle in its way. Gandrin tells me you wish to consolidate all the charges on
      your estate into one on a lower rate of interest. Is it so?”
“I am so advised,” said the Marquis.
“And very rightly advised; come and talk with me about it some day next week. I hope to have
      a large sum of money set free in a few days. Of course, mortgages on land don’t pay like
      speculations at the Bourse; but I am rich enough to please myself. We will see, we will
      see.”
Here Gandrin returned with the cigars; but Alain at that time never smoked, and Louvier
      excused himself, with a laugh and a sly wink, on the plea that he was going to pay his
      respects—as doubtless that joli garcon was going to do likewise—to a belle dame who did not
      reckon the smell of tobacco among the perfumes of Houbigant or Arabia.
“Meanwhile,” added Louvier, turning to Gandrin, “I have something to say to you on business
      about the contract for that new street of mine. No hurry,—after our young friend has gone to
      his ‘assignation.’”
Alain could not misinterpret the hint; and in a few moments took leave of his host, more
      surprised than disappointed that the financier had not invited him, as Graham had assumed he
      would, to his soiree the following evening.
When Alain was gone, Louvier’s jovial manner disappeared also, and became bluffly rude
      rather than bluntly cordial. “Gandrin, what did you mean by saying that that young man was no
      muscadin! Muscadin, aristocrate, offensive from top to toe.”
“You amaze me; you seemed to take to him so cordially.”
“And pray, were you too blind to remark with what cold reserve he responded to my
      condescensions; how he winced when I called him Rochebriant; how he coloured when I called him
      ‘dear boy’? These aristocrats think we ought to thank them on our knees when they take our
      money, and” here Louvier’s face darkened—“seduce our women.” “Monsieur Louvier, in all France
      I do not know a greater aristocrat than yourself.”
I don’t know whether M. Gandrin meant that speech as a compliment, but M. Louvier took it as
      such,—laughed complacently and rubbed his hands. “Ay, ay, millionnaires are the real
      aristocrats, for they have power, as my beau Marquis will soon find. I must bid you good
      night. Of course I shall see Madame Gandrin and yourself to-morrow. Prepare for a motley
      gathering,—lots of democrats and foreigners, with artists and authors, and such
      creatures.”
“Is that the reason why you did not invite the Marquis?”
“To be sure; I would not shock so pure a Legitimist by contact with the sons of the people,
      and make him still colder to myself. No; when he comes to my house he shall meet lions and
      viveurs of the haut ton, who will play into my hands by teaching him how to ruin himself in
      the quickest manner and in the genre Regence. Bon soir, mon vieux.”
