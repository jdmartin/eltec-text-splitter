CHAPTER II.
ON the morrow Graham called at the villa at A———. The two ladies received him in Isaura’s
      chosen sitting-room.
Somehow or other, conversation at first languished. Graham was reserved and distant, Isaura
      shy and embarrassed. The Venosta had the frais of making talk to herself. Probably at another
      time Graham would have been amused and interested in the observation of a character new to
      him, and thoroughly southern,—lovable not more from its naive simplicity of kindliness than
      from various little foibles and vanities, all of which were harmless, and some of them
      endearing as those of a child whom it is easy to make happy, and whom it seems so cruel to
      pain; and with all the Venosta’s deviations from the polished and tranquil good taste of the
      beau monde, she had that indescribable grace which rarely deserts a Florentine, so that you
      might call her odd but not vulgar; while, though uneducated, except in the way of her old
      profession, and never having troubled herself to read anything but a libretto and the pious
      books commended to her by her confessor, the artless babble of her talk every now and then
      flashed out with a quaint humour, lighting up terse fragments of the old Italian wisdom which
      had mysteriously embedded themselves in the groundwork of her mind.
But Graham was not at this time disposed to judge the poor Venosta kindly or fairly. Isaura
      had taken high rank in his thoughts. He felt an impatient resentment mingled with anxiety and
      compassionate tenderness at a companionship which seemed to him derogatory to the position he
      would have assigned to a creature so gifted, and unsafe as a guide amidst the perils and
      trials to which the youth, the beauty, and the destined profession of Isaura were exposed.
      Like most Englishmen—especially Englishmen wise in the knowledge of life—he held in fastidious
      regard the proprieties and conventions by which the dignity of woman is fenced round; and of
      those proprieties and conventions the Venosta naturally appeared to him a very unsatisfactory
      guardian and representative.
Happily unconscious of these hostile prepossessions, the elder Signora chatted on very gayly
      to the visitor. She was in excellent spirits; people had been very civil to her both at
      Colonel Morley’s and M. Louvier’s. The American Minister had praised the scarlet jacket. She
      was convinced she had made a sensation two nights running. When the amour propre is pleased,
      the tongue is freed.
The Venosta ran on in praise of Paris and the Parisians; of Louvier and his soiree and the
      pistachio ice; of the Americans, and a certain creme de maraschino which she hoped the Signor
      Inglese had not failed to taste,—the creme de maraschino led her thoughts back to Italy. Then
      she grew mournful. How she missed the native beau ciel! Paris was pleasant, but how absurd to
      call it “le Paradis des Femmes,”—as if les Femmes could find Paradise in a brouillard!
“But,” she exclaimed, with vivacity of voice and gesticulation, “the Signor does not come to
      hear the parrot talk; he is engaged to come that he may hear the nightingale sing. A drop of
      honey attracts the fly more than a bottle of vinegar.”
Graham could not help smiling at this adage. “I submit,” said he, “to your comparison as
      regards myself; but certainly anything less like a bottle of vinegar than your amiable
      conversation I cannot well conceive. However, the metaphor apart, I scarcely know how I dare
      ask Mademoiselle to sing after the confession I made to her last night.”
“What confession?” asked the Venosta.
“That I know nothing of music and doubt if I can honestly say that I am fond of it.”
“Not fond of music! Impossible! You slander yourself. He who loves not music would have a
      dull time of it in heaven. But you are English, and perhaps have only heard the music of your
      own country. Bad, very bad—a heretic’s music! Now listen.”
Seating herself at the piano, she began an air from the “Lucia,” crying out to Isaura to
      come and sing to her accompaniment.
“Do you really wish it?” asked Isaura of Graham, fixing on him questioning, timid eyes.
“I cannot say how much I wish to hear you.”
Isaura moved to the instrument, and Graham stood behind her. Perhaps he felt that he should
      judge more impartially of her voice if not subjected to the charm of her face.
But the first note of the voice held him spell-bound. In itself the organ was of the rarest
      order, mellow and rich, but so soft that its power was lost in its sweetness, and so
      exquisitely fresh in every note.
But the singer’s charm was less in voice than in feeling; she conveyed to the listener so
      much more than was said by the words, or even implied by the music. Her song in this caught
      the art of the painter who impresses the mind with the consciousness of a something which the
      eye cannot detect on the canvas.
She seemed to breathe out from the depths of her heart the intense pathos of the original
      romance, so far exceeding that of the opera,-the human tenderness, the mystic terror of a
      tragic love-tale more solemn in its sweetness than that of Verona.
When her voice died away no applause came,—not even a murmur. Isaura bashfully turned round
      to steal a glance at her silent listener, and beheld moistened eyes and quivering lips. At
      that moment she was reconciled to her art. Graham rose abruptly and walked to the window.
“Do you doubt now if you are fond of music?” cried the Venosta.
“This is more than music,” answered Graham, still with averted face. Then, after a short
      pause, he approached Isaura, and said, with a melancholy half-smile,—
“I do not think, Mademoiselle, that I could dare to hear you often; it would take me too far
      from the hard real world: and he who would not be left behindhand on the road that he must
      journey cannot indulge frequent excursions into fairyland.”
“Yet,” said Isaura, in a tone yet sadder, “I was told in my childhood, by one whose genius
      gives authority to her words, that beside the real world lies the ideal. The real world then
      seemed rough to me. ‘Escape,’ said my counsellor, ‘is granted from that stony thoroughfare
      into the fields beyond its formal hedgerows. The ideal world has its sorrows, but it never
      admits despair.’ That counsel then, methought, decided my choice of life. I know not now if it
      has done so.”
“Fate,” answered Graham, slowly and thoughtfully, “Fate, which is not the ruler but the
      servant of Providence, decides our choice of life, and rarely from outward circumstances.
      Usually the motive power is within. We apply the word ‘genius’ to the minds of the gifted few;
      but in all of us there is a genius that is inborn, a pervading something which distinguishes
      our very identity, and dictates to the conscience that which we are best fitted to do and to
      be. In so dictating it compels our choice of life; or if we resist the dictate, we find at the
      close that we have gone astray. My choice of life thus compelled is on the stony
      thoroughfares, yours in the green fields.”
As he thus said, his face became clouded and mournful. The Venosta, quickly tired of a
      conversation in which she had no part, and having various little household matters to attend
      to, had during this dialogue slipped unobserved from the room; yet neither Isaura nor Graham
      felt the sudden consciousness that they were alone which belongs to lovers. “Why,” asked
      Isaura, with that magic smile reflected in countless dimples which, even when her words were
      those of a man’s reasoning, made them seem gentle with a woman’s sentiment,—“why must your
      road through the world be so exclusively the stony one? It is not from necessity, it can not
      be from taste; and whatever definition you give to genius, surely it is not your own inborn
      genius that dictates to you a constant exclusive adherence to the commonplace of life.”
“Ah, Mademoiselle, do not misrepresent me. I did not say that I could not sometimes quit the
      real world for fairyland,—I said that I could not do so often. My vocation is not that of a
      poet or artist.”
“It is that of an orator, I know,” said Isaura, kindling; “so they tell me, and I believe
      them. But is not the orator somewhat akin to the poet? Is not oratory an art?”
“Let us dismiss the word orator; as applied to English public life, it is a very deceptive
      expression. The Englishman who wishes to influence his countrymen by force of words spoken
      must mix with them in their beaten thoroughfares; must make himself master of their practical
      views and interests; must be conversant with their prosaic occupations and business; must
      understand how to adjust their loftiest aspirations to their material welfare; must avoid as
      the fault most dangerous to himself and to others that kind of eloquence which is called
      oratory in France, and which has helped to make the French the worst politicians in Europe.
      Alas! Mademoiselle, I fear that an English statesman would appear to you a very dull
      orator.”
“I see that I spoke foolishly,—yes, you show me that the world of the statesman lies apart
      from that of the artist. Yet—”
“Yet what?”
“May not the ambition of both be the same?”
“How so?”
“To refine the rude, to exalt the mean; to identify their own fame with some new beauty,
      some new glory, added to the treasure-house of all.”
Graham bowed his head reverently, and then raised it with the flush of enthusiasm on his
      cheek and brow.
“Oh, Mademoiselle,” he exclaimed, “what a sure guide and what a noble inspirer to a true
      Englishman’s ambition nature has fitted you to be, were it not—” He paused abruptly.
This outburst took Isaura utterly by surprise. She had been accustomed to the language of
      compliment till it had begun to pall, but a compliment of this kind was the first that had
      ever reached her ear. She had no words in answer to it; involuntarily she placed her hand on
      her heart as if to still its beatings. But the unfinished exclamation, “Were it not,” troubled
      her more than the preceding words had flattered, and mechanically she murmured, “Were it
      not—what?”
“Oh,” answered Graham, affecting a tone of gayety, “I felt too ashamed of my selfishness as
      man to finish my sentence.”
“Do so, or I shall fancy you refrained lest you might wound me as woman.”
“Not so; on the contrary, had I gone on it would have been to say that a woman of your
      genius, and more especially of such mastery in the most popular and fascinating of all arts,
      could not be contented if she inspired nobler thoughts in a single breast,—she must belong to
      the public, or rather the public must belong to her; it is but a corner of her heart that an
      individual can occupy, and even that individual must merge his existence in hers, must be
      contented to reflect a ray of the light she sheds on admiring thousands. Who could dare to say
      to you, ‘Renounce your career; confine your genius, your art, to the petty circle of home’? To
      an actress, a singer, with whose fame the world rings, home would be a prison. Pardon me,
      pardon—”
Isaura had turned away her face to hide tears that would force their way; but she held out
      her hand to him with a childlike frankness, and said softly, “I am not offended.” Graham did
      not trust himself to continue the same strain of conversation. Breaking into a new subject, he
      said, after a constrained pause, “Will you think it very impertinent in so new an
      acquaintance, if I ask how it is that you, an Italian, know our language as a native; and is
      it by Italian teachers that you have been trained to think and to feel?”
“Mr. Selby, my second father, was an Englishman, and did not speak any other language with
      comfort to himself. He was very fond of me; and had he been really my father I could not have
      loved him more. We were constant companions till—till I lost him.”
“And no mother left to console you!”
Isaura shook her head mournfully, and the Venosta here re-entered. Graham felt conscious
      that he had already stayed too long, and took leave.
They knew that they were to meet that evening at the Savarins’.
To Graham that thought was not one of unmixed pleasure; the more he knew of Isaura, the more
      he felt self-reproach that he had allowed himself to know her at all.
But after he had left, Isaura sang low to herself the song which had so affected her
      listener; then she fell into abstracted revery, but she felt a strange and new sort of
      happiness. In dressing for M. Savarin’s dinner, and twining the classic ivy wreath in her dark
      locks, her Italian servant exclaimed, “How beautiful the Signorina looks to-night!”
