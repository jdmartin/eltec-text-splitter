CHAPTER II.
It was one of those lovely noons towards the end of May in which a rural suburb has the
      mellow charm of summer to him who escapes awhile from the streets of a crowded capital. The
      Londoner knows its charm when he feels his tread on the softening swards of the Vale of
      Health, or, pausing at Richmond under the budding willow, gazes on the river glittering in the
      warmer sunlight, and hears from the villa-gardens behind him the brief trill of the blackbird.
      But the suburbs round Paris are, I think, a yet more pleasing relief from the metropolis; they
      are more easily reached, and I know not why, but they seem more rural,—perhaps because the
      contrast of their repose with the stir left behind, of their redundance of leaf and blossom
      compared with the prim efflorescence of trees in the Boulevards and Tuileries, is more
      striking. However that may be, when Graham reached the pretty suburb in which Isaura dwelt, it
      seemed to him as if all the wheels of the loud busy life were suddenly smitten still. The hour
      was yet early; he felt sure that he should find Isaura at home. The garden-gate stood
      unfastened and ajar; he pushed it aside and entered. I think I have before said that the
      garden of the villa was shut out from the road and the gaze of neighbours by a wall and thick
      belts of evergreens; it stretched behind the house somewhat far for the garden of a suburban
      villa. He paused when he had passed the gateway, for he heard in the distance the voice of one
      singing,—singing low, singing plaintively. He knew it was the voice of Isaura-he passed on,
      leaving the house behind him, and tracking the voice till he reached the singer.
Isaura was seated within an arbour towards the farther end of the garden,—an arbour which, a
      little later in the year, must indeed be delicate and dainty with lush exuberance of jessamine
      and woodbine; now into its iron trelliswork leaflets and flowers were insinuating their gentle
      way. Just at the entrance one white rose—a winter rose that had mysteriously survived its
      relations—opened its pale hues frankly to the noonday sun. Graham approached slowly,
      noiselessly, and the last note of the song had ceased when he stood at the entrance of the
      arbour. Isaura did not perceive him at first, for her face was bent downward musingly, as was
      often her wont after singing, especially when alone; but she felt that the place was darkened,
      that something stood between her and the sunshine. She raised her face, and a quick flush
      mantled over it as she uttered his name, not loudly, not as in surprise, but inwardly and
      whisperingly, as in a sort of fear.
“Pardon me, Mademoiselle,” said Graham, entering; “but I heard your voice as I came into the
      garden, and it drew me onward involuntarily. What a lovely air! and what simple sweetness in
      such of the words as reached me! I am so ignorant of music that you must not laugh at me if I
      ask whose is the music and whose are the words? Probably both are so well known as to convict
      me of a barbarous ignorance.”
“Oh, no,” said Isaura, with a still heightened colour, and in accents embarrassed and
      hesitating. “Both the words and music are by an unknown and very humble composer, yet not,
      indeed, quite original,—they have not even that merit; at least they were suggested by a
      popular song in the Neapolitan dialect which is said to be very old.”
“I don’t know if I caught the true meaning of the words, for they seemed to me to convey a
      more subtle and refined sentiment than is common in the popular songs of southern Italy.”
“The sentiment in the original is changed in the paraphrase, and not, I fear, improved by
      the change.”
“Will you explain to me the sentiment in both, and let me judge which I prefer?”
“In the Neapolitan song a young fisherman, who has moored his boat under a rock on the
      shore, sees a beautiful face below the surface of the waters; he imagines it to be that of a
      Nereid, and casts in his net to catch this supposed nymph of the ocean. He only disturbs the
      water, loses the image, and brings up a few common fishes. He returns home disappointed, and
      very much enamoured of the supposed Nereid. The next day he goes again to the same place, and
      discovers that the face which had so charmed him was that of a mortal girl reflected on the
      waters from the rock behind him, on which she had been seated, and on which she had her home.
      The original air is arch and lively; just listen to it.” And Isaura warbled one of those
      artless and somewhat meagre tunes to which light-stringed instruments are the fitting
      accompaniment.
“That,” said Graham, “is a different music indeed from the other, which is deep and
      plaintive, and goes to the heart.”
“But do you not see how the words have been altered? In the song you first heard me singing,
      the fisherman goes again to the spot, again and again sees the face in the water, again and
      again seeks to capture the Nereid, and never knows to the last that the face was that of the
      mortal on the rock close behind him, and which he passed by without notice every day. Deluded
      by an ideal image, the real one escapes from his eye.”
“Is the verse that is recast meant to symbolize a moral in love?”
“In love? nay, I know not; but in life, yes,—at least the life of the artist.”
“The paraphrase of the original is yours, Signorina, words and music both. Am I not right?
      Your silence answers ‘Yes.’ Will you pardon me if I say that, though there can be no doubt of
      the new beauty you have given to the old song, I think that the moral of the old was the
      sounder one, the truer to human life. We do not go on to the last duped by an allusion. If
      enamoured by the shadow on the waters, still we do look around us and discover the image it
      reflects.”
Isaura shook her head gently, but made no answer. On the table before her there were a few
      myrtle-sprigs and one or two buds from the last winter rose, which she had been arranging into
      a simple nosegay; she took up these, and abstractedly began to pluck and scatter the
      rose-leaves.
“Despise the coming May flowers if you will, they will soon be so plentiful,” said Graham;
      “but do not cast away the few blossoms which winter has so kindly spared, and which even
      summer will not give again;” and placing his hand on the winter buds, it touched
      hers,—lightly, indeed, but she felt the touch, shrank from it, coloured, and rose from her
      seat.
“The sun has left this side of the garden, the east wind is rising, and you must find it
      chilly here,” she said, in an altered tone; “will you not come into the house?”
“It is not the air that I feel chilly,” said Graham, with a half-smile; “I almost fear that
      my prosaic admonitions have displeased you.”
“They were not prosaic; and they were kind and very wise,” she added, with her exquisite
      laugh,—laugh so wonderfully sweet and musical. She now had gained the entrance of the arbour;
      Graham joined her, and they walked towards the house. He asked her if she had seen much of the
      Savarins since they had met.
“Once or twice we have been there of an evening.”
“And encountered, no doubt, the illustrious young minstrel who despises Tasso and
      Corneille?”
“M. Rameau? Oh, yes; he is constantly at the Savarins. Do not be severe on him. He is
      unhappy, he is struggling, he is soured. An artist has thorns in his path which lookers-on do
      not heed.”
“All people have thorns in their path, and I have no great respect for those who want
      lookers-on to heed them whenever they are scratched. But M. Rameau seems to me one of those
      writers very common nowadays, in France and even in England; writers who have never read
      anything worth studying, and are, of course, presumptuous in proportion to their ignorance. I
      should not have thought an artist like yourself could have recognized an artist in a M. Rameau
      who despises Tasso without knowing Italian.”
Graham spoke bitterly; he was once more jealous.
“Are you not an artist yourself? Are you not a writer? M. Savarin told me you were a
      distinguished man of letters.”
“M. Savarin flatters me too much. I am not an artist, and I have a great dislike to that
      word as it is now hackneyed and vulgarized in England and in France. A cook calls himself an
      artist; a tailor does the same; a man writes a gaudy melodrame, a spasmodic song, a
      sensational novel, and straightway he calls Himself an artist, and indulges in a pedantic
      jargon about ‘essence’ and ‘form,’ assuring us that a poet we can understand wants essence,
      and a poet we can scan wants form. Thank heaven, I am not vain enough to call myself artist. I
      have written some very dry lucubrations in periodicals, chiefly political, or critical upon
      other subjects than art. But why, a propos of M. Rameau, did you ask me that question
      respecting myself?”
“Because much in your conversation,” answered Isaura, in rather a mournful tone, “made me
      suppose you had more sympathies with art and its cultivators than you cared to avow; and if
      you had such sympathies, you would comprehend what a relief it is to a poor aspirant to art
      like myself to come into communication with those who devote themselves to any art distinct
      from the common pursuits of the world, what a relief it is to escape from the ordinary talk of
      society. There is a sort of instinctive freemasonry among us, including masters and disciples;
      and one art has a fellowship with other arts. Mine is but song and music, yet I feel attracted
      towards a sculptor, a painter, a romance-writer, a poet, as much as towards a singer, a
      musician. Do you understand why I cannot contemn M. Rameau as you do? I differ from his tastes
      in literature; I do not much admire such of his writings as I have read; I grant that he
      overestimates his own genius, whatever that be,—yet I like to converse with him. He is a
      struggler upwards, though with weak wings, or with erring footsteps, like myself.”
“Mademoiselle,” said Graham, earnestly, “I cannot say how I thank you for this candour. Do
      not condemn me for abusing it, if—” he paused.
“If what?”
“If I, so much older than yourself,—I do not say only in years, but in the experience of
      life, I whose lot is cast among those busy and ‘positive’ pursuits, which necessarily quicken
      that unromantic faculty called common-sense,—if, I say, the deep interest with which you must
      inspire all whom you admit into an acquaintance even as unfamiliar as that now between us
      makes me utter one caution, such as might be uttered by a friend or brother. Beware of those
      artistic sympathies which you so touchingly confess; beware how, in the great events of life,
      you allow fancy to misguide your reason. In choosing friends on whom to rely, separate the
      artist from the human being. Judge of the human being for what it is in itself. Do not worship
      the face on the waters, blind to the image on the rock. In one word, never see in an artist
      like a M. Rameau the human being to whom you could intrust the destinies of your life. Pardon
      me, pardon me; we may meet little hereafter, but you are a creature so utterly new to me, so
      wholly unlike any woman I have ever before encountered and admired, and to me seem endowed
      with such wealth of mind and soul, exposed to such hazard, that—that—” again he paused, and
      his voice trembled as he concluded—“that it would be a deep sorrow to me if, perhaps years
      hence, I should have to say, ‘Alas’! by what mistake has that wealth been wasted!’”
While they had thus conversed, mechanically they had turned away from the house, and were
      again standing before the arbour.
Graham, absorbed in the passion of his adjuration, had not till now looked into the face of
      the companion by his side. Now, when he had concluded, and heard no reply, he bent down and
      saw that Isaura was weeping silently.
His heart smote him.
“Forgive me,” he exclaimed, drawing her hand into his; “I have had no right to talk thus;
      but it was not from want of respect; it was—it was—”
The hand which was yielded to his pressed it gently, timidly, chastely.
“Forgive!” murmured Isaura; “do you think that I, an orphan, have never longed for a friend
      who would speak to me thus?” And so saying, she lifted her eyes, streaming still, to his
      bended countenance,—eyes, despite their tears, so clear in their innocent limpid beauty, so
      ingenuous, so frank, so virgin-like, so unlike the eyes of ‘any other woman he had encountered
      and admired.’
“Alas!” he said, in quick and hurried accents, “you may remember, when we have before
      conversed, how I, though so uncultured in your art, still recognized its beautiful influence
      upon human breasts; how I sought to combat your own depreciation of its rank among the
      elevating agencies of humanity; how, too, I said that no man could venture to ask you to
      renounce the boards, the lamps,—resign the fame of actress, of singer. Well, now that you
      accord to me the title of friend, now that you so touchingly remind me that you are an orphan,
      thinking of all the perils the young and the beautiful of your sex must encounter when they
      abandon private life for public, I think that a true friend might put the question, ‘Can you
      resign the fame of actress, of singer?’”
“I will answer you frankly. The profession which once seemed to me so alluring began to lose
      its charms in my eyes some months ago. It was your words, very eloquently expressed, on the
      ennobling effects of music and song upon a popular audience, that counteracted the growing
      distaste to rendering up my whole life to the vocation of the stage; but now I think I should
      feel grateful to the friend whose advice interpreted the voice of my own heart, and bade me
      relinquish the career of actress.”
Graham’s face grew radiant. But whatever might have been his reply was arrested; voices and
      footsteps were heard behind. He turned round and saw the Venosta, the Savarins, and Gustave
      Rameau.
Isaura heard and saw also, started in a sort of alarmed confusion, and then instinctively
      retreated towards the arbour. Graham hurried on to meet the Signora and the visitors, giving
      time to Isaura to compose herself by arresting them in the pathway with conventional
      salutations.
A few minutes later Isaura joined them, and there was talk to which Graham scarcely
      listened, though he shared in it by abstracted monosyllables. He declined going into the
      house, and took leave at the gate. In parting, his eyes fixed themselves on Isaura. Gustave
      Rameau was by her side. That nosegay which had been left in the arbour was in her hand; and
      though she was bending over it, she did not now pluck and scatter the rose-leaves. Graham at
      that moment felt no jealousy of the fair-faced young poet beside her.
As he walked slowly back, he muttered to himself, “But am I yet in the position to hold
      myself wholly free? Am I, am I? Were the sole choice before me that between her and ambition
      and wealth, how soon it would be made! Ambition has no prize equal to the heart of such a
      woman; wealth no sources of joy equal to the treasures of her love.”
