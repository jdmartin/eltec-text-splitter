CHAPTER XI.
Men and women are much more like each other in certain large elements of character than is
      generally supposed, but it is that very resemblance which makes their differences the more
      incomprehensible to each other; just as in politics, theology, or that most disputatious of
      all things disputable, metaphysics, the nearer the reasoners approach each other in points
      that to an uncritical bystander seem the most important, the more sure they are to start off
      in opposite directions upon reaching the speck of a pin-prick.
Now there are certain grand meeting-places between man and woman—the grandest of all is on
      the ground of love, and yet here also is the great field of quarrel. And here the teller of a
      tale such as mine ought, if he is sufficiently wise to be humble, to know that it is almost
      profanation if, as man, he presumes to enter the penetralia of a woman’s innermost heart, and
      repeat, as a man would repeat, all the vibrations of sound which the heart of a woman sends
      forth undistinguishable even to her own ear.
I know Isaura as intimately as if I had rocked her in her cradle, played with her in her
      childhood, educated and trained her in her youth; and yet I can no more tell you faithfully
      what passed in her mind during the forty-eight hours that intervened between her conversation
      with that American lady and her reappearance in some commonplace drawing-room, than I can tell
      you what the Man in the Moon might feel if the sun that his world reflected were blotted out
      of creation.
I can only say that when she reappeared in that commonplace drawing-room world, there was a
      change in her face not very perceptible to the ordinary observer. If anything, to his eye she
      was handsomer—the eye was brighter—the complexion (always lustrous, though somewhat pale, the
      limpid paleness that suits so well with dark hair) was yet more lustrous,—it was flushed into
      delicate rose hues—hues that still better suit with dark hair. What, then, was the change, and
      change not for the better? The lips, once so pensively sweet, had grown hard; on the brow that
      had seemed to laugh when the lips did, there was no longer sympathy between brow and lip;
      there was scarcely seen a fine threadlike line that in a few years would be a furrow on the
      space between the eyes; the voice was not so tenderly soft; the step was haughtier. What all
      such change denoted it is for a woman to decide-I can only guess. In the mean while,
      Mademoiselle Cicogna had sent her servant daily to inquire after M. Rameau. That, I think, she
      would have done under any circumstances. Meanwhile, too, she had called on Madame Savarin—made
      it up with her—sealed the reconciliation by a cold kiss. That, too, under any circumstances, I
      think she would have done—under some circumstances the kiss might have been less cold.
There was one thing unwonted in her habits. I mention it, though it is only a woman who can
      say if it means anything worth noticing.
For six days she had left a letter from Madame de Grantmesnil unanswered. With Madame de
      Grantmesnil was connected the whole of her innermost life—from the day when the lonely
      desolate child had seen, beyond the dusty thoroughfares of life, gleams of the faery land in
      poetry and art-onward through her restless, dreamy, aspiring youth-onward—onward—till now,
      through all that constitutes the glorious reality that we call romance.
Never before had she left for two days unanswered letters which were to her as Sibylline
      leaves to some unquiet neophyte yearning for solutions to enigmas suggested whether by the
      world without or by the soul within. For six days Madame de Grantmesnil’s letter remained
      unanswered, unread, neglected, thrust out of sight; just as when some imperious necessity
      compels us to grapple with a world that is, we cast aside the romance which, in our holiday
      hours, had beguiled us to a world with which we have interests and sympathies no more.
