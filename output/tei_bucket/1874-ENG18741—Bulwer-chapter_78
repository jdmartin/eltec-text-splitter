CHAPTER XIII.
Isaura was seated beside the Venosta,—to whom, of late, she seemed to cling with greater
      fondness than ever,—working at some piece of embroidery—a labour from which she had been
      estranged for years; but now she had taken writing, reading, music, into passionate disgust.
      Isaura was thus seated, silently intent upon her work, and the Venosta in full talk, when the
      servant announced Madame Rameau.
The name startled both; the Venosta had never heard that the poet had a mother living, and
      immediately jumped to the conclusion that Madame Rameau must be a wife he had hitherto kept
      unrevealed. And when a woman, still very handsome, with a countenance grave and sad, entered
      the salon, the Venosta murmured, “The husband’s perfidy reveals itself on a wife’s face,” and
      took out her handkerchief in preparation for sympathising tears.
“Mademoiselle,” said the visitor, halting, with eyes fixed on Isaura. “Pardon my
      intrusion-my son has the honour to be known to you. Every one who knows him must share in my
      sorrow—so young—so promising, and in such danger—my poor boy!” Madame Rameau stopped abruptly.
      Her tears forced their way—she turned aside to conceal them.
In her twofold condition of being—womanhood and genius—Isaura was too largely endowed with
      that quickness of sympathy which distinguishes woman from man, and genius from talent, not to
      be wondrously susceptible to pity.
Already she had wound her arm round the grieving mother—already drawn her to the seat from
      which she herself had risen—and bending over her had said some words—true, conventional enough
      in themselves,—but cooed forth in a voice the softest I ever expect to hear, save in dreams,
      on this side of the grave.
Madame Rameau swept her hand over her eyes, glanced round the room, and noticing the Venosta
      in dressing-robe and slippers, staring with those Italian eyes, in seeming so quietly
      innocent, in reality so searchingly shrewd, she whispered pleadingly, “May I speak to you a
      few minutes alone?” This was not a request that Isaura could refuse, though she was
      embarrassed and troubled by the surmise of Madame Rameau’s object in asking it; accordingly
      she led her visitor into the adjoining room, and making an apologetic sign to the Venosta,
      closed the door.
