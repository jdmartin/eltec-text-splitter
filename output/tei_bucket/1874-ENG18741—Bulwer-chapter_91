CHAPTER IV.
The next day, at the hour appointed, Graham entered Alain’s apartment. “I am glad to tell
      you,” said the Marquis, gaily, “that the box has arrived, and we will very soon examine its
      contents. Breakfast claims precedence.” During the meal Alain was in gay spirits, and did not
      at first notice the gloomy countenance and abstracted mood of his guest. At length, surprised
      at the dull response to his lively sallies on the part of a man generally so pleasant in the
      frankness of his speech, and the cordial ring of his sympathetic laugh, it occurred to him
      that the change in Graham must be ascribed to something that had gone wrong in the meeting
      with Isaura the evening before; and remembering the curtness with which Graham had implied
      disinclination to converse about the fair Italian, he felt perplexed how to reconcile the
      impulse of his good nature with the discretion imposed on his good-breeding. At all events, a
      compliment to the lady whom Graham had so admired could do no harm.
“How well Mademoiselle Cicogna looked last night!”
“Did she? It seemed to me that, in health at least, she did not look very well. Have you
      heard what day M. Thiers will speak on the war?”
“Thiers? No. Who cares about Thiers? Thank heaven his day is past! I don’t know any
      unmarried woman in Paris, not even Valerie—I mean Mademoiselle Duplessis—who has so exquisite
      a taste in dress as Mademoiselle Cicogna. Generally speaking, the taste of a female author is
      atrocious.”
“Really—I did not observe her dress. I am no critic on subjects so dainty as the dress of
      ladies, or the tastes of female authors.”
“Pardon me,” said the beau Marquis, gravely. “As to dress, I think that so essential a thing
      in the mind of woman, that no man who cares about women ought to disdain critical study of it.
      In woman, refinement of character is never found in vulgarity of dress. I have only observed
      that truth since I came up from Bretagne.”
“I presume, my dear Marquis, that you may have read in Bretagne books which very few not
      being professed scholars have ever read at Paris; and possibly you may remember that Horace
      ascribes the most exquisite refinement in dress, denoted by the untranslatable words, ‘simplex
      munditiis,’ to a lady who was not less distinguished by the ease and rapidity with which she
      could change her affection. Of course that allusion does not apply to Mademoiselle Cicogna,
      but there are many other exquisitely dressed ladies at Paris of whom an ill-fated admirer

 ‘fidem Mutatosque deos flebit.’ 
“Now, with your permission, we will adjourn to the box of letters.”
The box being produced and unlocked, Alain looked with conscientious care at its contents
      before he passed over to Graham’s inspection a few epistles, in which the Englishman
      immediately detected the same handwriting as that of the letter from Louise which Richard King
      had bequeathed to him.
They were arranged and numbered chronologically.
 LETTER I. DEAR M. LE MARQUIS,—How can I thank you sufficiently for obtaining and
      remitting to me those certificates? You are too aware of the unhappy episode in my life not to
      know how inestimable is the service you render me. I am saved all further molestation from the
      man who had indeed no right over my freedom, but whose persecution might compel me to the
      scandal and disgrace of an appeal to the law for protection, and the avowal of the illegal
      marriage into which I was duped. I would rather be torn limb from limb by wild horses, like
      the Queen in the history books, than dishonour myself and the ancestry which I may at least
      claim on the mother’s side, by proclaiming that I had lived with that low Englishman as his
      wife, when I was only—O heavens, I cannot conclude the sentence! “No, Mons. le Marquis, I am
      in no want of the pecuniary aid you so generously wish to press on me. Though I know not where
      to address my poor dear uncle,—though I doubt, even if I did, whether I could venture to
      confide to him the secret known only to yourself as to the name I now bear—and if he hear of
      me at all he must believe me dead,—yet I have enough left of the money he last remitted to me
      for present support; and when that fails, I think, what with my knowledge of English and such
      other slender accomplishments as I possess, I could maintain myself as a teacher or governess
      in some German family. At all events, I will write to you again soon, and I entreat you to let
      me know all you can learn about my uncle. I feel so grateful to you for your just disbelief of
      the horrible calumny which must be so intolerably galling to a man so proud, and, whatever his
      errors, so incapable of a baseness. “Direct to me Poste restante, Augsburg. “Yours with all
      consideration, LETTER II. 
(Seven months after the date of Letter 1.)
“AUGSBURG. “DEAR M. LE MARQUIS,—I thank you for your kind little note informing me of
      the pains you have taken, as yet with no result, to ascertain what has become of my
      unfortunate uncle. My life since I last wrote has been a very quiet one. I have been teaching
      among a few families here; and among my pupils are two little girls of very high birth. They
      have taken so great a fancy to me that their mother has just asked me to come and reside at
      their house as governess. What wonderfully kind hearts those Germans have,—so simple, so
      truthful! They raise no troublesome questions,—accept my own story implicitly.” Here follow a
      few commonplace sentences about the German character, and a postscript. “I go into my new home
      next week. When you hear more of my uncle, direct to me at the Countess von Rudesheim, Schloss
      ————, near Berlin.” 
“Rudesheim!” Could this be the relation, possibly the wife, of the Count von Rudesheim with
      whom Graham had formed acquaintance last year? LETTER III.
(Between three and four years after the date of the last.)
 “You startle me indeed, dear M. le Marquis. My uncle said to have been recognised in
      Algeria under another name, a soldier in the Algerian army? My dear, proud, luxurious uncle!
      Ah, I cannot believe it, any more than you do: but I long eagerly for such further news as you
      can learn of him. For myself, I shall perhaps surprise you when I say I am about to be
      married. Nothing can exceed the amiable kindness I have received from the Rudesheims since I
      have been in their house. For the last year especially I have been treated on equal terms as
      one of the family. Among the habitual visitors at the house is a gentleman of noble birth, but
      not of rank too high, nor of fortune too great, to make a marriage with the French widowed
      governess a misalliance. I am sure that he loves me sincerely; and he is the only man I ever
      met whose love I have cared to win. We are to be married in the course of the year. Of course
      he is ignorant of my painful history, and will never learn it. And after all, Louise D—— is
      dead. In the home to which I am about to remove, there is no probability that the wretched
      Englishman can ever cross my path. My secret is as safe with you as in the grave that holds
      her whom in the name of Louise D—— you once loved. Henceforth I shall trouble you no more with
      my letters; but if you hear anything decisively authentic of my uncle’s fate, write me a line
      at any time, directed as before to Madame ——, enclosed to the Countess von Rudesheim. “And
      accept, for all the kindness you have ever shown me, as to one whom you did not disdain to
      call a kinswoman, the assurance of my undying gratitude. In the alliance she now makes, your
      kinswoman does not discredit the name through which she is connected with the yet loftier line
      of Rochebriant.” 
To this letter the late Marquis had appended in pencil. “Of course Rochebriant never denies
      the claim of a kinswoman, even though a drawing-master’s daughter. Beautiful creature, Louise,
      but a termagant. I could not love Venus if she were a termagant. L.‘s head turned by the
      unlucky discovery that her mother was noble. In one form or other, every woman has the same
      disease—vanity. Name of her intended not mentioned—easily found out.”
The next letter was dated May 7, 1859, on black-edged paper, and contained but these
      lines: “I was much comforted by your kind visit yesterday, dear Marquis. My affliction
      has been heavy: but for the last two years my poor husband’s conduct has rendered my life
      unhappy, and I am recovering the shock of his sudden death. It is true that I and the children
      are left very ill provided for; but I cannot accept your generous offer of aid. Have no fear
      as to my future fate. Adieu, my dear Marquis! This will reach you just before you start for
      Naples. Bon voyage.” There was no address on this note-no postmark on the
      envelope-evidently sent by hand.
The last note, dated 1861, March 20, was briefer than its predecessor. “I have taken
      your advice, dear Marquis; and, overcoming all scruples, I have accepted his kind offer, on
      the condition that I am never to be taken to England. I had no option in this marriage. I can
      now own to you that my poverty had become urgent.—Yours, with inalienable gratitude.
 This last note, too, was without postmark, and was evidently sent by hand.
“There are no other letters, then, from this writer?” asked Graham; “and no further clue as
      to her existence?”
“None that I have discovered; and I see now why I preserved these letters. There is nothing
      in their contents not creditable to my poor father. They show how capable he was of
      good-natured disinterested kindness towards even a distant relation of whom he could certainly
      not have been proud, judging not only by his own pencilled note, or by the writer’s condition
      as a governess, but by her loose sentiments as to the marriage tie. I have not the slightest
      idea who she could be. I never at least heard of one connected, however distantly, with my
      family, whom I could identify with the writer of these letters.”
“I may hold them a short time in my possession?”
“Pardon me a preliminary question. If I may venture to form a conjecture, the object of your
      search must be connected with your countryman, whom the lady politely calls the ‘wretched
      Englishman;’ but I own I should not like to lend, through these letters, a pretence to any
      steps that may lead to a scandal in which my father’s name or that of any member of my family
      could be mixed up.”
“Marquis, it is to prevent the possibility of all scandal that I ask you to trust these
      letters to my discretion.”
“Foi de gentilhomme?”
“Foi de gentilhomme!”
“Take them. When and where shall we meet again?”
“Soon, I trust; but I must leave Paris this evening. I am bound to Berlin in quest of this
      Countess von Rudesheim: and I fear that in a very few days intercourse between France and the
      German frontier will be closed upon travellers.”
After a few more words not worth recording, the two young men shook hands and parted.
