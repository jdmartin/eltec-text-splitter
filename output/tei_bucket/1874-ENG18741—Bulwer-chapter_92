CHAPTER V.
It was with an interest languid and listless indeed, compared with that which he would have
      felt a day before, that Graham mused over the remarkable advances towards the discovery of
      Louise Duval which were made in the letters he had perused. She had married, then, first a
      foreigner, whom she spoke of as noble, and whose name and residence could be easily found
      through the Countess von Rudesheim. The marriage did not seem to have been a happy one. Left a
      widow in reduced circumstances, she had married again, evidently without affection. She was
      living so late as 1861, and she had children living is 1859: was the child referred to by
      Richard King one of them?
The tone and style of the letters served to throw some light on the character of the writer:
      they evinced pride, stubborn self-will, and unamiable hardness of nature; but her rejection of
      all pecuniary aid from a man like the late Marquis de Rochebriant betokened a certain dignity
      of sentiment. She was evidently, whatever her strange ideas about her first marriage with
      Richard King, no vulgar woman of gallantry; and there must have been some sort of charm about
      her to have excited a friendly interest in a kinsman so remote, and a man of pleasure so
      selfish, as her high-born correspondent.
But what now, so far as concerned his own happiness, was the hope, the probable certainty,
      of a speedy fulfilment of the trust bequeathed to him? Whether the result, in the death of the
      mother, and more especially of the child, left him rich, or, if the last survived, reduced his
      fortune to a modest independence, Isaura was equally lost to him, and fortune became
      valueless. But his first emotions on recovering from the shock of hearing from Isaura’s lips
      that she was irrevocably affianced to another, were not those of self-reproach. They were
      those of intense bitterness against her who, if really so much attached to him as he had been
      led to hope, could within so brief a time reconcile her heart to marriage with another. This
      bitterness was no doubt unjust; but I believe it to be natural to men of a nature so proud and
      of affections so intense as Graham’s, under similar defeats of hope. Resentment is the first
      impulse in a man loving with the whole ardour of his soul, rejected, no matter why or
      wherefore, by the woman by whom he had cause to believe he himself was beloved; and though
      Graham’s standard of honour was certainly the reverse of low, yet man does not view honour in
      the same light as woman does, when involved in analogous difficulties of position. Graham
      conscientiously thought that if Isaura so loved him as to render distasteful an engagement to
      another which could only very recently have been contracted, it would be more honourable
      frankly so to tell the accepted suitor than to leave him in ignorance that her heart was
      estranged. But these engagements are very solemn things with girls like Isaura, and hers was
      no ordinary obligation of woman-honour. Had the accepted one been superior in rank-fortune—all
      that flatters the ambition of woman in the choice of marriage; had he been resolute, and
      strong, and self-dependent amid the trials and perils of life—then possibly the woman’s honour
      might find excuse in escaping the penalties of its pledge. But the poor, ailing, infirm,
      morbid boy-poet, who looked to her as his saving angel in body, in mind, and soul-to say to
      him, “Give me back my freedom,” would be to abandon him to death and to sin. But Graham could
      not of course divine why what he as a man thought right was to Isaura as woman impossible: and
      he returned to his old prejudiced notion that there is no real depth and ardour of affection
      for human lovers in the poetess whose mind and heart are devoted to the creation of imaginary
      heroes. Absorbed in reverie, he took his way slowly and with downcast looks towards the
      British embassy, at which it was well to ascertain whether the impending war yet necessitated
      special passports for Germany.
“Bon-jour, cher ami,” said a pleasant voice; “and how long have you been at Paris?”
“Oh, my dear M. Savarin! charmed to see you looking so well! Madame well too, I trust? My
      kindest regards to her. I have been in Paris but a day or two, and I leave this evening.”
“So soon? The war frightens you away, I suppose. Which way are you going now?”
“To the British embassy.”
“Well, I will go with you so far—it is in my own direction. I have to call at the charming
      Italian’s with my congratulations—on news I only heard this morning.”
“You mean Mademoiselle Cicogna—and the news that demands congratulations—her approaching
      marriage!”
“Mon Dieu! when could you have heard of that?”
“Last night at the house of M. Duplessis.”
“Parbleu! I shall scold her well for confiding to her new friend Valerie the secret she kept
      from her old friends, my wife and myself.”
“By the way,” said Graham, with a tone of admirably-feigned indifference, “who is the happy
      man? That part of the secret I did not hear.”
“Can’t you guess?” “NO.”
“Gustave Rameau.”
“Ah!” Graham almost shrieked, so sharp and shrill was his cry. “Ah! I ought indeed to have
      guessed that!”
“Madame Savarin, I fancy, helped to make up the marriage. I hope it may turn out well;
      certainly it will be his salvation. May it be for her happiness!”
“No doubt of that! Two poets-born for each other, I dare say. Adieu, my dear Savarin! Here
      we are at the embassy.”
