CHAPTER VII.
Graham continued his journey to Strasbourg. On arriving there he felt very unwell. Strong
      though his frame was, the anguish and self-struggle through which he had passed since the day
      he had received in London Mrs. Morley’s letter, till that on which he had finally resolved on
      his course of conduct at Paris, and the shock which had annihilated his hopes in Isaura’s
      rejection, had combined to exhaust its endurance, and fever had already commenced when he took
      his place in the coupe. If there be a thing which a man should not do when his system is
      undermined, and his pulse between 90 and 100, it is to travel all night by a railway express.
      Nevertheless, as the Englishman’s will was yet stronger than his frame, he would not give
      himself more than an hour’s rest, and again started for Berlin. Long before he got to Berlin,
      the will failed him—as well as the frame. He was lifted out of the carriage, taken to a hotel
      in a small German town, and six hours afterwards he was delirious. It was fortunate for him
      that under such circumstances plenty of money and Scott’s circular-notes for some hundreds
      were found in his pocketbook, so that he did not fail to receive attentive nursing and skilful
      medical treatment. There, for the present, I must leave him—leave him for how long? But any
      village apothecary could say that fever such as his must run its course. He was still in bed,
      and very dimly—and that but at times—conscious, when the German armies were gathering round
      the penfold of Sedan.
