CHAPTER X. SAINT ANTHONY’S WELL.
I STOOD on the rocky eminence in front of the ruins of Saint
                                   Anthony’s Chapel, and looked on the magnificent view of Edinburgh
                                   and of the old Palace of Holyrood, bathed in the light of the
                                   full moon.
The Well, as the doctor’s instructions had informed me, was behind
                                   the chapel. I waited for some minutes in front of the ruin,
                                   partly to recover my breath after ascending the hill; partly, I
                                   own, to master the nervous agitation which the sense of my
                                   position at that moment had aroused in me. The woman, or the
                                   apparition of the woman—it might be either—was perhaps within a
                                   few yards of the place that I occupied. Not a living creature
                                   appeared in front of the chapel. Not a sound caught my ear from
                                   any part of the solitary hill. I tried to fix my whole attention
                                   on the beauties of the moonlit view. It was not to be done. My
                                   mind was far away from the objects on which my eyes rested. My
                                   mind was with the woman whom I had seen in the summer-house
                                   writing in my book.
I turned to skirt the side of the chapel. A few steps more over the
                                   broken ground brought me within view of the Well, and of the high
                                   boulder or rock from the foot of which the waters gushed brightly
                                   in the light of the moon.
She was there.
I recognized her figure as she stood leaning against the rock, with
                                   her hands crossed in front of her, lost in thought. I recognized
                                   her face as she looked up quickly, startled by the sound of my
                                   footsteps in the deep stillness of the night.
Was it the woman, or the apparition of the woman? I waited, looking
                                   at her in silence.
She spoke. The sound of her voice was not the mysterious sound that
                                   I had heard in the summer-house. It was the sound I had heard on
                                   the bridge when we first met in the dim evening light.
“Who are you? What do you want?”
As those words passed her lips, she recognized me. “You here!” she went on, advancing a step,
                                   in uncontrollable surprise. “What does this mean?”
“I am here,” I answered, “to meet you, by your own
                                   appointment.”
She stepped back again, leaning against the rock. The moonlight
                                   shone full upon her face. There was terror as well as
                                   astonishment in her eyes while they now looked at me.
“I don’t understand you,” she said. “I have not seen you since you
                                   spoke to me on the bridge.”
“Pardon me,” I replied. “I have seen you—or the appearance of
                                   you—since that time. I heard you speak. I saw you write.”
She looked at me with the strangest expression of mingled
                                   resentment and curiosity. “What did I say?” she asked. “What did
                                   I write?”
“You said, ‘Remember me. Come to me.’ You wrote, ‘When the full
                                   moon shines on Saint Anthony’s Well.’”
“Where?” she cried. “Where did I do that?”
“In a summer-house which stands by a waterfall,” I answered. “Do
                                   you know the place?”
Her head sunk back against the rock. A low cry of terror burst from
                                   her. Her arm, resting on the rock, dropped at her side. I
                                   hurriedly approached her, in the fear that she might fall on the
                                   stony ground.
She rallied her failing strength. “Don’t touch me!” she exclaimed.
                                   “Stand back, sir. You frighten me.”
I tried to soothe her. “Why do I frighten you? You know who I am.
                                   Can you doubt my interest in you, after I have been the means of
                                   saving your life?”
Her reserve vanished in an instant. She advanced without
                                   hesitation, and took me by the hand.
“I ought to thank you,” she said. “And I do. I am not so ungrateful
                                   as I seem. I am not a wicked woman, sir—I was mad with misery
                                   when I tried to drown myself. Don’t distrust me! Don’t despise
                                   me!” She stopped; I saw the tears on her cheeks. With a sudden
                                   contempt for herself, she dashed them away. Her whole tone and
                                   manner altered once more. Her reserve returned; she looked at me
                                   with a strange flash of suspicion and defiance in her eyes. “Mind
                                   this!” she said, loudly and abruptly, “you were dreaming when you
                                   thought you saw me writing. You didn’t see me; you never heard me
                                   speak. How could I say those familiar words to a stranger like
                                   you? It’s all your fancy—and you try to frighten me by talking of
                                   it as if it was a real thing!” She changed again; her eyes
                                   softened to the sad and tender look which made them so
                                   irresistibly beautiful. She drew her cloak round her with a
                                   shudder, as if she felt the chill of the night air. “What is the
                                   matter with me?” I heard her say to herself. “Why do I trust this
                                   man in my dreams? And why am I ashamed of it when I wake?”
That strange outburst encouraged me. I risked letting her know that
                                   I had overheard her last words.
“If you trust me in your dreams, you only do me justice,” I said.
                                   “Do me justice now; give me your confidence. You are alone—you
                                   are in trouble—you want a friend’s help. I am waiting to help
                                   you.”
She hesitated. I tried to take her hand. The strange creature drew
                                   it away with a cry of alarm: her one great fear seemed to be the
                                   fear of letting me touch her.
“Give me time to think of it,” she said. “You don’t know what I
                                   have got to think of. Give me till to-morrow; and let me write.
                                   Are you staying in Edinburgh?”
I thought it wise to be satisfied—in appearance at least—with this
                                   concession. Taking out my card, I wrote on it in pencil the
                                   address of the hotel at which I was staying. She read the card by
                                   the moonlight when I put it into her hand.
“George!” she repeated to herself, stealing another look at me as
                                   the name passed her lips. “‘George Germaine.’ I never heard of
                                   ‘Germaine.’ But ‘George’ reminds me of old times.” She smiled
                                   sadly at some passing fancy or remembrance in which I was not
                                   permitted to share. “There is nothing very wonderful in your
                                   being called ‘George,’” she went on, after a while. “The name is
                                   common enough: one meets with it everywhere as a man’s name And
                                   yet—” Her eyes finished the sentence; her eyes said to me, “I am
                                   not so much afraid of you, now I know that you are called
                                   ‘George.’”
So she unconsciously led me to the brink of discovery!
If I had only asked her what associations she connected with my
                                   Christian name—if I had only persuaded her to speak in the
                                   briefest and most guarded terms of her past life—the barrier
                                   between us, which the change in our names and the lapse of ten
                                   years had raised, must have been broken down; the recognition
                                   must have followed. But I never even thought of it; and for this
                                   simple reason—I was in love with her. The purely selfish idea of
                                   winning my way to her favorable regard by taking instant
                                   advantage of the new interest that I had awakened in her was the
                                   one idea which occurred to my mind.
“Don’t wait to write to me,” I said. “Don’t put it off till
                                   to-morrow. Who knows what may happen before to-morrow? Surely I
                                   deserve some little return for the sympathy that I feel with you?
                                   I don’t ask for much. Make me happy by making me of some service
                                   to you before we part to-night.”
I took her hand, this time, before she was aware of me. The whole
                                   woman seemed to yield at my touch. Her hand lay unresistingly in
                                   mine; her charming figure came by soft gradations nearer and
                                   nearer to me; her head almost touched my shoulder. She murmured
                                   in faint accents, broken by sighs, “Don’t take advantage of me. I
                                   am so friendless; I am so completely in your power.” Before I
                                   could answer, before I could move, her hand closed on mine; her
                                   head sunk on my shoulder: she burst into tears.
Any man, not an inbred and inborn villain, would have respected her
                                   at that moment. I put her hand on my arm and led her away gently
                                   past the ruined chapel, and down the slope of the hill.
“This lonely place is frightening you,” I said. “Let us walk a
                                   little, and you will soon be yourself again.”
She smiled through her tears like a child.
“Yes,” she said, eagerly. “But not that way.” I had accidentally
                                   taken the direction which led away from the city; she begged me
                                   to turn toward the houses and the streets. We walked back toward
                                   Edinburgh. She eyed me, as we went on in the moonlight, with
                                   innocent, wondering looks. “What an unaccountable influence you
                                   have over me!” she exclaimed.
“Did you ever see me, did you ever hear my name, before we met that
                                   evening at the river?”
“Never.”
“And I never heard your name, and never saw
                                        you before. Strange! very strange!
                                   Ah! I remember somebody—only an old woman, sir—who might once
                                   have explained it. Where shall I find the like of her now?”
She sighed bitterly. The lost friend or relative had evidently been
                                   dear to her. “A relation of yours?” I inquired—more to keep her
                                   talking than because I felt any interest in any member of her
                                   family but herself.
We were again on the brink of discovery. And again it was decreed
                                   that we were to advance no further.
“Don’t ask me about my relations!” she broke out. “I daren’t think
                                   of the dead and gone, in the trouble that is trying me now. If I
                                   speak of the old times at home, I shall only burst out crying
                                   again, and distress you. Talk of something else, sir—talk of
                                   something else.”
The mystery of the apparition in the summer-house was not cleared
                                   up yet. I took my opportunity of approaching the subject.
“You spoke a little while since of dreaming of me,” I began. “Tell
                                   me your dream.”
“I hardly know whether it was a dream or whether it was something
                                   else,” she answered. “I call it a dream for want of a better
                                   word.”
“Did it happen at night?”
“No. In the daytime—in the afternoon.”
“Late in the afternoon?”
“Yes—close on the evening.”
My memory reverted to the doctor’s story of the shipwrecked
                                   passenger, whose ghostly “double” had appeared in the vessel that
                                   was to rescue him, and who had himself seen that vessel in a
                                   dream.
“Do you remember the day of the month and the hour?” I asked.
She mentioned the day, and she mentioned the hour. It was the day
                                   when my mother and I had visited the waterfall. It was the hour
                                   when I had seen the apparition in the summer-house writing in my
                                   book!
I stopped in irrepressible astonishment. We had walked by this time
                                   nearly as far on the way back to the city as the old Palace of
                                   Holyrood. My companion, after a glance at me, turned and looked
                                   at the rugged old building, mellowed into quiet beauty by the
                                   lovely moonlight.
“This is my favorite walk,” she said, simply, “since I have been in
                                   Edinburgh. I don’t mind the loneliness. I like the perfect
                                   tranquillity here at night.” She glanced at me again. “What is
                                   the matter?” she asked. “You say nothing; you only look at
                                   me.”
“I want to hear more of your dream,” I said. “How did you come to
                                   be sleeping in the daytime?”
“It is not easy to say what I was doing,” she replied, as we walked
                                   on again. “I was miserably anxious and ill. I felt my helpless
                                   condition keenly on that day. It was dinner-time, I remember, and
                                   I had no appetite. I went upstairs (at the inn where I am
                                   staying), and lay down, quite worn out, on my bed. I don’t know
                                   whether I fainted or whether I slept; I lost all consciousness of
                                   what was going on about me, and I got some other consciousness in
                                   its place. If this was dreaming, I can only say it was the most
                                   vivid dream I ever had in my life.”
“Did it begin by your seeing me?” I inquired.
“It began by my seeing your drawing-book—lying open on a table in a
                                   summer-house.”
“Can you describe the summer-house as you saw it?”
She described not only the summer-house, but the view of the
                                   waterfall from the door. She knew the size, she knew the binding,
                                   of my sketch-book—locked up in my desk, at that moment, at home
                                   in Perthshire!
“And you wrote in the book,” I went on. “Do you remember what you
                                   wrote?”
She looked away from me confusedly, as if she were ashamed to
                                   recall this part of her dream.
“You have mentioned it already,” she said. “There is no need for me
                                   to go over the words again. Tell me one thing—when you were at the summer-house, did you
                                   wait a little on the path to the door before you went in?”
I had waited, surprised by my first view of
                                   the woman writing in my book. Having answered her to this effect,
                                   I asked what she had done or dreamed of doing at the later moment
                                   when I entered the summer-house.
“I did the strangest things,” she said, in low, wondering tones.
                                   “If you had been my brother, I could hardly have treated you more
                                   familiarly. I beckoned to you to come to me. I even laid my hand
                                   on your bosom. I spoke to you as I might have spoken to my oldest
                                   and dearest friend. I said, ‘Remember me. Come to me.’ Oh, I was
                                   so ashamed of myself when I came to my senses again, and
                                   recollected it. Was there ever such familiarity—even in a
                                   dream—between a woman and a man whom she had only once seen, and
                                   then as a perfect stranger?”
“Did you notice how long it was,” I asked, “from the time when you
                                   lay down on the bed to the time when you found yourself awake
                                   again?”
“I think I can tell you,” she replied. “It was the dinner-time of
                                   the house (as I said just now) when I went upstairs. Not long
                                   after I had come to myself I heard a church clock strike the
                                   hour. Reckoning from one time to the other, it must have been
                                   quite three hours from the time when I first lay down to the time
                                   when I got up again.”
Was the clew to the mysterious disappearance of the writing to be
                                   found here?
Looking back by the light of later discoveries, I am inclined to
                                   think that it was. In three hours the lines traced by the
                                   apparition of her had vanished. In three hours she had come to
                                   herself, and had felt ashamed of the familiar manner in which she
                                   had communicated with me in her sleeping state. While she had
                                   trusted me in the trance—trusted me because her spirit was then
                                   free to recognize my spirit—the writing had remained on the page.
                                   When her waking will counteracted the influence of her sleeping
                                   will, the writing disappeared. Is this the explanation? If it is
                                   not, where is the explanation to be found?
We walked on until we reached that part of the Canongate street in
                                   which she lodged. We stopped at the door.
