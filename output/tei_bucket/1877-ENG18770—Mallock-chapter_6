BOOK II.
CHAPTER II.
 The blinds were half-down at luncheon in the dining-room, to keep out the
                        brilliant summer sun. The guests dropped in by ones and twos, somewhat tired
                        and exhausted by the divine service of the morning; and the sight of the
                        table was not a little refreshing to them, as it shone whitely in the soft
                        gloom, with its flowers and ferns, and its day-lit glimmer of glass and
                        silver. Soon, however, a piece of news was circulated that was even more
                        refreshing than the luncheon. Dr. Jenkinson, owing to his late exertions,
                        and the gas-light, and the draughts upon the stage, was suffering from a
                        headache, which inclined him to keep his room; and accordingly an unhopedfor
                        prospect of freely discussing the sermon dawned brightly upon the whole
                        party. 
 Mr. Stockton, who had been much struck with the strictly prosaic style of
                        Dr. Jenkinson’s discourse, and who had been secretly contrasting this with
                        the more impassioned character of his own mind, was the first to begin. 
 ‘The sermon was perhaps ingenious,’ he said, turning to Lady Ambrose, ‘but
                        I’m afraid our friend’s forte is certainly not poetry.’ 
 ‘Surely,’ said Donald Gordon with extreme solemnity of manner and only a
                        slight twinkle in his eye, ‘his forte is something far better. Poetry can
                        only make us happy for a little while. Such doctrines as we have heard this
                        morning ought to make us happy always.’ 
 As for Lady Ambrose, to whom both these remarks were addressed, she was in
                        doubt what altogether to think of the matter. More than half her heart
                        inclined her to look upon Dr. Jenkinson as a valuable ally; but there was
                        yet, all the while, a fatal something that whispered to her a vague distrust
                        of him. She was therefore waiting anxiously to hear what would be said by
                        others, before taking any side herself; her mind all the while being busy
                        with the profoundest questions. This suspense of judgment produced a certain
                        gravity and depression in her, which was visible on her face, and which
                        seemed to communicate itself to nearly everyone at her end of the table. For
                        Lady Ambrose was a communicative woman. Her spirits, good or bad, were
                        generally caught by those near her. As for Mr. Herbert, however, no one else
                        seemed needed to depress him. Low, slow, and melancholy, his accents at once
                        caught the ear of Lady Ambrose. 
 ‘I have heard to-day,’ he said to Mrs. Sinclair, who was sitting next him,
                        ‘an entirely new and in every way memorable doctrine, which I never heard
                        before from the mouth of man, woman, or child; nor can I tell by what steps
                        any human being could have arrived at it. I have heard that the world—the
                        world as it is—could not be better than it is; that there is no real sorrow
                        in it— no real evil—no real sin.’ 
 ‘Poor Dr. Jenkinson!’ said Mrs. Sinclair, also in a melancholy voice; ‘I
                        suppose he has never loved.’ 
 ‘Ah,’ exclaimed Mr. Stockton,—his voice was melancholy as well—‘the whole
                        teachings of that school have always seemed to me nothing more than a few
                        fragments of science imperfectly understood, obscured by a few fragments of
                        Christianity imperfectly remembered.’ 
 ‘You forget,’ said Leslie, ‘that Dr. Jenkinson’s Christianity is really a
                        new firm trading under an old name, and trying to purchase the goodwill of
                        the former establishment.’ 
 Lady Ambrose, who had not liked Leslie so much on further acquaintance as
                        she had at first expected she should, was very indignant at him for so
                        flippant a speech as this—she felt sure it was flippant, though she did not
                        quite understand its meaning—but once again Mr. Herbert’s grave accents
                        arrested her. 
 ‘It is simply,’ he was saying to Mrs. Sinclair, evidently alluding to the
                        same subject—‘it is simply our modern atheism trying to hide its own
                        nakedness, for the benefit of the more prudish part of the public, in the
                        cast grave-clothes of a Christ who, whether he be risen or no, is very
                        certainly, as the angel said, not here.’ 
 ‘All discussion of such matters seems to me but a diseased activity,’ said
                        Mr. Rose, raising languidly a white deprecating hand. 
 Mr. Storks too, though for different reasons, was apparently of the same
                        opinion. 
 ‘In his main points,’ he said with a severe dogmatism that seemed designed
                        to end all further controversy, ‘and putting aside his quasi-religious
                        manner of expressing it—which considering his position may be pardoned—I
                        conceive Dr. Jenkinson to have been entirely right.’ 
 Hitherto Lady Ambrose’s views had been wavering to and fro, in a sad
                        uncertainty. But now her mind at once cleared. Her worst suspicions of the
                        Doctor were confirmed by this fatal commendation. The gloom on her face
                        deepened, and she had a look almost of distress about her as she turned to
                        Laurence. 
 ‘You look tired,’ he said to her. 
 ‘No,’ said Lady Ambrose wearily: ‘at least, perhaps I am a little. Do you
                        know, I always think one feels rather dull if one doesn’t get the letters
                        one expects.’ 
 ‘Perhaps you don’t know,’ said Laurence, ‘that the letters you got this
                        morning were only those of last night’s post. Our Sunday letters we are
                        obliged to send for, and they don’t generally come till later on in the
                        day.’ 
 ‘Really!’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, with surprise, as a smile slowly spread
                        over her face, and her frank eyes lit up again. ‘The Duchess couldn’t have
                        forgotten it,’ she said to herself half-consciously. Strangely enough, a new
                        warmth, it seemed, had dawned upon her, and her ice-bound gloom began to
                        thaw—to thaw only, however, not to evaporate. It did not go; it only became
                        voluble. 
 ‘Do you know, Mr. Laurence,’ she began, ‘I have been thinking over and over
                        again about many of the things that were said last night; and I really am
                        afraid that the world is getting very bad. It is very sad to think so; but,
                        with all this infidelity and wickedness of which we hear so much, I’m afraid
                        it is true. For my own part, you know, there is nothing I dislike so much as
                        to hear the Bible profanely spoken about; though, of course, I know one is
                        tempted sometimes to make jokes out of it oneself. And then,’ Lady Ambrose
                        added—her ideas did not always follow one another in the strictest
                        order—‘hardly a week passes without some new scandal. I had a letter only
                        this morning, telling me all the particulars about Colonel Eardly and poor
                        Lady Arthur. And that man, you know—just fancy it!—it will not be very long
                        before we shall be obliged to receive him again. However,’ said Lady
                        Ambrose, with a slightly more cheerful accent, ‘that sort of thing, I
                        believe, is confined to us. The middle classes are all right—at least, one
                        always hears so.’ 
 At this moment Lord Allen’s voice was heard. 
 ‘But now,’ Lady Ambrose went on to Laurence, very slightly moving her head
                        in the direction of Lord Allen, and speaking in a low tone, ‘how different
                            he is!’ 
 Lady Ambrose had the greatest admiration for Lord Allen, though her
                        acquaintance with him had hitherto been of the slightest; and Laurence, not
                        knowing how to respond to all her late remarks, was glad that her attention
                        was thus called elsewhere. 
 ‘Don’t you think,’ Allen was saying, half addressing himself to Mr. Herbert,
                        half to Mr. Luke, ‘that though at the present moment things as they are may
                        be worse than they have ever been before, there are yet ideas amongst us of
                        things as they might be, that are in advance of what has ever been before? I
                        know quite well how society is falling to pieces, and how all our notions of
                        duty are becoming confused or lost. I know too how utterly without any
                        religion we are’—(Lady Ambrose started)— ‘at least, any religion that one
                        man can express to another, and that can enable men to act in concert. But
                        still, I can’t help feeling that, in spite of all this, a higher class of
                        conceptions both of religion and morality, and social relations also, is
                        forming itself in the minds of thinking men.’ 
 ‘Perfectly true, Lord Allen,’ said Mr. Luke, ‘perfectly true! It is indeed
                        the very essence of the cultured classes to be beyond their time—to have,
                        indeed, every requisite for making everything better, except the practical
                        power. As you say, what man’s life ought to be—what true morality is—what is
                        true sense, and what is true nonsense—these are matters never at any time
                        distinguished so truly as by some of us in the latter half of the nineteenth
                        century. Only, unfortunately,’ said Mr. Luke, sighing slowly, and looking
                        round the table, ‘the dense ignorance of the world at large hampers and
                        hinders such men as these, so that all that their teaching and their insight
                        can do, is only to suggest a Utopia in the future, instead of leading to any
                        reality in the present.’ 
 ‘All my happiness is in a kind of Utopia,’ sighed Mrs.
                        Sinclair. 
 ‘Yes—yes,’ said Mr. Luke wearily; ‘so in these days must be the happiness of
                        all of us—except that of the world at large.’ 
 Mr. Storks was here heard clearing his throat. With an ominous pugilistic
                        smile he turned towards Mr. Luke. 
 ‘Are you quite sure,’ he said, ‘that the reason why your friends do nothing
                        practical is not because they will build Utopias? I, as I have already said,
                        entirely hold with Dr. Jenkinson that the world is as good as it can be—has,
                        indeed, been always as good as it could have been—has, that is, been always
                        persistently progressing by one constant course of evolution. I don’t myself
                        profess to be a student of history; but, as far as I at all understand its
                        teachings, the one thing it most clearly shows to us is, that what strikes a
                        superficial observer as simply the decadence of old orders of things, is
                        really, under the surface, the birth of the new. Indeed,’ said Mr. Storks,
                        shrugging his shoulders, ‘of course it must be so. We are all part of
                        Nature; and, little as we think it, we are all working together by
                        invincible and inviolable laws. Nature will have her own way; and those who
                        have studied her carefully know that her way is always the best. Even
                        supposing we could transplant ourselves into some different, some more
                        advanced state of society, my dear sir, do you think we should be any
                        happier there? As much happier, I suppose, as you or I should be if we were
                        translated into the heaven our nurses used to tell us of, where nothing was
                        done but to sing Tate and Brady’s psalms with the angels to all eternity.
                        The air of our own age is the only air fit for us. In any other we should
                        languish.’ 
 ‘I languish in this,’ said Mr. Luke, looking up to the ceiling. 
 Scarcely were the words out of his mouth than Mr. Saunders exclaimed, in his
                        most excited and shrillest voice, ‘I deny it—I entirely deny it!’ 
 Mr. Luke was thunderstruck. Even Mr. Storks was taken aback by the audacity
                        of the contradiction; and as for the rest of the company, they could not
                        conceive where on earth Mr. Saunders had left his manners. Mr. Storks,
                        however, was still more astonished, and still less pleased, when he
                        discovered, as Mr. Saunders proceeded, what was the real meaning of his
                        speech. 
 ‘I entirely deny,’ Mr. Saunders went on, ‘that the ways of Nature are the
                        best ways. The belief that they are so is of all faiths the one that most
                        obviously contradicts experience. Did I accept this, I could accept
                        anything—Transubstantiation even. I should literally feel that I had no
                        right to condemn any doctrine because it was groundless, gratuitous, and
                        absurd. This faith in the goodness of Nature—why, that it is a
                        faith, is not that enough to condemn it? What but faith, let me ask, has
                        enslaved and stunted the world hitherto? And this particular faith, I would
                        remind you, which you flatter yourself will oppose religion, has been in
                        most cases its child, and is always ready to be its parent. I on the
                        contrary maintain that, far from being the best, Nature is the most odious
                        of things —that the whole universe is constructed on the most hateful
                        principles; in fact, that out of the primordial atoms only one thing has
                        developed itself in which the good outweighs the evil; and that is the one
                        thing that is usually opposed to Nature—man, and the reason of man.’ 
 Mr. Storks turned sharply round, and, with an awful look in his eyes of
                        contemptuous indignation, stared Mr. Saunders into silence. He held him
                        fixed in this way for a few moments, and then said to him in a voice of grim
                        unconcern, ‘May I trouble you for the mustard.’ Then again turning to Mr.
                        Luke, ‘You see,’ he proceeded, ‘what I take to be civilisation—indeed, the
                        whole duty of man— is the gradual self-adaptation of the human organism to
                        its environment—an adaptation which must take place, and any attempts to
                        hinder which are simply neither more nor less than disease. Progress, which
                        it is our highest life to further, is a thing that will continue despite the
                        opposition of individuals. Its tendencies are beyond the control of
                        individuals, and are to be sought in the spirit of the age at large,—not—if
                        you will forgive me the word—in the crotchets of this or that thinker. And
                        it seems to me to be the hopeful and distinguishing feature of the present
                        day, that men are learning generally to recognise this truth—that they are
                        learning not to cry out against progress, but to investigate its grand and
                        inevitable laws, and submit themselves willingly to them. And the tendency
                        of our own day is, I am proud to say, a tendency towards firm, solid,
                        verifiable knowledge, and as a result of this, towards the acquisition of a
                        firm and solid happiness also.’ 
 ‘To me,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘it seems rather that the only hope for the
                        present age lies in the possibility of some individual wiser than the rest
                        getting the necessary power, and in the most arbitrary way possible putting
                        a stop to this progress—utterly stamping out and obliterating every general
                        tendency peculiar to our own time. Mr. Storks will perhaps think me very
                        foolish. Perhaps I am. I freely own that I could more easily tell a good
                        action, if I saw it, than a good piece of protoplasm, and that I think the
                        understanding of a holy moral law, by which an individual may live, of
                        infinitely more importance than the discovery of all the laws of progress in
                        the world. But let Mr. Storks despise me, and not be angry with me—’ 
 ‘My dear sir,’ interposed Mr. Storks, with a gruff courtesy, ‘why should I
                        do either the one or the other?’ 
 ‘Because,’ said Mr. Herbert, slightly waving his hand, and speaking with
                        great emphasis, ‘had I only the power, I would myself put a forcible stop to
                        all this evolution. I would make a clean sweep of all the improvements that
                        the present day so much vaunts. I would collect an army of strong,
                        serviceable, honest workmen, and send them to blow up Manchester, and
                        Birmingham, and Liverpool, and Leeds, and Wolverhampton—’ 
 ‘And all the artisans in them?’ asked Mr. Storks. 
 ‘Well,’ said Mr. Herbert, smiling, ‘I would, perhaps, give the artisans
                        notice of this gunpowder plot of mine. And yet their existence has always
                        presented a painful difficulty to me. For if there is no other life, I think
                        they have a very bad time of it here; and if there is another life, I think
                        that they will all certainly be damned. But it is not only Manchester and
                        Birmingham that I would blow up. I would blow up also every anatomical
                        museum in the land, save such as were absolutely necessary for the use of
                        professional doctors, that the foul sights in them should not taint men’s
                        imaginations, and give them an appetite for beastly knowledge. I would
                        destroy every railway, and nearly every steam-engine; and I would do a
                        number of other things of a like sort, by way of preparing the ground for a
                        better state of society. Indeed, so far am I from believing that an entirely
                        different and better state of society is unthinkable, that I believe it to
                        be not impracticable; and I am at the present moment collecting money, from
                        such as will here and there confide in me, for the purpose of purchasing
                        land, and of founding a community upon what seem to me to be true and
                        healthful principles—a Utopia, in fact—in which I trust may be once again
                        realised upon earth those two things to which we are now such
                        strangers—order and justice.’ 
 ‘I once began a book about justice,’ said Laurence, ‘on the model of Plato’s
                        Republic.’ 
 ‘What is Plato’s Republic?’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘Tell me.’ 
 ‘It is a book,’ said Laurence, ‘which describes the meeting of a party of
                        friends, who fell discussing high topics just as we are doing, and, amongst
                        others, What is justice?’ 
 ‘What!’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose. ‘Did not they know that?’ 
 ‘You forget,’ said Laurence,’ that this was very long ago.’ 
 ‘To be sure,’ said Lady Ambrose; ‘and they were of course all heathens.
                        Well— and what conclusions did they come to as to the nature of justice?’ 
 ‘At first,’ said Laurence,’ though Socrates himself was amongst them, they
                        were all completely at a loss how to define it. But at last they hit upon
                        the notion of constructing an ideal perfect state, in which of course
                        justice would be lurking somewhere. Now there are in life, Plato says, four
                        great virtues— wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice; and no sooner has
                        the ideal state been constructed, than it appears that three of these
                        virtues are specially illustrated and embodied, each in a particular class
                        of citizens. Thus, wisdom is specially embodied in the theoretical
                        politicians and religious speculators of the day; courage is embodied in the
                        practical men who maintain and execute the regulations and orders of the
                        philosophers; and temperance is embodied in the commercial and industrial
                        classes, who loyally submit themselves to their betters, and refrain from
                        meddling in matters that are too high for them. And now, where is justice?
                        In what class is that embodied specially?’ 
 ‘In the judges and the magistrates and the policemen,’ said Lady Ambrose. 
 ‘No,’ said Laurence; ‘it is peculiar to no class. It resides in all. It is
                        that virtue which enables the others to exist and to continue.’ 
 ‘But surely,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘all that is not what we mean by justice
                        now?’ 
 ‘Certainly not,’ said Laurence; ‘and my book was designed to investigate
                        what justice is, as it exists now. I, like Plato, constructed a state,
                        making it, however, a real rather than an ideal picture. But when I had done
                        this, I could find no earnest thinking class to represent wisdom; no class
                        of practical politicians that would carry out even the little wisdom they
                        knew, and so represent courage; and certainly no commercial or industrial
                        class that would refrain for a single day from meddling in matters that were
                        too high for them, and so represent temperance. So I analysed life in a
                        somewhat different way. I divided it into happiness, misery, and justice. I
                        then at once discovered that the rich represented all the happiness of which
                        we are now capable, and the poor all the misery; and that justice was that
                        which set this state of things going and enabled it to continue.’ 
 ‘Ah, Laurence,’ exclaimed Mr. Herbert, clapping his hands gently in sad
                        applause, ‘I like that. I wish you had worked out this idea more fully.’ 
 ‘Suppose,’ exclaimed Leslie, ‘that we try this afternoon to construct a
                        Utopia ourselves. Let us embody our notions of life as it ought to be in a
                        new Republic.’ 
 ‘Well,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘I am not a Conservative; I don’t object. I’m
                        sure at any rate that there is much we could all of us alter, if we only had
                        our own way.’ 
 ‘Much,’ said Lady Grace, with severe briskness. 
 ‘Much,’ said Miss Merton, with a soft, half-serious smile. 
 ‘Much,’ said Lord Allen, catching eagerly at the idea. 
 ‘Well, then,’ said Laurence, ‘let us all do our best to give those airy
                        somethings, our aspirations, a local habitation and a name.’ 
 The majority of the company took very kindly to the proposal. Lady Grace was
                        especially pleased, as it seemed to provide at once a whole afternoon’s
                        occupation for the party; and it was arranged accordingly that as soon as
                        luncheon was over they should adjourn for castle-building to a shady spot in
                        the garden.
