CHAPTER XIII
The tenant of the Manor Farm was a good specimen of his class; a thorough Saxon, ruddy and
      bright visaged, with an athletic though rather bulky frame, hardened by exposure to the
      seasons and constant exercise. Although he was the tenant of several hundred acres, he had an
      eye to the main chance in little things, which is a characteristic of farmers, but he was
      good-natured and obliging, and while he foraged their pony, furnished their woodyard with logs
      and faggots, and supplied them from his dairy, he gratuitously performed for the family at the
      hall many other offices which tended to their comfort and convenience, but which cost him
      nothing.
Mr. Ferrars liked to have a chat every now and then with Farmer Thornberry, who had a shrewd
      and idiomatic style of expressing his limited, but in its way complete, experience of men and
      things, which was amusing and interesting to a man of the world whose knowledge of rural life
      was mainly derived from grand shooting parties at great houses.
The pride and torment of Farmer Thornberry’s life was his only child, Job.
“I gave him the best of educations,” said the farmer; “he had a much better chance than I
      had myself, for I do not pretend to be a scholar, and never was; and yet I cannot make head or
      tail of him. I wish you would speak to him some day, sir. He goes against the land, and yet we
      have been on it for three generations, and have nothing to complain of; and he is a good
      farmer, too, is Job, none better; a little too fond of experimenting, but then he is young.
      But I am very much afraid he will leave me. I think it is this new thing the big-wigs have set
      up in London that has put him wrong, for he is always reading their papers.”
“And what is that?” said Mr. Ferrars.
“Well, they call themselves the Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge, and Lord Brougham is
      at the head of it.”
“Ah! he is a dangerous man,” said Mr. Ferrars.
“Do you know, I think he is,” said Farmer Thornberry, very seriously, “and by this token, he
      says a knowledge of chemistry is necessary for the cultivation of the soil.”
“Brougham is a man who would say anything,” said Mr. Ferrars, “and of one thing you may be
      quite certain, that there is no subject which Lord Brougham knows thoroughly. I have proved
      that, and if you ever have time some winter evening to read something on the matter, I will
      lend you a number of the ‘Quarterly Review,’ which might interest you.”
“I wish you would lend it to Job,” said the farmer.
Mr. Ferrars found Job not quite so manageable in controversy as his father. His views were
      peculiar, and his conclusions certain. He had more than a smattering too of political economy,
      a kind of knowledge which Mr. Ferrars viewed with suspicion; for though he had himself been
      looked upon as enlightened in this respect in the last years of Lord Liverpool, when Lord
      Wallace and Mr. Huskisson were astonishing the world, he had relapsed, after the schism of the
      Tory party, into orthodoxy, and was satisfied that the tenets of the economists were mere
      theories, or could only be reduced into practice by revolution.
“But it is a pleasant life, that of a farmer,” said Mr. Ferrars to Job.
“Yes, but life should be something more than pleasant,” said Job, who always looked
      discontented; “an ox in a pasture has a pleasant life.”
“Well, and why should it not be a profitable one, too?” said Mr. Ferrars.
“I do not see my way to that,” said Job moodily; “there is not much to be got out of the
      land at any time, and still less on the terms we hold it.”
“But you are not high-rented!”
“Oh, rent is nothing, if everything else were right, but nothing is right,” said Job. “In
      the first place, a farmer is the only trader who has no security for his capital.”
“Ah! you want a lease?”
“I should be very sorry to have a lease like any that I have seen,” replied Job. “We had one
      once in our family, and we keep it as a curiosity. It is ten skins long, and more tyrannical
      nonsense was never engrossed by man.”
“But your family, I believe, has been on this estate for generations now,” said Ferrars,
      “and they have done well.”
“They have done about as well as their stock. They have existed,” said Job; “nothing
      more.”
“Your father always gives me quite the idea of a prosperous man,” said Mr. Ferrars.
“Whether he be or not I am sure I cannot say,” said Job; “for as neither he nor any of his
      predecessors ever kept any accounts, it is rather difficult to ascertain their exact
      condition. So long as he has money enough in his pocket to pay his labourers and buy a little
      stock, my father, like every British farmer, is content. The fact is, he is a serf as much as
      his men, and until we get rid of feudalism he will remain so.”
“These are strong opinions,” said Mr. Ferrars, drawing himself up and looking a little
      cold.
“Yes, but they will make their way,” said Job. “So far as I myself am concerned, I do not
      much care what happens to the land, for I do not mean to remain on it; but I care for the
      country. For the sake of the country I should like to see the whole thing upset.”
“What thing?” asked Mr. Ferrars.
“Feudalism,” said Job. “I should like to see this estate managed on the same principles as
      they do their great establishments in the north of England. Instead of feudalism, I would
      substitute the commercial principle. I would have long leases without covenants; no useless
      timber, and no game.”
“Why, you would destroy the country,” said Mr. Ferrars.
“We owe everything to the large towns,” said Job.
“The people in the large towns are miserable,” said Mr. Ferrars.
“They cannot be more miserable than the people in the country,” said Job.
“Their wretchedness is notorious,” said Mr. Ferrars. “Look at their riots.”
“Well, we had Swing in the country only two or three years ago.”
Mr. Ferrars looked sad. The reminiscence was too near and too fatal. After a pause he said
      with an air of decision, and as if imparting a state secret, “If it were not for the
      agricultural districts, the King’s army could not be recruited.”
“Well, that would not break my heart,” said Job.
“Why, my good fellow, you are a Radical!”
“They may call me what they like,” said Job; “but it will not alter matters. However, I am
      going among the Radicals soon, and then I shall know what they are.”
“And can you leave your truly respectable parent?” said Mr. Ferrars rather solemnly, for he
      remembered his promise to Farmer Thornberry to speak seriously to his son.
“Oh! my respectable parent will do very well without me, sir. Only let him be able to drive
      into Bamford on market day, and get two or three linendrapers to take their hats off to him,
      and he will be happy enough, and always ready to die for our glorious Constitution.”
