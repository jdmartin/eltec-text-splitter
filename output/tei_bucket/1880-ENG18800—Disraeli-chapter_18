CHAPTER XVIII
It was a dark December night when Mr. Ferrars returned to Hurstley. His wife, accompanied by
      the gardener with a lantern, met him on the green. She embraced him, and whispered, “Is it
      very bad, love? I fear you have softened it to me?”
“By no means bad, and I told you the truth: not all, for had I, my letter would have been
      too late. He said nothing about the cabinet, but offered me a high post in his government,
      provided I could secure my seat. That was impossible. During the month I was in town I had
      realised that. I thought it best, therefore, at once to try the other tack, and nothing could
      be more satisfactory.”
“Did you say anything about India?” she said in a very low voice.
“I did not. He is an honourable man, but he is cold, and my manner is not distinguished for
       abandon. I thought it best to speak generally, and leave it to him. He acknowledged
      my claim, and my fitness for such posts, and said if his government lasted it would gratify
      him to meet my wishes. Barron says the government will last. They will have a majority, and if
      Stanley and Graham had joined them, they would have had not an inconsiderable one. But in that
      case I should probably not have had the cabinet, if indeed he meant to offer it to me
      now.”
“Of course he did,” said his wife. “Who has such claims as you have? Well, now we must hope
      and watch. Look cheerful to the children, for they have been very anxious.”
With this hint the meeting was not unhappy, and the evening passed with amusement and
      interest. Endymion embraced his father with warmth, and Myra kissed him on both cheeks. Mr.
      Ferrars had a great deal of gossip which interested his wife, and to a certain degree his
      children. The latter of course remembered Zenobia, and her sayings and doings were always
      amusing. There were anecdotes, too, of illustrious persons which always interest, especially
      when in the personal experience of those with whom we are intimately connected. What the Duke,
      or Sir Robert, or Lord Lyndhurst said to papa seemed doubly wiser or brighter than if it had
      been said to a third person. Their relations with the world of power, and fashion, and fame,
      seemed not to be extinct, at least reviving from their torpid condition. Mr. Ferrars had also
      brought a German book for Myra; and “as for you, Endymion,” he said, “I have been much more
      successful for you than for your father, though I hope I shall not have myself in the long run
      to complain. Our friends are faithful to us, and I have got you put down on the private list
      for a clerkship both in the Foreign Office and the Treasury. They are the two best things, and
      you will have one of the first vacancies that will occur in either department. I know your
      mother wishes you to be in the Foreign Office. Let it be so if it come. I confess, myself,
      remembering your grandfather’s career, I have always a weakness for the Treasury, but so long
      as I see you well planted in Whitehall, I shall be content. Let me see, you will be sixteen in
      March. I could have wished you to wait another year, but we must be ready when the opening
      occurs.”
The general election in 1834-5, though it restored the balance of parties, did not secure to
      Sir Robert Peel a majority, and the anxiety of the family at Hurstley was proportionate to the
      occasion. Barron was always sanguine, but the vote on the Speakership could not but alarm
      them. Barron said it did not signify, and that Sir Robert had resolved to go on and had
      confidence in his measures. His measures were excellent, and Sir Robert never displayed more
      resource, more energy, and more skill, than he did in the spring of 1835. But knowledge of
      human nature was not Sir Robert Peel’s strong point, and it argued some deficiency in that
      respect, to suppose that the fitness of his measures could disarm a vindictive opposition. On
      the contrary, they rather whetted their desire of revenge, and they were doubly loth that he
      should increase his reputation by availing himself of an opportunity which they deemed the
      Tory party had unfairly acquired.
After the vote on the Speakership, Mr. Ferrars was offered a second-class West Indian
      government. His wife would not listen to it. If it were Jamaica, the offer might be
      considered, though it could scarcely be accepted without great sacrifice. The children, for
      instance, must be left at home. Strange to say, Mr. Ferrars was not disinclined to accept the
      inferior post. Endymion he looked upon as virtually provided for, and Myra, he thought, might
      accompany them; if only for a year. But he ultimately yielded, though not without a struggle,
      to the strong feeling of his wife.
“I do not see why I also should not be left behind,” said Myra to her brother in one of
      their confidential walks. “I should like to live in London in lodgings with you.”
The approaching appointment of her brother filled her from the first with the greatest
      interest. She was always talking of it when they were alone—fancying his future life, and
      planning how it might be happier and more easy. “My only joy in life is seeing you,” she
      sometimes said, “and yet this separation does not make me unhappy. It seems a chance from
      heaven for you. I pray every night it may be the Foreign Office.”
The ministry were still sanguine as to their prospects in the month of March, and they
      deemed that public opinion was rallying round Sir Robert. Perhaps Lord John Russell, who was
      the leader of the opposition, felt this, in some degree, himself, and he determined to bring
      affairs to a crisis by notice of a motion respecting the appropriation of the revenues of the
      Irish Church. Then Barron wrote to Mr. Ferrars that affairs did not look so well, and advised
      him to come up to town, and take anything that offered. “It is something,” he remarked, “to
      have something to give up. We shall not, I suppose, always be out of office, and they get
      preferred more easily whose promotion contributes to patronage, even while they claim its
      exercise.”
The ministry were in a minority on the Irish Church on April 2, the day on which Mr. Ferrars
      arrived in town. They did not resign, but the attack was to be repeated in another form on the
      6th. During the terrible interval Mr. Ferrars made distracted visits to Downing Street, saw
      secretaries of state, who sympathised with him not withstanding their own chagrin, and was
      closeted daily and hourly with under-secretaries, parliamentary and permanent, who really
      alike wished to serve him. But there was nothing to be had. He was almost meditating taking
      Sierra Leone, or the Gold Coast, when the resignation of Sir Robert Peel was announced. At the
      last moment, there being, of course, no vacancy in the Foreign Office, or the Treasury, he
      obtained from Barron an appointment for Endymion, and so, after having left Hurstley five
      months before to become Governor-General of India, this man, “who had claims,” returned to his
      mortified home with a clerkship for his son in a second-rate government office.
