CHAPTER LIII
Endymion was a little agitated when he arrived at the door of Montfort House, a huge family
      mansion, situate in a court-yard and looking into the Green Park. When the door was opened he
      found himself in a large hall with many servants, and he was ushered through several rooms on
      the ground floor, into a capacious chamber dimly lighted, where there were several gentlemen,
      but not his hostess. His name was announced, and then a young man came up to him and mentioned
      that Lord and Lady Montfort would soon be present, and then talked to him about the weather.
      The Count of Ferroll arrived after Endymion, and then another gentleman whose name he could
      not catch. Then while he was making some original observations on the east wind, and, to
      confess the truth, feeling anything but at his ease, the folding doors of a further chamber
      brilliantly lighted were thrown open, and almost at the same moment Lady Montfort entered,
      and, taking the Count of Ferroll’s arm, walked into the dining-room. It was a round table, and
      Endymion was told by the same gentleman who had already addressed him, that he was to sit by
      Lady Montfort.
“Lord Montfort is a little late to-day,” she said, “but he wished me not to wait for him.
      And how are you after our parliamentary banquet?” she said, turning to Endymion; “I will
      introduce you to the Count of Ferroll.”
The Count of Ferroll was a young man, and yet inclined to be bald. He was chief of a not
      inconsiderable mission at our court. Though not to be described as a handsome man, his
      countenance was striking; a brow of much intellectual development, and a massive jaw. He was
      tall, broad-shouldered, with a slender waist. He greeted Endymion with a penetrating glance,
      and then with a winning smile.
The Count of Ferroll was the representative of a kingdom which, if not exactly created, had
      been moulded into a certain form of apparent strength and importance by the Congress of
      Vienna. He was a noble of considerable estate in a country where possessions were not
      extensive or fortunes large, though it was ruled by an ancient, and haughty, and warlike
      aristocracy. Like his class, the Count of Ferroll had received a military education; but when
      that education was completed, he found but a feeble prospect of his acquirements being called
      into action. It was believed that the age of great wars had ceased, and that even revolutions
      were for the future to be controlled by diplomacy. As he was a man of an original, not to say
      eccentric, turn of mind, the Count of Ferroll was not contented with the resources and
      distraction of his second-rate capital. He was an eminent sportsman, and, for some time, took
      refuge and found excitement in the breadth of his dark forests, and in the formation of a
      stud, which had already become celebrated. But all this time, even in the excitement of the
      chase, and in the raising of his rare-breed steeds, the Count of Ferroll might be said to have
      been brooding over the position of what he could scarcely call his country, but rather an
      aggregation of lands baptized by protocols, and christened and consolidated by treaties which
      he looked upon as eminently untrustworthy. One day he surprised his sovereign, with whom he
      was a favourite, by requesting to be appointed to the legation at London, which was vacant.
      The appointment was at once made, and the Count of Ferroll had now been two years at the Court
      of St. James’.
The Count of Ferroll was a favourite in English society, for he possessed every quality
      which there conduces to success. He was of great family and of distinguished appearance,
      munificent and singularly frank; was a dead-shot, and the boldest of riders, with horses which
      were the admiration alike of Melton and Newmarket. The ladies also approved of him, for he was
      a consummate waltzer, and mixed with a badinage gaily cynical a tone that could be tender and
      a bewitching smile.
But his great friend was Lady Montfort. He told her everything, and consulted her on
      everything; and though he rarely praised anybody, it had reached her ears that the Count of
      Ferroll had said more than once that she was a greater woman than Louise of Savoy or the
      Duchesse de Longueville.
There was a slight rustling in the room. A gentleman had entered and glided into his
      unoccupied chair, which his valet had guarded. “I fear I am not in time for an oyster,” said
      Lord Montfort to his neighbour.
The gentleman who had first spoken to Endymion was the secretary of Lord Montfort; then
      there was a great genius who was projecting a suspension bridge over the Tyne, and that was in
      Lord Montfort’s county. A distinguished officer of the British Museum completed the party with
      a person who sate opposite Endymion, and whom in the dim twilight he had not recognised, but
      whom he now beheld with no little emotion. It was Nigel Penruddock. They had not met since his
      mother’s funeral, and the associations of the past agitated Endymion. They exchanged
      recognitions; that of Nigel was grave but kind.
The conversation was what is called general, and a great deal on suspension bridges. Lord
      Montfort himself led off on this, in order to bring out his distinguished guest. The Count of
      Ferroll was also interested on this subject, as his own government was making inquiries on the
      matter. The gentleman from the British Museum made some remarks on the mode in which the
      ancient Egyptians moved masses of granite, and quoted Herodotus to the civil engineer. The
      civil engineer had never heard of Herodotus, but he said he was going to Egypt in the autumn
      by desire of Mehemet Ali, and he would undertake to move any mass which was requisite, even if
      it were a pyramid itself. Lady Montfort, without disturbing the general conversation,
      whispered in turns to the Count of Ferroll and Endymion, and told the latter that she had paid
      a visit to Lady Roehampton in the morning—a most delightful visit. There was no person she
      admired so much as his sister; she quite loved her. The only person who was silent was Nigel,
      but Lady Montfort, who perceived everything, addressed him across the table with enthusiasm
      about some changes he had made in the services of some church, and the countenance of Nigel
      became suffused like a young saint who has a glimpse of Paradise.
After dinner Lady Montfort led Endymion to her lord, and left him seated by his host. Lord
      Montfort was affable and natural in his manner. He said, “I have not yet made the acquaintance
      of Lady Roehampton, for I never go out; but I hope to do so, for Lady Montfort tells me she is
      quite captivating.”
“She is a very good sister,” said Endymion.
“Lady Montfort has told me a great deal about yourself, and all of it I was glad to hear. I
      like young men who rise by their merits, and Mr. Sidney Wilton tells Lady Montfort that yours
      are distinguished.”
“Mr. Sidney Wilton is a kind master, sir.”
“Well, I was his fag at Harrow, and I thought him so,” said Lord Montfort. “And now about
      your office; tell me what you do. You were not there first, Lady Montfort says. Where were you
      first? Tell me all about it. I like detail.”
It was impossible to resist such polished and amiable curiosity, and Endymion gratified it
      with youthful grace. He even gave Lord Montfort a sketch of St. Barbe, inspired probably by
      the interview of the morning. Lord Montfort was quite amused with this, and said he should so
      much like to know Mr. St. Barbe. It was clear, when the party broke up, that Endymion had made
      a favourable impression, for Lord Montfort said, “You came here to-day as Lady Montfort’s
      friend, but you must come in future as mine also. And will you understand, I dine at home
      every day when I am in town, and I give you a general invitation. Come as often as you like;
      you will be always welcome. Only let the house know your intention an hour before dinner-time,
      as I have a particular aversion to the table being crowded, or seeing an empty chair.”
Lady Montfort had passed much of the evening in earnest conversation with Nigel, and when
      the guests quitted the room, Nigel and Endymion walked away together.
