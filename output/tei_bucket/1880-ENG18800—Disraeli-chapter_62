CHAPTER LXII
Lancashire was not so wonderful a place forty years ago as it is at present, but, compared
      then with the rest of England, it was infinitely more striking. For a youth like Endymion,
      born and bred in our southern counties, the Berkshire downs varied by the bustle of Pall-Mall
      and the Strand—Lancashire, with its teeming and toiling cities, its colossal manufactories and
      its gigantic chimneys, its roaring engines and its flaming furnaces, its tramroads and its
      railroads, its coal and its cotton, offered a far greater contrast to the scenes in which he
      had hitherto lived, than could be furnished by almost any country of the European
      continent.
Endymion felt it was rather a crisis in his life, and that his future might much depend on
      the fulfilment of the confidential office which had been entrusted to him by his chief. He
      summoned all his energies, concentrated his intelligence on the one subject, and devoted to
      its study and comprehension every moment of his thought and time. After a while, he had made
      Manchester his head-quarters. It was even then the centre of a network of railways, and gave
      him an easy command of the contiguous districts.
Endymion had more than once inquired after the Anti-Corn-Law League, but had not as yet been
      so fortunate as to attend any of their meetings. They were rarer than they afterwards soon
      became, and the great manufacturers did not encourage them. “I do not like extreme views,”
      said one of the most eminent one day to Endymion. “In my opinion, we should always avoid
      extremes;” and he paused and looked around, as if he had enunciated a heaven-born truth, and
      for the first time. “I am a Liberal; so we all are here. I supported Lord Grey, and I support
      Lord Melbourne, and I am, in everything, for a liberal policy. I don’t like extremes. A wise
      minister should take off the duty on cotton wool. That is what the country really wants, and
      then everybody would be satisfied. No; I know nothing about this League you ask about, and I
      do not know any one—that is to say, any one respectable—who does. They came to me to lend my
      name. ‘No,’ I said, ‘gentlemen; I feel much honoured, but I do not like extremes;’ and they
      went away. They are making a little more noise now, because they have got a man who has the
      gift of the gab, and the people like to go and hear him speak. But as I said to a friend of
      mine, who seemed half inclined to join them, ‘Well; if I did anything of that sort, I would be
      led by a Lancashire lad. They have got a foreigner to lead them, a fellow out of Berkshire; an
      agitator—and only a print-work after all. No; that will never do.’”
Notwithstanding these views, which Endymion found very generally entertained by the new
      world in which he mixed, he resolved to take the earliest opportunity of attending the meeting
      of the League, and it soon arrived.
It was an evening meeting, so that workmen—or the operatives, as they were styled in this
      part of the kingdom—should be able to attend. The assembly took place in a large but temporary
      building; very well adapted to the human voice, and able to contain even thousands. It was
      fairly full to-night; and the platform, on which those who took a part in the proceedings, or
      who, by their comparatively influential presence, it was supposed, might assist the cause, was
      almost crowded.
“He is going to speak to-night,” said an operative to Endymion. “That is why there is such
      an attendance.”
Remembering Mr. Wilton’s hint about not asking unnecessary questions which often arrest
      information, Endymion did not inquire who “he” was; and to promote communication merely
      observed, “A fine speaker, then, I conclude?”
“Well, he is in a way,” said the operative. “He has not got Hollaballoo’s voice, but he
      knows what he is talking about. I doubt their getting what they are after; they have not the
      working classes with them. If they went against truck, it would be something.”
The chairman opened the proceedings; but was coldly received, though he spoke sensibly and
      at some length. He then introduced a gentleman, who was absolutely an alderman, to move a
      resolution condemnatory of the corn laws. The august position of the speaker atoned for his
      halting rhetoric, and a city which had only just for the first time been invested with
      municipal privileges was hushed before a man who might in time even become a mayor.
Then the seconder advanced, and there was a general burst of applause.
“There he is,” said the operative to Endymion; “you see they like him. Oh, Job knows how to
      do it!”
Endymion listened with interest, soon with delight, soon with a feeling of exciting and not
      unpleasing perplexity, to the orator; for he was an orator, though then unrecognised, and
      known only in his district. He was a pale and slender man, with a fine brow and an eye that
      occasionally flashed with the fire of a creative mind. His voice certainly was not like
      Hollaballoo’s. It was rather thin, but singularly clear. There was nothing clearer except his
      meaning. Endymion never heard a case stated with such pellucid art; facts marshalled with such
      vivid simplicity, and inferences so natural and spontaneous and irresistible, that they
      seemed, as it were, borrowed from his audience, though none of that audience had arrived at
      them before. The meeting was hushed, was rapt in intellectual delight, for they did not give
      the speaker the enthusiasm of their sympathy. That was not shared, perhaps, by the moiety of
      those who listened to him. When his case was fairly before them, the speaker dealt with his
      opponents—some in the press, some in parliament—with much power of sarcasm, but this power was
      evidently rather repressed than allowed to run riot. What impressed Endymion as the chief
      quality of this remarkable speaker was his persuasiveness, and he had the air of being too
      prudent to offend even an opponent unnecessarily. His language, though natural and easy, was
      choice and refined. He was evidently a man who had read, and not a little; and there was no
      taint of vulgarity, scarcely a provincialism, in his pronunciation.
He spoke for rather more than an hour; and frequently during this time, Endymion,
      notwithstanding his keen interest in what was taking place, was troubled, it might be
      disturbed, by pictures and memories of the past that he endeavoured in vain to drive away.
      When the orator concluded, amid cheering much louder than that which had first greeted him,
      Endymion, in a rather agitated voice, whispered to his neighbour, “Tell me—is his name
      Thornberry?”
“That is your time of day,” said the operative. “Job Thornberry is his name, and I am on his
      works.”
“And yet you do not agree with him?”
“Well; I go as far as he goes, but he does not go so far as I go; that’s it.”
“I do not see how a man can go much farther,” said Endymion. “Where are his works? I knew
      your master when he was in the south of England, and I should like to call on him.”
“My employer,” said the operative. “They call themselves masters, but we do not. I will tell
      you. His works are a mile out of town; but it seems only a step, for there are houses all the
      way. Job Thornberry & Co.‘s Print-works, Pendleton Road—any one can guide you—and when you
      get there, you can ask for me, if you like. I am his overlooker, and my name is ENOCH
      CRAGGS.”
