6. Learning and Accomplishments

"I subscribe to Lucian: 'tis an elegant thing which cheareth up the mind, exerciseth the
     body, delights the spectators, which teacheth many comely gestures, equally affecting the ears,
     eyes and soul itself."—Burton, on Dancing.
"What is this?" asked Dr. Grimstone in his most blood-curdling tone, after a most impressive
     pause at the dormitory door.
Mr. Bultitude held his tongue, but kept fast hold of his chair, which he held before him as a
     defence against either party, while Coggs remained motionless in the
      centre of the room, with crooked knees and hands dangling impotently.
"Will one of you be good enough to explain how you come to be found struggling in this
     unseemly manner? I sent you up here to meditate on your past behaviour."
"I should be most happy to meditate, sir," protested Paul, lowering his chair on discovering
     that there was no immediate danger, "if that—that bloodthirsty young ruffian there would allow
     me to do so. I am going about in bodily fear of him, Dr. Grimstone. I want him bound over to
     keep the peace. I decline to be left alone with him—he's not safe!"
"Is that so, Coggs? Are you mean and base enough to take this cowardly revenge on a boy who
     has had the moral courage to expose your deceit—for your ultimate good—a boy who is unable to
     defend himself against you?"
"He can fight when he chooses, sir," said Coggs; "he blacked my eye last term, sir!"
"I assure you," said Paul, with the convincing earnestness of truth, "that I never blacked
     anybody's eye in the whole course of my life. I am not—ah—a pugnacious man. My age, and—hum—my
     position, ought to protect me from these scandals——"
"You've come back this year, sir," said Dr. Grimstone, "with a very odd way of talking of
     yourself—an exceedingly odd way. Unless I see you abandoning it, and behaving like a reasonable
     boy again, I shall be forced to conclude you intend some disrespect and open defiance by
     it."
"If you would allow me an opportunity of explaining my position, sir," said Paul, "I would
     undertake to clear your mind directly of such a monstrous idea. I am trying to assert my
     rights, Dr. Grimstone—my rights as a citizen, as a householder! This is no place for me, and I
     appeal to you to set me free. If you only knew one tenth——"
"Let us understand one another, Bultitude,"
     interrupted the Doctor. "You may think it an excellent joke to talk nonsense to me
     like this. But let me tell you there is a point where a jest becomes an insult. I've spared you
     hitherto out of consideration for the feelings of your excellent father, who is so anxious that
     you should become an object of pride and credit to him; but if you dare to treat me to any more
     of this bombast about 'explaining your rights,' you will force me to exercise one of mine—the
     right to inflict corporal punishment, sir—which you have just seen in operation upon
     another."
"Oh!" said Mr. Bultitude faintly, feeling utterly crestfallen—and he could say nothing
     more.
"As for those illicit luxuries in your playbox," continued the Doctor, "the fact that you
     brought the box up as it was is in your favour; and I am inclined on reflection to overlook the
     affair, if you can assure me that you were no party to their being put there?"
"On the contrary," said Paul, "I gave the strictest orders that there was to be no such
     useless extravagance. I objected to have the kitchen and housekeeper's room ransacked to make a
     set of rascally boys ill for a fortnight at my expense!"
The Doctor stared slightly at this creditable but unnatural view of the subject. However, as
     he could not quarrel with the sentiment, he let the manner of expressing it pass unrebuked for
     the present, and, after sentencing Coggs to two days' detention and the copying of innumerable
     French verbs, he sent the ill-matched pair down to the schoolroom to join their respective
     classes.
Paul went resignedly downstairs and into the room, where he found Mr. Blinkhorn at the head
     of one of the long tables, taking a class of about a dozen boys.
"Take your Livy and Latin Primer, Bultitude," said Mr. Blinkhorn mildly, "and sit down."
Mr. Blinkhorn was a tall angular man, with a long neck and slightly drooping head. He had
     thin wiry brown hair, and a plain face, with shortsighted kind
      brown eyes. In character he was mild and reserved, too conscientious to allow
     himself the luxury of either favourites or aversions among the boys, all of whom in his secret
     soul he probably disliked about equally, though he neither said nor did anything to show
     it.
Paul took a book—any book, for he did not know or care to know one from another—and sat down
     at the end furthest from the master, inwardly rebelling at having education thus forced upon
     him at his advanced years, but seeing no escape.
"At dinner time," he resolved desperately, "I will insist on speaking out, but just now it is
     simply prudent to humour them."
The rest of the class drew away from him with marked coldness and occasionally saluted him
     (when Mr. Blinkhorn's attention was called away) with terms and grimaces which Paul, although
     he failed thoroughly to understand them, felt instinctively were not intended as
     compliments.
Mr. Blinkhorn's notions of discipline were qualified by a sportsmanlike instinct which
     forbade him to harass a boy already in trouble, as he understood young Bultitude had been, and
     so he forbore from pressing him to take any share in the class work.
Mr. Bultitude therefore was saved from any necessity of betraying his total ignorance of his
     author, and sat gloomily on the hard form, impatiently watching the minute-hand skulk round the
     mean dull face of the clock above the chimney-piece, while around him one boy after another
     droned out a listless translation of the work before him, interrupted by mild corrections and
     comments from the master.
What a preposterous change from all his ordinary habits! At this very time, only twenty-four
     hours since, he was stepping slowly and majestically towards his accustomed omnibus, which was
     waiting with deference for him to overtake it; he was taking his seat, saluted respectfully by
     the conductor and cheerily by
      his fellow-passengers, as a man of recognised mark and position.
Now that omnibus would halt at the corner of Westbourne Terrace in vain, and go on its way
     Bankwards without him. He was many miles away—in the very last place where anyone would be
     likely to look for him, occupying the post of "whipping-boy" to his miserable son!
Was ever an inoffensive and respectable gentleman placed in a more false and ridiculous
     position?
If he had only kept his drawer locked, and hidden the abominable Garudâ Stone away from
     Dick's prying eyes; if he had let the moralising alone; if Boaler had not been so long fetching
     that cab, or if he had not happened to faint at the critical moment—what an immense difference
     any one of these apparent trifles would have made.
And now what was he to do to get out of this incongruous and distasteful place? It was all
     very well to say that he had only to insist upon a hearing from the Doctor, but what if, as he
     had very grave reason to fear, the Doctor should absolutely refuse to listen, should even
     proceed to carry out his horrible threat? Must he remain there till the holidays came to
     release him? Suppose Dick—as he certainly would unless he was quite a fool—declined to receive
     him during the holidays? It was absolutely necessary to return home at once; every additional
     hour he passed in imprisonment made it harder to regain his lost self.
Now and then he roused himself from all these gloomy thoughts to observe his companions. The
     boys at the upper end, near Mr. Blinkhorn, were fairly attentive, and he noticed one small
     smug-faced boy about half-way up, who, while a class-mate was faltering and blundering over
     some question, would cry "I know, sir. Let me tell him. Ask me, sir!" in a restless agony of
     superior information.
Down by Paul, however, the discipline was relaxed enough, as perhaps could only be expected
     on the first
      day of term. One wild-eyed long-haired boy had brought out a small china figure
     with which, and the assistance of his right hand draped in a pocket handkerchief, and wielding
     a penholder, he was busy enacting a drama based on the lines of Punch and Judy, to the
     breathless amusement of his neighbours.
Mr. Bultitude might have hoped to escape notice by a policy of judicious self-effacement, but
     unhappily his long, blank, uninterested face was held by his companions to bear an implied
     reproach; and being delicately sensitive on this point, they kicked his legs viciously, which
     made him extremely glad when dinnertime came, although he felt too faint and bilious to be
     tempted by anything but the lightest and daintiest luncheon.
But at dinner he found, with a shudder, that he was expected to swallow a thick ragged
     section of boiled mutton which had been carved and helped so long before he sat down to it,
     that the stagnant gravy was chilled and congealed into patches of greasy white. He managed to
     swallow it with many pauses of invincible disgust—only to find it replaced by a solid slab of
     pale brown suet pudding, sparsely bedewed with unctuous black treacle.
This, though a plentiful, and by no means unwholesome fare for growing boys, was not what he
     had been accustomed to, and feeling far too heavy and unwell after it to venture upon an
     encounter with the Doctor, he wandered slow and melancholy round the bare gravelled playground
     during the half-hour after dinner devoted to the inevitable "chevy," until the Doctor appeared
     at the head of the staircase.
It is always sad for the historian to have to record a departure from principle, and I have
     to confess with shame on Mr. Bultitude's account that, feeling the Doctor's eye upon him, and
     striving to propitiate him, he humiliated himself so far as to run about with an elaborate
     affection of zest, and his exertions were
      rewarded by hearing himself cordially encouraged to further efforts.
It cheered and emboldened him. "I've put him in a good temper," he told himself; "if I can
     only keep him in one till the evening, I really think I might be able to go up and tell him
     what a ridiculous mess I've got into. Why should I care, after all? At least I've done nothing
     to be ashamed of. It's an accident that might have happened to any man!"
It is a curious and unpleasant thing that, however reassuring and convincing the arguments
     may be with which we succeed in bracing ourselves to meet or disregard unpleasantness, the
     force of those arguments seldom or never outlasts the frame of mind in which they are composed,
     and when the unpleasantness is at hand, there we are, just as unreasonably alarmed at it as
     ever.
Mr. Bultitude's confidence faded away almost as soon as he found himself in the schoolroom
     again. He found himself assigned to a class at one end of the room, where Mr. Tinkler presently
     introduced a new rule in Algebra to them, in such a manner as to procure for it a lasting
     unpopularity with all those who were not too much engaged in drawing duels and railway trains
     upon their slates to attend.
Although Paul did not draw upon his slate, his utter ignorance of Algebra prevented him from
     being much edified by the cabalistic signs on the blackboard, which Mr. Tinkler seemed to chalk
     up dubiously, and rub out again as soon as possible, with an air of being ashamed of them. So
     he tried to nerve himself for the coming ordeal by furtively watching and studying the Doctor,
     who was taking a Xenophon class at the upper end of the room, and, being in fairly good humour,
     was combining instruction with amusement in a manner peculiarly his own.
He stopped the construing occasionally to illustrate some word or passage by an anecdote; he
     condescended to enliven the translation here and there by a familiar
      and colloquial paraphrase; he magnanimously refrained from pressing any obviously
     inconvenient questions; and his manner generally was marked by a geniality which was
     additionally piquant from its extreme uncertainty.
Mr. Bultitude could not help thinking it a rather ghastly form of gaiety, but he hoped it
     might last.
Presently, however, some one brought him a blue envelope on a tray. He read it, and a frown
     gathered on his face. The boy who was translating at the time went on again in his former
     slipshod manner (which had hitherto provoked only jovial criticism and correction) with
     complete self-complacency, but found himself sternly brought to book, and burdened by a heavy
     imposition, before he quite realised that his blunders had ceased to amuse.
Then began a season of sore trial and tribulation for the class. The Doctor suddenly withdrew
     the light of his countenance from them, and sunshine was succeeded by blackest thunderclouds.
     The wind was no longer tempered to the more closely shorn of the flock; the weakest vessels
     were put on unexpectedly at crucial passages, and, coming hopelessly to grief, were denounced
     as impostors and idlers, till half the class was dissolved in tears.
A few of the better grounded stood the fire, like a remnant of the Old Guard. With faces pale
     from alarm, and trembling voices, but perfect accuracy, they answered all the Doctor's
     searching inquiries after the paradigms of Greek verbs that seemed irregular to the verge of
     impropriety.
Paul saw it all with renewed misgiving. "If I were there," he thought, "I should have been
     run out and flogged long ago! How angry those stupid young idiots are making him! How can I go
     up and speak to him when he's like that? And yet I must. I'm sitting on dynamite as it is. The
     very first time they want me to answer any questions from some of their books, I shall be
     ruined! Why wasn't I better educated when I
      was a boy, or why didn't I make a better use of my opportunities! It will be a
     bitter thing if they thrash me for not knowing as much as Dick. Grimstone's coming this way
     now; it's all over with me!"
The Greek class had managed to repel the enemy, with some loss to themselves, and the Doctor
     now left his place for a moment, and came down towards the bench on which Paul sat
     trembling.
The storm, however, had passed over for the present, and he only said with restored calmness,
     "Who were the boys who learnt dancing last term?"
One or two of them said they had done so, and Dr. Grimstone continued: "Mr. Burdekin was
     unable to give you the last lesson of his course last term, and has arranged to take you
     to-day, as he will be in the neighbourhood. So be off at once to Mrs. Grimstone and change your
     shoes. Bultitude, you learnt last term, too. Go with the others."
Mr. Bultitude was too overcome by this unexpected attack to contradict it, though of course
     he was quite able to do so; but then, if he had, he must have explained all, and he felt
     strongly that just then was neither the time nor the place for particulars.
It would have been wiser perhaps, it would certainly have brought matters to a crisis, if he
     could have forced himself to tell everything—the whole truth in all its outrageous
     improbability—but he could not.
Let those who feel inclined to blame him for lack of firmness consider how difficult and
     delicate a business it must almost of necessity be for anyone to declare openly, in the teeth
     of common sense and plain facts, that there has been a mistake, and, in point of fact, he is
     not his own son, but his own father.
"I suppose I must go," he thought. "I needn't dance. Haven't danced since I was a young man.
     But I can't afford to offend him just now."
And so he followed the rest into a sort of cloak-room, where the tall hats which the boys
     wore on Sundays
      were all kept on shelves in white bandboxes; and there his hair was brushed, his
     feet were thrust into very shiny patent leather shoes, and a pair of kid gloves was given out
     to him to put on.
The dancing lesson was to be held in the "Dining Hall," from which the savour of mutton had
     not altogether departed. When Paul came in he found the floor cleared and the tables and forms
     piled up on one side of the room.
Biddlecomb and Tipping and some of the smaller boys were there already, their gloves and
     shiny shoes giving them a feeling of ceremony and constraint which they tried to carry off by
     an uncouth parody of politeness.
Siggers was telling stories of the dances he had been to in town, and the fine girls whose
     step had exactly suited his own, and Tipping was leaning gloomily against the wall listening to
     something Chawner was whispering in his ear.
There was a rustle of dresses down the stairs outside, and two thin little girls, looking
     excessively proper and prim, came in with an elderly gentlewoman who was their governess and
     wore a pince-nez to impart the necessary suggestion of a superior intellect. They were
     the Miss Mutlows, sisters of one of the day-boarders, and attended the course by special favour
     as friends of Dulcie's, who followed them in with a little gleam of shy anticipation in her
     eyes.
The Miss Mutlows sat stiffly down on a form, one on each side of her governess, and all three
     stared solemnly at the boys, who began to blush vividly under the inspection, to unbutton and
     rebutton their gloves with great care, and to shift from leg to leg in an embarrassed
     manner.
Dulcie soon singled out poor Mr. Bultitude, who, mindful of Tipping's warning, was doing his
     very best to avoid her.
She ran straight to him, laid her hand on his arm and looked into his face pleadingly.
     "Dick," she said, "you're not sulky still, are you?"


Mr. Bultitude had borne a good deal already, and, not being remarkably sweet-natured, he
     shook the little hand away, half petulant and half alarmed. "I do wish you wouldn't do this
     sort of thing in public. You'll compromise me, you know!" he said nervously.
Dulcie opened her grey eyes wide, and then a flush came into her cheeks, and she made a
     little disdainful upward movement of her chin.
"You didn't mind it once," she said. "I thought you might want to dance with me. You liked to
     last term. But I'm sure I don't care if you choose to be disagreeable. Go and dance with Mary
     Mutlow if you want to, though you did say she danced like a pair of compasses, and I shall tell
     her you said so, too. And you know you're not a good dancer yourself. Are you going to
     dance with Mary?"
Paul stamped. "I tell you I never dance," he said. "I can't dance any more than a lamp-post.
     You don't seem an ill-natured little girl, but why on earth can't you let me alone?"
Dulcie's eyes flashed. "You're a nasty sulky boy," she said in an angry undertone (all the
     conversation had, of course, been carried on in whispers). "I'll never speak to you or look at
     you again. You're the most horrid boy in the school—and the ugliest!"
And she turned proudly away, though anyone who looked might have seen the fire in her eyes
     extinguished as she did so. Perhaps Tipping did see it, for he scowled at them from his
     corner.
There was another sound outside, as of fiddlestrings being twanged by the finger, and, as the
     boys hastily formed up in two lines down the centre of the room and the Miss Mutlows and Dulcie
     prepared themselves for the curtsey of state, there came in a little fat man, with mutton-chop
     whiskers and a white face, upon which was written an unalterable conviction that his manner and
     deportment were perfection itself.
The two rows of boys bent themselves stiffly from the
      back, and Mr. Burdekin returned the compliment by an inclusive and stately
     inclination.
"Good afternoon, madam. Young ladies, I trust I find you well. (The curtsey just a leetle
     lower, Miss Mutlow—the right foot less drawn back. Beautiful! Feet closer at the recovery.
     Perfect!) Young gentlemen, good evening. Take your usual places, please, all of you, for our
     preliminary exercises. Now, the chassée round the room. Will you lead off, please,
     Dummer; the hands just lightly touching the shoulders, the head thrown negligently back to
     balance the figure; the whole deportment easy, but not careless. Now, please!"
And, talking all the time with a metrical fluency, he scraped a little jig on the violin,
     while Dummer led off a procession which solemnly capered round the room in sundry stages of
     conscious awkwardness. Mr. Bultitude shuffled along somehow after the rest, with rebellion at
     his heart and a deep sense of degradation. "If my clerks were to see me now!" he thought.
After some minutes of this, Mr. Burdekin stopped them and directed sets to be formed for "The
     Lancers."
"Bultitude," said Mr. Burdekin, "you will take Miss Mutlow, please."
"Thank you," said Paul, "but—ah—I don't dance."
"Nonsense, nonsense, sir, you are one of my most promising pupils. You mustn't tell me that.
     Not another word! Come, select your partners."
Paul had no option. He was paired off with the tall and rather angular young lady mentioned,
     while Dulcie looked on pouting, and snubbed Tipping, who humbly asked for the pleasure of
     dancing with her, by declaring that she meant to dance with Tom.
The dance began to a sort of rhythmical accompaniment by Mr. Burdekin, who intoned "Tops
     advance, retire and cross. Balance at corners. (Very nice, Miss Grimstone!) More
     'abandon,' Chawner! Lift the feet more from the floor. Not so high as that! Oh, dear
     me! that last figure over again. And slide the
      feet, oh, slide the feet! (Bultitude, you're leaving out all the steps!")
Paul was dragged, unwilling but unresisting, through it all by his partner, who jerked and
     pushed him into his place without a word, being apparently under strict orders from the
     governess not on any account to speak to the boys.
After the dance the couples promenaded in a stiff but stately manner round the room to a
     dirge-like march scraped upon the violin, the boys taking the parts of ladies jibbing away from
     their partners in a highly unlady-like fashion, and the boy burdened with the companionship of
     the younger Miss Mutlow walking along in a very agony of bashfulness.
"I suppose," thought Paul, as he led the way with Miss Mary Mutlow, "if Dick were ever to
     hear of this, he'd think it funny. Oh, if I ever get the upper hand of him again——.
     How much longer, I wonder, shall I have to play the fool to this infernal fiddle!"
But, if this was bad, worse was to come.
There was another pause, in which Mr. Burdekin said blandly, "I wonder now if we have
     forgotten our sailor's hornpipe. Perhaps Bultitude will prove the contrary. If I remember
     right, he used to perform it with singular correctness. And, let me tell you, there are a great
     number of spurious hornpipe steps in circulation. Come, sir, oblige me by dancing it
     alone!"
This was the final straw. It was not to be supposed for one moment that Mr. Bultitude would
     lower his dignity in such a preposterous manner. Besides, he did not know how to dance the
     hornpipe.
So he said, "I shall do nothing of the sort. I've had quite enough of
     this—ah—tomfoolery!"
"That is a very impolite manner of declining, Bultitude; highly discourteous and unpolished.
     I must insist now—really, as a personal matter—upon your going through the sailor's hornpipe.
     Come, you won't make a scene, I'm sure. You'll oblige me, as a gentleman?"


"I tell you I can't!" said Mr. Bultitude sullenly. "I never did such a thing in my life; it
     would be enough to kill me at my age!"
"This is untrue, sir. Do you mean to say you will not dance the hornpipe?"
"No," said Paul, "I'll be damned if I do!"
There was unfortunately no possible doubt about the nature of the word used—he said it so
     very distinctly. The governess screamed and called her charges to her. Dulcie hid her face, and
     some of the boys tittered.
Mr. Burdekin turned pink. "After that disgraceful language, sir, in the presence of the
     fairer sex, I have no more to do with you. You will have the goodness to stand in the centre of
     that form. Gentlemen, select your partners for the Highland schottische!"
Mr. Bultitude, by no means sorry to be freed from the irksome necessity of dancing with a
     heart ill-attuned for enjoyment, got up on the form and stood looking, sullenly enough, upon
     the proceedings. The governess glowered at him now and then as a monster of youthful depravity;
     the Miss Mutlows glanced up at him as they tripped past, with curiosity not unmixed with
     admiration, but Dulcie steadily avoided looking in his direction.
Paul was just congratulating himself upon his escape when the door opened wide, and the
     Doctor marched slowly and imposingly into the room.
He did this occasionally, partly to superintend matters, and partly as an encouraging mark of
     approbation. He looked round the class at first with benignant toleration, until his glance
     took in the bench upon which Mr. Bultitude was set up. Then his eye slowly travelled up to the
     level of Paul's head, his expression changing meanwhile to a petrifying glare.
It was not, as Paul instinctively felt, exactly the position in which a gentleman who wished
     to stand well with those in authority over him would prefer to be found. He felt his heart turn
     to water within him, and stared limp and helpless at the Doctor.


There was an awful silence (Dr. Grimstone was addicted to awful silences; and, indeed, if
     seldom strictly "golden," silence may often be called "iron"), but at last he inquired, "And
     pray what may you be doing up there, sir?"
"Upon my soul I can't say," said Mr. Bultitude feebly. "Ask that gentleman there with the
     fiddle—he knows."
Mr. Burdekin was a good-natured, easy-tempered little man, and had already forgotten the
     affront to his dignity. He was anxious not to get the boy into more trouble.
"Bultitude was a little inattentive and, I may say, wanting in respect, Dr. Grimstone," he
     said, putting it as mildly as he could with any accuracy; "so I ventured to place him there as
     a punishment."
"Quite right, Mr. Burdekin," said the Doctor: "quite right. I am sorry that any boy of mine
     should have caused you to do so. You are again beginning your career of disorder and rebellion,
     are you, sir? Go up into the schoolroom at once, and write a dozen copies before tea-time! A
     very little more eccentricity and insubordination from you, Bultitude, and you will reap a full
     reward—a full reward, sir!"
So Mr. Bultitude was driven out of the dancing class in dire disgrace—which would not have
     distressed him particularly, being only one more drop in his bitter cup—but that he recognised
     that now his hopes of approaching the Doctor with his burden of woe were fallen like a card
     castle. They were fiddled and danced away for at least twenty-four hours—perhaps for ever!
Bitterly did he brood over this as he slowly and laboriously copied out sundry vain
     repetitions of such axioms as, "Cultivate Habits of Courtesy and Self-control," and "True
     Happiness is to be sought in Contentment." He saw the prospect of a tolerably severe flogging
     growing more and more distinct, and felt that he could not present himself to his family with
     the consciousness of having suffered such an indelible
      disgrace. His family! What would become of them in his absence? Would he ever see
     his comfortable home in Bayswater again?
Tea-time came, and after it evening preparation, when Mr. Tinkler presided in a feeble and
     ineffective manner, perpetually suspecting that the faint sniggers he heard were indulged in at
     his own expense, and calling perfectly innocent victims to account for them.
Paul sat next to Jolland and, in his desperate anxiety to avoid further unpleasantness, found
     himself, as he could not for his life have written a Latin or a German composition, reduced to
     copy down his neighbour's exercises. This Jolland (who had looked forward to an arrangement of
     a very opposite kind) nevertheless cheerfully allowed him to do, though he expressed doubts as
     to the wisdom of a servile imitation—more, perhaps, from prudence than conscientiousness.
Jolland, in the intervals of study, was deeply engaged in the production of a small
     illustrated work of fiction, which he was pleased to call The Adventures of Ben Buterkin at
     Scool. It was in a great measure an autobiography, and the cuts depicting the hero's
     flagellations—which were frequent in the course of the narrative—were executed with much vigour
     and feeling.
He turned out a great number of these works in the course of the term, as well as faces in
     pen and ink with moving tongues and rolling eyes, and these he would present to a few favoured
     friends with a secretive and self-depreciatory giggle.
Amidst scenes and companions like these, Paul sat out the evening hours on his hard seat,
     which was just at the junction of two forms—an exquisitely uncomfortable position, as all who
     have tried it will acknowledge—until the time for going to bed came round again. He dreaded the
     hours of darkness, but there was no help for it—to protest would have been madness just then,
     and, once more, he was forced to pass a night under the roof of Crichton House.


It was even worse than the first, though this was greatly owing to his own obstinacy.
The boys, if less subdued, were in better temper than the evening before, and found it
     troublesome to keep up a feud when the first flush of resentment had died out. There was a
     general disposition to forget his departure from the code of schoolboy honour, and give him an
     opportunity of retrieving the past.
But he would not meet them half-way; his repeated repulses by the Doctor and all the
     difficulties that beset his return to freedom had made him very sulky and snappish. He had not
     patience or adaptability enough to respond to their advances, and only shrank from their rough
     good nature—which naturally checked the current of good feeling.
Then, when the lights were put out, some one demanded a story. Most of the bedrooms possessed
     a professional story-teller, and in one there was a young romancist who began a stirring
     history the very first night of the term, which always ran on until the night before the
     holidays, and, if his hearers were apt to yawn at the sixth week of it, he himself enjoyed and
     believed in it keenly from beginning to end.
Dick Bultitude had been a valued raconteur, it appeared, and his father found
     accordingly, to his disgust, that he was expected to amuse them with a story. When he clearly
     understood the idea, he rejected it with so savage a snarl, that he soon found it necessary to
     retire under the bedclothes to escape the general indignation that followed.
Finding that he did not actively resent it (the real Dick would have had the occupant of the
     nearest bed out by the ears in a minute!), they profited by his prudence to come to his
     bedside, where they pillowed his weary head (with their own pillows) till the slight offered
     them was more than avenged.
After that, Mr. Bultitude, with the breath half beaten out of his body, lay writhing and
     spluttering on
      his hard, rough bed till long after silence had fallen over the adjoining beds,
     and the sleepy hum of talk in the other bedrooms had died away.
Then he, too, drifted off into wild and troubled dreams, which, at their maddest, were
     scattered into blankness by a sudden and violent shock, which jerked him, clutching and
     grasping at nothing, on to the cold, bare boards, where he rolled, shivering.
"An earthquake!" he thought, "an explosion ... gas—or dynamite! He must go and call the
     children ... Boaler ... the plate!"
But the reality to which he woke was worse still. Tipping and Coker had been patiently
     pinching themselves to keep awake until their enemy should be soundly asleep, in order to enjoy
     the exquisite pleasure of letting down the mattress; and, too dazed and frightened even to
     swear, Paul gathered up his bedclothes and tried to draw them about him as well as he might,
     and seek sleep, which had lost its security.
The Garudâ Stone had done one grim and cruel piece of work at least in its time.
