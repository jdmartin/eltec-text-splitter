CHAPTER VII.
SHE was his absolute slave; and he used his influence with little scruple. Whatever
      he told her she believed: whatever he desired, she obeyed.
With little effort Arslàn persuaded her that to lend her beauty to the purpose of his art
      was a sacrifice pure and supreme; repaid, it might be, with immortality, like the immortality
      of the Mona Lisa. It was ever painful and even loathsome to her to give her beauty to the
      merciless imitations of art; it stung the dignity and purity that were inborn in the daughter
      of an outlawed people; it wounded, and hurt, and humiliated her. She knew that these things
      were only done that one day the eyes of thousands and of tens of thousands might gaze on them;
      and the knowledge was hateful to her. But as she would have hewn wood or carried water for
      him, as she would have denied her lips the least morsel of bread that his might have fed
      thereon, as she would have gone straight to the river’s edge at his bidding, and have stood
      still for the stream to swell and the floods to cover her, so she obeyed him, and let him make
      of her what he would.
He painted or sketched her in nearly every attitude, and rendered her the centre of
      innumerable stories.
He placed her form in the crowd of dancing‐women that followed after Barabbas. He took her
      for Persephone, as for Phryne. He couched her on the bleak rocks and the sea‐sands of barren
      Tenedos. He made her beauty burn through the purple passion vines and the roses of silence of
      the Venusberg. He pourtrayed her as Daphne, with all her soft human form changing and merging
      into the bitter roots and the poisonous leaves of the laurel that was the fruit of love. He
      drew her as Læna, whose venal lips yet, being purified by a perfect love, were sealed mute
      unto death, and for love’s sake spake not.
He sketched her in a hundred shapes and for a hundred
       stories, taking her wild deer‐like grace, and her supple
      mountain‐bred strength, and her beauty that had all the richness and the freshness that sun
      and wind and rain and the dews of the nights can give, taking these as he in other years had
      taken the bloom of the grape, the blush of the sea‐shell, the red glow of the desert reed, the
      fleeting glory of anything that, by its life or by its death, would minister to his dreams or
      his desires.
Of all the studies he made from her—he all the while cold to her as any priest of old to the
      bird that he seethed in its blood on his altars of sacrifice,—those which were slightest of
      all, yet of all pleased him best, were two twin studies which were fullest of that ruthless
      and unsparing irony with which in every stroke of his pencil he cut as with a knife into the
      humanity he dissected.
In the first, he painted her in all the warm, dreaming, palpitating slumber of youth, asleep
      in a field of poppies: thousands of the brilliant blossoms were crushed under her slender,
      pliant, folded limbs; the intense scarlet of the flowers burned everywhere, above, beneath,
      around her; purple shadow and amber light contended for the mastery upon her; her arms were
      lightly tossed above her head; her mouth smiled in her dreams; over her a butterfly flew,
      spreading golden wings to the sun; against her breast the great crimson cups of the flowers of
      sleep curled and glowed; amongst them, hiding and gibbering and glaring at her with elfin
      eyes, was the Red Mouse of the Brocken—the one touch of pitiless irony, of unsparing cynicism,
      that stole like a snake through the hush and the harmony and the innocence of repose.
In the second there was still the same attitude, the same solitude, the same rest, but the
      sleep was the sleep of death.
Stretched on a block of white marble, there were the same limbs, but livid and lifeless, and
      twisted in the contortions of a last agony: there was the same loveliness, but on it the hues
      of corruption had already stolen; the face was still turned upward, but the blank eyes stared
      hideously, and the mouth was drawn back from teeth closely clenched; upon the stone there lay
      a surgeon’s knife and a sculptor’s scalpel; between her lips the Red Mouse sat, watching,
      mouthing, triumphant.
All the beauty was left still, but it was left ghastly, dis‐
       coloured, ruined,—ready for the mockery of the clay, for
      the violation of the knife,—ready for the feast of the blind‐worm, for the narrow home dug in
      darkness and in dust.
And these two pictures were so alike and yet so unlike, so true to all the glory of youth,
      so true to all the ghastliness of death, that they were terrible; they were terrible even to
      the man who drew them with so unsparing and unfaltering a hand.
Only to her they were not terrible, because they showed his power, because they were his
      will and work. She had no share in the shudder, which even he felt, at that visible
      presentment of corruption to which her beauty in its human perfection was destined: since it
      pleasured him to do it, that was all she cared.
She would have given her beauty to the scourge of the populace, or to the fish of the sea,
      at his bidding. She had not asked him even what the Red Mouse meant.
She was content that he should deal with her in all things as he would. That such
      pourtrayals of her were cruel she never once thought: to her all others had been so brutal
      that the cruelties of Arslàn seemed soft as the south wind.
To be for one instant a thing in the least wished for and endeared was to her a miracle so
      wonderful, and so undreamt of, that it made her life sublime to her.
“Is that all the devil has done for you?” cried the gardener’s wife from the vine‐hung
      lattice, leaning out while the boat from Yprès went down the water‐street beneath.
“It was scarcely worth while to be his offspring if he deal you no better gifts than that.
      He is as niggard as the saints are—the little mean beasts. Do you know that the man who paints
      you brings death they say—sooner or later—to every creature that lives again for him in his
      art?”
Folle‐Farine, beneath the dense brown shadows cast from the timbers of the leaning houses,
      raised her eyes; the eyes smiled, and yet they had a look in them that chilled even the
      mocking, careless wanton temper of the woman who leaned above amongst the roses.
“I have heard it,” she said, simply, as her oar broke the shadows.

“And you have no fear?”
“I have no fear.”
The gardener’s wife laughed aloud, the silver pins shaking in her yellow tresses.
“Well—the devil gives strength, no doubt. But I will not say much for the devil’s wage. A
      fine office he set you—his daughter—to lend yourself to a painter’s eyes like any wanton that
      he could hire in the market‐place for a drink of wine. If the devil do no better than that for
      you—his own begotten,—I will cleave close to the saints and the angels henceforth, though they
      do take all the gems and the gold and the lace for their altars, and bestow so little in
      answer.”
The boat had passed on with slow and even measure; no words of derision which they could
      cast at her had power to move her any more than the fret of the ruffling rooks had power to
      move the cathedral spires around which they beat with their wings the empty air.
The old dull, grey routine of perpetual toil was illumined and enriched. If any reviled her,
      she heard not. If any flung a stone at her, she caught it and dropped it on the grass, and
      went on with a glance of pardon. When the rude children ran after her footsteps bawling and
      mouthing, she turned and looked at them with a dreaming tenderness in her eyes that rebuked
      them and held them silenced and afraid. Now, she hated none; nor could she envy any. The women
      were welcome to their little joys of hearth and home; they were welcome to look for their
      lovers across the fields with smiling eyes shaded from the sun, or to beckon their infants
      from the dusky orchards to murmur fond foolish words and stroke the curls of flaxen down,—she
      begrudged them nothing: she, too, had her portion and her treasure.
Base usage cannot make base a creature that gives itself nobly, purely, with unutterable and
      exhaustless love; and whilst the people in the country round muttered at her for her vileness
      and disgrace, she, all unwitting and made proud, raised high above the reach of taunt and
      censure by a deep and speechless joy that rendered hunger, and labour, and pain, and brutal
      tasks, and jibing glances indifferent to her—nay, unfelt—went on her daily ways with a light
      richer than the light of the sun in her eyes, and in her step the
       noble freedom of one who has broken from bondage and
      entered into a heritage of grace.
She was proud as with the pride of one selected for some great dignity; graced with the
      grace that a supreme devotion and a supreme ignorance made possible to her. He was as a god to
      her; and she had found favour in his sight. Although by all others despised, to him she was
      beautiful; a thing to be desired, not abhorred; a creature not cursed for daring to have a
      breath of mortal life, but thought worthy of life eternal amidst the deathless children of his
      genius. It seemed to her so wonderful that, night and day, in her heart she praised God for
      it—that dim unknown God of whom no man had taught her, but whom she had vaguely grown to dream
      of and to honour, and to behold in the setting of the sun, and in the flux of the sea, and in
      the mysteries of the starlit skies.
Of shame to her in it she had no thought: a passion strong as fire in its force, pure as
      crystal in its unselfishness, possessed her for him, and laid her at his feet to be done with
      as he would.
She would have crouched to him like a dog; she would have worked for him like a slave; she
      would have killed herself if he had bidden her without a word of resistance or a moan of
      regret. To be touched by him one moment as his hand moved some wave of her hair or some fold
      of her drapery, as he studied an outline or changed an attitude, was to her the greatest glory
      life could know. To be a pleasure to him for one hour, to see his eyes tell her once, however
      carelessly or coldly, that she had any beauty fit for his pourtrayal, was to her the noblest
      fate that could befall her.
To him she was no more than the cluster of grapes to the wayfarer, who brushes their bloom
      off and steals their sweetness, then casts them down to be trampled on, by whosoever the next
      comer be. But to this creature, who had no guide except her instincts of passion and
      sacrifice, who had no guard except the pure scorn that had kept her from the meanness and
      coarseness of the vices around her, this was unintelligible, unsuspected; and if she had
      understood it, she would have accepted it mutely, in that abject humility which had bent the
      dauntless temper in her to his will.
To be of use to him,—to be held of any worth to him,—
       to have his eyes find any loveliness to study in her,—to be
      to him only as the flower which he broke from the stem to copy its bloom on his canvas, and
      then cast out on the sand to wither as it would,—this, even this, seemed to her the highest
      fate to which she could have had election.
That he only borrowed the colour of her cheek and the outline of her limbs, as he had
      borrowed a thousand times ere then the venal charms of the dancing‐women of taverns and
      play‐houses, and the hireling graces of the wanton who strayed in the public ways, was a
      knowledge that never touched her with its indignity. To her his art was a religion, supreme,
      passionless, eternal, whose sacrificial fires ennobled and consecrated all that they
      consumed.
“Though I shall die as the leaf dies in my body, yet I shall live for ever embalmed amidst
      the beauty of his thoughts,” she told herself perpetually, and all her life became
      transfigured.
