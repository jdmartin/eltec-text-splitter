CHAPTER III.
ALL night long he was absent.
The old serving woman, terrified in so far as her dull brutish nature could be roused to
      fear, did what she knew, what she dared. She raised the little wounded naked creature, and
      carried her to her own pallet bed; restored her to consciousness by such rude means as she had
      knowledge of, and staunched the flow of blood.
She did all this harshly, as it was her custom to do all things, and without tenderness or
      even pity, for the sight of this stranger was unwelcome to her, and she also had guessed the
      message of that unread letter.
The child had been stunned by the blow, and she had lost some blood, and was weakened and
      stupefied and dazed; yet there seemed to her rough nurse no peril for her life, and by degrees
      she fell into a feverish, tossing slumber, sobbing sometimes in her sleep, and crying
      perpetually on the unknown name of Phratos.
The old woman Pitchou stood and looked at her. She, who had always known the true story of
      the disappearance which some had called death and some had deemed a divine interposition, had
      seen before that transparent brown skin, those hues in cheeks and lips like the carnation
      leaves, that rich, sun‐fed, dusky beauty, those straight dark brows.
“She is his sure enough,” she muttered. “He was the first with Reine Flamma. I wonder has he
      been the last.”
And she went down the stairs chuckling, as the low human brute will at any evil thought.
The mastiff stayed beside the child.
She went to the fire and threw more wood one, and sat down again to her spinning‐wheel, and
      span and dozed, and span and dozed again.
She was not curious: to her, possessing that thread to the secret of the past, which her
      master and her townsfolk had never held, it all seemed natural. It was an old, old story;
      there had been thousands like it; it was only strange because Reine Flamma had been held a
      saint.

The hours passed on; the lamp paled, and its flame at last died out; in the loft above,
      where the dog watched, there was no sound; the old woman slumbered undisturbed, unless some
      falling ember of the wood aroused her.
She was not curious, nor did she care how the child fared. She had led that deadening life
      of perpetual labour and of perpetual want in which the human animal becomes either a machine
      or a devil. She was a machine; put to what use she might be—to spin flax, to card wool, to
      wring a pigeon’s throat, to bleed a calf to death, to bake or stew, to mumble a prayer or
      drown a kitten, it was all one to her. If she had a preference it might be for the office that
      hurt some living thing; but she did not care; all she heeded was whether she had pottage
      enough to eat at noonday, and the leaden effigy of her Mary safe round her throat at
      night.
The night went on, and passed away; one gleam of dawn shone through a round hole in the
      shutter; she wakened with a start to find the sun arisen, and the fire dead upon the
      hearth.
She shook herself and stamped her chill feet upon the bricks, and tottered on her feeble
      way, with frozen body, to the house door. She drew it slowly open, and saw by the light of the
      sun that it had been for some time morning.
The earth was everywhere thick with snow; a hoar frost sparkled over all the branches; great
      sheets of ice were whirled down the rapid mill‐stream; in one of the leafless boughs a robin
      sang, and beneath the bough a cat was crouched, waiting with hungry eager eyes, patient even
      in its famished impatience.
Dull as her sympathy was, and slow her mind, she started as she saw her master there.
Claudis Flamma was at work; the rough, hard, rude toil which he spared to himself no more
      than to those who were his hirelings. He was carting wood; going to and fro with huge limbs of
      trees that men in youth would have found it a severe task to move; he was labouring
      breathlessly, giving himself no pause, and the sweat was on his brow, although he trod ankle
      deep in snow, and although his clothes were heavy with icicles.
He did not see or hear her; she went up to him and
       called him by name; he started, and raised his head and
      looked at her.
Dull though she was, she was in a manner frightened by the change upon his face; it had been
      lean, furrowed, weather‐beaten always, but it was livid now, with bloodshot eyes, and a
      bruised, broken, yet withal savage look that terrified her. He did not speak, but gazed at her
      like a man recalled from some drugged sleep back to the deeds and memories of the living
      world.
The old woman held her peace a few moments; then spoke out in her own blunt, dogged
      fashion.
“Is she to stay?”
Her mind was not awake enough for any curiosity; she only cared to know if the child stayed:
      only so much as would concern her soup kettle, her kneaded dough, her spun hemp, her household
      labour.
He turned for a second with the gesture that a trapped fox may make, held fast, yet striving
      to essay a death grip; then he checked himself, and gave a mute sign of assent, and heaved up
      a fresh log of wood, and went on with his labours, silently. She knew of old his ways too well
      to venture to ask more. She knew, too, that when he worked like this, fasting and in silence,
      there had been long and fierce warfare in his soul, and some great evil done for which he
      sought to make atonement.
So she left him, and passed in to the house, and built up afresh her fire, and swept her
      chamber out, and fastened up her round black pot to boil, and muttered all the while,—
“Another mouth to feed; another breast to tend.”
And the thing was bitter to her; because it gave trouble and took food.
Now, what the letter had been, or who had deciphered it for him, Claudis Flamma never told
      to any man; and from the little strange creature no utterance could be ever got.
But the child who had come in the night and the snow tarried at Yprès from that
      time thenceforward.
Claudis Flamma nourished, sheltered, clothed her; but he did all these begrudgingly,
      harshly, scantily; and he did all these with an acrid hate and scorn, which did not cease, but
      rather grew with time.
The blow which had been her earliest welcome was not the first that she received from him by
      many; and whilst
       she was miserable exceedingly, she showed it, not as
      children do, but rather like some chained and untamed animal, in fearless stupor and in
      sudden, sharp ferocity. And this the more because she spoke but a very few words of the
      language of the people amongst whom she had been brought; her own tongue was one full of round
      vowels and strange sounds, a tongue unknown to them.
For many weeks he said not one word to her, cast not one look at her; he let her lead the
      same life that was led by the beetles that crawled in the timbers, or by the pigs that couched
      and were kicked in the straw. The woman Pitchou gave her such poor scraps of garments or of
      victuals as she chose; she could crouch in the corner of the hearth where the fire warmth
      reached; she could sleep in the hay in the little loft under the roof; so much she could do
      and no more.
After that first moment in which her vague appeal for pity and for rest had been answered by
      the blow that struck her senseless, the child had never made a moan, nor sought for any
      solace.
All the winter through she lay curled up on the tiles by the fence, with her arms round the
      great body of the dog and his head upon her chest; they were both starved, beaten, kicked, and
      scourged, with brutal words oftentimes; they had the community of misfortune, and they loved
      one another.
The blow on her head, the coldness of the season, the scanty food that was cast to her, all
      united to keep her brain stupefied and her body almost motionless. She was like a young bear
      that is motherless, wounded, frozen, famished, but which, coiled in an almost continual
      slumber, keeps its blood flowing and its limbs alive. And, like the bear, with the spring she
      awakened.
When the townsfolk and the peasants came to the mill, and first saw this creature there,
      with her wondrous vivid hues, and her bronzed half‐naked limbs, they regarded her in
      amazement, and asked the miller whence she came. He set his teeth, and answered ever:
“The woman that bore her was Reine Flamma.”
The avowal was a penance set to himself, but to it he never added more; and they feared his
      bitter temper and his caustic tongue too greatly to press it on him, or even to
       ask him whether his daughter were with the living or the
      dead.
With the unfolding of the young leaves, and the loosening of the frost‐bound waters, and the
      unveiling of the violet and the primrose under the shadows of the wood, all budding life
      revives, and so did hers. For she could escape from the dead, cold, bitter atmosphere of the
      silent and loveless house, where her bread was begrudged, and the cudgel was her teacher, out
      into the freshness and the living sunshine of the young blossoming world, where the birds and
      the beasts and the tender blue flowers and the curling green boughs were her comrades, and
      where she could stretch her limbs in freedom, and coil herself among the branches, and steep
      her limbs in the coolness of waters, and bathe her aching feet in the moisture of rain‐filled
      grasses.
With the spring she arose, the true forest animal she was; wild, fleet, incapable of fear,
      sure of foot, in unison with all the things of the earth and air, and stirred by them to a
      strange, dumb, ignorant, passionate gladness.
She had been scarce seen in the winter; with the breaking of the year the people from more
      distant places, who rode their mules down to mill on their various errands, stared at this
      child and wondered amongst themselves greatly, and at length asked Claudis Flamma whence she
      came.
He answered ever, setting hard his teeth:
“The woman that bore her was one accursed, whom men deemed a saint—Reine Flamma.”
They dared not ask him more; for many were his debtors.
But when they went away, and gossiped amongst themselves by the wayside well or under the
      awnings of the market stalls, they said to one another that it was just as they had thought
      long ago; the creature had been no better than her kind; and they had never credited the fable
      that God had taken her, though they had humoured the miller because he was aged and in his
      dotage. Whilst one old woman, a withered and witch‐like crone, who had toiled in from the
      fishing village with a kreel upon her back and the smell of the sea about her rags, heard,
      standing in the market‐place, and laughed, and mocked them, these seers
       who were so wise after the years had gone, and when the
      truth was clear.
“You knew, you knew, you knew!” she echoed, with a grin upon her face. “Oh yes! you were so
      wise! Who, seven years through, said that Reine Flamma was a saint, and taken by the saints
      into their keeping? And who hissed at me for a foul‐mouthed crone when I said that the devil
      had more to do with her than the good God, and that the black‐browed gipsy, with jewels for
      eyes in his head, like the toad, was the only master to whom she gave herself? Oh‐hè, you were
      so wise!”
She mocked them, and they were ashamed, and held their peace; well knowing that indeed no
      creature amongst them had ever been esteemed so pure, so chaste, and so honoured of heaven as
      had been the miller’s daughter.
Many remembered the “gipsy with the jewelled eyes,” and was those brilliant, fathomless,
      midnight eyes reproduced in the small rich face of the child whom Reine Flamma, as her own
      father said, had borne in shame whist they had been glorifying her apotheosis. And it came to
      be said, as time went on, that this unknown stranger had been the fiend himself, taking human
      shape for the destruction of one pure soul, and the confusion of all true children of the
      church.
Legend and tradition still held fast their minds in this remote, ancient, and priest‐ridden
      place; in their belief the devil was still a living power, traversing the earth and air in
      search of souls, and not seldom triumphing: of metaphor or myth they were not ignorant; Satan
      to them was a personality, terrific, and oftentimes irresistible, assuming at will shapes
      grotesque or awful, human or spiritual. Their forefathers had beheld him; why not they?
So the henhucksters and poulterers, the cider makers and tanners, the fisherfolk from the
      sea‐board, and the peasant proprietors from the country round, came at length in all
      seriousness to regard the young child at Yprès as a devil‐born thing. “She was
      hell‐begotten,” they would mutter, when they saw her; and they would cross themselves, and
      avoid her if they could.
The time had gone by, unhappily, as they considered, when men had been permitted to burn
      such creatures as this; they knew it and were sorry for it; the world, they
       thought, had been better when Jews had blazed like torches,
      and witches had crackled like firewood; such treats were forbidden now, they knew, but many,
      for all that, thought within themselves that it was a pity it should be so, and that it was
      mistaken mercy in the age they lived in which forbade the purifying of the earth by fire of
      such as she.
In the winter time, when they first saw her, unusual floods swept the country, and destroyed
      much of their property; in the spring which followed there were mildew and sickness
      everywhere: in the summer there was a long drought, and by consequence there came a bad
      harvest, and great suffering and scarcity.
There were not a few in the district who attributed all these woes to the advent of the
      child of darkness, and who murmured openly in their huts and homesteads that no good would
      befall them so long as this offspring of hell were suffered in their midst.
Since, however, the time was past when the broad market‐place could have been filled with a
      curious, breathless, eager crowd, and the grey cathedral have grown red in the glare of flames
      fed by a young living body, they held their hands from doing her harm, and said these things
      only in their own ingle‐nooks, and contented themselves with forbidding their children to
      consort with her, and with drawing their mules to the other side of the road when they met
      her. They did not mean to be cruel; they only acted in their own self‐defence, and dealt with
      her as their fellow‐countrymen dealt with a cagote—“only.”
Hence, when, with the reviving year the child’s dulled brain awakened, and all the animal
      activity in her sprang into vigorous action, she found herself shunned, marked, and glanced at
      with averted looks of mingled dread and scorn. “A daughter of the devil!” she heard again and
      again muttered as they passed her; she grew to take shelter in this repute as in a fortress,
      and to be proud, with a savage pride, of her imputed origin.
It made her a little fierce, mute, fearless, reckless, all‐daring, and all enduring animal.
      An animal in her ferocities, her mute instincts, her supreme patience, her physical
      perfectness of body and of health. Perfect of shape and hue; full of force to resist; ignorant
      either of hope or fear; de‐
       siring only one thing, liberty; with no knowledge, but with
      unerring instinct.
She was at an age when happier creatures have scarce escaped from their mother’s arms; but
      she had not even thus early a memory of her mother, and she had been shaken off to live or
      die, to fight or famish, as a young fox whose dam has been flung to the hounds is driven away
      to starve in the winter woods, or save himself, if he have strength, by slaughter.
She was a tame animal only in one thing:—she took blows uncomplainingly, and as though
      comprehending that they were her inevitable portion.
“The child of the devil!” they said. In a dumb, half unconscious fashion, this five‐year‐old
      creature wondered sometimes why the devil had not been good enough to give her a skin that
      would not feel, and veins that would not bleed.
She had always been beaten ever since her birth; she was beaten here; she thought it a law
      of life, as other children think it such to have their mother’s kiss and their daily food and
      nightly prayer.
Claudis Flamma did after his manner his duty by her. She was to him a thing accursed,
      possessed, loathsome, imbued with evil from her origin; but he did what he deemed his duty. He
      clothe her, if scantily; he fed her, if meagrely; he lashed her with all the caustic gibes
      that came naturally to his tongue; he set her hard tasks to keep her from idleness; he beat
      her when she did not, and not seldom when she did, them. He dashed holy water on her many
      times; and used a stick to her without mercy.
After this light he did his duty. That he should hate her, was to fulfil a duty also in his
      eyes; he had always been told that it was right to abhor the things of darkness; and to him
      she was a thing of utter darkness, a thing born of the black ruin of a stainless soul,
      begotten by the pollution and corruption of an infernal tempter.
He never questioned her as to her past—that short past, like the span of an insect’s life,
      which yet had sufficed to gift her with passions, with instincts, with desires, even with
      memories,—in a word, with character:—a character he could neither change nor break; a thing
      formed already, for good or for evil, abidingly.

He never spoke to her except in sharp irony or in curt command. He set her hard tasks of
      bodily labour which she did not dispute, but accomplished so far as her small strength lay,
      with a mute dogged patience, half ferocity, half passiveness.
In those first winter days of her arrival he called her Folle‐Farine; taking the most
      worthless, the most useless, the most abject, the most despised thing he knew in all his daily
      life from which to name her; and the name adhered to her, and was the only one by which she
      was ever known.
Folle‐Farine!—as one may say, the Dust.
In time she grew to believe that it was really hers; even as in time she began to forget
      that strange, deep, rich tongue in which she had babbled her first words, and to know no other
      tongue than the Norman‐French about her.
Yet in her there existed imagination, tenderness, gratitude, and a certain wild and true
      nobility, though the old man Flamma would never have looked for them, never have believed in
      them. She was devil born: she was of devil nature in his eyes.
Upon his mill‐ditch, foul and fœtid, refuse would sometimes gather, and receiving the seed
      of the lily, would give birth to blossoms born stainless out of corruption: but the allegory
      had no meaning for him. Had any one pointed it out to him he would have taken the speaker into
      his orchard, and said:
“Will the crab bear a fruit not bitter? Will the nightshade give out sweetness and honey?
      Fool!—as the stem so the branch, as the sap so the blossom.”
And this fruit of sin and shame was poison in his sight.
