CHAPTER VI.
HAMLIN sat for some time in the dusty attic called a studio, while Perry cut
      acrobats and devils out of black paper, and stuck them on the dirty window‐panes.
“That’s my vocation,” said Perry, “and not painting damned landscape spinach and soapsud
      seas. Look! aren’t they jolly old fiends?” and he held up a group of black clowns, standing on
      each other’s hands and shoulders.
“Capital!” answered Hamlin. “But look here; I came to tell you something. I want the address
      of Miss Brown’s guardian,—you told me there was one,—because I am going to have Miss Brown
      educated, with a view, if she do not change her mind, to her becoming my wife.”
Perry let his scissors fall on the floor.

“Damnation!” he cried.
Hamlin picked up the scissors and put them quietly on the table.
“So that’s it!” burst out Perry. “While I was bothering my brains with trying to take care
      of Anne, you were being inveigled by that cursed hypocritical slut.”
“I shall be obliged to you to speak in rather different language, Perry,” said Hamlin, in a
      tone of voice and with a manner which his friend was not accustomed to.
“Oh, beast! brute! seven‐times‐distilled and most‐kickable jackass that I have been,” moaned
      Perry, “that I should have let this happen to you!—that I should have let you be entrapped
      under my very nose! But it mustn’t be, old fellow; I won’t stand it.”
“You will have to,” answered Hamlin, contemptuously; “and so, let’s say no more about it.
      Only one word: Miss Brown has not inveigled me.”
Perry gave a sort of moan of disgust. “No woman ever does inveigle a man!”

“Miss Brown has not inveigled me. I conceived the desire of educating her, and giving myself
      a chance of marrying her if she would have me, long ago, before I returned to Florence. And,
      as a favour, I beg you will respect Miss Brown so long as she remains in your house, as you
      would respect the woman who is at present my ward, and may possibly become my wife.”
“Ward! wife! fiddlesticks!” cried Perry. “For God’s sake, my dearest old Watty, don’t go and
      do such a damnable thing! don’t be such an idiot as to suppose you must do it. That was my
      confounded folly: let myself be led on, and then thought it was my own choice, my resolution,
      all sorts of fine things. No man ever really wants to tie himself up; it’s the woman who does
      it, and makes him believe it’s himself. All this is bosh, mere bosh; you’ll think better of
      it.”
“I tell you again, Perry, that there is no inveigling about the matter. I made up my mind to
      this step while I was away from
       Florence. Besides, I am not going to marry Miss Brown
      straight off; I am going to give her the education which such a woman deserves, to enable her
      to marry me should she care to do so.”
“Education, forsooth!” groaned Perry; “you will get yourself married before you have time to
      say Jack Robinson: and to think that I have brought it all upon you! to think that I have
      driven you to do it!”
Hamlin could not help smiling at his friend’s distress.
“Really, you need not feel under any responsibility. I alone am responsible in the
      business—I and good fortune, which has brought me into the presence of the most marvelIous
      woman that ever was—”
“But what do you do it for? You’re not in love with Annie, I do believe,” cried poor
      Perry.
“I do it because she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen,” answered Hamlin,
      deliberately; “and the woman who, properly
       educated, is of all others the one whom I should most wish
      to love—because, in short, I cannot see her wasted.”
Perry flung his arms over his head with a gesture of grotesque despair. At that moment the
      door opened, and Mrs Perry entered the studio.
“What is the matter? what has happened?” she asked with a dramatic gesture, and a not less
      dramatic accent; and she remained standing on the threshold, raising the door‐curtain with
      much dignity.
“Hamlin wants to bring up and marry Anne Brown,” yelled Perry.
Mrs Perry tottered, let the curtain go, held her hand to her head for a moment.
“Anne Brown—do you hear that? He wants to marry her! to educate her! He has already
      proposed!” repeated Perry.
Mrs Perry came forward solemnly, and stretched out her hand to Hamlin.
“Dear friend,” she said softly, “my heart told me that this would be.”

“Fudge!” exclaimed Perry; “if it did, why the deuce didn’t you interfere?”
“My heart told me this would be. I congratulate you, dearest friend, that you have at last
      found the embodiment of your mysterious dreams of beauty. And I thank you, on my part, for
      giving me the happiness of seeing that glorious dethroned goddess reinstated in her rights,
      and also,”—and Mrs Perry’s long mouth smiled—formidable like an alligator’s,—“for giving me
      the happiness of witnessing a union of mystic perfection;” whereupon, to Hamlin’s horror, the
      tall and bony lady deposited a damp kiss on his forehead.
“Oh—but—thank you so much!” exclaimed Hamlin—“I have not asked Miss Brown to marry me; I
      have only asked her to let me educate her. I wish her to choose whatever husband may deserve
      her.”
“And that will be yourself—your noble, darling self,” beamed Mrs Perry.
“I am happy that you approve of my decision,” said Hamlin, quickly; “and since you
       do, will you kindly tell me the address of Miss
      Brown’s—Miss Brown’s guardian?”
“Julia, I forbid you,” moaned Perry feebly.
“His address”—answered Mrs Perry blandly, and taking no notice of her husband—“is Richard
      Brown, care of Gillespie Brothers, New Cross. He is foreman at a cannon‐foundry, or a place
      where they make torpedoes. I know it’s something murderous and dreadful.”
“Richard Brown, Gillespie Brothers, New Cross,” wrote Hamlin in his note‐book. “Thank you so
      much; I shall write to him at once.”
“Oh, idiotic beast that I was!” groaned Perry, “to think that it should all be my
      fault.”
“Come into my boudoir,” said Mrs Perry; “you shall write to him without a moment’s delay.
      Denrest Mr Hamlin, it is so noble, so lovely on your part; and dear Anne—how beautiful she
      will become!”
Perry paced up and down the room in violent despair, kicking at all the chairs and easels on
      his way, and hurling a tin of black
       paint against the ceiling, whence, having deposited its
      oozy contents, it slowly descended. After this, feeling that his despair was not yet vented,
      he stalked off to the German beer‐cellar, in the Via Lambertesca, and gloomily consumed a
       bock—a proceeding to which he invariably resorted whenever
      his wife had inspired him with a more than usually strong wish to drown himself.
Suddenly an idea struck him, and he rushed to the nearest telegraph‐office. There he spent
      upwards of an hour, and consumed many pieces of paper in concocting a missive which should,
      within the compass of twenty words, convey to Mr Richard Brown, care of Gillespie Brothers,
      New Cross, that the proposal being made to Anne Brown by a certain person must be immediately
      rejected, as its acceptance would bring ruin, dishonour, and misery on all parties. “Proposal
      disastrous snare,” wound up Perry at last in triumph; and then discovered that, in his zeal
      for Hamlin’s good,
       he had expressed disapprobation to the extent of exactly
      twenty francs of Italian money.
“Nothing but pipes—loathsome, smelly, filthy pipes; never a cigar—for the next two months,”
      meditated Perry, as he paid his money and received the clerk’s receipt; “but a fellow must
      save his friend after all.”
