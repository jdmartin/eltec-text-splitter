CHAPTER I.
IT was raining when they arrived in London—a warmish, brown, clammy autumn day. The
      streets were a porridge of liquid mud, whose trail dragged along the wet asphalt; the houses
      were staring forth, a livid dirt‐grey, in the thin rain; and the sky, the very rain, was
      befouled with grime. Only drays splashed through the mud, and carriages carrying
      hurried‐looking people; children, still in their tattered summer cottons and battered straw
      hats, stared in at the shops, the broad sheen from whose brilliant windows was caught up by
      the wet pavement, and lingered out, in broken reflections, in the brown ooze of the
      thoroughfare. Along the deserted suburban streets every second house seemed to be a
       gin‐palace, with shining coloured globes, and stucco
      pinnacles soaked with rain, and ground‐glass windows shining out like a leprosy of white. Mrs
      Macgregor closed her eyes in disgust. Even the maid looked depressed. But Anne stared out of
      the window of the carriage at all the hideous soppy sordidness, which seemed to soil and soak
      black into one’s mind; and she felt glad. All this was reality: it was the world in which lay
      her redemption, and the redemption of Hamlin.
Anne found Hamlin full of his cousin Sacha, upon whom he had already called three times, and
      in whom, to his surprise, he had found not a trace of the child whom he had hated; but a
      respectable, unworldly young mother, devoted to her children, timid, and only deserving a
      little sympathy.
“She is a very curious woman,” he said, “evidently excellent at bottom; but I don’t know
      whether I quite like her. She has something very strange about her,—handsome; and at the same
      time—I don’t know exactly
       what it is—charming, but not quite reassuring. I am so
      anxious for you to see her.”
“I am so awfully glad she’s nice,” exclaimed Anne. “Do you know, she weighed upon me like a
      nightmare after all Aunt Claudia had said. It seemed too horrible that such a creature should
      exist; and I felt sure it was all prejudice against the poor little thing.”
“Don’t be in such a hurry,” laughed Hamlin; “perhaps you won’t like her after all. There is
      something uncanny about her, decidedly.”
“I’m sure that’s all your imagination. You’re always thinking that things are uncanny: it
      comes of writing too much about proud, pale, evil women, and that sort of nonsense.”
Anne felt really glad. That the terrible Cousin Sacha, the fiend‐child of Wotton Hall,
      should turn out a respectable, unworldly young woman, devoted to her children, seemed to her
      like the first breaking of the spell which hung over Hamlin. She felt no jealousy of Cousin
      Sacha; for, as Hamlin spoke of Madame Elaguine, it was obvious that if he was anxious to
       show her to Anne, he was equally impatient to display his
      beautiful ward to her, who had evidently been told a great deal about her already.
The next day Madame Elaguine was to call on Anne. Mrs Macgregor took the announcement in a
      spirit of sombre defiance. “She may come,” she said, “but I will not see her. What o’clock is
      the creature coming?”
“Four,” answered Hamlin.
“Very well; then I’ll order the brougham for half‐past three, and go and make some calls.
      Anne may stay behind if she likes.”
Accordingly, at half‐past three, Mrs Macgregor rolled off in the brougham to Mrs
      Argiropoulo’s, and to various other people whom she declared she hated. At four o’clock Hamlin
      came up‐stairs from his studio, and Anne gave him some tea. “She will be here in a minute,” he
      said.
There was a noise of wheels; Anne felt her hand tremble as she poured out a second cup for
      Hamlin.
“There! I’ve gone and spilt it on your cuff!
       Isn’t it idiotic of me to feel flurried about seeing your
      cousin?”
But the wheels passed on. More wheels, which also passed; rings and knocks; but no Madame
      Elaguine. Hamlin, at every false alarm, got up and looked at Anne—a long, admiring look at her
      stately figure and her strange pale face, with the overhanging masses of crimp black hair; at
      the splendid postures, of which only Michelangelo seemed to have ever understood the
      magnificent weary weightiness into which she naturally fell.
“She is evidently not coming,” he said with some irritation, as the clock struck five; “it’s
      too bad, keeping one in for nothing, like this!”
“I didn’t want to go out with Aunt Claudia; and I don’t see how you could have gone on
      painting after dark.”
“Still it is too annoying.”
“I daresay it’s not so easy to go paying visits at Hammersmith when one has children to
      attend to.”

“Bother the children! she might leave them to a nurse.”
At that moment a cab stopped, and there came a knock.
“That’s she!” cried Hamlin, and he ran down‐stairs.
Madame Elaguine entered; in the dusk Anne could scarcely see her face: she was rather below
      the average height, but so slender that she looked tall; there was something very shy about
      her, and Anne could understand her shyness.
“I am so glad you have come,” she said; “we had almost given you up.”
“I fear I am very late—perhaps in your way,” said Madame Elaguine; “the fact is, I had to
      take my little girl to choose a doll, and she took nearly an hour about it,” and she laughed a
      little shy laugh. She had a beautiful voice, high and silvery, and yet warm and caressing,
      like a child’s, which inevitably made you think of delicate green leaves, and fields whitened
      with budding clover, and all sorts of young and tender things. She
       was very thin, almost emaciated, and with a slight droop of
      the head: it was too dark for Anne to see her features distinctly, but she seemed pretty, and
      frail, and wasted. There was something in that childish voice which touched Anne; her strong,
      rebellious disbelief in the horrible Sacha of Mrs Macgregor came indignantly to her.
“It is very good of you to let me come and see you,” said Madame Elaguine, after some
      trifling conversation, “and very good of my cousin to propose it; because,” and her voice, in
      a sudden outburst of frankness, became just a little tremulous, “Walter must have a very
      painful recollection of me. It was a very unhappy time when we were last together, and I often
      think with shame of what I was then—what a wretched, badly brought up, bad‐hearted child I
      was.”
“If you had been a bad‐hearted child,” cried Anne, “you could not be what you are now, you
      could not speak as you do now. I don’t believe it.”

Madame Elaguine sighed.
“At all events,” she said, “the question now is no longer what I was or what I am, but what
      my children are to be. I am played out; I only hope I may live to see them on the road to
      being happier and more useful creatures than I have been.”
There was something in that clear soft voice, with its just perceptible daintiness of
      Russian pronunciation, making the English words not less English, but more distinct and
      liquid, which made what from any one else might have seemed strange, quite natural and
      simple.
“You have come to settle in England?” asked Anne.
“Yes; at least if it is possible for me ever to settle anywhere. I have been a rolling stone
      so long, or rather such a feather carried hither and thither by the wind, that I can scarcely
      believe in settling anywhere; and then, perhaps, I may not be permitted to stay where I should
      be happy. But I want my boy to become an Englishman, and at the
       same time I haven’t the heart to let him go away from
      me.”
“Why should you not settle?” asked Anne; “surely you will be much happier near your
      child.”
“Why may I never do what I wish?” exclaimed Madame Elaguine, with a curious wildness; “why
      may I not be left to live in peace like any other insignificant woman, whose life has been a
      failure? I am not my own mistress.”
“Bring lights,” ordered Hamlin, who had summoned the servants. He was impatient that the two
      women should see each other, impatient to display to his cousin the magnificent creature which
      belonged to him.
They had begun discussing various school‐plans for Madame Elaguine’s children when the lamps
      were brought in. Anne was surprised when she saw Hamlin’s cousin distinctly; she had imagined
      her pretty and delicate in an ordinary way, but there was nothing commonplace about this
      woman. She was pale, and of almost ghastly thinness, and
       her features, despite her small size, were large, and
      perhaps a little gaunt. It struck Anne that she had seen a face like that before, and later
      she discovered that what Madame Elaguine made her think of was Sarah Bernhardt in one of her
      girlish parts, or as her face looked under the little cap of Coppée’s page‐boy. It was a
      charming, frank, worn, yet childish face, full of movement,—a face which seemed to vibrate
      like a delicate instrument—not exactly beautiful nor exactly lovable, but interesting and
      fascinating. It seemed to Anne that she could perfectly understand the past of this woman: a
      highly nervous, delicate nature, not earnest but passionate, easily turned into the very best
      or the very worst; and she felt more than ever indignant at the thought of the corruption in
      contact with which this mobile impressionable creature had come as a child,—at the thought of
      all the unintentional shame which this woman must look back upon in her childhood.
While they were talking, Sacha Elaguine
       was equally busy looking at Anne; and Anne puzzled her.
“Either a volcano or an iceberg, or both,” said the little Russian to herself, as she looked
      at Anne’s solemn, unruffled, and yet tragic beauty.
At that moment a carriage stopped at the door. Hamlin went to the window. He looked rather
      pale and puzzled as he came back.
“Let me show you my studio, Sacha,” he said hurriedly; “we can get there quickest by a
      little back‐stair out of the library. Will you come?”
Anne understood. Mrs Macgregor, who had gone out expecting Madame Elaguine to come an hour
      earlier, had returned, and Hamlin dreaded a scene. But Madame Elaguine understood also.
“Your aunt has returned,” she said; “yes, I’m sure she has—that’s why you want to hide me
      away; you are afraid of a scene . . .”
Hamlin hesitated; but Madame Elaguine
       seemed to pin him down with her rapid glance.
“Well, yes,” he said; “what’s the use of mincing matters? You know how unreasonable Aunt
      Claudia always was, and what a prejudice she had against you.”
“And has still; I can believe it. But look here,” and the little emaciated creature rapidly
      stopped Hamlin as he was raising the curtain into the next room—“I am not going to be hid
      away. Your aunt has every reason to hate me, and to be angry at finding me here. But I am not
      coming into her house on the sly—I won’t be hidden away. Your aunt may say what she likes to
      me, but she shall see me here.”
“I think Madame Elaguine is quite right,” said Anne, though she knew full well what sort of
      reception Mrs Macgregor was likely to give to the detested Sacha. “I quite understand her
      feeling.”
“But you are not coming into Aunt Claudia’s house on the sly,” insisted Hamlin. “In the
       first place, this house is not Aunt Claudia’s house, but
      Miss Brown’s house. Aunt Claudia, like you and me, is merely Miss Brown’s guest, and you have
      come to see Miss Brown. In the second place, my aunt knew you were coming, and went out
      expressly to avoid meeting you.”
Madame Elaguine listened with a slight look of contempt.
“So much the better if I am not intruding behind her back. And it is very considerate of Mrs
      Macgregor to save me what she knows must be a painful scene. But besides Mrs Macgregor, I have
      myself to think of. I wish to see your aunt. I wish to have the satisfaction of telling her,
      that however much she may hate the remembrance of me, she cannot hate it more than I do.”
There was something theatrical in this which took Hamlin by surprise; but it was the
      theatricalness of a quixotic and passionate temper, and Anne liked Madame Elaguine for it.
“I want to see Mrs Macgregor,” repeated
       the Russian; “but I don’t want to inflict it upon you, Miss
      Brown. Indeed I fear it is very ill‐bred and very selfish of me to come to your house merely
      to make a disagreeable scene: still I can’t resist the desire,” and she shook her little head
      with its close pale‐yellow curls and deep brown eyes, “only—don’t stay —just tell your aunt
      that I am here, and that I want to see her.”
“I will go and tell Aunt Claudia,” said Anne.
But as she spoke, Mrs Macgregor entered. The old lady was short‐sighted; and in that room,
      where the light, concentrated on a few spots, left all the more shadow all round, she did not
      at first notice the presence of a stranger.
“Well, is she gone?” she asked savagely.
“Madame Elaguine is here, Aunt Claudia,” answered Anne, quietly.
“Here!” exclaimed Mrs Macgregor—“ still in this house!”
“And she has remained,” went on Anne, with a weighty coldness which often put
       down the old lady’s ebullitions, “because she wants to see
      you again.”
Hamlin was standing by the piano. How he wished his cousin at the devil for inflicting such
      a scene upon him!
“The insolence!” muttered Mrs Macgregor.
But Madame Elaguine had come forward and stretched out her hand.
“I could not come here without seeing you, Aunt Claudia,” she said, in her clear voice. “I
      want to tell you that, badly, as I behaved as a child, and cruelly unjust though you were
      towards me, I bear you no ill‐will, and only wish to ask for your forgiveness.”
She had sat down opposite to Mrs Macgregor. Hamlin’s aunt scanned her from head to foot; she
      was taken by surprise, shaken throughout her nature, and at a loss how to answer.
“So you are Sacha Polozoff,” said Mrs Macgregor at length, slowly. “I know all the fine
      trash which Anne talks about the woman not being the same as the child—
       maybe; I hope so, for your sake. As to forgiveness, you
      have mine: but forgiveness is only an empty word; it does not cancel what has been done,
      neither from the memory of God nor of man. Here; I forgive you, and take it for
      what it is worth.”
And she stretched out her hand with a bitter smile.
Madame Elaguine stooped down and kissed that shaking old hand.
“Whatever your forgiveness is worth, I take it joyfully; it cannot undo the past, and it
      cannot put an end to injustice and hatred,—so far it is worthless. But to me it gives a new
      life, because I have been able at last to ask forgiveness, to admit all the mischief I have
      ever done, and to cast away the faults of my childhood from my own clean self,”—she spoke very
      low, and with tears in her voice, but with passion and pride.
“I am happy that you feel so comfortable,” replied Mrs Macgregor, “and that I have been
      conducive thereto. I am happy also to make
       your acquaintance, Madame Elaguine, and I hope you will not
      deprive my nephew and niece of your society on my account.”
Sacha bowed; the insult seemed to trickle off her. Anne half wondered, half admired. She
      could not in the least understand the kind of character which prompted such a useless and
      hollow ceremony as this; but as to Madame Elaguine, this solemn act of self‐humiliation seemed
      necessary and just; she admired her for having the courage to carry out her intention.
“Good‐bye,” said Madame Elaguine, as Anne accompanied her into the anteroom. “I must beg
      your forgiveness a thousand, thousand times for having made a scene in your house. You see, I
      am a badly brought‐up woman: I was never taught to do anything except what I liked; and I am
      what I am, and must say what I feel.”
Her tone was very appealing.
“Will you forgive me, Madame Elaguine,” said Anne, in her earnest, solemn way, “if I
       tell you, what it is perhaps a liberty to tell you, that I
      have always thought my aunt very unjust towards you?”
The little thin woman looked up in Anne’s face.
“You are good,” she said. “Will you give me a kiss?”
Anne stooped down and kissed her shyly on her wan cheek. But a sort of shudder passed
      through her as her own lips touched that hot face, and grazed the light hair, which seemed to
      give out some faint Eastern perfume. This woman was so unlike anything she had ever seen—so
      unlike her own simple self.
“You will come and see me—and see my children—won’t you?” asked Madame Elaguine. “I think it
      will do me good to know you.” She was very excited, and she gasped as if her heart were
      beating like bursting.
“I will come with Mr Hamlin,” said Anne.
“She is a strange creature,” said Hamlin, as he followed Anne up‐stairs from the door.
      “Didn’t I tell you she was uncanny?”

“I don’t see anything uncanny about her. She is very nervous and excitable—very Russian, I
      should say—and accustomed always to follow her impulses; but I think she is a brave little
      woman.”
“I can’t make her out. Did you notice her mouth? it looks as if it would bite: and she has
      strange eyes; one looks into them, and finds she has merely drawn out one’s soul without
      showing her own.”
Anne laughed. “Poor little woman! Fancy what her feelings would be if she ever knew all
      that! I wonder, by the way, whether you ever thought me strange, and told people that I had. a
      mouth which would bite, and eyes in which you get drowned?”
“I always thought,” answered Hamlin, looking at Anne, and seeing her again in that
      close‐fitting white bodice, with rolled‐up sleeves, bending her magnificent head over the
      iron‐board in the little nursery, with frescoes of blue skies, and blue seas, and ducks, and
      people in boats, at the Villa Arnolfini—“I always
       thought that you had something strange in you, Miss Brown;
      some terrible thing to do or to suffer in the future; some great passion or action—I don’t
      know clearly what, but something heroic; and I think so now—”
Anne smiled; but she took his words to heart, for somehow that same impression which he said
      he had received from her face she had had vaguely in her heart.
“I hope the strangeness may consist in being a tolerably well‐behaved and useful young
      woman,” she said, “and—a tolerably grateful one.”
