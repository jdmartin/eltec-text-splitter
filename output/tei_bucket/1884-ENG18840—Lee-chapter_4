CHAPTER IV.
DURING luncheon, no mention was made of the nursemaid into whose concerns Hamlin
      had that morning intruded; but at dinner, Hamlin’s sense of the question being a sore one, and
      of being himself mixed up in it, gave way before his curiosity to solve the riddle of the
      strange‐type which had taken him so by surprise.
“That is a very strange‐looking girl you have in your service,” he remarked to his hostess,
      over their grapes and thin wine.
“The cook?” cried Mrs Perry. “Isn’t she a divine creature? I call her Monna Lisa’s younger
      sister.”
“I don’t know your cook by sight,” he answered. “I mean the other young woman they call
      Annina—”

Mrs Perry’s brow darkened.
“The nurse—or governess,—I don’t know exactly how to describe her,—of your little
      girls.”
“My children’s maid,” answered Mrs Perry, with considerable emphasis. “Thank heaven, my
      children have never had and shall never have any other nurse or any other governess than their
      own mother.”
“Well, now, Julia,” remonstrated her husband, “I think, you know, that’s pushing it a little
      too far.”
“My children shall never learn anything from a menial,” insisted Mrs Perry, “neither to walk
      bodily, nor morally, nor intellectually, as long as I am alive.”
“Good heavens!” thought Hamlin, “what a bandy‐legged family they are likely to turn
      out!”
“I suppose you mean Annie,” said Perry. “Yes, she’s a good girl, and a good‐looking
      girl.”
“You are mad, Melton,” cried Mrs Perry, “with your idea of goodness and good looks!”

“I think her extraordinarily good‐looking,” put in Hamlin, enjoying the authority of his own
      verdict.
“I always told you so,” replied Perry.
“When I say good‐looking,” corrected Hamlin, “I don’t mean it at all in the ordinary sense.
      There are dozens of Italian girls five times as pretty as that girl, and I daresay most people
      don’t think her at all attractive.”
“Yes,” burst out Mrs Perry, “vulgar minds and eyes never appreciate the higher beauty. They
      see only the body.”
“This is exactly a question of the body,” went on Hamlin. “That girl is one of the most
      singular types I have ever come across. She is like some of Michaelangelo’s women, but even
      stranger—a superb creature.”
The revelation of her maid’s beauty by so great an authority as Hamlin quite dazzled and
      delighted Mrs Perry.
“All our servants are handsome,” she said; “the cook’s the finest Leonardo da Vinci
      type—when you see her you will want to do her
       picture, Mr Hamlin, as Venus Mystica,” and Mrs Melton Perry
      set her meagre features and wide‐opening mouth into a mystic smile, intimating that she knew a
      great deal about Venus Mystica, and her guest doubtless likewise.
“And the footman” . . . she went on.
“Errand‐boy,” corrected Mr Perry, suddenly, emboldened by his friend’s presence.
“The footman is quite a type of manly beauty—a young Hercules,—such a neck and shoulders and
      arms—and a head like a cameo. I always make it a rule to engage only handsome servants,
      because it spiritualises the minds of our children to be brought up constantly surrounded by
      beautiful human forms.”
“I see,” answered Hamlin drily, entirely neglecting his opportunity of making the usual
      reply to this remark—namely, that the young Perrys were so abundantly provided with beautiful
      human form in the person of their mother that any other was superfluous.
“That girl you noticed has rather a curious history,” said Perry.

“Indeed!” answered Hamlin;“she looks as if she ought to have some sort of tragic past—a kind
      of Brynhilt or Amazon.”
“It’s tragic enough if you like, but it’s unfortunately not at all poetical,” replied
      Perry.
“There is poetry in all suffering, Melton,” corrected his wife gravely.
“Well, this girl is the daughter of a Scotch mechanic, a very clever fellow, I believe, who
      fell in love with the Italian maid of some old friends of ours, and followed her to Italy. He
      got a very good position in the docks at Spezia, but then the other chaps caballed against
      him, and made him lose his place. They had to live from hand to mouth for a long while, doing
      odd jobs for the railway company; he squandered his money also on inventions, so, little by
      little, he and his wife and children got into great distress. Then he took to drinking, poor
      devil! (I’m sure I should have done so long before;) and one day that he had again been done
      out of a place by some Italian scoundrel
      , he tried to throw his wife out of the window, and then shot
      himself. It was a dreadful business.”
“He was a great republican, poor dear,” added Mrs Perry. “I’m a republican too, a
      socialist—quite a dreadful creature, Mr Hamlin.”
“What became of the wife and children ?” asked Hamlin.
“The children had all died by this time, except Annie; and the poor wife was quite broken in
      health. There was a nephew of the husband’s, a Scotch lad, quite a boy, who was awfully plucky
      and worked for them for some time. Then the widow died; and an old friend of ours, old Miss
      Curzon, the famous singer that had been—perhaps you may have heard of her—took Annie into her
      house.”
“Darling Miss Curzon!” exclaimed Mrs Perry. “She was the noblest woman that ever lived. How
      she loved me! I always say that I lost my voice—I had a lovely voice before my marriage—when
      dear darling Miss Curzon died.”

“Miss Curzon was an excellent old woman,” went on Perry: “she took Annie when
      she was eleven, and kept her in her house and educated her till her own death two years ago;”
      and Perry sighed, as he peeled a hard white peach.
“Then I said to my husband, ‘Perry, this child is a legacy to us from our dearest friend,’”
      went on Mrs Perry, solemnly; “‘we are not rich, but Heaven will send us enough for our
      children and this child; and if it don’t, why, we must do without.’”
“So she has been with you ever since?”
“Yes,” answered Perry, sharply; “and I should like her to remain for the children’s sake,
      only that I feel the girl ought to look out for some better place.” And he turned rather
      gloomily to his wife.
Mrs Perry answered his look with one of sweet and ineffable astonishment. She naturally
      viewed all her property, servants, children, husband, etc., as emanations from herself—that
      is to say, from perfection, and consequently as
       more perfect than other folk’s property, servants, children,
      husbands, although occasionally falling short of this ineffable origin; and she accepted, with
      alacrity and pleasure, the belief in the transcendent beauty of the nursemaid whom she had
      shrieked at only a few hours before. She was quite reconciled to her, evidently.
“And what is this girl’s name?” asked Hamlin.
“Anne,” answered Perry—“ Anne Brown.”
