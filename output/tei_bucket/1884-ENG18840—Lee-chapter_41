CHAPTER V.
AUTUMN turned to winter, and at last Hamlin’s long‐expected, much‐talked‐of book of
      new poems made its appearance. In her gradual estrangement from Hamlin, in the gradual
      replacing of the ideal creature whom she had so fervently loved by a reality by which she was
      beginning to be repelled, Anne had hung some of her last hopes to Hamlin’s poetry. She would
      often say to herself that, after all, Hamlin made no pretence to being anything more than an
      artistic nature; that he was a great artist, born to give the world a certain amount of
      pleasure, and that she had no right to ask of him to be anything else. What could she, willing
      as she was to sympathise and to work,—what could a
       man like Richard Brown, with all his self‐sacrificing
      energy and ability, do for mankind that might compare with what had been done by Leonardo, by
      Mozart, by Keats—men as solely artistic as Hamlin? and Hamlin was a great poet,
      and would become a greater one—of that Anne felt persuaded, for his work was steadily
      improving, and there were things in this book which she recognised as having the highest
      merit. So she clung to Hamlin’s poetry as to an anchor for his nobility and for her affection.
      At length the volume was published. Hamlin arrived at Hammersmith one morning and placed a
      copy of it by the side of Anne’s plate at breakfast.
“It is the first copy,” he said, “and as such, belongs to you.”
“Thank you,” said Anne, flushing with pleasure; for, opening the book, she found on the
      fly‐leaf a little poem, imitated from the love‐songs of the Tuscan peasants, in which Hamlin
      dedicated the volume to her; it was beautiful and simple and almost solemn—the
       very flower of that distant and poetic love which he
      professed towards her.
“You have put in the ‘Ballad of the Fens’ after all! Oh, thank you so much, Mr Hamlin! You
      know I always thought it the best thing you have ever done,” she exclaimed.
Hamlin did not answer; perhaps because he was aware that this “Ballad of the Fens,”
      rewritten under the influence of Dennistoun, was not the same as the one which he had torn up
      three months before. Anne soon discovered it: reading through the still uncut sheets, she
      found that instead of the story of married love, which had called down the wrath of the whole
      school, Hamlin had set in his beautiful descriptions a ghastly tale which she scarcely
      required more than to glance at. So this was all that had come of her having mentioned Cold
      Fremley to him!
“I think I have made the story more tragic and more in harmony with the surrounding nature.
      I always felt that I needed some more powerful and terrible situation. Like this,
       I think the effect is sufficiently worked out, don’t you
      think?”
“Yes,” said Anne, icily. There was the description of the sunset on the fens, of the broad
      slow river flowing between low green banks, its clotted masses reflecting the red sunset
      embers; the description of the whole scene as they had witnessed it; and then a description of
      the people of Cold Fremley, of their lives and sins, in which she could almost recognise her
      own words in which she had vainly pleaded for them that memorable afternoon in his studio. A
      cold terror prevented Anne from turning at once to the sonnets. But after all, had he not, as
      it were, promised to abide by her choice? had he not submitted, however reluctantly, to the
      condemnation of those twelve sonnets? Anne felt ashamed of her own suspicions and fears; she
      boldly turned to the end of the book, peeped between the leaves—
“Desire—XII. Sonnets.”
Anne did not know what was the feeling
       which filled her. She had never felt it before. It was too
      cold to be indignation, too self‐possessed to be horror: she seemed surrounded by an icy
      atmosphere, through which she saw Hamlin as through a mist. He had broken his word, and for
      what? To attribute to himself vicious thoughts and feelings which he had never had. Anne said
      not a word; the man who was capable of acting thus could not understand if he were chidden for
      it.
Breakfast passed gloomily, talking little, or of indifferent things. Hamlin was evidently
      ruffled by this reception of his book.
“Are you going to sit to me this morning, Miss Brown?” he asked with some irritation, as he
      rose from table.
“I will, if you wish me to.”
Anne’s voice smote him as if he had opened the window to a snowstorm.
“Have you anything else to do?”
“I always have plenty to do, you know. If you don’t want me, I shall go out with Marjory
      Leigh.”

“So much the better. I don’t feel as if I could work successfully this morning, and I should
      be sorry to detain you for nothing at all. I will go and ask my cousin whether she would care
      to see Lewis’s studio. This weather is very depressing.”
“Very,” answered Anne.
Anne went out with Marjory Leigh, who was on a round of visiting poor people at Lainbeth.
      They were joined by Harry Collett. He stood in great awe of his future bride’s superior wisdom
      and dogmatic manner; but it was touching to see how completely these two creatures—the shy and
      mystical curate, and the masterful and rationalistic young woman, who was wont to tell him
      that some day he should be persuaded that only secular work was really useful, and the Church
      ought to be disestablished—understood each other, and sympathised in their best
      endeavours.
“Hamlin has brought out a new book,” said Collett to Anne. “How proud you must be, Miss
      Brown! he has been quite another man,
       twice as cheerful and devoted to his art, since he has
      known you. For a poet like him, so sensitive and easily depressed, it must be a great thing to
      have a noble woman to encourage him.”
Anne did not answer. She felt alone—alone as in a desert, without an ear to hear her, or a
      hand to touch hers.
Often did that sensation recur to her now; a sensation as of dragging wearily and alone
      along an ice‐bound road, under a grey wintry sky, weary and solitary, but with the knowledge
      that the more solitary and weary she felt, the more was she bound to plod on. Things that
      happened seemed spectral. Here in London she saw less of Hamlin than in the country; he was
      going about with his friends, he was at his cousin’s. She did not know or care where. People
      talked a great deal about the new book; and only Anne was silent.
“You don’t like Hamlin’s new book,” said Richard Brown to her one evening, fixing his eyes
      upon her in his ruthless way. He came often now; he had apparently got to believe in
       her, and he even held out a possibility to her, if she
      continued to work steadily, reading and attending lectures, that she might by the summer‐time
      be able to offer herself to teach the elements of political economy at the Working Women’s
      Club.
“You don’t like Hamlin’s new book.”
It was not a question, but an assertion, and Anne felt it as a taunt.
“I like some things in it extremely,” she answered boldly; “but I dislike and disapprove of
      some others.”
Brown made a characteristic upward movement with one of his big black eyebrows.
“I thought that you æsthetic folk never disapproved of anything—that it was against the
      canons of art to disapprove.”
“I am not an æsthete, Richard. If I were, I should not be trying to learn the things in
      which you take interest.”
“True. And does Hamlin know that you dislike and disapprove of some of his poems?”
For a moment Anne did not answer.
       Brown’s question was like an insolent attempt to see into
      her heart. Yet what right had she to hide anything?
“He knows exactly what I think about all his poems; but he does not, naturally, agree with
      me in all my views.”
She was determined to keep her cousin at a distance. He had hated her ever becoming
      connected with æsthetic society, and he tried to force her to admit that she regretted it.
But Brown had an inveterate hatred which he could not put aside.
“Have you seen the review in the ‘Saturday Gazette’?” he asked.
The review was one of the few bad ones which Hamlin’s book had had, among a chorus of good
      ones. But it was written by a rabid enemy of pre‐Raphaelite poetry; and who had taken the
      occasion of this book to show up what he considered the pestilent moral condition of the whole
      school.
“Yes; I have. It is a very unjust and violent attack, and quite indiscriminating.”

“So I thought. Still, what it quoted from the sonnets called Desire seemed,
      so far, to bear out its statements. What do you think?”
“I think,” answered Anne slowly, and choking her pride and emotion, “that all he says about
      those sonnets is quite correct. I think it is most regrettable that they should have been
      published. But I think that in writing them Mr Hamlin was merely following the vicious
      traditions of his school; and I know that he is, in reality, a perfectly pure‐minded man.
      And,” she added, as if to put an end to the conversation, “he is the man to whom I owe more
      gratitude than any woman ever owed to any man.”
Brown did not press the conversation. He understood. He had of late been getting to
      comprehend Anne’s character; he recognised her serious unselfishness, her indomitable desire
      for good; he saw in her a strange straining dissatisfaction—a something which was as the
      beating of a bird’s wings against its cage. And now he understood whence it came.

“She has made her choice and must abide by it,” he said sternly to himself, remembering that
      scene when he had tried vainly to dissuade her from accepting Hamlin’s offer, and she had
      answered, “I love him!” “She has sold her soul into bondage, and must accept the isolation and
      silence and uselessness of a slave.” But then, as he said good night and looked at that noble
      face, whose tragic intensity of rectitude was now revealed to him, Richard Brown could not
      help feeling a pang. “Poor child!” he said to himself; and wished he had proved less of a
      prophet than he believed himself to have done.
He began, in consequence, to feel a little ashamed of himself, and came oftener to see Anne.
      He was a brilliant man when you got him on his own subjects, warm‐hearted, self‐sacrificing,
      ambitious, eloquent; and he had always a number of practical schemes at heart. Originally a
      hand at a foundry, he had for some time, like Anne’s father, been smitten with communistic
      theories; but instead of
       being tempted into becoming a socialistic demagogue, he
      had, when he was about twenty‐five, given up the little workman’s newspaper, of which he was
      editor and chief author, and deliberately set to work studying economical and social questions
      in the intervals of his work, carefully suspending his judgment during the while. To a man as
      impetuous and ambitious as Brown, to whom the easy and tempting path of party leader lay open,
      such a course must have meant a terrible and long‐sustained effort of self‐control. But his
      indomitable conscience and will had carried him through it; and now he was reaping the
      unexpected reward of his forbearance. While slowly working his way in business and studying
      the subjects which were dearest to him, he had managed also to cultivate a mechanical genius,
      which seemed in some way hereditary in the family of Anne’s father, who, in happier
      circumstances, might perhaps have been a brilliant inventor instead of a starving expatriated
      workman. He had made valuable improvements
       in the foundry of which he had become the foreman, and had
      now, for the last two years, been the chief partner and virtual director of the business, with
      a fair livelihood in the present, and a large fortune and great influence in the immediate
      future. But money and influence were nothing to Richard Brown; or rather, influence to him
      meant merely the triumph of his own philanthropical schemes. Selfish he undoubtedly was, but
      his selfishness, his vanity, his pride, his ambition, were drafted off into the service of
      others. Anne listened with enthusiasm, but not unmixed with sadness, to her cousin’s projects
      for educating the lower classes, for bringing home to the upper classes their own
      responsibilities; they had the charm of dreams, but of the dreams of a man who seemed able to
      make what he desired into reality. Even in this æsthetic society, which had looked upon him
      with suspicion and loathing, Richard Brown got a certain importance. He would spend hours with
      old Saunders the painter, and
       his daughter, the enthusiastic Mrs Spencer, discussing the
      way of introducing more beautiful patterns into trade, and of getting up schools of design and
      loan exhibitions for the poorer classes.
“He is a man of the middle ages!” Mrs Spencer would enthusiastically exclaim; “if only we
      had a few more like him, we should soon build cathedrals and town‐halls like
      those of the fourteenth century.”
“He is a canny Radical,” answered her father, “but a gude sort of man. For my part, I don’t
      much believe in educating the lower classes up to art, but there’s no harm in trying, and, at
      least, we shall get better‐made chairs and tables for our money.”
Chough was equally enthusiastic. Richard Brown was anxious to get up some concerts at a kind
      of workman’s union at which he presided; and Chough—yes, the great Chough himself, who hinted
      mysteriously that his father (who was an apothecary at Limerick) was a duke, but that he would
      rather die
       than succeed to the title—was prevailed upon to take the
      musical direction upon himself. While these schemes were going on, Madame Elaguine met Richard
      Brown.
There was something in this big, burly, rather brutal man, which immediately fascinated the
      nervous little Russian woman: she sat at Brown’s feet, she listened with rapture to his
      theories, she threw herself headlong into the plan of the concerts; she offered to perform, to
      teach, to do whatever Brown might wish.
Hamlin was thoroughly disgusted with his cousin Sacha, who had hitherto known no divinity
      save him and pure beauty, when he saw her devoting herself to humanitarianism, personified in
      what he called “that shoddy philanthropical black brute.” He became vehemently devoted to
      Anne. He seemed to repent of his book. He declared himself sick of London and of æsthetic
      society.
“I must turn over a new leaf,” he said. “I feel I must, or sink into being no better than
      Chough or Dennistoun. But I am too weak
       to turn it over alone. Will you help me, Miss Brown?”—and
      he looked at her with his slow, beautiful glance of Platonic love.
Anne smiled sadly. “No one can help any one, I am beginning to fear; and I least of all.”
      She had got so accustomed to these sudden returns of Hamlin’s, to these false starts, these
      longings after a healthier moral and intellectual atmosphere, which came to nothing. She saw
      so plainly the hopeless weakness and thinness of his nature; and yet in such moments she could
      not help feeling some of that old love for this beautiful, delicate, idealistic, chivalrous
      creature whom she knew to be mere selfishness and vanity. If only he would remain thus at
      least.
“Perhaps you are right,” answered Hamlin, leaning over the piano at which she was seated;
      “but I feel myself sick of this life, this poetry. All is false, false, hollow, and empty. My
      verses are untrue, my pictures are mere Christmas cards; even with you as a model, I feel I am
      always repeating the same
       wearisome insipid trick of eyes, and mouth, and neck. Oh, I
      don’t know what to do!”
It was but too true. That school of mere beautiful suggestion, which scorned reality and
      mechanical skill as a bird scorns the ground, was fast sinking into nullity. Anne had often
      remarked it in comparing the works of various masters; she had noticed the stray sentences,
      not meant for her, dropped by painters of other schools.
“Go to Paris and study for a year or so under Bastien‐Lepage, or Henner, or Duran,” she
      said, with a smile at the vanity of her own words.
Hamlin could not even conceive that she was in earnest, that any one could dream of seeing
      anything in modern French painting, that any one could be so mad as to think of
       his studying.
“Yes,” he cried, “that is the only art that can live in our day! Ours is a mere phantom; our
      poetry is a phantom; they come round us imploring us to give them life, like
       the ghosts round Odysseus’s trench. But who shall give them
      life? Where shall we get the life‐blood of passion whereon to feed and revivify them?”
And he suddenly turned round and looked at her with great yearning eyes. Hamlin was
      genuinely unhappy, though he did not guess that his unhappiness was due to vacuity, to
      slighted vanity, to the sudden infatuation of Madame Elaguine for a shoddy philanthropist. He
      longed for passion as, in hot climates, after months of faint sultriness, one longs for rain
      and wind; and he looked at Anne as one might watch the dark clouds hanging on the hills, the
      dark clouds which hold the storm for which one is thirsting. Oh for a strong passion!—it would
      revive him, revive his art. Hamlin did not say it to himself in so many words, but he felt
      it.
He talked long and vehemently about the necessity of going outside one’s self, of
      transmuting one’s consciousness into that of another, of having something beyond one’s self to
       live for. He told Anne, always with those yearning eyes
      fixed upon her, that what was wanted to revive the world and art (and by the world he meant
      himself) was passion; but not the mere sultry passion which his school had sung about, which
      merely enervated and sent to sleep, but the clear cold air, the whirlwinds and thunderstorms
      of ideal love—of love such as Dante had felt for Beatrice, and Heathcliff for Cathey. It was
      very eloquent and beautiful what he said about this love, which was something vague and quite
      unselfish and outside one’s self,—a sort of act of adoration and purification and
      renunciation,—a meeting of two souls which vibrated in unison in their desire for the good and
      the noble. While he spoke, Anne almost believed that he was sincere; sincere, indeed, he was,
      but according to his nature, not hers. She felt the tears coming into her eyes, and a vague
      wish to throw herself into his arms and implore him to cast aside his selfish habits, to live
      for the life of other men and
       for her love, came to her heart. But when, suddenly, their
      conversation was interrupted by the entry of Edmund Lewis and Madame Elaguine, it all ebbed
      back, till her whole nature seemed to burst. She felt that he did not know what he was saying,
      what he did not comprehend what he was wanting; she felt the uselessness of saying to this man
      that the world and herself were waiting for him to love them, that her whole nature was
      sickening for want of one with which to vibrate in harmony of desire for the good and the
      noble. Cold Fremley, the sonnets, a hundred little words and looks which had made the chasm
      between them, returned to her. She felt once more alone, terribly and hopelessly alone.
And still, when she met her cousin Dick, and realised how different he was, how genuine and
      strong and passionate for good, she could not help experiencing a sort of repulsion from him,
      and a melancholy, hopeless throwing of herself back on to the unreal Hamlin.
       She felt that Richard Brown, with all his nobility and
      energy of nature, would never have done for her what Hamlin had done, would never have been
      for her what Hamlin had been; that he would never have singled her out, her a mere servant,
      and guessed that in her there was a soul which could love and could aspire. But after all, why
      had Hamlin singled her out? and what had he guessed in her, what had he hoped from her? That
      line of Rossetti’s, which Hamlin admired more than any other, which he so often quoted— 
“Beauty like hers is genius,”—
 returned to her with a chill; and she felt that Hamlin wanted, expected from her that
      sort of passion which he had spoken of to revive him and his art. It seemed to her as if she
      had been sold in the slave‐market, and were being told “now love.”
