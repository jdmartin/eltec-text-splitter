CHAPTER VI.
RICHARD BROWN did not let Madame Elaguine sit at his feet very long. After about a
      fortnight of extremely assiduous visits at the Russian lady’s house at Kensington, during
      which he poured out to the enthusiastic little woman all his philanthropical schemes, Richard
      suddenly gave up calling, and even avoided meeting Madame Elaguine at other houses.
“Why have you deserted Madame Elaguine so suddenly?” asked Anne of her cousin. To confess
      the truth, Anne was rather malicious in her question. She had speedily recognised the vanity,
      or rather the self‐sufficiency, the belief in his own irresistible uniqueness, which was the
      leaven of Cousin Dick’s virtues, and she had been amused from the first at seeing
       how this earnest philanthropist had let himself be caught
      by Madame Elaguine’s conscious or unconscious instinct of flirtation; and now, she thought,
      Dick has suddenly awaked from his dream of having fascinated and converted her. Anne smiled as
      she asked the question, but there was sadness as well as amusement in her smile. In his
      way—his blind, self‐satisfied, unselfish way—Dick was as vain as Hamlin: wherever she looked
      vanity and hollowness met her, and she herself could not even conceive what vanity was.
“Why have you deserted Madame Elaguine?” repeated Anne.
Brown suddenly raised his big, rough, black head from the review which he had been
      mechanically looking at, and answered, looking straight in front of him—
“Don’t speak to me about Madame Elaguine; she is an odious woman.”
There was something brief and silencing in his tone which surprised Anne and precluded
      further questions.

“In fact,” added Richard Brown, “if it were not that a woman like you will never even
      understand what Madame Elaguine is made of, I should peremptorily say that she is not a person
      for you to know.”
Anne was indignant, and yet, at the same time, a little shocked.
“Why, what has Madame Elaguine done?”
“Done!” answered Brown, half waiving the subject, and half insisting upon it, as
      self‐important men frequently do. “Why, she has done nothing. But that makes no
      difference; she’s an odious woman.”
Anne laughed bitterly. The whole world seemed so awry, every one seeing everything through
      the crooked spectacles of his own vanity. Now here was Dick insinuating evil against a woman
      because he had been such a big baby as to fancy her in love with him.
“Men are very unjust!” cried Anne; “they always trump up some mysterious sin to justify
      their unreasonable aversions.”
Brown reddened, and was on the point of
       saying something. But he checked himself, and merely
      remarked—
“Oh, of course women always fancy that they understand each other better than a man
      can.”
“So they can! A woman can always understand another woman better than a man can, who
      attributes all sorts of nasty masculine faults to women, or suspects imaginary feminine ones,
      when he doesn’t see clear. Oh yes, I know: every woman is weak, vain, a creature of impulse
      and passion, something half‐way only between the man and the child, as I read in a French
      paper, with a kind of sham character, like the backbones of cartilage or jelly of some lower
      creatures!”
Brown shook his head.
“Most women are like that, but not all; not you, Anne, for instance.”
“Thank you,” answered Anne, scornfully.
“But all women, at least all noble women, are unable to judge of other women. How should
      they judge? It is only a man, or a
       base woman, who knows of the mud out of which many women,
      like many men, are moulded.”
“One does not need to be base to know that,” said Anne, half to herself; and she thought of
      the mud which she had discovered in her own silver idol.
“I don’t think we are alluding to the same thing,” said Cousin Dick, turning off the
      conversation.
“Mere vanity, and the injustice of vanity,” said Anne to herself, and her pessimism became
      more confirmed. But later, although she continued to believe quite equally in Richard Brown’s
      vanity, she began to suspect that there had been in this coarse‐looking man a movement of
      modesty, an unwillingness to let her eyes rest upon some nasty thing which he had seen. But of
      this, at present, she had no idea, and Madame Elaguine, although she did not find much in
      common with her, became for Anne another victim of the vanity and injustice of the world.

They saw a good deal of the little woman now. Anne thought she understood her thoroughly,
      and owned to herself that she had not understood her at first. She recognised that the little
      woman had much more character than she had at first imagined; and the impression of frailness,
      childishness, and helplessness which something in Madame Elaguine’s appearance, manner, and
      voice had at first given her, wore away so completely that she could scarcely believe it had
      ever existed. Eccentric and irresponsible she still seemed, always rushing from one enthusiasm
      to another, always thirsting for excitement; but Anne found that instead of a childish girl
      who could lean upon her, she had to deal with a woman, undisciplined and capricious indeed,
      but still, in many respects, more of a woman than herself. She was flighty and giddy like her
      own little girl in many respects, and fully as ignorant of many things; but she had a
      knowledge of sides of life which Anne instinctively guessed, and from which she recoiled
      . With an extraordinary love of the beautiful, the
      fantastic, and the ideal, which, as it made her dress herself in queer ingénue little costumes, also made her mould her conduct, ideas, and words rather
      theatrically in obedience to a conception of something striking and pretty,—Madame Elaguine
      had, at the same time, a vein—no, Anne thought it must be a mere exterior dab, not due to her
      inner nature, but to her Russian and Continental education—of coarseness, which surprised and
      pained Miss Brown. Once or twice, in Anne’s presence, she alluded to things in a manner which
      gave Anne a shock; and Anne, who, half Italian as she was, and wholly fearless and unprudish,
      would ask herself what right she had had to feel like that; she would analyse Madame
      Elaguine’s words, and find them, when measured by a Continental standard, very harmless; yet
      somehow, though she told herself that she was stupid and unjust, something of the painful
      impression would remain. Also, she could not conceive
       how a woman could like to sit for hours, as Madame Elaguine
      did, on the score of spiritual séances, with a man like
      Edmund Lewis. She never heard him talk on anything objectionable to the Russian; and yet there
      was something to her inconceivable in the endurance of this man by a young woman. Anne came to
      the conclusion that she must be growing horribly prejudiced and unjust; and the less she could
      sympathise with some of Madame Elaguine’s tastes (though there was nothing really
      objectionable in them) the more did she force herself to try and understand, and make
      allowance for, and help the little woman. And one day Anne’s sympathies were really enlisted
      for her.
It was about Christmas, and Anne had prevailed upon Hamlin to accompany her and Madame
      Elaguine to a pantomime, to which the Russian was taking her little girl, and Anne the two
      Chough children. Anne amused herself heartily, as she always did, at every sort of theatrical
      performance, with the love
       of shows and acting in her Italian blood; she was so happy
      laughing with the children, while Hamlin talked with his cousin and Chough in the back of the
      box, that that evening long remained a sort of oasis in the dreariness of her inner life.
      There was a tremendous crush in the lobbies and on the stairs;. and while Chough shoved on his
      two children, and Hamlin tried to make way through the crowd for his frail little cousin, who
      looked as if she would be knocked over and trampled like a feather, Anne, towering through the
      throng (and people turned to look at that magnificent pale face, set in crisp black hair, and
      said to each other, “Look there; that’s Miss Brown, the famous pre‐Raphaelite beauty”), held
      Sacha Elaguine’s little girl close in front of her, calmly making the crowd divide as a ship
      divides the water. They were fairly out of the theatre, on the steps looking out into the
      street, with the gas burning dim in the fog, and the long splashes of yellow light on pavement
      and wet cab‐tops,
       waiting in the damp cold, while Chough called their
      carriage, and Madame Elaguine, leaning on Hamlin’s arm, the two little Choughs by her side,
      had heaved a sigh of relief, and exclaimed—
“Oh, how delicious it is to be in the cold, and fog, and dark, after that theatre!—”
When little Hélène Elaguine, who was holding Anne’s hand, and see‐sawing from one leg to
      another—while staring at the men in opera hats and comforters, and the ladies and children
      huddled in furs, and the policemen and cabmen who passed in front—suddenly gave a piercing
      shriek, and threw herself into Anne’s arms, clinging to her and burying her head in her
      pelisse.
“Good heavens! what’s the matter, child?” cried Anne, mechanically clasping the little girl
      round the waist.
“What’s the matter?” cried Hamlin, who had not seen this action.
But Madame Elaguine had let go his arm and darted forward, white as ashes, and seized
       her child from Anne, and cried—“Let us go! let us go!” in
      an agonised voice.
The carriage came up, and she jumped into it, scarcely giving Hamlin and Anne time to
      follow, and leaving Chough and his children amazed before the theatre door.
The carriage stopped at her door in Kensington.
“I cannot pass this night alone with only Helen and the servants! I cannot, I cannot!”
And Madame Elaguine burst into tears, strangely intermingled with hysterical laughs.
“They want to take my child away; they are trying it again!”
“What is to be done?” asked Hamlin.
“I will stay to‐night with Madame Elaguine,” said Anne, with decision; “if you will go to
      Hammersmith and tell Aunt Claudia’s maid that your cousin was feeling ill, and I am staying
      with her till to‐morrow. Help Madame Elaguine out, will you?”
Hamlin lifted his cousin out of the carriage, while Anne took charge of the child,
       whom its nurse carried up in a condition of lethargic
      sleep.
When they were in Madame Elaguine’s drawing‐room, the Russian took the child in her arms,
      and flinging herself on a sofa, burst out crying, her sobs interrupted by moaning complaints
      that some one wanted to take her child away.
“I will go to Hammersmith now, and leave you with her,” whispered Hamlin to Anne, who had
      knelt down by the side of the sofa.
“I will come to‐morrow morning for news; good night.”
“Good night,” answered Anne, under her breath.
But Madame Elaguine heard. She started up, and looking wildly about—
“Oh, don’t leave me alone yet!” she cried.
“Miss Brown will remain, Sacha,” said Hamlin.
“Oh, don’t leave me yet, Walter!” repeated
       Madame Elaguine. “I am afraid—I am afraid of Miss
      Brown.”
“I think you had better remain, Mr Hamlin,” whispered Anne; “she will probably be quiet in a
      minute or two.”
Hamlin took a chair near the table, and looked on in surprise. Madame Elaguine was stretched
      on the sofa, her sleeping child pressed close to her; her little head, with its short pale
      curls, thrown back; her eyes half closed, moaning and gasping and sobbing; and Anne, kneeling
      by her side, looking anxiously into that curious, convulsed face.
“Do you think she is going to faint?” asked Hamlin of his cousin’s Swiss maid, who stood by,
      the picture of self‐satisfied composure.
“Oh no—Monsieur need be under no apprehension. Madame often had de
       ces crises; Madame was often frightened like that. It was the first time since
      Madame was in England, but it was quite common. Madame,” added the servant quietly, “has
      probably seen her black man—”

“What black man?” asked Hamlin.
Sacha Elaguine had suddenly raised herself on her elbow,—as if she had heard the maid’s
      words.
“Take Mademoiselle Hélène to bed, Sophie,” she said quietly.
“Shan’t I take her?” asked Anne.
“Sophie knows how to manage her,” answered Madame Elaguine; and sitting up, she drew the
      half‐wakened child close to her and kissed her with convulsive passion. Yet she let the maid
      carry off the little one, and merely let herself slip down on the couch with a moan, putting
      aside her heavy fur and passing her hands through her pale blond hair, and moaning.
“Don’t you think you had better go?” said Anne to Hamlin. “I will look after your cousin.”
      She would loathe to have Hamlin sitting there, looking at her, if she were in Madame
      Elaguine’s condition.
Hamlin rose.
“Stop a minute,” said his cousin faintly,
       turning round and fixing her vague northern blue eyes on
      him; “stop a minute, Walter.”
Hamlin remained standing, his eyes involuntarily fixed upon the curious spectacle of this
      prostrate little figure, panting and gasping as if going to die, and half unconscious of any
      one’s presence—her cloak thrown back on the sofa, her hair tangled, her bare arms and neck
      (for it was one of her caprices always to go the play, even to the pantomime, full dress) half
      covered by the fur of her pelisse and the lace of her dress.
“Stay a minute; I want to explain,” repeated the Russian, in a faint voice. “Anne—dear
      Anne—where are you?”
“Here I am,” answered Anne, in her cheerful strong voice; “do you want anything, dear Madame
      Elaguine?”
“I want you,” and Sacha flung her arms round Anne’s neck, and drew her dark
      head close to her own little pale yellow one. Anne felt her arms tighten passionately round
      her, her little hand tighten convulsively round her
       neck, as if the half‐fainting woman would throttle her,—but
      she felt no fear, only a vague, undefinable repulsion. Madame Elaguine sighed a long sigh of
      relief, and loosened her hold; but she kept Anne’s face near hers, and kissed her with hot
      lips on the forehead.
“Dear Anne,” she said, “forgive me.”
“There is nothing to forgive,” said Anne, trying to get loose and to rise to her feet. But
      Madame Elaguine kept her down in her kneeling posture, her arm always round Anne’s
      shoulder.
“I must explain it all to you,” she said, in a slow, vague tone, fixing her eyes upon
      Hamlin. “Don’t think me very foolish or mad; but I thought they were again trying to carry off
      my little Helen,—they have tried before,—and they keep writing to me, telling me that they
      will carry off Helen or kill me. I don’t care about that,—but Helen!” and Madame Elaguine hid
      her face in Anne’s iron‐black hair.
Hamlin looked on as in a dream. It was a
       curious sight, these two women, so different, and yet both
      so young and beautiful, the one clinging so to the other; and of the two, Madame Elaguine,
      whom he had never thought regularly handsome, with her thin, strange face, and red lips, and
      wild eyes, seemed to him at this moment the stranger and more beautiful of the two.
“I want to explain it all,” said Madame Elaguine. “Walter, give me that box—the little
      Indian inlaid one on the writing‐table—there, next to the palm‐tree.”
Hamlin brought the box; and Madame Elaguine, without letting go her hold of Anne, pressed a
      spring and opened it. It was full to the brim of letters—some large and folded in their
      envelopes, others mere scraps of paper. She took some out, and spread them on her knees.
“Look,” she said, letting Anne go, so that she could, while still kneeling, see the
      papers.
Anne raised herself, and Hamlin approached.
“Look at these,” said the Russian, carefully
       handling the soiled and crumpled pieces of paper; “these
      are to me what love‐letters are to other women,—they are my life—my past, and my future.” And
      she fixed her eyes wildly on Hamlin. “As other women have lived on knowing that they were
      loved and would always be loved, so I have lived, ever since I was twenty, knowing that I was
      surrounded by invisible enemies, who would either put a sudden end to my life or protract it
      with their tortures. Ah! I know you think me giddy, and fickle, and childish; but you don’t
      know that I try to lose my wits in order that I may gain some peace!” her voice burst out hot
      and passionate.
Anne and Hamlin were shyly fingering the papers; they were all in the same hand—a curious,
      crabbed, left‐handed character—some in French, some in English, some in Russian, but all brief
      and to the same purpose: initials of which neither Anne nor Hamlin understood the meaning at
      the head, and below a threat of something terrible, sometimes left vague,
       sometimes outspoken, as death, to what was styled the
      traitress. Many of them said that what could not be visited on the mother should be visited on
      the children, and all concluded with saying that wherever the traitress went she would be
      followed by invisible eyes and footsteps.
“It was all my fault in the beginning,” began Madame Elaguine, covering her eyes with her
      hands; “but I was very young, ignorant, and lonely; and after all, what harm did I do? I had
      been married when I was only seventeen to a man whom I thought of as a father; and little by
      little, when I found what sort of man he was—how base, and coarse, and cunning—I began to feel
      very lonely and empty‐hearted. I was too young to care for my children, who were babies, and I
      was a baby myself. But it was all so lonely, and the world so mean about me. I longed to be of
      some use, and able to sacrifice myself for something. And a man was sent across my path, twice
      as old as myself, whom I looked
       upon as a father, and who treated me as a child; and this
      man used to talk to me, when my husband left me all alone to run after low women, and tell me
      all about the miserable condition of Russia, and how all the good was being stamped out, and
      only selfishness, and injustice, and corruption triumphed. He was a Nihilist himself, and one
      of their chief men—a wonderful man, who seemed so cold, and just, and honest. So, little by
      little, he converted me to his ideas, and I got to know other Nihilists, men and women, and
      heard a great deal about all sorts of terrible doings. I felt so happy and heroic—I was a
      fool, you see. Then I suddenly discovered that my hero was quite different from what I
      thought—that he had gained all this power over me only in hopes of making shameful use of it,
      and had cornpromised me with his party merely to make me his mistress. When I understood it, I
      drove him away, and threatened to tell all to my husband; and then he swore to get the better
      of me, and to use all the power of his society to
       bring me, as he called it, to reason. For two years, while
      my husband was alive, I struggled with him, and he kept on threatening and hoping to frighten
      me. But when my husband died, I sold all the Russian property, and was preparing to leave the
      country, and then that man who hated me, just because in his way he had loved me, denounced me
      to his society as a traitor to the Nihilist cause, and as a person to be hunted down. And so,
      ever since, I have been persecuted with all the might of the Nihilists wielded by this man;
      and although I have been hundreds of times on the point of denouncing him and his associates
      to the Government, I have never done so, because I am still a Nihilist at heart, and hate the
      Russian Government as much as I hate him; and he, who knows it, knows I cannot defend myself,
      and employs his power in tormenting me.”
A convulsion passed across Madame Elaguine’s face; it dropped, like that of a dying person.
      But she started up suddenly, and went on with her story. For ten years nearly she had been
       persecuted in this mysterious way; threatening letters had
      come to her by all manner of conveyances,—brought by the post, found on her table, dropped by
      invisible hands at her feet. Attempts had been made to poison her, stopped just in time to let
      her know of them—for the object seemed rather to make her life unbearable than to take it
      away; burning spirits of wine had been poured under her door; twice she had been shot at. But
      the most terrible part of the persecution had come when they had discovered her passionate
      love for her little girl (the boy, now at school, they had somehow let alone). Several times,
      in various places (for she was always on the move, flying her enemies), attempts had been made
      to carry off the child; once, at Cannes, she had gone to the window just in time to see a man
      snatch up the child, who was playing in the garden, and to fire off a revolver at him.
“If I had killed my child,” said Madame Elaguine, savagely, “it would have been better than
      to see her carried away from me.”

The individual who had made these attempts she described as being very dark, as if his
      complexion had been altered by overdoses of nitrate of silver. And this man would every now
      and then, at unexpected moments, reappear, and his reappearance meant some fresh outrage. Poor
      little Helen had suddenly seen him, or thought she had seen him, among the crowd coming out of
      the theatre; and this had produced the child’s sudden fit.
“Ever since I have come to London,” said Madame Elaguine, “I have been comparatively quiet.
      I was almost forgetting all about my misfortunes, or thinking I was forgotten—and here it
      begins afresh;” and she burst into tears.
“Oh why, why cannot I be permitted to be happy for a little while—only a little while?” she
      cried.
Anne had listened awe‐stricken. She had always thought there was something mysterious about
      this giddy little woman. This frightful undeserved calamity struck down her
       imagination; what right had she ever to feel unhappy in the
      presence of such misery as this?
“Perhaps,” she suggested timidly—“perhaps it may have been Helen’s fancy. As she is used to
      the idea of this black man, she may have imagined, being tired and overexcited from the play,
      that she saw him among the crowd.”
“Oh no, no, it was he, really he,” moaned Madame Elaguine, turning over on the sofa and
      burying her face in its cushions.
“You must go now,” whispered Anne to Hamlin; “there is no earthly use in your staying. I
      will sit up with her till she be quiet. Good night.”
“Good night;” and Hamlin, as he noiselessly opened the door, cast a last glance at that
      singular group in the rose‐coloured light of his cousin’s lamp,—Sacha, with her fur and lace
      all in disarray, gasping on the couch, her bare throat heaving, and one of her thin white arms
      hanging loosely by her side; and Anne
       Brown, in her long plain white dress of high art simplicity
      of cut, stooping over her. For some time Anne sat by Sacha’s side, holding the Russian’s hot
      hand.
“Is Walter gone?” suddenly asked Madame Elaguine, turning her head.
“Mr Hamlin went some minutes ago.”
Madame Elaguine raised herself and sat up on the sofa, and passed her little hands through
      her disorderly yellow hair.
“Give me a kiss, Annie,” she said.
Anne stooped down and kissed her.
“Perhaps I had better go to bed now,” said Madame Elaguine.
“Shall I help you to undress?” asked Anne, who feared that Hamlin’s cousin might have
      another fit of hysterics.
“Oh no; call Sophie—she will undress me.”
On Anne’s call, the Swiss maid emerged from the next room.
“Put me to bed,” ordered Sacha, rising and leaning on the arm of the sofa.

“May I really not help you?” asked Anne, for the maid looked so indifferent, nay, so sulky,
      and she seemed to handle her mistress so roughly, that Miss Brown wondered how Madame
      Elaguine, in her state of nerves, could endure to be helped by her.
Anne waited till Madame Elaguine was in bed.
“I have made up the bed for Mademoiselle in the spare room,” said the maid, looking at Anne
      with a curious insolence; and she led her up‐stairs. Anne did not put out the lamp, and she
      did not undress. She could not sleep; and she felt miserable at the notion of Madame Elaguine
      being left all alone on the first floor. What if the little woman should wake up with a panic,
      if she were to fancy that some of her mysterious persecutors were hiding in her room? Anne
      took the lamp, and silently descended into the drawing‐room. All was quiet. She sat down in an
      arm‐chair, and made up the dying fire. She felt very restless and unable to sleep. The whole
      scene
       of this night and Sacha’s revelations had shaken her nerves
      and gone to her imagination. In her half‐drowsy, dreamy condition, everything seemed to her
      strange and eerie in this room, which was so unlike her own at Hammersmith. It was full of
      pretty things, but in great confusion; Sacha’s piano was still open, with a book of
      Rubinstein’s songs on it. There was a heap of dog’s‐eared French novels and recent volumes of
      poetry on the table, and the whole room was heavy with the scent of some Eastern drug and of
      Madame Elaguine’s Turkish cigarettes. On the table by Anne’s side were some books: she took up
      one, and opened it at random; it was Hamlin’s new volume. At the head of the page was the
      title, “Desire—XII. Sonnets,” and all along the margin was a faint line in pencil, and the
      words, in a childish hand, “How beautiful! and how TRUE!”
