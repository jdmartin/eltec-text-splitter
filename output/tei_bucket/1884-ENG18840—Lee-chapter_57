CHAPTER VIII.
“DO you know, Annie,” said Melton Perry, two or three days later, “I find Watty
      very much altered. He seems so fearfully depressed and broken‐spirited. He used always to be
      bored, but not like this; he has got to look so old, with those great rings under his
      eyes.”
Miss Brown did not answer. Hamlin had returned the previous evening from Paris, and she also
      had noticed that he was changed—not so much, indeed, as Melton Perry seemed to think, for
      Melton Perry had not seen him for four or five years; and she—she had watched a change coming
      over him during the last months. Yet even she must own to herself that this change had made
      rapid progress during his fortnight or three weeks in Paris, or at least that this absence
       enabled her to notice the change much more. He was even
      more than usually apathetic and silent, and his pleasure at seeing his old friend once more
      was so slight, or rather so tempered by a kind of indifference and even annoyance, that Miss
      Brown felt perfectly nervous lest poor warm‐hearted Melton Perry should feel mortally wounded.
      The next day Hamlin made an effort over himself: he seemed anxious to be as kind as possible
      to Perry; but somehow it did not succeed. Melton Perry would have liked, as he said, to have
      Walter all to himself, to sit with him by the hour together, or walk out alone with him,
      talking of old times; but Hamlin seemed possessed by a nervous dread of a tête‐à‐tête. He could not sit in the studio with Perry for more than
      half an hour without, on some excuse or other, calling his aunt or Miss Brown. He seemed to
      have invited a lot of people to drop in at all hours, as if to protect him from his old
      friend.
“It’s awfully good of old Hamlin to wish me to know all these grand swell painters and
       newspaper writers,” said Perry to Anne, in the tone of a
      disappointed child; “and I suppose it is very useful to me. But still, I wish I
      could get him to understand that what I want at present is to see just him and you; that all
      these confounded influential people will keep; and that I’d rather have a good talk over a
      pipe with him alone, as in old days.”
Anne did not answer. It seemed to her that she understood so well why Hamlin dreaded a
       tête‐à‐tête with Melton Perry; a tête‐à‐t;ête which would be, largely, a talk about the past and the future, about
      her, Anne Brown. But Anne could not think about poor Perry and his disappointed friendliness;
      her whole nature seemed to be staggering and reeling, and the concerns of other folk were as
      distant, as unattainable, as they might be to a person tossed for hours on a stormy sea,
      paralysed, removed as it were from the world by an unspeakable sense of nausea. The days
      seemed to reel past, and yet not a week was gone since the arrival of Melton Perry.
One afternoon, they were seated—Hamlin,
       Perry, and she—with Mrs Macgregor at tea in the dim,
      shuttered drawing‐room, with the heavy scent of flowers, when Richard Brown was announced. If
      a ghost had appeared on the threshold, Anne could not have turned paler, and trembled harder
      in all her limbs—this man, whom she had seen but a week ago, seemed indeed a spectre out of
      the past, the long dead past, with which all connection was severed. It was an immense relief
      to her not to be alone; she had an instinct that Richard had come to ask her whether, at last,
      she had settled matters with Hamlin; she thought she could see his eyes going from Hamlin’s
      face to her own inquiringly. The conversation was languid and indifferent. Richard Brown
      wished for an explanation from her; Melton Perry hoped for an explanation from Richard Brown;
      Hamlin looked on passively, with that half‐stupefied look which she had noticed in him
      lately.
Hamlin was more than merely depressed, he was very sad; his face, so handsome and still so
      young, so perfectly unmarked in feature,
       contrasted strikingly with the pleased, happy‐go‐lucky,
      kindly face of Perry; with the strong, eager, contemptuous face of Brown. For a moment Anne
      wondered what this sadness meant; whether there was in him any recollection of what he was, of
      what he might be; whether the poet, the dreamer, the chivalrous Hamlin of former days, still
      existed and suffered within this weak and degraded Hamlin of the present; and then, suddenly,
      this thought came in violent contact with the remembrance of Perry’s story of Constantine
      Bulzo. Had Constantine Bulzo looked like that?
Richard Brown, obviously disappointed in his visit, rose.
“Why are you going so soon, Brown ?” asked Hamlin, rising and making an effort over himself;
      “you never give me a chance of seeing you. Won’t you stay to dinner? It is very impertinent of
      me to invite people in a house that isn’t mine; but I feel sure Miss Brown is disappointed in
      not having had any talk with you. Chough is coming to see Perry
       this evening, so you and your cousin might have a chat
      after dinner.”
He spoke simply, in his quiet, subdued, melancholy voice. Richard Brown looked at him
      rapidly from head to foot; what was the meaning of this? And Anne felt herself growing very
      red. Had Hamlin guessed what she scarcely herself knew?
“Thank you,” answered Richard; “I am dining with some of my would‐be constituents to‐night.
      You know,” he said to Anne, “I am going into Parliament, I believe. I will return soon; many
      thanks, Mr Hamlin.”
“I have a good many things to tell you, Nan,” he said, as Miss Brown accompanied him to the
      room‐door. “I have heard of a scholarship which I am sure you could take if you would cram for
      six months; and I want to ask you a lot of things also. I will come back in two or three days.
      Good‐bye.”
He squeezed her hand; and Anne felt her heart thump at that hand‐squeeze, so frank and
      affectionate.

“Good‐bye, Cousin Dick,” she said. Her voice and eyes and hand lingered in that farewell, in
      a way quite unusual to her reserved and decided nature. She was saying goodbye she knew not
      exactly to what, but she felt that the farewell was the last, and that it meant farewell to
      her happiness.
Chough came to dinner and stayed during the evening.
When he and Hamlin had taken their departure, Perry remained for a few moments standing by
      the open window, looking vacantly at the trees, the outlines of the craft moored opposite, the
      long trails of moonlight on the water. Then he came back into the room, and began fiddling
      with some roses in a glass.
“Beautiful roses,” he said, in an awkward drawl; “we have none like them in Italy. Why don’t
      Italians cultivate flowers? What do you call this? Is it a La France? I never knew a turnip
      from a jasmine.”
“I think it is a La France; I don’t know,” answered Anne, taking a candlestick off the
       dining‐room mantelpiece. “I think I must leave you now. You
      will find a box of cigarettes on the sideboard. Forgive me, I feel so tired and stupid.”
“One moment!” cried Perry. “It’s a very disagreeable thing I have to say, Annie; but I think
      I ought to say it. I guessed it the second time I saw him already; but now I am quite sure of
      it—Hamlin drinks.”
Anne did not answer.
“I don’t mean to say that he gets drunk. But he drinks—spirits; I’ve seen him to‐night after
      dinner, and I’m sure he’s going to take more at home. There’s no mistaking the look. It isn’t
      that he takes much, not more than I or most men might take; but it is that he oughtn’t to take
      any. He used, you know, never even to take wine, except with gallons of water. He can’t take
      anything of the sort. I remember already when we were at college together, Watty was a
      teetotaller. It appears some people are like that; I’ve heard doctors say that it’s not
      unusual in families where
       there has been much drinking: it’s a sort of diseased
      sensitiveness to alcohol—it becomes a kind of poison. You know that Hamlin’s father drank, and
      one of his uncles died of drink, and his brother is either dead or dying, somewhere in a
       maison de santé, of a sort of mixed delirium tremens and craziness. It’s a thing,” went on Perry, keeping his eyes
      fixed on the pattern of the Persian rug under his feet, “which grieves and alarms me horribly;
      and in which I feel that you are probably the only person who could have any influence with
      him. It’s useless my speaking. He must have got in among a bad lot. That little Chough seems
      harmless enough;but I hear that he was very close with a nasty fellow called Lewis—a
      spiritualist, opium‐eater, haschisch‐eater, and heaven knows what. Does he see much of him
      now?”
“He has quarrelled with Edmund Lewis, I fancy.”
“Ah—so much the better. Then this would evidently be the moment to act. Of course
       I know it will be awfully difficult and horrible for you;
      because he’ll feel so miserably ashamed before you, and, of course, you will feel it almost as
      badly as he. But still, you are the only person that can influence him. You see he loves you,
      worships you, all that sort of thing. And I am sure you will have the courage to get over your
      repugnance to a disagreeable half‐hour, won’t you, Annie, for your own sake as well as
      his?”
“I will do my best,” said Miss Brown.
