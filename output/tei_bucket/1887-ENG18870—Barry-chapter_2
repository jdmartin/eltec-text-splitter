CHAPTER II SIBYLLINE MUSIC
On entering the drawing-room he found some ten or twelve persons, of whom he knew
      none but his host, standing about in the mournful way which seems to have been prescribed by a
      Plutonian master of ceremonies for the minutes preceding dinner. Every one was hungry, and
      even the ladies looked pensive or distracted, for the hour was late. Glanville had no gift of
      taking in a company at a glance; he was led forward blindly, introduced to Lady May Davenant,
      who presided over her father's household (for the Earl was a widower), and whose face, as she
      was standing with her back to the light, he could scarcely see,—bowed submissively to another
      lady whose name he did not catch, but to whom he offered his arm with the readiness required
      of him, dinner being that instant announced; and moved on to the dining-room not unwillingly,
      for all the romantic scene of lights upon the sea which curtains now shut out and
       the flowers and subdued lamps of a dinner-table replaced.
Dazzled though he often was on coming into a room, Glanville had quick eyes and ears. When,
      in Homeric phrase, his mind was getting the better of its desire of meat and drink,—in other
      words, when an excellent soup and a glass of old sherry left him philosophically calm and
      capable of observation,—he looked across the ferns and surveyed the assembled guests at his
      leisure. Mr. Tom Davenant, who had followed him into the drawing-room, was now sitting
      opposite by the side of a clerical-looking lady whose partner in life was not far to seek; for
      the only clergyman present (he had said grace, but of course Glanville did not hear him) at
      that moment drew all eyes by remarking in a cheerful voice to the Earl that his two volumes of
      the Life of King Arthur would be out to-morrow. Glanville, a little alarmed at the
      announcement, earnestly scrutinised the speker's countenance. It was a bright, good humoured
      face, betokening no malice, and made veneable by the crown of white hair which set off a
      noble-looking head. Lord Trelingham, however, replied that Mr. Truscombe's work could not have
      appeared at a better time; it would no doubt help Mr. Glanville to more vividly reproduce the
      local colouring which their frescoes in the Great Hall would demand. Mr. Truscombe was the
      clergyman of the parish, expressly invited to meet the artist on the ground of his being
      learned beyond all others in British antiquities, and
       already famous by his great book on the holy wells of Cornwall and Cumbria.
      Glanville received this piece of news with a polite air, but inwardly began to chafe at the
      appearance of King Arthur and British antiquities during dinner. No one could be more
      sensitive, or less given to the jargon of his trade than he. So sensitive, indeed, was the
      man, that he had not yet overcome his vexation on hearing from Tom Davenant that the Earl had
      spoken of him as 'the artist who was to paint the Great Hall.' He did not know that he should
      paint it. One thing was certain: if he undertook the design he must be left to his own
      inspirations, or it would be a failure. He had hoped to come down as an invited guest with no
      preliminary flourish of trumpets, to meditate upon the work in solitude, alone with Art, his
      unseen mistress; and here was a whole dinner-table ready perhaps to ask him, 'What were his
      ideas?' or, worse still, to brings out their own by way of suggestion. Glanville was a fiery,
      shy, unmanageable spirit, quite beyond Lord Trelingham's comprehension. The Earl could not
      have dreamt what thoughts were passing through his mind at the mention of Mr. truscombe's
       King Arthur and the short discussion to which it gave rise. For an instant the
      design which had brought Glanville from London was in danger. He had more than once started at
      the shadow of interference and flung his work aside. Could he but have done so now! Innocent
      Mr. Truscombe would then have proved himself the Deus ex machina , the divine agency
      that
       cuts an otherwise insoluble knot and gives the tragic story a happy ending,—or
      rather, in this case, the tragedy would never have begun. But no, the personages of the play,
      on the very point of falling asunder and going out by their several exits, were drawn once
      more by invisible threads into a fated group. Glanville mastered, though not without an
      effort, the spasm of rage that had seized upon him. At clever evasions he was skilful; and,
      while he took care that there should be no talk of King Arthur that evening, so far as he was
      concerned, only a very keen observer would have known how angry the allusion had made him. It
      was an evil omen. Instead of the 'auspicious bird' with which he had hoped to begin, he felt
      as if a raven or other illboding visitant were flapping its wings over the painted scene in
      which already his imagination was roving.
Conversation at the Earl's end of the table floated to a fresh topic. Another voice struck
      in, that of Lord Hallamshire, one of his oldest friends, and, like himself, devoted to the
      interests of the catholicising party in the Church of England. Lord Hallamshire presided at
      meeting innumerable for the adoption, defence, or further strengthening of the eastward
      position; visited the confessors of the faith in prison; subscribed handsomely to missionary
      efforts for explaining to the natives of the Andaman and neighbouring islands the exact
      difference between a cope and a chasuble; and was a large, good, dull man,
       with heavy brows and an immovable countenance. His enormous nose, as I have often
      observed in persons of Lord Hallamshire's type, indicated solidity rather than sagacity, and a
      firm grasp of the prosaic side of things. He was now, after some floundering about, holding
      straight on in an account of what had been acccomplished by the Guild of St. Austell to get
      the orders of the English Church fully recognised by their Eastern brethren. Their success
      with the Catholicus of babylon, so far, had been all they could wish.
'The Catholicus of Babylon!' said Glanville, who had recovered his good-humour; 'is that the
      same as the Pope of Rome?'
Tom Davenant looked at the Earl and broke into a very pleasant smile. But Lord Trelingham,
      who had no sense of the ludicrous, replied with much gravity, 'The same as the Pope of Rome!
      Oh dear, no! I see your mistake, which was quite natural. It is true that St. Peter dates an
      epistle from Babylon which our brethren of the Western Obedience interpret as Rome. But the
      Catholicus is independent of Rome, like our own archbishop. He sits in the place of St. —' He
      hesitated, trying to remember the name.
'St. Daniel?' inquired Tom Davenant, to the Earl's consternation, who became yet more
      confused and quite at a loss. The young man continued innocently, 'I know I learnt some poetry
      at school about Babylon where Daniel comes in as a sort of bishop. It began— "'Belshazzar gave
      a feast at Babylon in his hall.'" 

'Be quiet, Tom,' said lady May, from the end of the table. 'You might at least quote
      accurately. You have spoilt the rhythm of the verse.' Then, turning to her father, 'St.
      Paphnutius is the name,' she said.
Glanville, who had not observed Lady May hitherto, looked at her in amazement. It was rude,
      but how could he help it? Was she an embodied dictionary of ecclesiastical worthies,—a
      blue-stocking, thus to hand her father a name like Paphnutius as unconcerned and gracefully as
      though it were a cup of tea? What was her age? She seemed six or seven-and-twenty; yes, it was
      the period when ladies began to do these things. He disliked learned women; they seemed to him
      unfeminine, the most beautiful thing in the world spoilt. And so he looked too steadfastly at
      Lady May. She might have noticed, had not the younger lady whom Glanville had taken into
      dinner, and who had been hitherto very quiet, added to the bizarre effect of Daniel and
      Belshazzar by remarking, 'My dear May, I met this very Catholicus of Babylon, who has said
      such civil things of your church, last week in Paris, at Madame de Mont-Bazeille's. An
      extraordinarily handsome man, of about thirty-six. He has a face like a statue, and the
      darkest of dark eyes. But his beard was not so long as I expected. His costume was splendid,—a
      kind of Oriental satin, of which even Worth does not know the name, for I asked him. And
      charmingly made up with a ruche, you know, of strange old lace. I daresay it
       cost a fortune. Monseigneur Sidarlik they called him.'
'That is the name,' said Lord Hallamshire; 'it is odd you should have met him in Paris. His
      letter to the Guild was dated Constantinople.'
'Oh, he came on account of the slave-trade,' said the lady. 'I heard why, but it has gone
      out of my head.'
'Doubtless,' said Lord Trelingham in his gentle voice, 'it was to ask the French Government
      whether they could not stop the importation of slaves into Syria. I hope he succeeded in his
      benevolent mission.'
'I remember now,' said the young lady; 'no, it was very amusing. Monseigneur Sidarlik came
      to consult a great firm in Paris which gives young girls a dot ,—what are they
      called? Ah, yes, the Prix Montyon de l' Orient ; they send them to the East, and by
      way of Armenia to Russia, where they marry into the households of our great nobles. The
      Catholicus is their agent in his part of the world; and the number exported had fallen off,
      and he came to make fresh arrangements. We were all so much amused at the idea of going to
      Asia for a husband.'
Lord Trelingham looked aghast. 'My dear Countess,' he said, 'you must be mistaken. This is
      dreadful. The Catholicus would never engage in such proceedings; he is perfectly orthodox. You
      must have heard the wrong story.'
Lord Hallamshire thought so too. The Countess
       shrugged her shoulders and did not argue the point; but she held her own opinion.
      Whether, indeed, she were maligning a blameless prelate, or casting a powerful side-light on
      the manners and customs of Babylonian Christians, in any case, the subject became too
      difficult to dwell upon. Lady May inquired of Tom Davenant what he had been doing. He
      bethought himself of the remarkable meeting with Glanville, and drew the artist into the
      conversation; and the Earl's daughter, though her sentences were brief, and she guided their
      talk rather than shared in it, kept them off the dangerous themes of painting and religion.
      Her expression, while she thus fulfilled the duties of her place, was somewhat fatigued. She
      wore an air of listlessness. But her lips were proud and firm; and Glanville found himself
      comparing her voice to the sound of a harp. It was a rich contralto, full of depth and
      resonance, which gave the commonest words a feeling. What she spoke was not trivial, but it
      could not be intimate, uttered across a dining-table; yet there was something,—there was a
      story to make out, Glanville fancied, though he could not have said why. If she were a
      blue-stocking, then blue-stockings might be wonderfully impressive. Lady May rose, and the
      gentlemen fell into politics when they were left to themselves. But Glanville sat considering.
      He was haunted by the look and still more by the voice of his hostess.
She was not exactly beautiful—or was she? The features were regular, the eyes dark and full;
      cheek
       and throat of a ruddy brown, and hair as black as night. There was intelligence
      in the forehead, and a proud decision in her movements. Yet in those dark eyes was a far-off
      look, uncertain, questioning, in the closed lips a habit of self-repression. Could it be that
      she was unhappy? passionate she seemed by temperament, inclinning to despise those about her.
      And the voice again,—'fire and sweetness,' he said to himself. 'Am I falling in love?' he
      concluded, with and inward smile. But he was glad when the Earl invited them to join the
      ladies. He wanted to hear the harp-like tones, to study the character a little more.
He was fortunate. The windows of the drawing-room opened on the terrace; and a mild evening,
      with the moon making daylight all over the land and shimmering softly out at sea, drew them
      into the open air. It was not a formal party. Except Glanville, they were all old
      acquaintance; and Mr. and Mrs. Truscombe were, that night, staying like the rest at
      Trelingham. Tom Davenant went away to smoke with the clergyman; the others fell into little
      groups; and lady May, in her quality of hostess, came to Mr. Glanville where he stood with the
      Earl, and inquired whether he found his room comfortable. Her father turned to her, 'Thank you
      so much, my dear,' he said, 'for helping me to the name of St. Paphnutius. What a wonderful
      memory you have! I cannot remember names at all, and it gets one into such difficulties when
      one has to make a speech. But you never forget them.'

'It is easier,' said Lady May gently, 'to remember a name for you, papa, even if it is so
      out of the way as Paphnutius than to see you in trouble over it.'
'So,' thought Glanville, 'she is not a church dictionary after all; she is only an
      affectionate daughter. I am glad of it.'
Just then Lord Trelingham was called away. The artist found himself alone with the lady, and
      was not a little surprised when, after a pause of a moment or two, she began, 'I fear Mr.
      Truscombe's new book will not be so agreeable to you as to the good man himself. It is a pity
      the publication should occur just whem you are designing your plans for the great Hall.'
Glanville could only say in some confusion, 'Really, I don't know. Why do you think so?
      Perhaps I did not show sufficient interest in the Life of King Arthur . I hope I was
      not in any way rude to Mr. truscombe?'
'Oh no,' said Lady May; 'but there was something you did not like. My father is the most
      considerate of men, and admires art and artists. But he does not quite, I think, enter into
      the nture of their work; he does not know that inspiration is easily checked. He would fancy
      that you and mr. Truscombe might, to some extent, combine your gifts in the decoration on
      which he has set his heart. But if I understand—perhaps I do not—the quality of your painting,
      I should think it impossible for you to do so. And I saw you were annoyed.'

'Well,' said Glanville, half ashamed of himself, 'I was. I may not have any inspiration to
      boast of; and no doubt Mr. Truscombe could teach me about the local colour. But I have always
      worked alone, and a partner would be unendurable to me. At least,' he continued, with a sort
      of laugh, 'there is only one from whom I ask advice, and I seldom take it then.'
'He must be a man of genius,' said Lady May, not sarcastically, but as if she really thought
      so, 'for your painting has so much that is peculiar. I cannot imagine two minds, much less two
      pairs of hands, engaged in it.'
The artist felt astonished; had this lady studied his works closely? And why was her
      admiration so unreserved? He answered:
'My friend does not paint, but he knows all that has been done in painting, and everything
      else, I think. His advice, like that of the demon of Socrates, is chiefly negative. But it is
      the serverest criticism; it takes down the studio walls and lets in the sun.'
'How very interesting!' cried Lady May; 'and is he known? Has he written anything?'
'Not a line. He is quite unknown, and will never be famous.'
They fell into silence. The Earl did not return. His daughter, as if absorbed in thought,
      looked out over the moor towards the distant sparkle of the waves. At last she said again, 'I
      wonder by what secret association it is that one thinks of rain and
       storm on such an evening as this? There is not a cloud to be seen.'
'And are you thinking of rain and storm?' said the artist.
'My imagination, I suppose I must call it, has been whispering to me of rain since we came
      on the terrace. Rain, coming down soft and steady, without a moment's pause; and the wind
      sighing through it, yet not blowing it away. It is strange that fancy should play these
      tricks. What is the association with a still landscape and radiant moon?'
'Contrast,' said Glanville; 'if we only knew why contrasts suggest each other, or why
      extremes meet. It is too deep a philosophy. But,' he went on slowly, 'there is something in
      your description of dark rain and wind that reminds me of I know not what musician; of some
      one who has put into his composition the voice of a long-continued, hopeless, weeping tempest,
      which sobs as though it would fain hush itself to sleep and could not.'
'Oh,' said Lady May, looking pleased, 'have you those feelings when you hear music? Do you
      translate it into figures of people moving, scenery, a sense that you are journeying on and on
      into unknown lands? I am constantly doing so.'
'And I, too,' replied he; 'but in my fanciful accompaniment there are always battles. mighty
      conflicts upon which the fate of the world seems to hanf. Yes, it was a movement of Chopin's
      that you described, the very spirit of the rain moaning to
       itself secretly. Do you play? You may have the music.'
'Yes, I play,' said the lady, 'and there are many of Chopin's works in the drawing-room.'
      She turned and looked towards it. No lights were visible. The moon made a great square of
      silver where it shone in at the long windows opening to the ground.
'Then,' said Glanville, 'let me ask you to lay the rain-spirit with Chopin's nocturne. Let
      it weep itself to death on the piano.'
They walked towards the entrance; and as they were going in the Countess joined them. 'May,'
      she said, 'are you going to play? I want you to choose something that will take the moonlight
      out of my eyes. It has made me quite sleepy; and you must wake me up.' And she threw herself
      with the look of a tired child on a sofa near the open window.
'No, karina,' replied Lady May; 'I shall send you to sleep now. You can wake up afterwards.'
      Glanville lit the wax candles in a pair of antique sconces which adorned the piano. Their
      feeble light left a deep shadow in the centre of the room. The moon looked in at the window;
      on the terrace outside nothing stirred. It was a lovely scene, hushed in silence; a world all
      fresh, calm, and beautiful, lifted up into night and poesy. The music, found as soon as looked
      for, was opened; Glanville stood by, to turn over the leaves; and Lady May, seating herself,
      struck the opening chords.
A few bars of sad, slow meditation, passing into
       lament, into longing, expectancy, disappointment; and then the sighing music
      seemed to gather the winds out of heaven, and breathe all its sorrow into them and send them
      wandering abroad; and by and by, as the listner fancied, the skies had turned to rain, and all
      round were the falling showers, soft, steady, unbroken, as they had been pictured to him,
      every moment more sombre, blotting out the light. He seemed to hear the thunderous harmonies
      with their muffed, threatening roll; and fire came into the rain and struck through it; and
      the music grew shrill and weird, only to sink down again into faint monotonous sobbing. All at
      once, as it seemed coming to an end, there rose up as from the heart of the spent storm a
      human voice. With not unlike cadence and alternation of feeling, now proudly defiant, now
      self-accusing and full of regret, now fainting to utter weariness, it in some way repeated and
      intensified the passionate throbbings of Chopin's nocturne. Glanville started from his
      reverie. It was lady May, improvising as in subtle reminiscence of the notes before her a
      chant in some southern tongue, that recalled the phases of the strange composition and put
      upon them a definite and heart-shaking meaning. The words were foreign to Glanville's ear; the
      accents of grief were not; and he stood motionless and embarrassed, like one who witnesses an
      outbreak of unsuspected wildness where all has hitherto been self-control. Lady May took no
      heed of him; she had forgotten his existence it seemed, and she went
       on shaping, as he could not doubt, her words to the music, until in the gentlest
      whisperings of resignation they became softer and softer, and at last went out in silence. It
      was like seeing the curtain fall on a tragedy.
'Oh, May,' cried the Countess, starting up, 'do you call that playing me to sleep? I am
      trembling all over. Where did you find that horrible piece of music? It was enough to curdle
      the blood in one's veins. Do you not think,' she said to the artist, 'that my cousin ought to
      be ashamed of frightening us so? I always say she has the voice of a Medea, or a
      stage-murderess. Don't you agree with me?'
Glanville muttered dissent of acquiescence, it would be impossible to say which, and could
      not take his eyes off Lady May. What sort of temperament was it that broke loose in such
      perilous fashion? Was it only te genius of an actress, metamorphosed by fate into an earl's
      daughter, yet unable to subdue its natural longings and in this way satisfying them? A Medea!
      There could be no question of it. Were that untamable disposition to be roused, it would,
      while the frenzy lasted, be as little capable of pity as the tigress. And yet how tender had
      some passages of the improvisation sounded! He was at a loss; he could not tell what to think,
      except that in this high-born, delicately-nurtured lady there were unknown possibilities of
      good and evil.
She met his glance, and said, with a shade of diffidence, 'I learned to improvise when I was
      a
       child in Italy; and the pleasure of attempting it is sometimes irresistible. I
      hope you were not frightened, like my cousin Karina. She is terrified at everything.'
'Indeed, I am not,' said Karina petulantly; 'but I never could endure your grand style of
      singing—you know I adore you when you are quiet—since the day it made me fall off the steps at
      Genoa with surprise.'
'You were a silly child,' said Lady May, 'and you fell because you would look back and make
      faces at me, instead of seeing where you were going.' And they both laughed at the
      remembrance.
The rest of the party now came in; tea was handed by the orthodox ministers that accompanied
      the urn; Lady May did all that could be required at the hands of an attentive daughter and
      hostess; and Glanville struggled with an eerie feeling, as if he had seen her in the form of
      panther or tigress vanishing in the twilight, which had now succeeded on the moon's going
      down. When he retired to his room the feeling was still upon him, uncanny, disagreeable. He
      was not equal to much railway travelling, and fatigue soon sent him to sleep; but in the dim
      caverns of unconsciousness he seemed again and again to hear the falling rain, drip, drip,
      drip, and the murmurs, fierce or tender, of unassuaged passion, its endless long-drawn
      sighings, till he sank into depths of slumber where no voice came.
