CHAPTER III.
"Do you know that Willy has been sent down again?"
Six weeks have passed since Burgoyne's eye followed his quondam friends down Mesopotamia,
      and he is not in Oxford now. He left it, indeed, twenty-four hours after the rencounter
      described; left it with something of a determination never to revisit it. This, too, in spite
      of the good Brown's vociferously reiterated invitation to him to run down for another Sunday,
      whenever he should feel inclined, and which he accepted civilly, knowing that he should never
      feel inclined.
At the present moment he is pacing up and down the still wintry, north-windswept walks of a
      country-house garden in Shropshire, in the company of a lady whom he has known as long as he
      can remember; a lady who would have been a friend of circumstance, even if she had not been
      one of choice, since her home has been in the immediate neighbourhood of the only one he has
      ever had; a lady whose friendship he has tested by letters on thin paper from New Guinea and
      Central Africa all about himself; at whose feet he has laid on his return more heads, and
      skins, and claws than she has well known what to do with; whose husband he thought a very good
      fellow, and to whom he wrote a very nice letter on that husband's death; lastly, concerning
      whose only child has been made the communication that opens this chapter—"Do you know that
      Willy has been sent down again?"
"I did not know it; but I am very sorry now that I do know."
"You need not be," returns she cheerfully; "he does not mind it in the least; indeed,
      happily for him, most of his friends have been sent down too."
"What has he been doing this time? Putting the porter into the fountain? or screwing up the
      Dean? or what other playful little pleasantry?"
"You need not speak in that nasty sarcastic voice," says she, half laughing and half vexed.
      "After all, you must know that young men will be young men, or, at least, if you do not know
      it now, you must have known it once."
"If you take that tone to me," retorts Burgoyne, smiling, "I shall have to souse your
      gardener in your fountain, to prove my juvenility; but come, what has he done?"
"Absolutely nothing, as far as I can make out," replies she, spreading out her hands as if
      to emphasize the statement.
"Do you mean to say that the authorities have sent him down de gaieté de cœur,
      without any provocation at all?" asks Burgoyne, in a tone out of which he is unable to keep a
      shade of incredulity.
"I mean to say," replies she, nettled, "that he had a few men to supper, and I suppose they
      were making a little noise; did you ever in your day hear of an undergraduate supper where
      there was not noise? However, in this case, from what he tells me, Willy was taking positively
      no part in it."
"He was sitting in a corner, with cotton-wool in his ears, reading Aristotle," suggests
      Burgoyne teasingly.
"And it seems," continued she, not deigning to notice the interruption, "that the Proctor
      came in, and was very rude, and Willy was told to go to the Dean next morning, and he either
      was a little late, or mistook the hour, or some trifle of that sort; and when he did go he was
      told that he was sent down. However"—with some triumph in her voice—"it did not matter in the
      least—he did not mind; in fact, he was rather glad, as he has long wanted to go to Italy in
      the spring."
"To Italy? Then perhaps we shall meet; I too am going to Italy."
"Are you?" she says. "Why should you go to Italy? There is nothing to kill there, is there?
      Is not it at Naples that they go out in full chasseur uniform to shoot tomtits?" Which speech
      is her revenge for his sarcasms upon her son.
But Burgoyne's face has taken on a rather careworn look; and her little arrow misses its
      mark.
"You see, Amelia is at Florence," he says explanatorily; "her father, Mr. Wilson, had a
      clergyman's throat in the autumn, and was obliged to give up duty, so they all went abroad.
      They have been abroad all the winter; you know that I have not seen her since I came back from
      the Rockies."
They are now walking in a winding shrubbery path, whose laurels protect them from the
      pinching wind. They have turned several corners, and traversed half a quarter of a mile before
      either again breaks silence. It is the lady who does so finally.
"Jim, how long have you been engaged to Amelia?"
There is a sigh mixed with his answer.
"Eight years—eight years this next June; it was the second summer term after I came up."
"And as far as you can see, you are likely to be engaged for another eight years?"
"As far as I can see—yes; but then I cannot see far."
Perhaps his companion is a fanciful woman; but she notices that this time he does not
      sigh.
"Poor Amelia!" she says, half under her breath.
"Poor Amelia!" repeats he sharply; "why poor?—for being engaged to me? You are not very
      complimentary, Mrs. Byng."
She looks up friendlily at him. "For being engaged to you, or being only engaged to
      you?—which? I leave you a choice of interpretation."
But either Jim is too ruffled by the pity expressed in her tone towards his betrothed, or
      her remarks have provoked in him a train of thought which does not tend towards loquacity. The
      loud rooks, balancing themselves on improbably small twigs above their heads, and, hoarsely
      melodious, calling out their airy vernal news to each other, make for some time the only sound
      that breaks the silence of the cold spring afternoon. It is again Mrs. Byng who at last
      infringes it.
"If you and Willy are both going to Italy, why should not you go together?"
Jim does not immediately answer; the project is sprung upon him with such suddenness that he
      does not at once know whether it is agreeable to him or the reverse.
"You do not like the idea?" continues the mother, trying, not very successfully, to keep out
      of her tone the surprise she feels at his not having jumped at a plan so obviously to his own
      advantage.
"I did not say so. I did not even think so."
"Willy is an ideal fellow-traveller," says she, "excepting in the matter of punctuality; I
      warn you"—laughing—"that you would always have to drag him out of bed."
"But," suggests Jim slowly, "even supposing that I embraced your design with the warmth
      which I see you think it deserves, how can you tell that it would meet with his approbation?
      He has probably made up a party with some of the other innocent victims of a corrupt
      University system."
"No, he has not; the friend with whom he was to have gone has thrown him over; at least,
      poor man, that is hardly the way to express it, for he has broken his leg; but anyhow he is
       hors de combat. If you went with Willy," she adds, after a pause, and with a rather
      wistful air, "I should be sure of knowing if anything went wrong."
"I am to dry-nurse him, in fact, only I stipulate that, if he brings you home a Contadina
      daughter-in-law, or 'commits himself with a countess,' like the commercial gentleman at
      Todgers's, you are not to hold me responsible."
And so it came to pass that a fortnight later, while April is still young, Burgoyne, en
       route to his Amelia, is standing at a window of the Hotel de Gênes at Genoa, noisiest of
      hotels, though, to be sure, that is its only fault. He is looking out at the gay market that
      is held in the piazza below—the gay market that is over and gone by nine o'clock.
It seems odd that so many women, so many umbrellas, so many baskets, so many oranges and
      lemons—each lemon with a glossy green leaf still adhering to its inch of stalk—so many fresh
      vegetables can be swept away in so short a time. But they are; all the gay kerchiefs are fled,
      and have been replaced by a row of fiacres with sad droop-headed horses, a good hour before
      Byng appears—appears radiantly well washed and apologetic.
"How many morning chapels did you attend last term?" asks Burgoyne with some dryness.
"It is a vile habit," replies the other sweetly, sitting down at a little table, and
      unfolding his breakfast napkin. "I do not mean going to chapel, but being so late; however, I
      really am improving. I am a quarter of an hour—twenty minutes earlier than I was yesterday,
      and, thank God, we have no train to catch to-day."
Burgoyne is rather inclined to echo the thanksgiving a little later in the day, as they
      stroll with the pleasant vagueness with which one strays about a little-known foreign town,
      not exactly knowing whither, through the streets of the queenly city, with which neither of
      them has much acquaintance; Byng's twenty-two years of school and college, of cricket, and
      grouse, and stalking, having left not much margin for aught else; and Burgoyne being in the
      case of some widely-wandered shots and explorers, to whom the Nyanza Lake and the Australian
      Bush are more familiar than Giotto's Campanile or the Lagoons. There is a grayish-looking
      English sky, with now and then little sprays of rain, and now and then flashes of warm
      sun.
Neither of the young men knows much Italian, and such as they possess they are ashamed to
      air before each other in asking their way, so they wander wherever chance or fancy leads them.
      They look curiously into churches, they walk down deep narrow streets, whose houses have for
      three centuries been threatening to embrace each other across the strait sky strip far, far
      above their heads. They glance at palace-fronts, and wonder at the sculptured portals where
      fresco and fruit garland and fine tracery speak of a time at more leisure for delicate work
      that has no end but beauty, than this breathless one. Everywhere in the gardens they see
      budding green, untrained roses making bowers, ripe oranges hanging over the walls. They jostle
      against women, each made charming, even the ugliest of them, by the black lace kerchief tied
      about her head.
"Henry James says that an English crowd is the best-looking in the world," says Byng, in a
      tone of strong dissent, following with his eyes a little tripping figure, and with an
      expression of pronounced approbation in those eyes, which gives Burgoyne a momentary twinge of
      misgiving as to his chaperonship. "I should put it the other way up, and say that they are the
      ugliest."
"All crowds are ugly, and most individuals," replies Burgoyne, misanthropically looking up
      from his guide-book.
They are sauntering down the Via Garibaldi, street of palaces that deserves an antiquer name
      than that of the somewhat shoddy and recent hero who has god-fathered it. Noblest Via, down
      whose stately length great towering bulks succeed each other in solid majesty on either hand;
      bulks on whose high fronts, lofty-portaled, o'errun with fresco, glorified by brush and
      chisel, strength and beauty take hands in unending wedlock. Into the noblest of all, up the
      echoing stone stairs, down which the feet of the masters have for ever ceased to tread, they
      enter. As we all know, it has been given to the city of Genoa—lovely queen-city meriting so
      great a gift—by the dying hand of its latest possessor, the last of that high and beautiful
      race—if we may judge of the dead by their pictures—who paced its floors, and went forth in
      final funeral pomp through its worthy-to-be-imperial portals.
Burgoyne and Byng are standing before the great Vandyke. The custode, opening a shutter, and
      throwing wider a door, casts a brighter ray of light for the staring Britons—several others
      have joined themselves to our friends—to gape at it by. What does the stately gentleman on his
      great white horse, whom Vandyke has made able to set at naught death's effacement, think of
      them, as the custode slowly swings him forward on his hinges, so that the day-beams may bring
      out more clearly still the arresting charm of his serious face, his outstretched arm, and
      grave, gallant bearing? Looking at him, whose heart among us is not besieged by an ache of
      longing that that "young and princely" gentleman on the brave white charger should ride down
      to us out of his frame, and bring back his world with him? probably not a better world than
      ours, but surely, surely a handsomer one.
After awhile the other tourists drift away, but the two men still stand and gaze. Into
      Burgoyne's mind has come a sense of disgust with the present, a revolt against steam trams and
      the Cromwell Road—most perfect symbol of that bald, unending, vulgar ugliness, which, in some
      moods, must seem to everyone the dominant note of nineteenth-century life. The light-hearted
      Byng, who always takes his colour from his surroundings, is hushed into a silence that is
      almost reverent too.
"What a difference there is between his Italian and his English pictures," he says
      presently. "Do you remember the Marchesa Balbi, and those divine Balbi children in the
      Grosvenor, last year? Oh, no! by-the-bye, you were in America. The fog seemed to get into his
      brush whenever he painted an Englishwoman, always excepting Henrietta Maria, who was not an
      Englishwoman, and whom he was obviously rather in love with."
"Is that a piece of scandal of your own invention, or is it founded on fact?" asks Burgoyne,
      rousing himself, and looking over his shoulder towards the entrance to the next frescoed,
      mirrored, pictured room, whence he hears the sound of approaching voices. In his eye is an
      idle and mechanical curiosity, mixed with vexation that his short respite from his
      fellow-countrymen is ended; in this case, it is fellow-countrywomen, for the tones that are
      nearing are those of a woman, a woman who is saying in a key of satisfaction, "Oh, here it is!
      I thought I remembered that it was in this room."
At the same moment the speaker, as well as the person addressed, came into sight; and in an
      instant out of Burgoyne's eye has raced away the lack-lustre curiosity, and has given way to
      an expression of something beyond surprise, of something more nearly verging on consternation;
      and yet, after all, there is nothing very astonishing in the fact that it is Mrs. Le Marchant
      who is the woman in search of the Vandyke. There is nothing more surprising in her being at
      Genoa than in his being there himself. At that mart of nations it can never be matter for
      wonder to meet anyone; but who is this to whom her observation is addressed? It is not Mr. Le
      Marchant, it is not a man at all; it is a slight woman—

"White as a lily, and small as a wand"—

like Lance's sister, dressed with that neat, tight, gray-tinted simplicity, severe yet
      smart, which marks the well-bred Englishwoman on her travels. Is it one of the younger ones,
      who has grown up so startlingly like her? Miriam? Rose? or is it, can it be, the dead
      Elizabeth?
