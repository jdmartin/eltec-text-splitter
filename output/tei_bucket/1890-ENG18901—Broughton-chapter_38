CHAPTER VIII.
"After all," says Mrs. Le Marchant presently, rallying a little, her naturally buoyant
      temperament—that temperament which she has transmitted with such curious fidelity to her
      child, coming to her rescue; "after all, there is no reason why you should see him, Elizabeth.
      There is no reason why she should see him, is there, Mr. Burgoyne? It could serve no possible
      end—could it?—and only be exceedingly painful to them both. You will explain to him, will not
      you? You will take any message from her? You will tell him that she really is not up to it,
      will not you? It is quite true, I am sure. You are not, are you darling? She is not, is
      she?"
The mother turns as she speaks eagerly from one to the other, addressing each in turn; but
      from neither does she obtain any answer.
"Or I would speak to him myself; if you thought that better," continues she, still
      interrogating them with her handsome, careworn eyes. "I would say anything you wished said to
      him, and I would be careful to say it as kindly as possible. I am sure he would understand; he
      would see the sense, the justice of it, would not he? There is no need for her to expose
      herself to such useless suffering, is there, Mr. Burgoyne?"—appealing desperately to him by
      name, since he will not respond to any less direct address—"when either you or I are more than
      ready to shield her from it, are not we?"
Thus apostrophized, Jim is compelled to break the silence, which seems to himself to wall
      him round like a petrifaction. It is to Elizabeth that he offers his hardly-won speech.
"I think I need not tell you," he says gravely, and with passable steadiness, "that I would
      help you in any way I could."
She stands a moment or two irresolute, her features all quivering as if with pain; and yet,
      underlying and under-shining the pain, something that is not pain. Then she puts out a hand
      impulsively to each. If the one that gives itself to Burgoyne had struck him on the mouth,
      instead of offering itself with affectionate confidence to his clasp, it could not have hurt
      him more than do those small fingers that lie in his, trembling with a passion that is not for
      him.
"You are both very good to me," she says brokenly. "As to you, mammy, that is an old story.
      But I really believe that there is nothing disagreeable that you, too"—with a slight grateful
      pressure of the lifeless hand that so slackly keeps possession of hers—"would not do for me.
      But do not think me obstinate if I say that I think—I am sure—that it would be better—that it
      would hurt him less—if I spoke to him myself."
"It is not a question of what will hurt him least," cries Mrs. Le Marchant, with an agony of
      impatience in her tone. "The thing to be considered is what will hurt you least. Mr.
      Burgoyne, am I not right? Do tell her that I am! Ought not she to think of what will hurt her
      least?"
But Jim is incapable of coming a second time to her rescue. His eyes are painfully fastened
      upon Elizabeth, and he is watching the pain fall off, as it were, from her face, and the light
      spread rosily over it. Some instinct makes her withdraw that hand of hers which he has shown
      so little eagerness to retain, ere she says, in a low but perfectly firm voice:
"Well, then, I think it will hurt me least, too."
Five minutes later Jim has left the room—ostensibly to make arrangements for his friend's
      arrival, in reality because he cannot count upon his own self-control if he remain in it. The
      survivors of Elizabeth Le Marchant's acquaintance remain undecapitated. The widow-headed Life
      Guardsman and the baby-bodied cornet lie unregarded on the table, while Elizabeth herself is
      stretched along the floor, with her face pressed against her mother's knees. Jim has decided
      to sit up for his friend. He is perfectly aware that neither will the two women go to bed. But
      he has no desire that their vigil should be shared in common. It is equally impossible to him
      to take part in the noisy mirth of the rest of the hotel, which, having taken the place of
      their measureless daylight ennui, now boils over in ebullient laughter, in dancing, squeaking,
      and noisily scampering out of the public drawing-room into the hall and up the stairs. It is
      not till the clamour has declined, until, indeed, its total cessation tells him that the
      promiscuous revellers have retired to their apartments, that he issues from his, and takes
      possession of the now empty smoking-room, whence he can hear more distinctly than from his own
      bedroom any noise of wheels approaching the hotel. The wind has risen again, and it needs an
      ear very finely pricked to dissever from its mad singing, and from the storming of the frantic
      rain, any lesser and alien sound. What a terrific night in which to be out on the raging sea!
      Worse even than that one last week, when the Moïse broke her shaft, and tossed for
      twenty-four hours at the mercy of the waves. Possibly the weather may have already yesterday
      been so rough at Marseille as to prevent his setting off. But the idea—at the first blush
      eagerly welcomed by him—is dismissed from his mind almost as soon as entertained. If the boat
      has started—and it is only under such heavy penalties that the mail-boats do not start, that
      this contingency hardly ever occurs—Byng will have started too. A terrific bang at the
      casement seems to come as a comment upon this conviction. He will have started; but will he
      ever arrive? It is said that in eight years during which they have been running no catastrophe
      has ever sent one of this line of steamers to the bottom; but yet they are cranky little
      craft, with engines too big for them—built rather for speed than safety. The clock has struck,
      with a repetition that seems strangely frequent through the sleeping house: 11, 11.30, 12,
      12.30.
"I will give him half an hour more," says the watcher to himself, "and then I will turn
      in."
Of this allotted half-hour only five minutes are yet left to run, when, in a lull in the
      hurricane, the sound which Jim's hearing has been so long stretched to catch—the sound of
      wheels on the gravel—is at length audible. During the last two hours he has heard many phantom
      wheels—many of those ghostly coaches that the wind drives shrieking through the winter nights.
      But these are real ones. Before the drowsy porter, nodding in his little den, can reach the
      hall-door, Jim has opened it—opened it just in time to admit a man who, his pace still further
      accelerated by the mighty hands of the pushing blast, is bounding up the steps. If any doubt
      as to this person's identity lingered in Jim's mind, his first words would dispel it.
"She is here? There is no mistake? She is here?"
"How late you are!" cries the other, apparently regarding the new arrival's utterance more
      as an ejaculation than as a question expecting or needing an answer. "Why are you so late? Did
      the engines break down?"
"She is here?" repeats Byng insistently, taking no notice of the queries addressed to him.
      "You have not deceived me? For mercy's sake say that you have not deceived me!"
"Why should I deceive you?" rejoins Jim impatiently. "Yes; certainly she is here."
They are in the hall by now—the hall which, the Grand Hotel being gasless, is lit by only
      one weak paraffin lamp, which the gust from the door, necessarily still open to admit of the
      carrying in of the traveller's bags and rugs, is making even more faint and flickering than
      its wont.
"You must have had a fine tossing!"
"I believe you; they all thought we were going to make a dinner for the fishes—ha, ha! All
      but I. I knew better. I knew that I could not come to grief when she had called me to
      her."
Byng's hat is rammed down over his brows, and his fur coat turned up so high round his ears
      that it is impossible in the obscurity to see his face; but there is something in the tone of
      his voice—a loud, wild rollicking—that makes the idea cross Jim's mind that he has been
      drinking. What a shock it will give to Elizabeth if, in her covert vigil—he has no more doubt
      that she has been watching than that he has been doing so himself—she overhears that thick,
      raised voice! Prompted by this thought, he says hastily:
"Come into the dining-room. I told them to put something to eat for you there."
Byng complies; and when they have reached the empty salle à manger, whose whitewash
      looks weird and unnatural in the chill of the night, he sends his hat skimming down one of the
      long tables, and, grasping both Jim's hands in his, cries out, in the same loud tone of
      intoxicated triumph:
"Oh, my dear old chap, how good it is to see your ugly old mug again! If you had known—oh,
      if you had only known!—what I went through during the twenty-four hours after I sent you that
      telegram, when through every hour, through every minute and second of every hour, I said to
      myself, 'It may come now—my death-warrant may come now! In five minutes it
      may have come!' But it did not, it did not! I ought to have known"—with an accent of
      ecstasy—"that of her pitifulness she would relent at last. She is infinitely pitiful, is not
      she? but I shall upbraid her a little—oh, do not be afraid; it will be gently, most
      gently—for having kept me so long, so inhumanly long, upon my gridiron! I had always"—breaking
      into a rather wild laugh—"something of a tenderness for St. Lawrence, but during the last
      seven months I have loved him like a brother!"
He goes on again, with scarcely a pause, or apparently any consciousness of the unresponsive
      silence of his auditor:
"But what does it matter now?" beginning to stride about with his eyes cast up to the beamed
      ceiling and his lifted hands locked together—"what does it matter? 'After long grief and pain,
      to feel the arms of my true love round me once again!' You may think that I word it
      extravagantly," returning to Jim as he leans downcast and shocked upon one of the chairs of
      the monotonous table-d'hôte row; "but in the hope itself, the more than hope, there
      is nothing extravagant; you must own that yourself. If she had not meant to put an end to my
      long agony, she would not have sent for me; not to stop me was to send for me."
"You are labouring under a mistake," says Jim coldly, and yet with an inward quaking as to
      the effect that his words may produce; "she had not the option of stopping you. By some
      accident I did not receive your telegram till four hours ago. She could not have stopped you
      if she had wished."
The idea, as I have already said, has occurred to Burgoyne that his companion is under the
      influence of intoxication; but either this is not the case, or the shock of the last words has
      the effect of instantly sobering him.
"I—I—do not understand," he says in a voice out of which all the insane exhilaration has
      been conjured as if by magic; "I do not follow you. What do you mean?"
"I mean," replies Jim, in a matter-of-fact, level tone, meant to have a calming effect upon
      his auditor, "that owing, I suppose, to my name being spelt wrongly—Bourgouin instead of
      Burgoyne—your telegram was given to someone else, and did not reach me till nine o'clock this
      evening."
Byng puts up his hand to his throat, and, unfastening the collar of his fur coat as if it
      were strangling him, throws back the coat itself. Now that he sees him freed from enveloping
      wrap and concealing hat-brim, Jim can realize the full amount of change and deterioration that
      are visible in his appearance; can see how bloodshot his eyes are; how lined his mouth; and
      how generally ravaged and dimmed his good looks.
"I am to understand, then, that—that she would have stopped my coming if she could."
Jim is silent. He cannot answer that question with any certainty even to himself.
"She would have escaped me again if she had had the chance! What am I saying?"—with a sudden
      access of terror in his tone—"she may have escaped me already! She may be gone! Tell me the
      truth—do not dare to tell me anything but the bare truth. I saw that you hesitated when I
      asked you whether she was really here. Is she gone?"
"Gone!" repeats Jim, with an exasperated jerk of the head towards the window, against which
      the rain and wind are hurling themselves with threefold rage, as if to recapture the victim
      just escaped them. "To-night—in this storm? How likely! Come, be rational; try to keep your
      head, and let us have a truce to this ranting. I give you my word of honour that she is here,
      under this roof; asleep, I should hope, if your bellowings have not awoke her."
The latter clause may perhaps come under the head of a pardonable fiction; at all events, it
      has, despite its incivility, the desired effect of soothing, to some extent, the agitation of
      him to whom it is addressed.
"Asleep!" he repeats, while an ecstatic smile breaks over his handsome, dissipated face.
      "Good angels guard her slumbers! But"—with a rather ominous return of excitement—"are you sure
      that she is asleep—that she has gone to bed yet? They used to sit up very late in
      Florence sometimes. If she has not gone to bed, why should not I see her; why should not I
      fall at her feet now—to-night?"
"My dear boy," rejoins Jim, with a praiseworthy attempt to answer this modest and sensible
      proposal with patient good-humour, "have you any idea what time it is? I should have thought
      it might have occurred even to you that 1.30 A.M. is scarcely a suitable hour for
      paying a morning call! Do not be a fool! Pull yourself together. I swear to you that she has
      every intention of seeing you to-morrow. Come"—trying to laugh—"you will not have long to
      wait! It is to-morrow already; and, meantime, sit down and eat something; you must be as empty
      as a drum."
But to this prudent if homely counsel Byng opposes an obstinate negation, adorned with
      excited asseverations that food shall never cross his lips until they have pastured upon his
      lady's pardoning hand.
The same prohibition does not, however, apparently apply to drink, as he pours more than
      half the bottle of happily not very potent wine, prepared for his refreshment, into a tumbler,
      and tosses it off at a draught. He offers an even stouter refusal to Burgoyne's suggestion
      that he should go to bed; and as he utters it a flash of cunning suspicion comes into his
      eyes, shocking his friend with a gleam as of possible and scarcely latent madness. Across the
      latter's brain darts the query, which had proposed itself more than once to him last spring at
      Florence:
"Is there insanity in Byng's blood"
Not certainly on the distaff side, the side of his eminently sane and wholesome mother; but
      can he be throwing back to some distempered ancestor?
"What security have I if I go to bed that she will not steal away from me in the night? It
      was in the night—almost in the night—that she stole away from me before."
From this logic it is impossible to move him; and although, with some return to his old
      sweet-natured kindliness of manner, he begs his friend not to think it necessary to keep him
      company, yet the latter is far too ill at ease as to his condition, both of mind and body, to
      comply.
The porter, having drawn the natural inference that as soon as the traveller has refreshed
      his body he will wish to retire to rest, has put out the lights in the smoking-room; the
       salle à manger is therefore the only room in the hotel where lamps still burn, and
      in it the two men spend the dreary remaining hours of the night, Byng walking up and down like
      a captive beast, frequently going to the door, opening it, putting his head out into the
      darkness, and listening suspiciously if, perchance, he may hear the footfall of Elizabeth
      fleeing away from him even through the hurricane. As the time goes on, his restlessness
      increases rather than diminishes. Jim has vainly tried to distract his thoughts by putting
      questions to him as to his pursuits and companions since their last parting—by inquiries as to
      the extent and direction of his travels.
Did he get as far as Palestine? How long is it since he left Cairo? etc. But to all his
      interrogations Byng gives brief and unsatisfactory answers, putting a final stop to them by
      breaking out excitedly:
"Why do you go on questioning me as to where I have been, and what I have done? I tell you I
      have been nowhere, and done nothing; I believe that my body has been here and there, but my
      soul has been nowhere; it has been lying dead! Would you expect a man who has been lying six
      months in his coffin to give you a catalogue of his adventures? My soul has been dead, I tell
      you—dead and putrescent. What is the use of putting me through a catechism about its
      doings?"
Before the long-delaying dawn shows its pale profile upon the deep obscurity, it seems to
      Jim as if six midwinter nights must have pieced themselves end to end. But it comes at last;
      and at last also, by dint of strenuous representations to his companion as to how unfit he is,
      in his present travel-stained and disordered condition, to offer himself to Elizabeth's eyes,
      he induces him to let himself be led to the bedroom prepared overnight for him, and to refresh
      himself with a bath and a change of clothes. Even this concession he obtains only in exchange
      for an exacted promise to seek out Elizabeth at the earliest possible hour at which she may be
      presumed accessible, and urgently to entreat of her an instant interview with his friend.
Jim feels that he is keeping his word handsomely when, not a minute later than nine o'clock,
      he finds himself knocking at the door of the Le Marchants' apartment—that door with which of
      late his knuckles have grown so pleasantly and friendlily familiar. It is opened to him by
      Elizabeth herself, and he follows her silently through the ante-room into the little
       salon. Arrived there, he looks mournfully round with a sort of feeling as of taking
      farewell of the familiar objects.
It is impossible that Elizabeth can have spent the just-past stormy night in gathering
      flowers, and yet the flowers have a freshened air. She must have been carefully rearranging
      them. The bits of brocade, too, the Turkish embroideries, the haiks, and the
      praying-carpets, wear a more festal appearance than usual. The little room looks decked as if
      for a gala. His jealous fancy cannot but admit that Elizabeth herself is dressed in her
      ordinary morning gown, but even over it some holiday transmutation has passed. He cannot trust
      himself to verify whether that holiday look is on her face too.
"He has come; you know that, I suppose?"
"Yes."
What a catch in her breath! He must steal a glance at her. She will think it unnatural if he
      does not; and perhaps his eye may not be offended by so much radiance as he feared. In her
      voice there was something not very distant from a sob. The result of his glance shows itself
      in what sounds like a reproach.
"I do not believe that you went to bed at all."
"Yes, I did! yes, I did!" hurrying away eagerly from the subject of herself, as from
      something irrelevant and importunate; "and—he—how is he? How does he look? Had not he a
      dreadful crossing? Does he want to see me? to see me soon? to-day?"
There is such a breathless passion in her tone, coupled with something so apologetic for
      putting her questions to him, that his heart, hitherto half touched, half angered by the
      pathos of her little preparations, melts wholly towards her.
"Of course he wants to see you—wants it very, very much," replies he; and, to his credit,
      replies without any harshness marring the cordial kindness of his tone. "As much as"—with a
      rather melancholy smile—"you want to see him. No, do not be angry. Why should not you wish to
      see each other?"
"Oh, there is every reason!" cries she miserably—"the same reason that there always was.
      But"—with rising agitation—"where is it to be? How soon? When does he wish it?"
"He is waiting outside now."
She starts painfully.
"Now! Oh, poor fellow! we must not keep him waiting; and yet"—stretching out her
      hand in detention—"tell me, before he comes in—tell me, is he changed? Is he? Is he the same
      as he was?"
Jim hesitates, and the painful perplexity written on his brow is misread by her.
"You are vexed with me for teasing you with so many tiresome questions. Oh, forgive me! I
      ought not to take advantage of your kindness; but we have grown to depend upon you so; and I
      will promise not to worry you with any other, if you will only answer me this one. Is he
      changed—much changed?"
"I am afraid," replies Jim, with the slowness of one who is trying to convey unpleasant
      tidings in the least unpleasant terms, "that you must be prepared to find him a good deal
      altered."
"Altered! How?"
"I do not quite know how to describe it"—uneasily—"but you must not be shocked if you find
      him a good deal changed in looks; and he is—he seems, in a very excited state."
She makes a clutch at his hand.
"Do you mean"—her voice has sunk to a horror-struck whisper—"that he is—mad?"
"Mad! Oh, of course not," with a strained laugh; "you must not jump to such conclusions. But
      I do not think he is quite himself, that is all. He looks as if he had not eaten or slept for
      a fortnight; and if you play such tricks as that with yourself, you must expect to get a
      little off your balance."
She is still terrifiedly clutching his hand, though with no consciousness of doing so, nor
      that the fingers so tightly gripped by her are not made of dry stick.
"You must not look so frightened," he says soothingly. "I would not have said anything to
      you, only that I thought it better you should be prepared—that it should not take you quite by
      surprise; and also because I wanted to give you a hint, that you might be a little careful
      what you say to him, or, at all events, how you say it."
Still she does not speak, and there is scarcely any diminution of the horror of her
      look.
"If you do not mind, I think it would be as well to have someone within call, if
      he—he—became—unreasonable."
"Do you think," she asks, with a sort of scorn, "that I am afraid of him—afraid for
      myself?"
"No, that I am sure you are not; but I cannot shake off the idea that—poor fellow!—he may be
      on the verge of some grave illness; and in that sort of case one never knows what may happen.
      So, if you do not mind——"
"As you please," she answers, docile even now. "Do as you think best; and will you tell him
      that I am ready to see him?"
The misgivings with which Jim complies with this request are not much allayed by the manner
      and voice of him who receives it, and who has been raging up and down the narrow corridor.
"She will not see me, I suppose?"
"On the contrary, she will see you now. But stay!" catching him by the arm as he springs
      past him. "One moment! For God's sake control yourself! Behave like a gentleman. Do not make
      her a scene; she is not up to it."
Byng's answer is to fling resentfully away the detaining hand of his Mentor, while he says,
      with a furious look coming into his bloodshot eyes:
"What do you mean by keeping me here, preaching to me, while she is waiting for
      me?"
The rudeness of both words and actions is so unlike the real Byng, that it is with an even
      more sinking spirit than before that Jim follows him with his eyes as he passes out of sight
      into the salon. As soon as the door is shut behind him, he himself takes up the
      position he had suggested in the ante-room.
