VI.
For several days there was a new heaven and a new earth. Miss Leland seemed suddenly
      impressed with the seriousness of life. She was gentleness itself; and as Sherman sat on
      Sunday mornings in his pocket-handkerchief of a garden under the one tree, with its smoky
      stem, watching the little circles of sunlight falling from the leaves like a shower of new
      sovereigns, he gazed at them with a longer and keener joy than heretofore—a new heaven and a
      new earth, surely!
Sherman planted and dug and raked this pocket-handkerchief of a garden most diligently,
      rooting
       out the docks and dandelions and mouse-ear and the patches of untimely grass. It
      was the point of contact between his new life and the old. It was far too small and unfertile
      and shaded in to satisfy his love of gardener’s experiments and early vegetables.
Perforce this husbandry was too little complex for his affections to gather much round plant
      and bed. His garden in Ballah used to touch him like the growth of a young family.
Now he was content to satisfy his barbaric sense of colour; right round were planted
      alternate holyhock and sunflower, and behind them scarlet-runners showed their inch-high
      cloven shoots.
One Sunday it occurred to him to write to his friends on the matter of his engagement. He
      numbered them over. Howard, one or two less intimate, and Mary Carton. At that name he paused;
      he would not write just yet.
