VIII.
Gradually those bright eyes of his imagination, watching him from letters and from among the
      fourteen flies on the ceiling, had ceased to be centres of peace. They seemed like two
      whirlpools, wherein the order and quiet of his life were absorbed hourly and daily.
He still thought sometimes of the country house of his dreams and of the garden and the
      three gardeners, but somehow they had lost half their charm.
He had written to Howard and some others, and commenced, at last, a letter to Mary Carton.
      It lay unfinished on his desk; a thin coating of dust was gathering upon it.

 Mrs. Leland called continually on Mrs. Sherman. She sentimentalized over the
      lovers, and even wept over them; each visit supplied the household with conversation for a
      week.
Every Sunday morning—his letter-writing time—Sherman looked at his uncompleted letter.
      Gradually it became plain to him he could not finish it. It had never seemed to him he had
      more than friendship for Mary Carton, yet somehow it was not possible to tell her of this
      love-affair.
The more his betrothed troubled him the more he thought about the unfinished letter. He was
      a man standing at the cross-roads.
Whenever the wind blew from the south he remembered his friend, for that is the wind that
      fills the heart with memory.
One Sunday he removed the dust from the face of the letter almost reverently, as though it
      were the dust from the wheels of destiny. But the letter remained unfinished.
