II.
He arrived in the town of Ballah by rail, for he had avoided the slow cattle steamer and
      gone by Dublin.
It was the forenoon, and he made for the Imperial Hotel to wait till four in the evening,
      when he would find Mary Carton in the schoolhouse, for he had timed his journey so as to
      arrive on Thursday, the day of the children’s practice.
As he went through the streets his heart went out to every familiar place and sight: the
      rows of tumble-down thatched cottages; the slated roofs of the shops; the women selling
      gooseberries;
       the river bridge; the high walls of the garden where it was said the gardener
      used to see the ghost of a former owner in the shape of a rabbit; the street corner no child
      would pass at nightfall for fear of the headless soldier; the deserted flour store; the
      wharves covered with grass. All these he watched with Celtic devotion, that devotion carried
      to the ends of the world by the Celtic exiles, and since old time surrounding their
      journeyings with rumour of plaintive songs.
He sat in the window of the Imperial Hotel, now full of guests. He did not notice any of
      them. He sat there meditating, meditating. Grey clouds covering the town with flying shadows
      rushed by like the old and dishevelled eagles that Maeldune saw hurrying towards the waters of
      life. Below in the street passed by country people, townspeople, travellers, women with
      baskets, boys driving donkeys, old men
       with sticks; sometimes he recognized a face or was recognized himself, and
      welcomed by some familiar voice.
“You have come home a handsomer gentleman than your father, Misther John, and he was a neat
      figure of a man, God bless him!” said the waiter, bringing him his lunch; and in truth Sherman
      had grown handsomer for these years away. His face and gesture had more of dignity, for on the
      centre of his nature life had dropped a pinch of experience.
At four he left the hotel and waited near the schoolhouse till the children came running
      out. One or two of the elder ones he recognized but turned away.
