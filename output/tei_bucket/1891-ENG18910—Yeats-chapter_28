II.
Slower and slower he went, with his eyes on the ground, bewildered by all that was
      happening. A few feet from the cave he stood still, counting aimlessly the round spots of
      light made by the beams slanting through trees that hid with their greenness, as in the centre
      of the sea, that hollow rock. As over and over he counted them, he heard, first with the ear
      only, then with the mind also, a footstep going to and fro within the cave. Lifting his eyes
      he saw the same figure seen on the cliff—the figure of a woman, beautiful and young. Her dress
      was white, save for a border of
       feathers dyed the fatal red of the spirits. She had arranged in one corner the
      spears, and in the other the brushwood and branches used for the fire, and spread upon the
      ground the skins, and now began pulling vainly at the great stone pitcher of the
      Fomorians.
Suddenly she saw him, and with a burst of wild laughter flung her arms around his neck,
      crying, “Dhoya, I have left my world far off. My people—on the floor of the lake they are
      dancing and singing, and on the islands of the lake; always happy, always young, always
      without change. I have left them for thee, Dhoya, for they cannot love. Only the changing, and
      moody, and angry, and weary can love. I am beautiful; love me, Dhoya. Do you hear me? I left
      the places where they dance, Dhoya, for thee!” For long she poured out a tide of words, he
      answering at first little, then more and more as she
       melted away the silence of so many inarticulate years; and all the while she
      gazed on him with eyes, no ardour could rob of the mild and mysterious melancholy that watches
      us from the eyes of animals—sign of unhuman reveries.
Many days passed over these strangely wedded ones. Sometimes when he asked her, “Do you love
      me?” she would answer, “I do not know, but I long for your love endlessly.” Often at twilight,
      returning from hunting, he would find her bending over a stream that flowed near to the cave,
      decking her hair with feathers and reddening her lips with the juice of a wild berry.
He was very happy secluded in that deep forest. Hearing the faint murmurs of the western
      sea, they seemed to have outlived change. But Change is everywhere, with the tides and the
      stars fastened to her wheel. Every blood drop in their lips, every cloud in the sky, every
      leaf in
       the world changed a little, while they brushed back their hair and kissed. All
      things change save only the fear of change. And yet for his hour Dhoya was happy and as full
      of dreams as an old man or an infant—for dreams wander nearest to the grave and the
      cradle.
Once, as he was returning home from hunting, by the northern edge of the lake, at the hour
      when the owls cry to each other, “It is time to be abroad,” and the last flutter of the wind
      has died away, leaving under every haunted island an image legible to the least hazel branch,
      there suddenly stood before him a slight figure, at the edge of the narrow sand-line, dark
      against the glowing water. Dhoya drew nearer. It was a man leaning on his spear-staff, on his
      head a small red cap. His spear was slender and tipped with shining metal; the spear of Dhoya
      of wood, one end pointed and hardened in the fire. The red-capped
       stranger silently raised that slender spear and thrust at Dhoya, who parried
      with his pointed staff.
For a long while they fought. The last vestige of sunset passed away and the stars came out.
      Underneath them the feet of Dhoya beat up the ground, but the feet of the other as he rushed
      hither and thither, matching his agility with the mortal’s mighty strength, made neither
      shadow nor footstep on the sands. Dhoya was wounded, and growing weary a little, when the
      other leaped away, and, crouching down by the water, began—“You have carried away by some
      spell unknown the most beautiful of our bands—you who have neither laughter nor singing.
      Restore her, Dhoya, and go free.” Dhoya answered him no word, and the other rose and again
      thrust at him with the spear. They fought to and fro upon the sands until the dawn touched
      with olive the distant sky, and then his anger
       fit, long absent, fell on Dhoya, and he closed with his enemy and threw him, and
      put his knee on his chest and his hands on his throat, and would have crushed all life out of
      him, when lo! he held beneath his knee no more than a bundle of reeds.
Nearing home in the early morning he heard the voice he loved, singing—

“Full moody is my love and sad,
His moods bow low his sombre crest,
I hold him dearer than the glad,
And he shall slumber on my breast.
“My love hath many an evil mood
Ill words for all things soft and fair,
I hold him dearer than the good,
My fingers feel his amber hair.
“No tender wisdom floods the eyes
That watch me with their suppliant light—
I hold him dearer than the wise,
And for him make me wise and bright.”

And when she saw him she cried, “An old mortal song heard floating from a tent of skin, as
       we rode, I and mine, through a camping-place at night.” From that day she was
      always either singing wild and melancholy songs or else watching him with that gaze of animal
      reverie.
Once he asked, “How old are you?”
“A thousand years, for I am young.”
“I am so little to you,” he went on, “and you are so much to me—dawn, and sunset,
      tranquility, and speech, and solitude.”
“Am I so much?” she said; “say it many times!” and her eyes seemed to brighten and her
      breast heaved with joy.
Often he would bring her the beautiful skins of animals, and she would walk to and fro on
      them, laughing to feel their softness under her feet. Sometimes she would pause and ask
      suddenly, “Will you weep for me when we have parted?” and he would answer, “I will die then;”
      and she would go on rubbing her feet to and fro in the soft skin.

 And so Dhoya grew tranquil and gentle, and Change seemed still to have forgotten
      them, having so much on her hands. The stars rose and set watching them smiling together, and
      the tides ebbed and flowed, bringing mutability to all save them. But always everything
      changes, save only the fear of Change.
