 III.
Towards evening he went out. The pale sunshine of winter flickered on his path. The wind
      blew the straws about. He grew more and more melancholy. A dog of his acquaintance was chasing
      rabbits in a field. He had never been known to catch one, and since his youth had never seen
      one for he was almost wholly blind. They were his form of the eternal chimera. The dog left
      the field and followed with a friendly sniff.
They came together to the rectory. Mary Carton was not in. There was a children’s practice
      in the school-house. They went thither.
A child of four or five with a
       swelling on its face was sitting under a wall opposite the school door, waiting
      to make faces at the Protestant children as they came out. Catching sight of the dog she
      seemed to debate in her mind whether to throw a stone at it or call it to her. She threw the
      stone and made it run. In after times he remembered all these things as though they were of
      importance.
He opened the latched green door and went in. About twenty children were singing in shrill
      voices standing in a row at the further end. At the harmonium he recognized Mary Carton, who
      nodded to him and went on with her playing. The white-washed walls were covered with glazed
      prints of animals; at the further end was a large map of Europe; by a fire at the near end was
      a table with the remains of tea. This tea was an idea of Mary’s. They had tea and cake first,
      afterwards the singing. The floor was covered with crumbs.
       The fire was burning brightly. Sherman sat down beside it. A child with a great
      deal of oil in her hair was sitting on the end of a form at the other side.
“Look,” she whispered, “I have been sent away. At any rate they are further from the fire.
      They have to be near the harmonium. I would not sing. Do you like hymns? I don’t. Will you
      have a cup of tea? I can make it quite well. See, I did not spill a drop. Have you enough
      milk?” It was a cup full of milk—children’s tea. “Look, there is a mouse carrying away a
      crumb. Hush!”
They sat there, the child watching the mouse, Sherman pondering on his letter, until the
      music ceased and the children came tramping down the room. The mouse having fled, Sherman’s
      self-appointed hostess got up with a sigh and went out with the others.
Mary Carton closed the harmonium and came towards
       Sherman. Her face and all her movements showed a gentle decision of character.
      Her glance was serene, her features regular, her figure at the same time ample and beautifully
      moulded; her dress plain yet not without a certain air of distinction. In a different society
      she would have had many suitors. But she was of a type that in country towns does not get
      married at all. Its beauty is too lacking in pink and white, its nature in that small
      assertiveness admired for character by the uninstructed. Elsewhere she would have known her
      own beauty—as it is right that all the beautiful should—and have learnt how to display it, to
      add gesture to her calm and more of mirth and smiles to her grave cheerfulness. As it was, her
      manner was much older than herself.
She sat down by Sherman with the air of an old friend. They had long been accustomed
       to consult together on every matter. They were such good friends they had never
      fallen in love with each other. Perfect love and perfect friendship are indeed incompatible;
      for the one is a battlefield where shadows war beside the combatants, and the other a placid
      country where Consultation has her dwelling.
These two were such good friends that the most gossiping townspeople had given them up with
      a sigh. The doctor’s wife, a faded beauty and devoted romance reader, said one day, as they
      passed, “They are such cold creatures.” The old maid who kept the Berlin-wool shop remarked,
      “They are not of the marrying sort,” and now their comings and goings were no longer noticed.
      Nothing had ever come to break in on their quiet companionship and give obscurity as a
      dwelling-place for the needed illusions. Had one been weak and the other strong, one plain and
      the other handsome,
       one guide and the other guided, one wise and the other foolish, love might have
      found them out in a moment, for love is based on inequality as friendship is on equality.
“John,” said Mary Carton, warming her hands at the fire, “I have had a troublesome day. Did
      you come to help me teach the children to sing? It was good of you: you were just too
      late.”
“No,” he answered, “I have come to be your pupil. I am always your pupil.”
“Yes, and a most disobedient one.”
“Well, advise me this time at any rate. My uncle has written, offering me £100 a year to
      begin with in his London office. Am I to go?”
“You know quite well my answer,” she said.
“Indeed I do not. Why should I go? I am contented here. I am now making my garden ready for
      spring. Later on there will be trout fishing
       and saunters by the edge of the river in the evening when the bats are flickering
      about. In July there will be races. I enjoy the bustle. I enjoy life here. When anything
      annoys me I keep away from it, that is all. You know I am always busy. I have occupation and
      friends and am quite contented.”
“It is a great loss to many of us, but you must go, John,” she said. “For you know you will
      be old some day, and perhaps when the vitality of youth is gone you will feel that your life
      is empty and find that you are too old to change it; and you will give up, perhaps, trying to
      be happy and likeable and become as the rest are. I think I can see you,” she said, with a
      laugh, “a hypochondriac, like Gorman, the retired excise officer, or with a red nose like Dr.
      Stephens, or growing like Peters, the elderly cattle merchant, who starves his horse.”
“They were bad material to
       begin with,” he answered, “and besides, I cannot take my mother away with me at
      her age, and I cannot leave her alone.”
“What annoyance it may be,” she answered, “will soon be forgotten. You will be able to give
      her many more comforts. We women—we all like to be dressed well and have pleasant rooms to sit
      in, and a young man at your age should not be idle. You must go away from this little backward
      place. We shall miss you, but you are clever and must go and work with other men and have your
      talents admitted.”
“How emulous you would have me. Perhaps I shall be well-to-do some day; meanwhile I only
      wish to stay here with my friends.”
She went over to the window and looked out with her face turned from him. The evening light
      cast a long shadow behind her on the floor. After some moments, she said, “I see
       people ploughing on the slope of the hill. There are people working on a house to
      the right. Everywhere there are people busy,” and, with a slight tremble in her voice, she
      added, “and, John, nowhere are there any doing what they wish. One has to think of so many
      things—of duty and God.”
“Mary, I didn’t know you were so religious.”
Coming towards him with a smile, she said, “No more did I, perhaps. But sometimes the self
      in one is very strong. One has to think a great deal and reason with it. Yet I try hard to
      lose myself in things about me. These children now—I often lie awake thinking about them. That
      child who was talking to you is often on my mind. I do not know what will happen to her. She
      makes me unhappy. I am afraid she is not a good child at all. I am afraid she is not taught
      well at home. I try hard to be gentle
       and patient with her. I am a little displeased with myself to-day; so I have
      lectured you. There! I have made my confession. But,” she added, taking one of his hands in
      both hers and reddening, “you must go away. You must not be idle. You will gain
      everything.”
As she stood there with bright eyes, the light of evening about her, Sherman for perhaps the
      first time saw how beautiful she was, and was flattered by her interest. For the first time
      also her presence did not make him at peace with the world.
“Will you be an obedient pupil?”
“You know so much more than I do,” he answered, “and are so much wiser. I will write to my
      uncle and agree to his offer.”
“Now you must go home,” she said. “You must not keep your mother waiting for her tea. There!
      I have raked the fire out. We must not forget to lock the door behind us.”

 As they stood on the doorstep the wind blew a whirl of dead leaves about
      them.
“They are my old thoughts,” he said; “see, they are all withered.”
They walked together silently. At the vicarage he left her and went homeward.
The deserted flour store at the corner of two roads, the house that had been burnt hollow
      ten years before and still lifted its blackened beams, the straggling and leafless fruit-trees
      rising above garden walls, the church where he was christened—these foster-mothers of his
      infancy seemed to nod and shake their heads over him.
“Mother,” he said, hurriedly entering the room, “we are going to London.”
“As you wish. I always knew you would be a rolling stone,” she answered, and went out to
      tell the servant that as soon as she had finished the week’s washing they must pack up
       everything, for they were going to London.
“Yes, we must pack up,” said the old peasant; she did not stop peeling the onion in her
      hand—she had not comprehended. In the middle of the night she suddenly started up in bed with
      a pale face and a prayer to the Virgin whose image hung over her head—she had now
      comprehended.
