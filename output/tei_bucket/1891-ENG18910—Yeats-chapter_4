IV.
On January the 5th about two in the afternoon, Sherman sat on the deck of the steamer
       Lavinia enjoying a period of sunshine between two showers. The steamer
       Lavinia was a cattle boat. It had been his wish to travel by some more expensive
      route, but his mother, with her old-fashioned ideas of duty, would not hear of it, and now, as
      he foresaw, was extremely uncomfortable below, while he, who was a good sailor, was pretty
      happy on deck, and would have been quite so if the pigs would only tire of their continual
      squealing. With the exception
       of a very dirty old woman sitting by a crate of geese, all the passengers but
      himself were below. This old woman made the journey monthly with geese for the Liverpool
      market.
Sherman was dreaming. He began to feel very desolate, and commenced a letter to Mary Carton
      in his notebook to state this fact. He was a laborious and unpractised writer, and found it
      helped him to make a pencil copy. Sometimes he stopped and watched the puffin sleeping on the
      waves. Each one of them had its head tucked in in a somewhat different way.
“That is because their characters are different,” he thought.
Gradually he began to notice a great many corks floating by, one after the other. The old
      woman saw them too, and said, waking out of a half sleep—
“Misther John Sherman, we will be in the Mersey before evening. Why are ye goin’ among them
      savages in London,
       Misther John? Why don’t ye stay among your own people—for what have we in this
      life but a mouthful of air?”
