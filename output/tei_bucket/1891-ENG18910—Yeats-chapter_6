II.
One afternoon Mrs. Leland called on Mrs. Sherman. She very often called—this fat,
      sentimental woman, moving in the midst of a cloud of scent. The day was warm, and she carried
      her too elaborate and heavy dress as a large caddis-fly drags its case with much labour and
      patience. She sat down on the sofa with obvious relief, leaning so heavily among the cushions
      that a clothes-moth in an antimacassar thought the end of the world had come and fluttered out
      only to be knocked down and crushed by Mrs. Sherman, who was very quick in her movements.

 As soon as she found her breath, Mrs. Leland began a long history of her sorrows.
      Her daughter Margaret, had been jilted and was in despair, had taken to her bed with every
      resolution to die, and was growing paler and paler. The hard-hearted man, though she knew he
      had heard, did not relent. She knew he had heard because her daughter had told his sister all
      about it, and his sister had no heart, because she said it was temper that ailed Margaret, and
      she was a little vixen, and that if she had not flirted with everybody the engagement would
      never have been broken off. But Mr. Sims had no heart clearly, as Miss Marriot and Mrs. Eliza
      Taylor, her daughter’s friends, said, when they heard, and Lock, the butler, said the same
      too, and Mary Young, the housemaid, said so too—and she knew all about it, for Margaret used
      to read his letters to her often when having her hair brushed.

 “She must have been very fond of him,” said Mrs. Sherman.
“She is so romantic, my dear,” answered Mrs. Leland, with a sigh. “I am afraid she takes
      after an uncle on her father’s side, who wrote poetry and wore a velvet jacket and ran away
      with an Italian countess who used to get drunk. When I married Mr. Leland people said he was
      not worthy of me, and that I was throwing myself away—and he in business, too! But Margaret is
      so romantic. There was Mr. Walters, the gentleman farmer, and Simpson who had a jeweller’s
      shop—I never approved of him!—and Mr. Samuelson, and the Hon. William Scott. She tired of them
      all except the Hon. William Scott, who tired of her because some one told him she put
      belladonna in her eyes—and it is not true; and now there is Mr. Sims!” She then cried a
      little, and allowed herself to be consoled by Mrs. Sherman.
“You talk so intelligently and
       are so well informed,” she said at parting. “I have made a very pleasant call,”
      and the caddis-worm toiled upon its way, arriving in due course at other cups of tea.
