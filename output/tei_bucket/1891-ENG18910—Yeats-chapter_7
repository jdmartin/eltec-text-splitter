III.
The day after Mrs. Leland’s call upon his mother, John Sherman, returning home after his not
      very lengthy day in the office, saw Margaret coming towards him. She had a lawn tennis racket
      under her arm, and was walking slowly on the shady side of the road. She was a pretty girl
      with quite irregular features, who though really not more than pretty, had so much manner, so
      much of an air, that every one called her a beauty: a trefoil with the fragrance of a
      rose.
“Mr. Sherman,” she cried, coming smiling to meet him, “I
       have been ill, but could not stand the house any longer. I am going to the Square
      to play tennis. Will you come with me?”
“I am a bad player,” he said.
“Of course you are,” she answered; “but you are the only person under a hundred to be found
      this afternoon. How dull life is!” she continued, with a sigh. “You heard how ill I have been?
      What do you do all day?”
“I sit at a desk, sometimes writing, and sometimes, when I get lazy, looking up at the
      flies. There are fourteen on the plaster of the ceiling over my head. They died two winters
      ago. I sometimes think to have them brushed off, but they have been there so long now I hardly
      like to.”
“Ah! you like them,” she said, “because you are accustomed to them. In most cases there is
      not much more to be said for our family affections, I think.”

 “In a room close at hand,” he went on, “there is, you know, Uncle Michael, who
      never speaks.”
“Precisely. You have an uncle who never speaks; I have a mother who never is silent. She
      went to see Mrs. Sherman the other day. What did she say to her?”
“Nothing.”
“Really. What a dull thing existence is!”—this with a great sigh. “When the Fates are
      weaving our web of life some mischievous goblin always runs off with the dye-pot. Everything
      is dull and grey. Am I looking a little pale? I have been so very ill.”
“A little bit pale, perhaps,” he said, doubtfully.
The Square gate brought them to a stop. It was locked, but she had the key. The lock was
      stiff, but turned easily for John Sherman.
“How strong you are,” she said.

 It was an iridescent evening of spring. The leaves of the bushes had still their
      faint green. As Margaret darted about at the tennis, a red feather in her cap seemed to
      rejoice with its wearer. Everything was at once gay and tranquil. The whole world had that
      unreal air it assumes at beautiful moments, as though it might vanish at a touch like an
      iridescent soap-bubble.
After a little Margaret said she was tired, and, sitting on a garden seat among the bushes,
      began telling him the plots of novels lately read by her. Suddenly she cried—
“The novel-writers were all serious people like you. They are so hard on people like me.
      They always make us come to a bad end. They say we are always acting, acting, acting;
      and what else do you serious people do? You act before the world. I think, do you know,
       we act before ourselves. All the old
       foolish kings and queens in history were like us. They laughed and beckoned and
      went to the block for no very good purpose. I dare say the headsmen were like you.”
“We would never cut off so pretty a head.”
“Oh, yes, you would—you would cut off mine to-morrow.” All this she said vehemently,
      piercing him with her bright eyes. “You would cut off my head to-morrow,” she repeated, almost
      fiercely; “I tell you you would.”
Her departure was always unexpected, her moods changed with so much rapidity. “Look!” she
      said, pointing where the clock on St. Peter’s church showed above the bushes. “Five minutes to
      five. In five minutes my mother’s tea-hour. It is like growing old. I go to gossip.
      Good-bye.”
The red feather shone for a moment among the bushes and was gone.
