IV.
The next day and the day after, Sherman was followed by those bright eyes. When he opened a
      letter at his desk they seemed to gaze at him from the open paper, and to watch him from the
      flies upon the ceiling. He was even a worse clerk than usual.
One evening he said to his mother, “Miss Leland has beautiful eyes.”
“My dear, she puts belladonna in them.”
“What a thing to say!”
“I know she does, though her mother denies it.”
“Well, she is certainly beautiful,” he answered.

 “My dear, if she has an attraction for you, I don’t want to discourage it. She is
      rich as girls go nowadays; and one woman has one fault, another another: one’s untidy, one
      fights with her servants, one fights with her friends, another has a crabbed tongue when she
      talks of them.”
Sherman became again silent, finding no fragment of romance in such discourse.
In the next week or two he saw much of Miss Leland. He met her almost every evening on his
      return from the office, walking slowly, her racket under her arm. They played tennis much and
      talked more. Sherman began to play tennis in his dreams. Miss Leland told him all about
      herself, her friends, her inmost feelings; and yet every day he knew less about her. It was
      not merely that saying everything she said nothing, but that continually there came through
      her wild words the sound of the mysterious
       flutes and viols of that unconscious nature which dwells so much nearer to woman
      than to man. How often do we not endow the beautiful and candid with depth and mystery not
      their own? We do not know that we but hear in their voices those flutes and viols playing to
      us of the alluring secret of the world.
Sherman had never known in early life what is called first love, and now, when he had passed
      thirty, it came to him that love more of the imagination than of either the senses or
      affections: it was mainly the eyes that followed him.
It is not to be denied that as this love grew serious it grew mercenary. Now active, now
      latent, the notion had long been in Sherman’s mind, as we know, that he should marry money. A
      born lounger, riches tempted him greatly. When those eyes haunted him from the fourteen flies
      on the ceiling, he would say, “I should be rich; I should have a
       house in the country; I should hunt and shoot, and have a garden and three
      gardeners; I should leave this abominable office.” Then the eyes became even more beautiful.
      It was a new kind of belladonna.
He shrank a little, however, from choosing even this pleasant pathway. He had planned many
      futures for himself and learnt to love them all. It was this that had made him linger on at
      Ballah for so long, and it was this that now kept him undecided. He would have to give up the
      universe for a garden and three gardeners. How sad it was to make substantial even the best of
      his dreams. How hard it was to submit to that decree which compels every step we take in life
      to be a death in the imagination. How difficult it was to be so enwrapped in this one new hope
      as not to hear the lamentations that were going on in dim corners of his mind.
One day he resolved to propose.
       He examined himself in the glass in the morning; and for the first time in his
      life smiled to see how good-looking he was. In the evening before leaving the office he peered
      at himself in the mirror over the mantlepiece in the room where customers were received. The
      sun was blazing through the window full on his face. He did not look so well. Immediately all
      courage left him.
That evening he went out after his mother had gone to bed and walked far along the
      towing-path of the Thames. A faint mist half covered away the houses and factory chimneys on
      the further side; beside him a band of osiers swayed softly, the deserted and full river
      lapping their stems. He looked on all these things with foreign eyes. He had no sense of
      possession. Indeed it seemed to him that everything in London was owned by too many to be
      owned by any one. Another river that he did seem to possess flowed
       through his memory with all its familiar sights—boys riding in the stream to the
      saddle-girths, fish leaping, water-flies raising their small ripples, a swan asleep, the
      wallflowers growing on the red brick of the margin. He grew very sad. Suddenly a shooting
      star, fiery and vagabond, leaped from the darkness. It brought his mind again in a moment to
      Margaret Leland. To marry her, he thought, was to separate himself from the old life he loved
      so well.
Crossing the river at Putney, he hurried homewards among the market gardens. Nearing home,
      the streets were deserted, the shops closed. Where King Street joins the Broadway, entirely
      alone with itself, in the very centre of the road a little black cat was leaping after its
      shadow.
“Ah!” he thought, “it would be a good thing to be a little black cat. To leap about in the
      moonlight and sleep in the sunlight,
       and catch flies, to have no hard tasks to do or hard decisions to come to, to be
      simple and full of animal spirits.”
At the corner of Bridge Road was a coffee-stall, the only sign of human life. He bought some
      cold meat and flung it to the little black cat.
