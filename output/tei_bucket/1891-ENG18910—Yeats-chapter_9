 V.
Some more days went by. At last, one day, arriving at the Square somewhat earlier than
      usual, and sitting down to wait for Margaret on the seat among the bushes, he noticed the
      pieces of a torn-up letter lying about. Beside him on the seat was a pencil, as though some
      one had been writing there and left it behind them. The pencil-lead was worn very short. The
      letter had been torn up, perhaps, in a fit of impatience.
In a half-mechanical way he glanced over the scraps. On one of them he read: “My dear
       Eliza,—What an incurable gossip
       my mother is. You heard of my misfortune. I nearly died——” Here he had to search
      among the scraps; at last he found one that seemed to follow. “Perhaps you will hear news from
      me soon. There is a handsome young man who pays me attention, and——” Here another piece had to
      be found. “I would take him though he had a face like the man in the moon, and limped like the
      devil at the theatre. Perhaps I am a little in love. Oh! friend of my heart——” Here it broke
      off again. He was interested, and searched the grass and the bushes for fragments. Some had
      been blown to quite a distance. He got together several sentences now. “I will not spend
      another winter with my mother for anything. All this is, of course, a secret. I had to tell
      somebody; secrets are bad for my health. Perhaps it will all come to nothing.” Then the letter
      went off into dress, the last novel the
       writer had read, and so forth. A Miss Sims, too, was mentioned, who had said some
      unkind thing of the writer.
Sherman was greatly amused. It did not seem to him wrong to read—we do not mind spying on
      one of the crowd, any more than on the personages of literature. It never occurred to him that
      he, or any friend of his, was concerned in these pencil scribblings.
Suddenly he saw this sentence: “Heigho! your poor Margaret is falling in love again; condole
      with her, my dear.”
He started. The name “Margaret,” the mention of Miss Sims, the style of the whole letter,
      all made plain the authorship. Very desperately ashamed of himself, he got up and tore each
      scrap of paper into still smaller fragments and scattered them far apart.
That evening he proposed, and was accepted.
