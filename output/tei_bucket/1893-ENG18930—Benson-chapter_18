CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Edith had stayed on with the Granthams till nearly the end of August. She declined to have
      breakfast with the family, after she had been there about a week, because she said it spoiled
      her mornings, and used to breakfast by herself at seven or half-past, which gave her extra'
      two hours at her music; and Lady Grantham complained of being wakened in the middle of the
      night by funeral marches. So Edith promised to play with the soft pedal down, which she never
      did.
At lunch Sir Robert used to make a point of asking her how she had got on, and described to
      her the admirable band in the Casino at Monte Carlo. He was always extremely genial to her,
      and, when she played to them in the evening, he would beat time with one hand. Now and then he
      even told her that she was not playing staccato enough, or that he heard it taken rather
      quicker at Bayreuth.
Dodo had written to Edith saying that she was coming to stay with her in September, and that
      Edith must be at home by the second, because she would probably come that day or the third.
      Edith happened to mention this one night in the hearing of Lady Grantham, who had been firing
      off home-truths at her husband and son like a minute gun, in a low, scornful voice. This habit
      of hers was rather embarrassing at times. At dinner, for instance, that evening, when he had
      been airing his musical views to Edith as usual, she had suddenly said,—
"You don't know how silly you're making yourself, Bob. Everyone knows that you can't
      distinguish one note from another!"
Though Edith felt on fairly intimate terms with the family, there were occasions when she
      didn't quite know how to behave. She attempted to continue her conversation with the Baronet,
      but Lady Grantham would not allow it.
"Edith, you know he doesn't know 'God save the Queen' when he hears it. You'll only make him
      conceited."
"She's only like this when she's here, Miss Staines," remarked Frank, alluding to his mother
      in the third person. "She's awfully polite when she's in London; she was to you the first week
      you were here, you know, but she can't keep it up. She's had a bad education. Poor dear!"
"Oh, you are a queer family," said Edith sometimes. "You really ought to have no faults
      left, any of you, you are so wonderfully candid to each other."
"Some people think mother so charming," continued Frank. "I never yet found out what her
      particular charm is."
On this occasion, when Edith mentioned that Dodo was coming to stay with her, Lady Grantham
      sounded truce at once, and left her unnatural offspring alone.
"I wish you'd ask me to come and stay with you, too," said she presently. "Bob and Frank
      will be going off partridge shooting all day, and Nora and I will be all alone, and they'll be
      sleepy in the evening, and snore in the drawing-room."
"I'd make her promise to be polite, Miss Staines," remarked Frank.
"I want to meet Lady Chesterford very much," she continued. "I hear she is so charming.
      She's a friend of yours; isn't she, Nora? Why have you never asked her to stay here? What's
      the good of having friends if you don't trot them out?"
"Oh, I've asked her more than once, mother," said Miss Grantham, "but she couldn't ever
      come."
"She's heard about ma at home," said Frank.
"I'm backing you, Frank," remarked the Baronet, who was still rather sore after his recent
      drubbing. "Go in and win, my boy."
"Bob, you shouldn't encourage Frank to be rude," said Lady Grantham. "He's bad enough
      without that."
"That's what comes of having a mamma with foreign manners. There's no word for 'thank you'
      in Spanish, is there, mother? Were you here with Charlie Broxton, Miss Staines? She told him
      he didn't brush his hair, or his teeth, and she hated little men. Charlie's five feet three.
      He was here as my friend."
"Do come," said Edith, when this skirmishing was over. "Nora will come with you, of course.
      We shall be only four. I don't suppose there will be anyone else at home."
"Hurrah," said Frank, "we'll have a real good time, father. No nagging in the evenings. We
      won't dress, and we'll smoke in the drawing-room."
"I long to see Dodo again," remarked Miss Grantham. "She's one of the few people I never get
      at all tired of."
"I know her by sight," said Lady Grantham. "She was talking very loud to Prince Waldenech
      when I saw her. It was at the Brettons'."
"Dodo can talk loud when she wants," remarked Miss Grantham. "Did you see her dance that
      night, mother? I believe she was splendid."
"She was doing nothing else," replied Lady Grantham.
"Oh, but by herself," said Edith. "She took a select party away, and tucked up her skirts
      and sent them all into raptures."
"That's so like Dodo," said Miss Grantham. "She never does anything badly. If she does it at
      all, it's good of its kind."
"I should like to know her," said Lady Grantham. The remark was characteristic.
Lady Grantham returned to the subject of Dodo in the course of the evening.
"Everyone says she is so supremely successful," she said to Edith. "What's her method?"
All successful people, according to Lady Grantham, had a method. They found out by
      experience what rôle suited them best, and they played it assiduously. To do her
      justice, there was a good deal of truth in it with regard to the people among whom she
      moved.
"Her method is purely to be dramatic, in the most unmistakable way," said Edith, after some
      consideration. "She is almost always picturesque. To all appearance her only method is to have
      no method. She seems to say and do anything that comes into her head, but all she says and
      does is rather striking. She can accommodate herself to nearly any circumstances. She is never
      colourless; and she is not quite like anybody else I ever met. She has an immense amount of
      vitality, and she is almost always doing something. It's hopeless to try and describe her; you
      will see. She is beautiful, unscrupulous, dramatic, warm-hearted, cold-blooded, and a hundred
      other things."
"Oh, you don't do her justice, Edith," remarked Miss Grantham. "She's much more than all
      that. She has got genius, or something very like it. I think Dodo gives me a better idea of
      the divine fire than anyone else."
"Then the divine fire resembles something not at all divine on occasions," observed Edith.
      "I don't think that the divine fire talks so much nonsense either."
Lady Grantham got up.
"I expect to be disappointed," she said. "Geniuses are nearly always badly dressed, or they
      wear spectacles, or they are very short. However, I shall come. Come, Nora, it's time to go to
      bed."
Lady Grantham never said "good-night" or "good-morning" to the members of her family. "They
      all sleep like hogs," she said, "and they are very cheerful in the morning. They get on quite
      well enough without my good wishes. It is very plebeian to be cheerful in the morning."
Although, as I have mentioned before, Sir Robert was an adept at choosing his conversation
      to suit his audience, there was one subject on which he considered that he might talk to
      anyone, and in which the whole world must necessarily take an intelligent and eager interest.
      The Romans used to worship the bones and spirits of their ancestors, and Sir Robert, perhaps
      because he was undoubtedly of Roman imperial blood, kept up the same custom. Frank used
      irreverently to call it "family prayers."
To know how the Granthams were connected with the Campbells, and the Vere de Veres, and the
      Stanleys, and the Montmorencies, and fifty other bluest strains, seemed to Sir Robert to be an
      essential part of a liberal education.
To try to be late for family prayers was hopeless. They were at no fixed hour, and were held
      as many times during the day as necessary. Sometimes they were cut down to a sentence or two;
      suggested by the mention of some ducal name; sometimes they involved a lengthy, pious orgie in
      front of the portraits. To-night Edith was distinctly to blame, for she deliberately asked the
      name of the artist who had painted the picture hanging over the door into the library.
Sir Robert, according to custom, seemed rather bored by the subject. "Let's see," he said;
      "I've got no head for names. I think that's the one, of my great-grandfather, isn't it? A
      tall, handsome man in peer's robes?"
"Now he's off." This sotto voce from Frank, who was reading Badminton on Cover
      Shooting.
Sir Robert drew his hand over his beautiful moustache once or twice.
"Ah, yes, how stupid of me. That's the Reynolds, of course. Reynolds was quite unknown when
      he did that portrait. Lord Linton, that was my great-grand-father—he was made an earl after
      that portrait was taken—saw a drawing in a little shop in Piccadilly, which took his fancy,
      and he inquired the name of the artist. The shopman didn't know; but he said that the young
      man came very often with drawings to sell, and he gave him a trifle for them. Well, Lord
      Linton sent for him, and gave him a commission to do his portrait, had it exhibited, and young
      Reynolds came into notice. The portrait came into possession of my grandfather, who, as you
      know, was a younger son; don't know how, and there it is."
"It's a beautiful picture," remarked Edith.
"Ah, you like it? Lord Sandown, my first cousin, was here last week, and he said, 'Didn't
      know you'd been raised to the Peerage yet, Bob.' He thought it was a portrait of me. It is
      said to be very like. You'd noticed the resemblance, no doubt?"
"A tall, handsome man," remarked Frank to the fireplace.
"I don't know as much as I ought about my ancestors," continued Sir Robert, who was doing
      himself a gross injustice. "You ought to get Sandown on the subject. I found a curious old
      drawing the other day in a scrapbook belonging to my father. The name Grantham is printed in
      the centre of a large folio sheet, with a circle round it to imitate the sun, and from it go
      out rays in all directions, with the names of the different families with which we have
      intermarried."
"I haven't got any ancestors," remarked Edith. "My grandfather was a draper in Leeds, and
      made his fortune there. I should think ancestors were a great responsibility; you have to live
      up to them, or else they live down to you."
"I'm always saying to Frank," said Sir Robert, "that you have to judge a man by himself, and
      not by his family. If a man is a pleasant fellow it doesn't matter whether his family came
      over with the Conqueror or not. Our parson here, for instance, he's a decent sensible fellow,
      and I'm always delighted to give him a few days' shooting, or see him to dinner on Sunday
      after his services. His father was a tobacconist in the village, you know. There's the shop
      there now."
Edith rose to go.
Sir Robert lighted her candle for her.
"I should like to show you the few portraits we've got," he said. "There are some
      interesting names amongst them; but, of course, most of our family things are at
      Langfort."
"My grandfather's yard measure is the only heirloom that we've got," said Edith. "I'll show
      it to Lady Grantham when she comes to stay with me."
Frank had followed them into the hall.
"Family prayers over yet, father?" he asked. "I shall go and smoke. I hope you've been
      devout, Miss Staines."
Edith left the Granthams two days after this, "to buy legs of mutton," she explained, "and
      hire a charwoman. I don't suppose there's anyone at home. But I shall have things straight by
      the time you come."
Sir Robert was very gracious, and promised to send her a short memoir he was writing on the
      fortunes of the family. It was to be bound in white vellum, with their arms in gilt upon the
      outside.
Edith, found no one at home but a few servants on board wages, who did not seem at all
      pleased to see her. She devoted her evening to what she called tidying, which consisted in
      emptying the contents of a quantity of drawers on to the floor of her room, and sitting down
      beside them. She turned them over with much energy for about half an hour, and then decided
      that she could throw nothing away, and told her maid to put them back again, and played her
      piano till bed-time.
Lady Grantham and Nora followed in a few days, and Dodo was to come the same evening. They
      were sitting put in the garden after dinner, when the sound of wheels was heard, and Edith
      went round to the front door to welcome her.
Dodo had not dined, so she went and "made hay among the broken meats," as she expressed it.
      Travelling produced no kind of fatigue in her; and the noise, and shaking, and smuts, that
      prey on most of us in railway carriages always seemed to leave her untouched. Dodo was
      particularly glad to get to England. She had had rather a trying time of it towards the end,
      for Jack and the Prince got on extremely badly together, and, as they both wished to be with
      Dodo, collisions were frequent. She gave the story of her adventure to Edith with singular
      frankness as she ate her broken meats.
"You see, Jack got it into his head that the Prince is a cad and a brute," said Dodo. "I
      quite admit that he may be, only neither Jack nor I have the slightest opportunity for
      judging. Socially he is neither, and what he is morally doesn't concern me. How should it? It
      isn't my business to inquire into his moral character. I'm not his mother nor his mother
      confessor. He is good company. I particularly like his sister, whom you must come and see,
      Edith. She and the Prince are going to stay with us when we get back to Winston; and he knows
      how to behave. Jack has a vague sort of feeling that his morals ought to prevent him from
      tolerating the Prince, which made him try to find opportunities for disliking him. But Jack
      didn't interfere with me."
"No," said Edith; "I really don't see why private individuals shouldn't associate with whom
      they like. One doesn't feel bound to be friends with people of high moral character, so I
      don't see why one should be bound to dislike people of low ditto."
"That's exactly my view," said Dodo; "morals don't come into the question at all. I
      particularly dislike some of the cardinal virtues—and the only reason for associating with
      anybody is that one takes pleasure in their company. Of course one wouldn't go about with a
      murderer, however amusing, because his moral deficiencies-might produce unpleasant physical
      consequences to yourself. But my morals are able to look after themselves. I'm not afraid of
      moral cut-throats. Morals don't come into the social circle. You might as well dislike a man
      because he's got a sharp elbow-joint. He won't use it on your ribs, you know, in the
      drawing-room. To get under the influence of an immoral man would be different. We'll, I've
      finished. Where are the others? Give me a cigarette, Edith. I sha'n't shock your servants,
      shall I? I've given up shocking people."
Dodo and Edith strolled out, and Dodo was introduced to Lady Grantham.
"What an age you and Edith have been," said Miss Grantham. "I have been dying to see you,
      Dodo."
"We were talking," said Dodo, "and for once Edith agreed with me."
"She never agrees with me," remarked Lady Grantham.
"I wonder if I should always agree with you then," said Dodo. "Do things that disagree with
      the same thing agree with one another?"
"What did Edith agree with you about?" asked Miss Grantham.
"I'm not sure that I did really agree with her," interpolated Edith.
"Oh, about morals," said Dodo. "I said that a man's morals did not matter in ordinary social
      life. That they did not come into the question at all."
"No, I don't think I do agree with you," said Edith. "All social life is a degree of
      intimacy, and you said yourself that you wouldn't get under the influence of an immoral man—in
      other words, you wouldn't be intimate with him."
"Oh, being intimate hasn't anything to do with being under a man's influence," said Dodo.
      "I'm very intimate with lots of people. Jack, for instance, but I'm not under his
      influence."
"Then you think it doesn't matter whether society is composed of people without morals?"
      said Edith.
"I think it's a bad thing that morals should deteriorate in any society," said Dodo; "but I
      don't think that society should take cognisance of the moral code. Public opinion don't touch
      that. If a man is a brute, he won't be any better for knowing that other people disapprove of
      him. If he knows that, and is worth anything at all, it will simply have the opposite effect
      on him. He very likely will try to hide it; but that doesn't make it any better. A whited
      sepulchre is no better than a sepulchre unwhitened. You must act by your own lights. If an
      action doesn't seem to you wrong nothing in the world will prevent your doing it, if your
      desire is sufficiently strong. You cannot elevate tone by punishing offences. There are no
      fewer criminals since the tread-mill was invented and Botany Bay discovered."
"You mean that there would be no increase in crime if the law did not punish?"
"I mean that punishment is not the best way of checking crime, though that is really
      altogether a different question. You won't check immorality by dealing with it as a social
      crime."
There was a short silence, broken only by the whispering of the wind in the fir trees. Then
      on the stillness came a light, rippling laugh. Dodo got out of her chair, and plucked a couple
      of roses from a bush near her.
"I can't be serious any longer," she said; "not a single moment longer. I'm so dreadfully
      glad to be in England again. Really, there is no place like it. I hate the insolent
      extravagant beauty of Switzerland —it is like chromo lithographs. Look at that long, flat,
      grey distance over there. There is nothing so beautiful as that abroad."
Dodo fastened the roses in the front of her dress, and laughed again.
"I laugh for pure happiness," she continued. "I laughed when I saw the cliff of Dover
      to-day, not because I was sea-sick—I never am sea-sick—but simply because I was coming home
      again. Jack parted from me at Dover. I am very happy about Jack. I believe in him
      thoroughly."
Dodo was getting serious again in spite of herself. Lady Grantham was watching her
      curiously, and without any feeling of disappointment. She did not wear spectacles, she was, at
      least, as tall as herself, and she dressed, if anything, rather better. She was still wearing
      half-mourning, but half-mourning suited Dodo very well.
"Decidedly it's a pity to analyse one's feelings," Dodo went on, "they do resolve themselves
      into such very small factors. I am well, I am in England, where you can eat your dinner
      without suspicion of frogs, or caterpillars in your cauliflower. I had two caterpillars in my
      cauliflower at Zermatt one night. I shall sleep in a clean white bed, and I shall not have to
      use Keating. I can talk as ridiculously as I like, without thinking of the French for
      anything. Oh, I'm entirely happy."
Dodo was aware of more reasons for happiness than she mentioned. She was particularly
      conscious of the relief she felt in getting away from the Prince. For some days past she had
      been unpleasantly aware of his presence. She could not manage to think of him quite as lightly
      as she thought of anyone else. It was a continual effort to her to appear quite herself in his
      presence, and she was constantly rushing into extremes in order to seem at her ease. He was
      stronger, she felt, than she was, and she did not like it. The immense relief which his
      absence brought more than compensated for the slight blankness that his absence left. In a way
      she felt dependent on him, which chafed and irritated her, for she had never come under such a
      yoke before. She had had several moments of sudden anger against herself on her way home. She
      found herself always thinking about him when she was not thinking about anything else; and
      though she was quite capable of sending her thoughts off to other subjects, when they had done
      their work they always fluttered back again to the same resting-place, and Dodo was conscious
      of an effort, slight indeed, but still an effort, in frightening them off. Her curious
      insistence on her own happiness had struck Edith. She felt it unnatural that Dodo should
      mention it, and she drew one of two conclusions from it; either that Dodo had had a rather
      trying time, for some reason or other, or that she wished to convince herself, by constant
      repetition, of something that she was not quite sure about; and both of these conclusions were
      in a measure correct.
"Who was out at Zermatt when you were there?" inquired Miss Grantham.
"Oh, there was mother there, and Maud and her husband, and a Russian princess, Waldenech's
      sister, and Jack, of course," said Dodo.
"Wasn't Prince Waldenech there himself?" she asked.
"The Prince? Oh yes, he was there; didn't I say so?" said Dodo.
"He's rather amusing, isn't he?" said Miss Grantham. "I don't know him at all."
"Oh, yes," said Dodo; "a little ponderous, you know, but very presentable, and good
      company."
Edith looked up suddenly at Dodo. There was an elaborate carelessness, she thought, in her
      voice. It was just a little overdone. The night was descending fast, and she could only just
      see the lines of her face above the misty folds of her grey dress. But even in that half light
      she thought that her careless voice did not quite seem a true interpretation of her
      expression. It might have been only the dimness of the shadow, but she thought she looked
      anxious and rather depressed.
Lady Grantham drew her shawl more closely round her shoulders, and remarked that it was
      getting cold. Edith got up and prepared to go in, and Miss Grantham nestled in her chair. Only
      Dodo stood quite motionless, and Edith noticed that her hands were tearing one of the roses to
      pieces, and scattering the petals on the grass.
"Are you going in, Dodo?" she asked; "or would you rather stop out a little longer?"
"I think I won't come in just yet," said Dodo; "it's so delightful to have a breath of cool
      air, after being in a stuffy carriage all day. But don't any of you stop out if you'd rather
      go in. I shall just smoke one more cigarette."
"I'll stop with you, Dodo," said Miss Grantham. "I don't want to go in at all. Edith, if
      you're going in, throw the windows in the drawing-room open, and play to us."
Lady Grantham and Edith went towards the house.
"I didn't expect her to be a bit like that," said Lady Grantham. "I always heard she was so
      lively, and talked more nonsense in half an hour than we can get through in a year. She's very
      beautiful."
"I think Dodo must be tired or something," said Edith. "I never saw her like that before.
      She was horribly serious. I hope nothing has happened."
The piano in the drawing-room was close to a large French window opening on to the lawn.
      Edith threw it open, and stood for a moment looking out into the darkness. She could just see
      Dodo and Nora sitting where they had left them, though they were no more than two pale spots
      against the dark background. She was conscious of a strange feeling that there was an
      undercurrent at work in Dodo, which showed itself by a few chance bubbles and little sudden
      eddies on the surface, which she thought required explanation.
Dodo certainly was not quite like herself. There was no edge to her vivacity: her attempts
      not to be serious had been distinctly forced, and she was unable to keep it up. Edith felt a
      vague sense of coming disaster; slight but certain. However, she drew her chair to the piano
      and began to play.
Miss Grantham was conscious of the same sort of feeling. Since the others had gone in, Dodo
      had sat quite silent, and she had not taken her cigarette.
"You had a nice time then, abroad?" she remarked at length.
"Oh, yes," said Dodo, rousing herself. "I enjoyed it a good deal. The hotel was full of the
      hotel class, you know. A little trying at times, but not to matter. We had a charming party
      there. Algernon is getting quite worldly. However, he is ridiculously fond of Maud, and she'll
      keep him straight. Do you know the Prince?"
"Hardly at all," said Miss Grantham.
"What do you think of him, as far as you've seen?" asked Dodo.
"I think he is rather impressive," said Miss Grantham. "I felt I should do as he told
      me."
"Ah, you think that, do you?" asked Dodo, with the most careful carelessness. "He struck me
      that way, too, a little."
"I should think he was an instance of what Edith meant when she said that to be intimate
      with anyone was to be under their influence."
"Edith's awfully wrong, I think, about the whole idea," said Dodo, hastily. "I should hate
      to be under anyone's influence; yet, I think, the only pleasure of knowing people is to be
      intimate. I would sooner have one real friend than fifty acquaintances."
"Did you see much of him?" asked Miss Grantham.
"Yes, a good deal," she said, "a great deal, in fact. I think Edith's right about intimacy
      as regards him, though he's an exception. In general, I think, she's wrong. What's that she's
      playing?"
"Anyhow, it's Wagner," said Miss Grantham.
"I know it," said Dodo. "It's the 'Tannhauser' overture. Listen, there's the Venus motif
      crossing the Pilgrim's march. Ah, that's simply wicked. The worst of it is, the Venus part is
      so much more attractive than the other. It's horrible."
"You're dreadfully serious to-night, Dodo," said Miss Grantham.
"I'm a little tired, I think," she said. "I was travelling all last night, you know. Come,
      let's go in."
Dodo went to bed soon afterwards. She said she was tired, and a little overdone. Edith
      looked at her rather closely as she said good-night.
"You're sure it's nothing more?" she asked. "There's nothing wrong with you, is there?"
"I shall be all right in the morning," said Dodo, rather wearily. "Don't let them call me
      till nine."
Dodo went upstairs and found that her maid had unpacked for her. A heap of books was lying
      on the table, and from among these she drew out a large envelope with a photograph inside. It
      was signed "Waldenech."
Dodo looked at it a moment, then placed it back in its envelope, and went to the window. She
      felt the necessity of air. The room seemed close and hot, and she threw it wide open.
She stood there for ten minutes or more quite still, looking out into the night. Then she
      went back to the table and took up the envelope again. With a sudden passionate gesture she
      tore it in half, then across again, and threw the pieces into the grate.
