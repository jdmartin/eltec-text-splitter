CHAPTER II.
CONTAINS A FEW DETAILS.
IN an old second-hand bookshop in London, an old man sat reading Gibbon's History of Rome.
      He did not put down his book when the postman brought him a letter. He just glanced
      indifferently at the letter, and impatiently at the postman. Zerviah Holme did not like to be
      interrupted when he was reading Gibbon; and as he was always reading Gibbon, an interruption
      was always regarded by him as an insult.
About two hours afterwards, he opened the letter, and learnt that his niece, Bernardine, had
      arrived safely in Petershof, and that she intended to get better and come home strong. He tore
      up the letter, and instinctively turned to the photograph on the mantelpiece. It was the
      picture of a face young and yet old, sad and yet with possibilities of merriment, thin and
      drawn and almost wrinkled, and with piercing eyes which, even in the dull lifelessness of the
      photograph, seemed to be burning themselves away. Not a pleasing nor a good face; yet
      intensely pathetic because of its undisguised harassment.
Zerviah looked at it for a moment.
"She has never been much to either of us," he said to himself. "And yet, when Malvina was
      alive, I used to think that she was hard on Bernardine. I believe I said so once or twice. But
      Malvina had her own way of looking at things. Well, that is over now."
He then, with characteristic speed, dismissed all thoughts which did not relate to Roman
      History; and the remembrance of Malvina, his wife, and Bernardine, his niece, took up an
      accustomed position in the background of his mind.
Bernardine had suffered a cheerless childhood in which dolls and toys took no leading part.
      She had no affection to bestow on any doll, nor any woolly lamb, nor apparently on any human
      person; unless, perhaps, there was the possibility of a friendly inclination towards Uncle
      Zerviah, who would not have understood the value of any deeper feeling, and did not therefore
      call the child cold-hearted and unresponsive, as he might well have done.
This she certainly was, judged by the standard of other children; but then no softening
      influences had been at work during her tenderest years. Aunt Malvina knew as much about
      sympathy as she did about the properties of an ellipse; and even the fairies had failed to win
      little Bernardine. At first they tried with loving patience what they might do for her; they
      came out of their books, and danced and sang to her, and whispered sweet stories to her, at
      twilight, the fairies' own time. But she would have none of them, for all their gentle
      persuasion. So they gave up trying to please her, and left her as they had found her,
      loveless. What can be said of a childhood which even the fairies have failed to touch with the
      warm glow of affection?
Such a little restless spirit, striving to express itself now in this direction, now in
      that; yet always actuated by the same constant force, the desire for work. Bernardine
      seemed to have no special wish to be useful to others; she seemed just to have a natural
      tendency to work, even as others have a natural tendency to play. She was always in earnest;
      life for little Bernardine meant something serious.
Then the years went by. She grew up and filled her life with many interests and ambitions.
      She was at least a worker, if nothing else; she had always been a diligent scholar, and now
      she took her place as an able teacher. She was self-reliant, and, perhaps, somewhat conceited.
      But, at least, Bernardine the young woman had learnt something which Bernardine the young
      child had not been able to learn: she learnt how to smile. It took her, about six and twenty
      years to learn; still, some people take longer than that; in fact, many never learn. This is a
      brief summary of Bernardine Holme's past.
Then, one day, when she was in the full swing of her many engrossing occupations: teaching,
      writing articles for newspapers, attending socialistic meetings, and taking part in political
      discussions —she was essentially a modern product, this Bernardine —one day she fell ill. She
      lingered in London for some time, and then she went to Petershof.
