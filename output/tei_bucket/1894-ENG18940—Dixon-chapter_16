CHAPTER XVI
TWO ULTIMATUMS
IN the professional solemnity of the consulting-room, the large, bland face of Dr.
     Danby looked grave. Tapping his stethoscope, with which he had just made an examination of
     Mary, he looked her straight in the eyes.
‘The fact is, my child, you ought to know the truth. You will not, believe me, be able to do
     the work you are doing. As a matter of fact, you are very, very far from strong. Nothing
     dangerous, I admit, but great deli—cacy,’ he added thoughtfully, pronouncing the word
     ‘delicacy’ with a certain unction, as an attribute which applied mostly to charming young
     women. ‘None of the vital organs are attacked as yet,’ he went on, ‘but there is a terrible
     want of tone. If I were asked to describe you, I should say you were a bundle of nerves.
     Slightly anæmic, too,’ continued the doctor, frowning. ‘You live too much in London. There is
     too much strain on the nervous system. You have,
      you see, an unfortunate previous history. Your father, you
     must remember, was not able to stand the strain; your poor mother died when she was a mere
     girl. A mere girl,’ repeated the great man, shaking his head.
‘Well, that, at any rate, I shall not be able to accomplish,’ said Mary drily. ‘You know,
     doctor, that I am nearly twenty-eight.’
‘Dear me, dear me—you don't look it.’ And then he added briskly, taking out a sheet of paper
     and beginning to write a prescription, ‘I should like to have all you young ladies living a
     healthy out-of-door life, happily married, and with no mental worries. There is something wrong
     somewhere,’ he muttered to himself, ‘with our boasted civilisation. It's all unnatural. Not
     fit, not fit for girls.’
There was a silence. Mary said nothing, but observed, with much interest, a sparrow which was
     conveying to a nest in the drain-pipe a crust of bread which the servants had thrown out in the
     yard. Since Vincent's letter—a long, characteristic letter, speaking of new duties, and
     obligations, of personal sacrifices for the cause which he had so much at heart, and of his
     dread of dragging her down ‘to a life of pecuniary restraints and restricted horizons’—she had
     almost felt as if she must give up the fight. Her nerves were completely unstrung,
      but she had never stopped working. In work there was at
     least forgetfulness.
‘Arsenic, iron, and strychnine, with something for the nerves,’ said the doctor,
     thoughtfully; ‘and the Volnay I told you of before. There should be a complete change of scene
     and ideas.’
‘I'll try the tonic and the burgundy, please,’ said Mary, as she rose to go. ‘I cannot leave
     London now; and I don't see any prospect of doing so. And—and—it isn't exactly serious, dear
     Dr. Danby?’ she continued, looking him, in her turn, straight in the face with her charming
     eyes.
‘My dear child,’ he said kindly, ‘life without health and happiness is not worth having. Let
     me beg you to stop, to take care of yourself, to think of others,’ he added vaguely.
‘I wonder whom I've got to think of?’ thought Mary, as she went down the step of the Wimpole
     Street house. ‘Jimmie, who will probably marry before he is one-and-twenty? Aunt Julia, at
     Bournemouth, who thinks I am given over to the evil one since I've become a journalist?
     Vincent?’—but here Mary pulled up her thoughts with a jerk. Yet the words ‘life without health
     and happiness,’ ‘very del-i-cate,’ repeated themselves in her brain, as she made her way
     towards the Strand, where she had an appointment with the editor of
      Illustrations.

And with this new care pressing upon her, never had the Strand seemed so dreary, so cheaply
     vicious, as to-day under the hurrying clouds.
‘Spesh—shul!—Globe piper—St. James's Gizett—Pall
      Mall,’ shouted a newsboy in her ear, at Charing-cross; and looking down she read, in
     blue or red letters, spattered and stained with London mud, the posters of the evening
     newspapers:—‘The Great Divorce Case. Cross-examination of the Plaintiff, Unabridged Report.
     Ladies ordered out of Court. Sketches of the Co-respondents.’ For the Blaythewaite scandal
     hung, like a pestilence, over England. Like some foul miasma, it poisoned everything. It met
     the eye, in columns of close print, at the breakfast table; it formed the one subject of
     conversation wherever people met. With hoarse laughs and brutal jests, it was discussed in
     public-houses and at street corners; with tepid, meaning smiles and shrugged shoulders in
     drawing-rooms and clubs.
And meanwhile the great tide of humanity swept on. A dray had got across the crowded street,
     and a procession of loaded omnibuses, whose drivers were bandying oaths and scathing cockney
     satire, drew up at the curb. Outside Charing Cross station two girls in tawdry
      capes were quarrelling and gesticulating, while a man in a
     round hat, who had just arrived by train, and who appeared to be the cause of the dispute,
     turned from them both, hailed a hansom, and drove off with a relieved air. A small gaping crowd
     at once gathered round the wranglers on the pavement. ‘Run 'em both in,’ said a raucous voice
     on the fringe of the crowd; and, indeed, a policeman's helmet was now seen bearing down towards
     the group. Mary hurried on. Further on there were sordid little eating-houses displaying a
     joint of raw meat, a cauliflower, and a plate of oysters; and dark narrow passages—the entrance
     to theatres—ornamented with coloured posters of the latest three-act farce. Inexpressibly
     dreary were the pictures which invited one within: representations of elderly ladies in black
     silk, falling backwards into hip-baths: monster heads of comedians, with flaxen wigs and
     brick-red complexions, displaying all their teeth in a frightful grin; full-length posters of
     girls with knowing smiles and abnormally developed limbs; while further on, outside a
     music-hall, was the picture of a raffish-looking dwarf, who was described with engaging
     optimism as ‘screamingly funny.’
‘Spesh—shul! Extry spesh—shul! The great divorce case! Ex-trorinary evidence!
     Cross-examination of Sir 'Orris Blaythewaite’!
      shouted a small newsvendor in Mary's ear, as she waited at
     Wellington Street to cross.
And all the while, as she hurried along to the office, with this new terror of broken health
     knocking at her brain, she wondered what the abrupt summons could mean which she had received
     from the editor. Half of the MSS. of her novel was in his hands. Could it be possible that he
     was going to refuse it?
With some trepidation, Mary gave her name to her old admirer, the small office boy, whom she
     found casting a supercilious eye over the current number of the paper, while he furtively
     sucked an acid drop. And in due time she found herself ushered into the editor's private room.
     Six months of proof-reading, of interviewing incapable artists, of the thousand worries of a
     newspaper, had not made the manners of the editor of Illustrations more
     gracious.
‘Good day, Miss Erle. Take a chair. I want to talk to you.’
‘Is it anything,’ asked Mary, ‘about the novel?’
‘The fact is,’ said the melancholy man, tapping with an irritable hand on a pile of
     manuscript near his desk, which Mary recognised with some anxiety as her own, ‘it won't do at
     all. It won't do at all.’
‘It—won't do?’ faltered Mary. ‘Why, I've
      written it just as you told me. There's a ball in the first
     volume, a parting in the second—’
‘Oh, that's all right,’ interrupted the editor. ‘But, my dear young lady,’ he added, ‘you've
     put the most extraordinary things in this last chapter. Why, there's a young man making love to
     his friend's wife. I can't print that sort of thing in my paper. The public won't stand it.
     They want thoroughly healthy reading.’
‘Do they?’ said Mary, who could not help remembering the columns of unedifying matter which
     had lain on the breakfast-table that morning, nor the newsboys vending the latest detail of the
     great scandal, served red-hot at the street corners. ‘I thought,’ she continued quietly, ‘that
     the public would take anything—in a newspaper.’
For a minute the editor looked perplexed. Then, frowning slightly, he went on: ‘Not in
     fiction—not in fiction. Must be fit to go into every parsonage in England. Remember that you
     write chiefly for healthy English homes.’
‘But even the people in the country parsonage must occasionally see life as it is—or do they
     go about with their eyes shut?’ ventured Mary quietly.
‘Well, we're not going to encourage that sort of thing,’ he said conclusively, getting up and
     putting his mouth to the telephone.

‘Hullo! Richards! No. Yes, of course. Not got the portrait of Lady Blaythewaite? What?
     Spoiled? Take another kodak into court, then. Eh? Yes. See that it's a good likeness. All the
     co-respondents for this week's issue. And see that they're touched up. What? Yes, yes. A couple
     of pages of drawings.’
The editor sat down again. Their eyes met.
‘The fact is,’ he said, looking rather foolish, ‘novels are—er—well—novels. The British
     public doesn't expect them to be like life. And if you take my advice, Miss Erle, and cultivate
     your talents in the right way, you will be able to make a—a—comfortable income. Only there must
     be a thoroughly breezy, healthy tone.’
‘Oh, as to breezy,’ said Mary, in a tired voice, ‘I never somehow feel like that. I don't
     know how it is, but I can't help seeing things as they are, and the truth is so supremely
     attractive.’
‘But it is just what the public won't stand,’ repeated the editor. ‘Now take this chapter
     back and reconsider it. This young man, now—he isn't a principal character in the
     story—couldn't you make him her cousin—or her brother?’
‘Oh, anything you like,’ said Mary, taking the manuscript; ‘but I did like that chapter.
      I took so much trouble over it. It was a little bit of real
     observation.’
‘That's right. And if you don't mind my saying so, there aren't quite enough love scenes
     between the hero and the heroine. The public like love-scenes, and besides, they illustrate so
     well.’
‘Is there anything more?’ asked Mary, trying to force the manuscript into her pocket.
‘I should suggest a thoroughly happy ending. The public like happy endings. The novelists are
     getting so morbid. It's all these French and Russian writers that have done it. It's really
     difficult now to get a thoroughly breezy book with a wedding at the end. Take my advice and
     stick to pretty stories. They're bound to pay best.’
‘That's what Perry Jackson thinks,’ said Mary to herself, as she stepped out into the windy
     Strand. ‘And he certainly understands—he always did understand—the public.’ The banal, the pretty-pretty, the obvious! This was what she was to
     write—if she wanted to make any money, to keep her head above water. And the kindly words of
     the doctor reiterated themselves in her brain: ‘All you young ladies ought to be living a
     healthy, out-door life, happily married, and with no mental worries!’ And then, with a kind of
     obstinate courage, she thought of what she should do to get better. She would try and eat more
     meat; she would
      order some burgundy at the stores; she would try and get
     more out in the open air; and there was the tonic—the arsenic and strychnine—which sometimes,
     for a week or two, seemed to give her a fresh lease of life. She must take some of that
     prescription to-night, for to-morrow she had to go all the way to the Whitechapel Hospital to
     do a scene for her book. It would be tiring, very tiring, but it had all been arranged with
     Alison and Dr. Strange. The outlines of the long narrow street were growing vague in the
     twilight. The omnibuses, loaded inside and out, loomed in dark masses against the pink western
     sky. The aspect of the crowd had changed. Hardly any women were to be seen, and the newsboys,
     bawling their loudest, were thrusting their wares in the faces of busy lawyers hurrying from
     the Courts. With the passing hours, events, it would seem, had waxed more exciting.
‘Spesh-shul! Extry Spesh-hul! Fifth Edition! Sir 'Orris Blaythewaite in the box! Revoltin'
     details! The great divorce case!’ shouted the newsboys.
And beneath the cold, unheeding, scudding clouds, the world which writes, and buys, and sells
     the news of the evening was pushing, hurrying, and jostling elbows up and down the wind-swept
     Strand.
