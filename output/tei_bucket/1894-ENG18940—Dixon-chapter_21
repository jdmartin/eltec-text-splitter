CHAPTER XXI
THE WORLD WAGS ON
FIVE years had passed.
All day long the streets had been full of carriages going and coming from Buckingham Palace.
     The spring sunshine fell on the pink arms, the thin bare shoulders of young girls on the back
     seats of broughams and closed barouches, which passed swiftly by, leaving a vision of a foam of
     tulle, an excited young face, a cascade of flowers, or the large complacent bosom of a
     chaperon.
Some of these carriages stopped, towards five o'clock, at Lady Jane Ives' in Portman Square.
     The drawing-room was already spread with shining satin trains, and heavy with the odour of
     slightly faded hothouse flowers, before the hostess herself appeared, for Lady Jane was
     presenting a niece, and had been late in getting away from the palace. One or two men, vaguely
     bored, strayed about with uncertain feet among the yards of satin and brocade which covered the
     floor; and the women, in their nodding
      plumes and foolish trains, seemed conscious of their
     wrinkled throats and faded skins, as they stood, with a somewhat forced smile, receiving the
     usual compliments.
But very soon Lady Jane appeared, swimming into the room with her large smile, and her ruby
     velvet train, and having behind her a young girl in white, with puffy pink cheeks and an
     alarmed air.
‘My niece, Victoria,’ she announced to every one, in her rapid, genial manner. ‘Presented
     today; my brother's girl, you know. Dear Victoria is so devoted to society; she is going to
     stay with me. It will be quite charming.’
And Mr. Beaufort Flower, with a huge white button-hole which accentuated the dingy yellow of
     his skin, and with several tell-tale wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, murmured to Mr.
     Bosanquet-Barry as he gazed with half-closed lids at the new candidate for society's
     favours;—
‘I adore drawing-room teas. One sees so much of people, don't you know. And in
     the daylight, too, one gets such a good idea of what they are really like,’ he tittered,
     turning to where Lady Blaythewaite's creamy white shoulders were illuminated by the full glare
     from the window, the sunlight sparkling on the diamond tiara round her forehead.
‘She's got her best “fender” on,’ said Mr.
      Bosanquet-Barry, with rising interest, ‘by Jove! did you
     ever see such jewels? And what a skin! She looks like some superb animal.’
‘Oh, no, she don't,’ whispered Beaufy, in his acidulous voice, ‘animals never look depraved.
     And for my part, I don't admire her so much as all that. Poor Lady Blay is so odiously,
     blatantly healthy.’
The room was nearly full when Mary came up the stairs. A stout lady in green, whose
     extremities looked extraordinarily large in their white coverings, thrust a bouquet of spiked
     flowers in her eye as she reached the landing, and then stared, with all the impertinence of a
     certain kind of British matron, when the girl stepped back, annoyed.
‘Oh, dear Miss Erle,’ said a shrill voice at the door, ‘do come in.
     It's such a nice party. I wonder,’ continued Mr. Beaufort Flower, who entertained a good deal
     himself, ‘why other people's parties are so much nicer than one's own? I suppose it is because
     one always knows so many more people at other people's houses?’
‘Who is here?’ said Mary, who never troubled herself to laugh at his small witticisms.
‘All sorts of pretty people. There's Lady Blaythewaite, “looking magnificent in yellow.”’ He
     always made a point of praising other women when he talked to ladies, in the pleasing hope
      that it would annoy them. ‘She never misses going to Court
     once a year; but really, you know, she's got to! There's the Duchess of Birkenhead now,’ he
     chattered on, ‘she's only been once since her marriage, you know. But then she needn't, because
     she's so perfectly, so entirely respectable!’ And he disappeared with a delighted little
     wriggle in the crowd, and a few minutes later Mary saw him pouring his sub-acid compliments
     into Lady Blaythewaite's ear.
There was some attempt at animation in the rooms now. There were crowds of ladies as well as
     those who had been to Court, and a hired pianist, making tinkling sounds on a somewhat worn
     piano, was endeavouring to impart a false air of gaiety to the affair. The words, ‘the Queen,’
     ‘the Princess,’ ‘heliotrope brocade,’ ‘exquisite diamonds,’ and ‘fearful crush,’ were bandied
     about the room. Some one related a story that a Colonial lady of much wealth had been turned
     away because she had worn tan-coloured gloves, and an ancient legend even found listeners that
     a young girl had fallen over her train while backing from the Royal presence. A woman with
     pronounced Jewish features, who wore a smart bonnet and a French frock, explained at some
     length to an indifferent group what had happened when she had been presented last year. And, as
     she stood talking
      to Mr. Bosanquet-Barry, who had, as usual, his air of not
     wishing to be detained, the lady whom Mary remembered in the old days as a player on the harp,
     had placed a piece of music on the piano, and was singing in an elderly, threadbare voice, and
     an accent which left much to be desired, something which sounded like— 
      ‘Allong cueillir lay roas-er.’
      lifting her eyebrows, standing on tip-toe, and slightly wriggling her shoulders as the
     song proceeded.
Mary looked round the room. It all seemed foolish enough; the women with their naked, yellow
     shoulders, their torn veils and faded flowers, the men slipping in and out in their neat frock
     coats, murmuring scandal of the very people whose hands they had just pressed. She could not
     bear the house since Alison's death. The rooms seemed noisy and yet empty without her. It was
     the same outwardly, for here were the usual crowd, chattering, smiling, whispering, as they
     passed in and out. And only she, Mary, seemed to remember. Lady Jane, to be sure, had been
     immersed in grief for some months after the death, but the next season she had reappeared in
     mauve and black, and had resumed her round of drums and dinners. All that had happened five
     years ago. This was the second
      niece that she had successfully launched in society; the
     first had made an excellent match, and Lady Jane only hoped, in confidence to all her intimate
     friends, that Victoria would not think of marrying quite so soon, for it was charming, she
     said—it made her feel quite young again—to have a girl to take out. She never, she complained,
     had been able to make her poor darling Alison take a proper interest in society; only an
     eccentric, intermittent one. And people naturally dislike that. 
      ‘Allons cueillir les ro—’
      urged the lady at the piano, but her voice, not being very strong, was inaudible at
     the end of the song, a termination which was received thankfully, with a decent little murmur
     of applause.
‘Dear Sir Dunlop,’ cried Lady Jane in her deep, genial tones at the door, ‘how good of you to
     find time to drink a dish of tea. Let me introduce to you my niece Victoria. Presented to-day,
     and so devoted to society. Go in, go in, you will find all your pretty friends in there.’
And the face of the fashionable doctor, smooth, smug, successful, was seen here and there
     chatting in the crowd. If the mouth was still hard, the smile was more insinuating than ever. A
     voluptuous feminine atmosphere surrounded him
      as he moved about, as pretty women bent forward to whisper,
     meeting his eyes with an intimate look, or laying detaining, half-caressing fingers on his arm.
     All of these charming ladies had been, were now, or would be, his patients. His reputation had
     grown apace in the last five years; no one could have the megrims in Belgravia or Mayfair
     without consulting Sir Dunlop Strange. Reports of his approaching marriage were constantly
     circulated, but at present, it would seem, there was a barrier in the way; for he was
     understood to be devoted to Lady Blaythewaite. And indeed, as he neared the window where she
     was still standing, the circle of black coats which surrounded her dissolved, and they stood
     practically alone, looking out on the square. The lady slowly turned her handsome, prominent
     eyes upon him, and, with a long gaze which took in every detail of her radiant health and
     beauty, he slipped his nervous, sinewy fingers round her wrist in the shadow of the
     curtain.
Mary was standing near the door, trying to get a breath of air, when the pale, town-bred face
     of Perry Jackson was seen ascending the stair, but she instinctively stepped aside, not knowing
     whether he would care to speak to her. She heard Lady Jane overwhelm him with pretty phrases,
     for she was proud of the portrait
      he had painted of her that year, and adored a new celebrity;
     but Perry Jackson did not come near Mary, and it was with a somewhat forced smile that he
     returned her greeting. ‘I have lost my kind little friend,’ she said to herself with a certain
     bitterness. And then, as Vincent Hemming appeared in the crowd, she said to herself with the
     inconsistency of a woman, ‘Here, at any rate, is some one who cares for me still—a little
     bit.’
The face of Vincent Hemming was that of an irritated, disappointed man. He was, however, as
     perfectly dressed, as elaborately suave as of old, as he stopped to speak to several dowagers
     on his way upstairs. It was always half a pleasure, half a pain to her to meet him, and there
     were times when she felt that the acquiescent feminine smile was a little forced as she talked
     to him at some crowded party, or called on his wife at Queen's Gate.
Hemming had made but a brief appearance in the House of Commons, for he had been unseated
     almost immediately—his agents, it would seem, not having been discreet in the matter of beer;
     and he had had no opportunity of entering the House since. Meanwhile, Mrs. Vincent Hemming had
     not made herself popular in London society, and her husband had always a somewhat uneasy air
     when she was in the
      same room. Lady Jane Ives, for one, openly snubbed her, and
     Vincent had arrived at that stage in an unsuccessful marriage when a husband is not offended at
     being asked out to dinner without his wife. To any other woman but Mary the thing would have
     been a personal triumph.
‘Here is that poor Mr. Hemming that you threw over,’ whispered Lady Jane to Mary; ‘I did not
     ask his impossible wife. I don't know how a man with such delightful cultured tastes could
     marry such a person. If it had only been an American, now! An American or an Australian—then
     nobody would have minded what she said or did.’
And in a few minutes Mary found herself talking, in a conventional voice, of the rain and the
     fine weather, of politics and the park, with the man who had once been so much to her.
     Sometimes, indeed, as he took her down to supper, or handed her a cup of tea, with his little
     formal manner, she wondered how, in those past years, he had been able to make her suffer so.
     But Mary was beginning to understand that women love most of all the men who have done them an
     irreparable wrong.
His face looked grey and tired, and it was with a visible effort that he found phrases
     suitable to be overheard by the nodding plumes, the bare shoulders, and the limp nosegays
     around.

‘You look tired; are you ill?’ she said suddenly, in her old sweet manner. For a moment Mary
     had forgotten.
‘No; it is nothing. I am a little out of sorts I think,’ he said, avoiding her eyes. Then he
     added, after a pause, looking straight at the carpet, ‘You don't know, you can't conceive, what
     worries I have!’
She said nothing; there was nothing she could say. But he looked miserable, and all her
     tender, womanly little heart rushed out to him.
‘Mayn't I get you a cup of tea?’ he said suddenly, offering her his arm, and turning with an
     abrupt movement towards the door. Downstairs, there was the usual struggle for a cup, a
     sugar-basin, a spoon.
‘Why mayn't I come and see you sometimes, Mary?’ he said, in his voice which meant so much
     more than the mere words.
‘Oh, Vincent! You've put cream in my tea, and I can't bear it,’ said Mary, with a comical
     little frown.
‘I'm so sorry, and you don't like sugar either. How could I have forgotten it?’ said Hemming,
     wafting it away in his grand manner. ‘But Mary,’ he continued, when he had battled successfully
     for another cup, ‘why won't you read me some of your work? I used not to be
      a bad critic, though I do little enough myself now. Why
     can't we see each other, sometimes, like that?’
All the blood left her face. It was horrible, horrible of him to talk so; but he must not
     even guess that she cared.
‘Of course,’ she said, after a pause, during which they had been pushed apart by the stout
     lady with the spiky bouquet, who had come downstairs and was forcing her way with a
     business-like air to the buffet. ‘I suppose you can come and be victimised by manuscripts—if
     you want to.’
‘When, Mary?’
‘Oh,’ she said quickly, ‘not to-morrow. I've got to go to the Strand. But the day
     after—?’
‘Aren't you well? Let me look at you,’ said Hemming, as they went up to the drawing-room
     again. ‘Come into the light,’ he continued in an authoritative tone. ‘I can't have
     you getting ill.’
There was a movement of departure in the crowd. The monstrous trains were being caught up,
     bouquets were seen moving towards the door. Mr. Beaufort Flower, slipping in and out, was
     murmuring a last impertinence to a pretty woman on her way downstairs. Lady Jane was beginning
     to look tired, for at seventy, as
      she said, one wasn't in the first blush of youth; and Miss
     Victoria, whose puffy cheeks had assumed a purplish hue, announced to every one, as they made
     their farewells, that she and her aunt were going to a ball that night, which she expected
     would be ‘splendid fun.’ Mr. Bosanquet-Barry, who approved of Miss Erle as an occasional
     contributor because he met her in what he called ‘smart’ houses, bestowed on her a brief vision
     of all his gleaming teeth as he squeezed her hand and passed on without a word.
‘The day after to-morrow, Mary?’ demanded Vincent Hemming, as they stood irresolutely on the
     doorstep among the little crowd of drab-coated footmen. She hardly noticed Mr. Beaufy Flower,
     as he skipped past her down the steps, tripping into his brougham and slamming the door with a
     vicious little click, nor the rather shrill voice, in which there was a triumphant sound,
     giving the direction: ‘To the Bachelors' Club!’
Mary stood silent for a moment, gazing at the stone steps. After all, why should she not see
     Vincent—her old friend, her father's friend? She felt nervous and unstrung; it would be very
     sweet to have him there, to talk to him in a sensible way. She wanted to ask his advice about
     Jimmie, for her young brother, who had duly got his exhibition at Magdalen, had done
      little more during his stay at Oxford than entangle himself
     with, and finally marry, a scout's daughter. Living by herself in lodgings, she never saw any
     one; there seemed to be no one now whose advice she could ask.
‘Yes, come,’ she said suddenly, in a high, clear tone, and, as she went down the steps and
     hurried across the square, she was startled herself by the note of exultation in her voice.
