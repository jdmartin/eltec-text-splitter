CHAPTER XXXVII.
AS Hadria had foretold, she commenced the attack on herself as soon as Henriette
       had departed, and all night long, the stormy inner debate was kept up. Her mind never
       wavered, but her heart was rebellious. Hubert deserved to pay for his conduct; but if we all
       had to pay for our conduct to the uttermost farthing, that would be hard, if just. If Hadria
       assumed the burden of Hubert's debt, it would mean what M. Jouffroy had pointed out. Hubert's
       suffering would be only on account of offended public opinion; hers—but then her parents
       would suffer as well as Hubert. Round and round went the thoughts, like vast wheels, and when
       towards morning, she dozed off a little, the wheels were still turning in a vague, weary way,
       and as they turned, the life seemed to be crushed gradually out of the sleeper.
Jouffroy came to enquire whether the decision had been made. He was in a state of great
       excitement. He gave fervent thanks that Hadria had stood firm.
“You do not forget my words, Madame?”
“I shall never forget them, Monsieur.”
Henriette discreetly forbore to say anything further on the subject of dispute. She waited,
       hopefully.
“Hubert has been troubled about the money that your father set apart, on your marriage, as
       a contribution to the household expenses,” she said, one morning. “Your father did not place
       it all in your name.”
“I know,” said Hadria. “It is tied up, in some way, for the use of the family. I have a
       small sum only in my own control.”

“Hubert is now leaving half of it to accumulate. The other half has still to go towards the
       expenses at the Red House. I suppose you approve?”
“Certainly,” said Hadria. “My father designed it for that purpose.”
“But Hubert feared you might be running short of money, and wished to send you some; but
       the trustees say it is against the conditions of the trust.”
“So I suppose.”
“I wanted you to know about it, that is all,” said Henriette, “Also, I should like to say
       that though Hubert does not feel that he can ask you to return to the Red House, after what
       has happened—he cannot risk your refusing—yet I take it on myself to tell you, that he would
       only be too glad if you would go back.”
“Thank you, I understand.”
Next morning, Henriette came with a letter in her hand.
“Bad news!” Hadria exclaimed.
The letter announced the failure of the Company. It was the final blow. Dunaghee would have
       to be given up. Mrs. Fullerton's settlement was all that she and her husband would now have
       to live upon.
Hadria sat gazing at the letter, with a dazed expression. Almost before the full
       significance of the calamity had been realized, a telegram arrived, announcing that Mrs.
       Fullerton had fallen dangerously ill.
The rest of that day was spent in packing, writing notes, settling accounts, and preparing
       for departure.
“When—how are you going?” cried Madame Vauchelet, in dismay.
“By the night boat, by the night boat,” Hadria replied hurriedly, as if the hurry of her
       speech would quicken her arrival in England.
The great arches of the station which had appealed to her imagination, at the moment of
       arrival, swept upward, hard and grey, in the callous blue light. Hadria breathed deep. Was
        she the same person who had arrived that night, with every
       nerve thrilled with hope and resolve? Ah! there had been so much to learn, and the time had
       been so short. Starting with her present additional experience, she could have managed so
       much better. But of what use to think of that? How different the homeward journey from the
       intoxicating outward flight, in the heyday of the spring!
What did that telegram mean? `Ill; dangerously, dangerously.' The words seemed
       to be repeated cruelly, insistently, by the jogging of the train and the rumble of the
       wheels. The anxiety gnawed on, rising at times into terror, dulling again to a steady ache.
       And then remorse began to fit a long-pointed fang into a sensitive spot in her heart. In vain
       to resist. It was securely placed. Let reason hold her peace.
A thousand fears, regrets, self-accusations, revolts, swarmed insect-like in Hadria's
       brain, as the train thundered through the darkness, every tumultuous sound and motion
       exaggerated to the consciousness, by the fact that there was no distraction of the attention
       by outside objects. Nothing offered itself to the sight except the strange lights and shadows
       of the lamp thrown on the cushions of the carriage; Henriette's figure in one corner, Hannah,
       with the child, in another, and the various rugs and trappings of wandering Britons.
       Everything was contracted, narrow. The sea-passage had the same sinister character. Hadria
       compared it to the crossing of the Styx in Charon's gloomy ferry-boat.
She felt a patriotic thrill on hearing the first mellow English voice pronouncing the first
       kindly English sentence. The simple, slow, honest quality of the English nature gave one a
       sense of safety. What splendid raw material to make a nation out of! But, ah, it was
       sometimes dull to live with! These impressions, floating vaguely in the upper currents of the
       mind, were simultaneous with a thousand thoughts and anxieties, and gusts of bitter fear and
       grief.
What would be the end of it all? This uprooting from the
        old home—it wrung one's heart to think of it. Scarcely
       could the thought be faced. Her father, an exile from his beloved fields and hills; her
       mother banished from her domain of so many years, and after all these disappointments and
       mortifications and sorrows! It was piteous. Where would they live? What would they do?
Hadria fought with her tears. Ah! it was hard for old people to have to start life anew,
       bitterly hard. This was the moment for their children to flock to their rescue, to surround
       them with care, with affection, with devotion; to make them feel that at least
        something that could be trusted, was left to them from the wreck.
“Ah! poor mother, poor kind father, you were very good to us all, very, very good!”
