CHAPTER XL.
“DO you know it is a year to-day, since we came to this cottage?” exclaimed Mrs.
       Fullerton. “How the time flies!”
The remark was made before the party settled to the evening's whist.
“You are looking very much better than you did a month after your illness, Mrs. Fullerton,”
       said Joseph Fleming, who was to take a hand, while Hadria played Grieg or Chopin, or Scottish
       melodies to please the old people. The whist-players enjoyed music during the game.
“Ah, I shall never be well,” said Mrs. Fullerton. “One can't recover from long worry, Mr.
       Fleming. Shall we cut for partners?”
It was a quaint, low-pitched little room, filled with familiar furniture from Dunaghee,
       which recalled the old place at every turn. The game went on in silence. The cards were
       dealt, taken up, shuffled, sorted, played, massed together, cut, dealt, sorted, and so on,
       round and round; four grave faces deeply engrossed in the process, while the little room was
       filled with music.
Mrs. Fullerton had begun to feel slightly uneasy about her daughter. “So much nursing has
       told upon her,” said everyone. The illness of the two boys had come at an unfortunate moment.
       She looked worn and white, and dreadfully thin. She seemed cheerful, and at times her mood
       was even merry, but she could not recover strength. At the end of the day, she would be
       completely exhausted. This had not been surprising at first, after the long strain of
       nursing,
        but Mrs. Fullerton thought it was time that she began to
       mend. She feared that Hadria spent too many hours over her composing; she sat up at night,
       perhaps. What good did all this composing do? Nobody ever heard of it. Such a sad pity that
       she could not see the folly of persevering in the fruitless effort.
Lady Engleton was sure that Hadria saw too few people, lived too monotonous a life.
       Craddock Place was filled with guests just now, and Lady Engleton used her utmost persuasion
       to induce Hubert and Hadria to come to dinner, or to join the party, in the evening, whenever
       they could.
Hadria shrank from the idea. It was adding another burden to her already failing strength.
       To talk coherently, to be lively and make oneself agreeable, to have to think about one's
       dress,—it all seemed inexpressibly wearisome. But Lady Engleton was so genuinely eager to
       administer her cure that Hadria yielded, half in gratitude, half in order to save the effort
       of further resistance.
She dragged herself upstairs to dress, wishing to heaven she had refused, after all. The
       thought of the lights, the sound of voices, the complexity of elements and of life that she
       had to encounter, made her shrink into herself. She had only one evening gown suitable for
       the occasion. It was of some white silken stuff, with dull rich surface. A bunch of yellow
       roses and green leaves formed the decoration. Hubert approved of her appearance. To her own
       surprise she felt some new feeling creep into her, under the influence of the exquisite
       attire. It put her a little more in tune. At least there were beautiful and dainty things in
       the world. The fresh green of the rose leaves, and the full yet delicate yellow of the
       fragrant roses on the creamy lace, evoked a feeling akin to the emotion stirred by certain
       kinds of music; or, in other words, the artistic sensibility had been appealed to through
       colour and texture, instead of through harmony.
The drawing-room at Craddock Place was glowing with subdued candle-light. Lady Engleton's
       rooms carried one back to a past epoch, among the dainty fancies and art of a
        sore leisurely and less vulgar century. Lady Engleton
       admitted nothing that had not the quality of distinction, let have what other quality it
       might. Hadria's mood, initiated at home, received impetus at Craddock Place. It was a
       luxurious mood. She desired to receive rather than to give: to be delicately ministered to;
       to claim the services of generations of artists, who had toiled with fervour to attain that
       grand ease and simplicity, through faithful labour and the benison of heaven.
Hadria had attracted many eyes as she entered the room. Unquestionably she was looking her
       best to-night, in spite of her extreme pallor. She was worthy to take her place among the
       beautiful objects of art that Lady Engleton had collected found her. She had the same
       quality. Hubert vaguely perceived this. He heard the idea expressed in so many words by a
       voice that he knew. He looked round, and saw Professor Theobald bending confidentially
       towards Joseph Fleming.
“Oh, Professor, I did not know you were to be here to-night!”
“What has your guardian spirit been about, not to forewarn you?” asked the Professor.
“I am thinking of giving my guardian spirit a month's learning,” returned Hubert; “he has
       been extremely neglectful of late. And how have you been getting on all this time,
       Professor?”
Theobald gave some fantastic answer, and crossed the room to Mrs. Temperley, who was by
       this time surrounded by a group of acquaintances, among them Madame Bertaux, who had just
       come from Paris, and had news of all Hadria's friends there.
“Mrs. Temperley, may I also ask for one passing glance of recognition?”
Hadria turned round with a little start, and a sudden unaccountable sense of disaster.
“Professor Theobald!”
She did not look pleased to see him, and as they shook hands, his mouth shut sharply, as it
       always did when his self-
        love was wounded. Then, a gleam of resolve or cunning came
       into his face, and the next instant he was at his suavest.
“Do you know, Mrs. Temperley, I scarcely recognized you when you first came in. ‘Who can
       this beautiful, distinguished-looking woman be?’ I said to myself.”
Hadria smiled maliciously.
“You think I am so much changed?”
Professor Theobald began to chuckle.
“The trowel, I see, is still your weapon,” she added, “but I am surprised that you have not
       learnt to wield the implement of sway with more dexterity, Professor.”
“I am not accustomed to deal with such quick-witted ladies, Mrs. Temperley.”
“You shew your hand most frankly,” she answered; “it almost disarms one.”
A few introductory chords sounded through the room. Hadria was sitting in front of the
       window, across which the pale green curtains had been drawn. Many eyes wandered towards
       her.
“I should like to paint you just like that,” murmured Lady Engleton; “you can't imagine
       what a perfect bit of harmony you make, with my brocade.” A cousin of Lord Engleton was at
       the piano. He played an old French gavotte.
“That is the finishing touch,” added Lady Engleton, below her breath. “I should like to
       paint you and the curtains and Claude Moreton's gavotte all together.”
The performance was received with enthusiasm. It deepened Hadria's mood, set her pulses
       dancing. She assented readily to the request of her hostess that she should play. She chose
       something fantastic and dainty. It had a certain remoteness from life.
“Like one of Watteau's pictures,” said Claude Moreton, who was hanging over the piano. He
       was tall and dark, with an expression that betrayed his enthusiastic temperament. A group had
       collected, among them Professor Theobald. Beside him stood Marion Fenwick, the bride whose
       wedding had taken place at Craddock Church about eighteen months before.

It seemed as if Hadria were exercising some influence of a magnetic quality. She was always
       the point of attraction, whether she created a spell with her music, or her speech, or her
       mere personality. In her present mood, this was peculiarly gratifying. The long divorce from
       initiative work which events had compelled, the loss of nervous vigour, the destruction of
       dream and hope, had all tended to throw her back on more accessible forms of art and
       expression, and suggested passive rather than active dealings with life. She was wearied with
       petty responsibilities, and what she called semi-detached duties. It was a relief to sit down
       in white silk and lace, and draw people to her simply by the cheap spell of good looks and
       personal magnetism. That she possessed these advantages, her life in Paris had made obvious.
       It was the first time that she had been in contact with a large number of widely differing
       types, and she had found that she could appeal to them all, if she would. Since her return to
       England, anxieties and influences extremely depressing had accustomed her to a somewhat
       gloomy atmosphere. To-night the atmosphere was light and soft, brilliant and enervating.
“This is my Capua,” she said laughingly, to her hostess.
It invited every luxurious instinct to come forth and sun itself. Marion Fenwick's soft,
       sweet voice, singing Italian songs to the accompaniment of the guitar, repeated the
       invitation.
It was like a fairy gift. Energy would be required to refuse it. And why, in heaven's name,
       if she might not have what she really wanted, was she to be denied even the poor little
       triumphs of ornamental womanhood? Was the social order which had frustrated her own ambitions
       to dominate her conscience, and persuade her voluntarily to resign that one
       kingdom which cannot be taken from a woman, so long as her beauty lasts?
Why should she abdicate? The human being was obviously susceptible to personality beyond
       all other things. And beauty moved that absurd creature preposterously. There,
       at least,
        the woman who chanced to be born with these superficial
       attractions, had a royal territory, so long as she could prevent her clamorous fellows from
       harassing and wearing those attractions away. By no direct attack could the jealous powers
       dethrone her. They could only do it indirectly, by appealing to the conscience which they had
       trained; to the principles that they had instilled; by convincing the woman that she owed
       herself, as a debt, to her legal owner, to be paid in coined fragments of her being, till she
       should end in inevitable bankruptcy, and the legal owner himself found her a poor
       investment!
It would have startled that roomful of people, who expressed everything circuitously,
       pleasantly, without rough edges, had they read beneath Mrs. Temperley's spoken words, these
       unspoken thoughts.
Marion Fenwick's songs and the alluring softness of her guitar, seemed the most fitting
       accompaniment to the warm summer night, whose breath stirred gently the curtains by the open
       window, at the far end of the room.
Lady Engleton was delighted with the success of her efforts. Mrs. Temperley had not looked
       so brilliant, so full of life, since her mother's illness. Only yesterday, when she met her
       returning from the Cottage, her eyes were like those of a dying woman, and now—!
“People say ill-natured things about Mrs. Temperley,” she confided to an intimate friend,
       “but that is because they don't understand her.”
People might have been forgiven for not understanding her, as perhaps her hostess felt,
       noticing Hadria's animation, and the extraordinary power that she was wielding over everyone
       in the room, young and old. That power seemed to burn in the deep eyes, whose expression
       changed from moment to moment. Hadria's cheeks, for once, had a faint tinge of colour. The
       mysterious character of her beauty became more marked. Professor Theobald followed her, with
       admiring and studious gaze. Whether she had felt remorseful for her somewhat unfriendly
       greeting at the beginning of the evening, or from
        some other cause, her manner to him had changed. It was
       softer, less mocking. He perceived it instantly, and pursued his advantage. The party still
       centred eagerly round the piano. Hadria was under the influence of music; therefore less
       careful and guarded than usual, more ready to sway on the waves of emotion. And beyond all
       these influences, tending in the same direction, was the underlying spirit of rebellion
       against the everlasting “Thou shalt not” that met a woman at every point, and turned her back
       from all paths save one. And following that one (so ran Hadria's insurrectionary thoughts),
       the obedient creature had to give up every weapon of her womanhood; every grace, every power;
       tramping along that crowded highway, whereon wayworn sisters toil forward, with bandaged
       eyes, and bleeding feet; and as their charm fades, in the pursuing of their dusty pilgrimage,
       the shouts, and taunts, and insults, and laughter of their taskmasters follow them, while
       still they stumble on to the darkening land that awaits them, at the journey's end: Old Age,
       the vestibule of Death.
Hadria's eyes gleamed strangely.
“They shall not have their way with me too easily. I can at least give my pastors and
       masters a little trouble. I can at least fight for it, losing battle though it be.”
The only person who seemed to resist Hadria's influence to-night, was Mrs. Jordan, the
       mother of Marion Fenwick.
“My dear madam,” said Professor Theobald, bending over the portly form of Mrs. Jordan, “a
       woman's first duty is to be charming.”
“Oh, that comes naturally, Professor,” said Hadria, “though it is rather for
        you than for me to say that. You are always missing
       opportunities.”
“Believe me, I will miss them no more,” he said emphatically.
“Tell us your idea of a woman's duty, Mrs. Jordan,” prompted Madame Bertaux maliciously.
       Mrs. Jordan delivered herself of various immemorial sentiments which met the usual applause.
       But Madame Bertaux said brusquely
        that she thought if that sort of thing were preached at
       women much longer, they would end by throwing over duty altogether, in sheer disgust at the
       whole one-sided business. Mrs. Jordan bristled, and launched herself upon a long and virtuous
       sentence. Her daughter Marion looked up sharply when Madame Bertaux spoke. Then a timid,
       cautious glance fell on her mother. Marion had lost her freshness and her exquisite ætherial
       quality; otherwise there was little change in her appearance. Hadria was struck by the way in
       which she had looked at Madame Bertaux, and it occurred to her that Marion Fenwick was
       probably not quite so acquiescent and satisfied as her friends supposed. But she would not
       speak out. Early training had been too strong for her.
Professor Theobald was unusually serious to-night. He did not respond to Hadria's
       flippancy. He looked at her with grave, sympathetic eyes. He seemed to intimate that he
       understood all that was passing in her mind, and was not balked by sprightly appearances.
       There was no sign of cynicism now, no bandying of compliments. His voice had a new ring of
       sincerity. It was a mood that Hadria had noticed in him once or twice before, and when it
       occurred, her sympathy was aroused; she felt that she had done him injustice.
        This was evidently the real man; his ordinary manner must be merely the cloak
       that the civilized being acquires the habit of wrapping round him, as a protection against
       the curiosity of his fellows. The Professor himself expressed it almost in those words: “It
       is because of the infinite variety of type and the complexity of modern life which the
       individual is called upon to encounter, that a sort of fancy dress has to be worn by all of
       us, as a necessary shield to our individuality and our privacy. We cannot go through the
       complex process of adjustment to each new type that we come across, so by common consent, we
       wear our domino, and respect the unwritten laws of the great bal
        masqué that we call society.”
The conversation took more and more intimate and serious turns. Mrs. Jordan was the only
       check upon it. Madame
        Bertaux followed up her first heresy by others even more
       bold.
“Whenever one wants very particularly to have one's way about a matter,” she said, “one
       sneaks off and gets somebody else persuaded that it is his duty to sacrifice himself for
        us—c'est tout simple—and the chances are that he meekly
       does it. If he doesn't, at least one has the satisfaction of making him feel a guilty wretch,
       and setting oneself up with a profitable grievance for life.”
“To the true woman,” said Mrs. Jordan, who had ruled her family with a rod of iron for
       thirty stern years, “there is no joy to equal that of self-sacrifice.”
“Except that of exacting it,” added Hadria.
“I advise everyone desirous of dominion to preach that duty, in and out of season,” said
       Madame Bertaux. “It is seldom that the victims even howl, so well have we trained them.”
“Truly I hope so!” cried Professor Theobald. “It must be most galling when their
       lamentations prevent one from committing one's justifiable homicide in peace and quietness.
       Imagine the discomfort of having a half-educated victim to deal with, who can't hold his
       tongue and let one perform the operation quietly and comfortably. It is enough to embitter
       any Christian!”
The party broke up, with many cordial expressions of pleasure, and several plans were made
       for immediately meeting again. Lady Engleton was delighted to see that Mrs. Temperley entered
       with animation, into some projects for picnics and excursions in the neighbourhood.
“Did I not tell you that all you wanted was a little lively society?” she said, with
       genuine warmth, as the two women stood in the hall, a little apart from the others.
Hadria's eyelids suddenly fell and reddened slightly.
“Oh, you are so kind!” she exclaimed, in a voice whose tones betrayed the presence of
       suppressed tears.
Lady Engleton, in astonishment, stretched out a sisterly hand, but Hadria had vanished
       through the open hall door into the darkness without.
