CHAPTER VI.
“I CANNOT make you realize that you are an ignorant girl who knows nothing of the
       world, and that it is necessary you should accept my experience, and condescend to be guided
       by my wishes. You put me in a most unpleasant position this afternoon, forcing me to receive
       a person whom I have never been introduced to, or heard of—”
“Valeria Du Prel has been heard of throughout the English-speaking world,” said Hadria
       rhetorically.
“So much the worse,” retorted Mrs. Fullerton. “No nicely brought up woman is ever heard of
       outside her own circle.”
Hadria recalled a similar sentiment among the ancient Greeks, and thought how hard an old
       idea dies.
“She might have been some awful person, some unprincipled adventuress, and that I believe
       is what she is. What was she prowling about the back of our house for, I should like to
       know?”
“I suspect she wanted to steal chickens or something,” Hadria was goaded into suggesting,
       and the interview ended painfully.
When Hadria went to Craw Gill, next morning, to enquire for Miss Du Prel, Mrs. McEwen said
       that the visitor had breakfasted in bed. The farmer's wife also informed Miss Fullerton that
       the lady had decided to stay on at Craw Gill, for some time. She had been looking out for a
       retreat of the kind.
“She seems a nice-like body,” said Mrs. McEwen, “and I see no objection to the
       arrangement.”
Hadria's heart beat faster. Could it be possible that Valeria Du Prel was to be a near
       neighbour? It seemed too good to be true!
When Miss Du Prel came down in her walking garments,
        she greeted Hadria with a certain absence of mind, which
       smote chill upon the girl's eagerness.
“I wanted to know if you were comfortable, if I could do anything for you.” Miss Du Prel
       woke up.
“Oh no, thank you; you are very kind. I am most comfortable—at least—it is very strange,
       but I have lost my keys and my umbrella and my hand-bag-I can't think what I can have done
       with them. Oh, and my purse is gone too”
Thereupon Mrs. McEwen in dismay, Mr. McEwen (who then appeared), the maid, and Hadria,
       hunted high and low for the missing properties, which were brought to light, one by one, in
       places where their owner had already thoroughly searched,” and about which she had long since
       abandoned hope.
She received them with mingled joy and amazement, and having responded to Mrs. McEwen's
       questions as to what she would like for dinner, she proposed to Hadria that they should take
       a walk together.
Hadria beamed. Miss Du Prel seemed both amused and gratified by her companion's worship,
       and the talk ran on, in a light and pleasant vein, differing from the talk of the ordinary
       mortal, Hadria considered, as champagne differs from ditch-water.
In recording it for Algitha's benefit that evening, Hadria found that she could not
       reproduce the exhilarating quality, or describe the influence of Miss Du Prel's personality.
       It was as if, literally, a private and particular atmosphere had encompassed her. She was
       “alive all round,” as her disciple asserted. Her love of Nature was intense. Hadria had never
       before realized that she had been without full sympathy in this direction. She awoke to a
       strange retrospective sense of solitude, feeling a new pity for the eager little child of
       years ago, who had wandered up to the garret, late at night, to watch the moonlight spread
       its white shroud over the hills.
With every moment spent in the society of Valeria Du Prel, new and clearer light seemed to
       Hadria, to be thrown upon all the problems of existence; not by any means only through
        what Miss Du Prel directly said, but by what she implied,
       by what she took for granted, by what she omitted to say.
“It seems like a home-coming from long exile,” Hadria wrote to her sister. “I have been
       looking through a sort of mist, or as one looks at one's surroundings before quite waking.
       Now everything stands out sharp and cut, as objects do in the clear air of the South. Ah me,
       the South! Miss Du Prel has spent much of her life there, and my inborn smouldering passion
       for it, is set flaming by her descriptions! You remember that brief little fortnight that we
       spent with mother and father in Italy? I seem now to be again under the spell of the
       languorous airs, the cloudless blue, the white palaces, the grey olive groves, and the art,
       the art! Oh, Algitha, I must go to the South soon, soon, or I shall die of home sickness!
       Miss Du Prel says that this is only one side of me breaking out: that I am northern at heart.
       I think it is true, but meanwhile the thought of the South possesses me. I confess I think
       mother had some cause to be alarmed when she saw Miss Du Prel, if she wants to keep us in a
       chastened mood, at home. It seems as if all of me were in high carnival. Life is raised to a
       higher power. I feel nearly omnipotent. Epics and operas are child's play to me! It is true I
       have produced comparatively few; but, oh, those that are to come! I feel fit for anything,
       from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter. I think of the two, I rather lean to the manslaughter.
       Oh, I don't mean it in the facetious sense! that would be a terrible downfall from my present
       altitudes. To such devices the usual wretched girl, who has never drawn rebellious breath, or
       listened to the discourses of Valeria Du Prel, has to turn for a living, or to keep ennui at bay. But I, no, the inimical sex may possess
       their souls in peace, as far as I am concerned. They might retort that they never
        had felt nervous, but a letter has the same advantage as the pulpit: the
       adversary can never get up and contradict.
“That ridiculous adversary, Harold Wilkins, is staying again at Drumgarren, and I hear from
       Mrs. Gordon that he thinks
        it very strange that I should see so much of so
       extraordinary a person as Miss Du Prel! Opinions differ of course; I think it very strange
       that the Gordons should see so much of so ordinary a person as Mr. Wilkins. Everybody makes
       much of him here, and, alas! all the girls run after him, and even fall in love with him;
       why, I can't conceive. For if driven by dire compulsion of fate, to bend one's thoughts upon
        some prosaic example of that prosaic sex, why not choose one of the many far
       more attractive candidates available—the Gordons, the McKenzies, and so forth? When I go to
       tennis parties with mother—they are still playing upon the asphalte courts—and see the little
       dramas that go on, the jealousies and excitements, and general much-ado-about-nothing, I can
       scarcely believe that Miss Du Prel really belongs to the same planet as ours. But I don't
       feel so contemptuous as I did; it is so pitiful. Out of my great wealth I can afford to be
       more generous.
“And when I see those wretched girls fluttering round Mr. Wilkins, I no longer turn up my
       ‘aughty nose’ (as old Mrs. Brooks used to say). I only think to myself, ‘Heavens and earth!
       what an aching, empty life those young women must lead, if they are actually reduced for
       interest and amusement to the utterances of Mr. Wilkins!’ They would have the pull of one
       though, if the utterances of Mr. Wilkins were the only utterances to be heard! Perish the
       thought of such beggary!”
The talks with Valeria Du Prel grew more intimate, and more deeply interesting to Hadria,
       every day.
Miss Du Prel used often to look at her companion in amazement. “Where did you
       come from?” she exclaimed on one occasion. “One would suppose you had lived several lives;
       you seem to know things in such a subtle, intimate fashion!”
She used to ponder over the problem, wondering what Professor Fortescue would say to it.
       There appeared to be more here than mere heredity could account for. But science had never
       solved this problem; originality seemed always to enter upon its career, uncaused and
       unaccountable. It was ever a miraculous phenomenon. The Professor had always said
        so. Still the heritage was rich enough, in this case.
       Heredity might have some discoverable part in the apparent marvel. Each member of the
       Fullerton family had unusual ability of some kind. Their knowledge of science, and their
       familiarity with the problems of philosophy, had often astonished Miss Du Prel. Hadria's
       accounts of the Preposterous Society made her laugh and exclaim at the same moment. She gave
       an envious sigh at the picture of the eager little group, with their warmth of affection for
       one another, and their vivid interests. Miss Du Prel, with all her sadness, was youthful in
       spirit. Hadria found her far younger than many girls of her own age. This set her thinking.
       She observed how rigid most people become in a few years, and how the personality grows
       wooden, in the daily repetition of the same actions and the same ideas. This stiffening
       process had been attributed to the malice of Time; but now Hadria began to believe that
       narrow and ungenerous thought lay at the root of the calamity. The entire life of the little
       world in which she had grown up, on all its sides, in all its ideals and sentiments, stood
       before her, as if some great painter had made a picture of it. She had never before been able
       to stand so completely apart from the surroundings of her childhood. And she was able to do
       so now, not because Miss Du Prel discoursed about it, but because Hadria's point of view had
       shifted sympathetically to the point of view of her companion, through the instinctive desire
       to see how these familiar things would look to alien eyes. That which had seemed merely
       prosaic and dreary, became characteristic; the very things which she had taken most for
       granted were exactly those which turned out to be the significant and idiomatic facts.
These had made permanent inroads into the mind and character. It was with these that Hadria
       would have to reckon all her days, under whatever conditions she might hereafter be placed.
       Daily surroundings were not merely pleasant or unpleasant facts, otherwise of no importance;
       they were the very material and substance of character; the push and impetus, or the let and
       hindrance; the guardians or the assassins of the soul.
