SCENE III
SOME five months passed away.
One January night the Independent minister of Clinton Magna was passing down the village
     street. Clinton lay robed in light snow, and “sparkling to the moon.” The frozen pond beside
     the green, though it was nearly eight o'clock, was still alive with children, sliding and
     shouting. All around the gabled roofs stood laden and spotless. The woods behind the village,
     and those running along the top of the snowy hill, were meshed in a silvery mist which died
     into the moonlit blue, while in the fields the sharpness of the shadows thrown by the scattered
     trees made a marvel of black and white.
The minister, in spite of a fighting creed, possessed a measure of gentler susceptibilities,
     and the beauty
      of this basin in the chalk hills, this winter triumphant,
     these lights of home and fellowship in the cottage windows disputing with the forlornness of
     the snow, crept into his soul. His mind travelled from the physical purity and hardness before
     him to the purity and hardness of the inner life—the purity that Christ blessed, the “hardness”
     that the Christian endures. And such thoughts brought him pleasure as he walked—the mystic's
     pleasure.
Suddenly he saw a woman cross the snowy green in front of him. She had come from the road
     leading to the hill, and her pace was hurried. Her shawl was muffled round her head, but he
     recognized her, and his mood fell. She was the wife of Isaac Costrell, and she was hurrying to
     the Spotted Deer, a public-house which lay just beyond the village, on the road to the mill.
     Already several times that week had he seen her going in or coming out. Talk had begun to reach
     him, and he said to himself to-night as he saw her,—that Isaac Costrell's wife was going to
     ruin.

The thought oppressed him, pricked his pastoral conscience. Isaac was his right-hand man:
     dull to all the rest of the world, but not dull to the minister. With Mr. Drew sometimes he
     would break into talk of religion, and the man's dark eyes would lose their film. His big
     troubled self spoke with that accent of truth which lifts common talk and halting texts to
     poetry. The minister, himself more of a pessimist than his sermons showed, felt a deep regard
     for him. Could nothing be done to save Isaac's wife and Isaac? Not so long ago Bessie Costrell
     had been a decent woman, though a flighty and excitable one. Now some cause, unknown to the
     minister, had upset a wavering balance, and was undoing a life.
As he passed the public-house a man came out, and through the open door Mr. Drew caught a
     momentary glimpse of the bar and the drinkers. Bessie's handsome, reckless head stood out an
     instant in the bright light.
Then Drew saw that the man who had emerged was Watson the policeman. They greeted each
      other cordially and walked on together. Watson also was a
     member of the minister's flock. Mr. Drew felt suddenly moved to unburden himself.
“That was Costrell's wife, Watson, wasn't it, poor thing?”
“Aye, it wor Mrs. Costrell,” said Watson in the tone of concern natural to the respectable
     husband and father.
The minister sighed. “It's terrible the way she's gone downhill the last three months. I
     never pass almost but I see her going in there or coming out.”
“No,” said Watson, slowly, “no, it's bad. What I'd like to know,” he added reflectively, “is
     where she gets the money from.”
“Oh, she had a legacy, hadn't she, in August? It seems to have been a curse. She has been a
     changed woman ever since.”
“Yes, she had a legacy,” said Watson, dubiously; “but I don't believe it was much. She talked
     big, of course, and made a lot o' fuss—she's that kind o' woman—just as she did about old
     John's money.”

“Old John's money?—Ah! did any one ever know what became of that?”
“Well, there's many people thinks as Isaac has got it hid in the house somewhere, and there's
     others thinks he's put it in Bedford bank. Edwards told me private he didn't know nothing about
     it at the post-office, an' Bessie told my wife as John had given Isaac the keepin' of it till
     he come back again; but he'd knock her about, she said, if she let on what he'd done with it.
     That's the story she's allus had, and boastin', of course, dreadful, about John's trustin'
     them, and Isaac doin' all his business for him.”
The minister reflected.—“And you say the legacy wasn't much?”
“Well, sir, I know some people over at Bedford where her aunt lived as left it her, and they
     were sure it wasn't a great deal; but you never know.”
“And Isaac never said?”
“Bless yer, no, sir! He was never a great one for talking, wasn't Isaac; but you'd think now
     as he'd
      never learnt how. He'll set there in the Club of a night and
     never open his mouth to nobody.”
“Perhaps he's fretting about his wife, Watson?”
“Well, I don't believe as he knows much about her goin's-on—not all, leastways. I've seen her
     wait till he was at his work or gone to the Club, and then run down the hill,—tearin'—with her
     hair flyin'—you'd think she'd gone silly. Oh, it's a bad business,” said Watson, strongly, “an'
     uncommon bad business—all them young children too.”
“I never saw her drunk, Watson.”
“No—yer wouldn't. Nor I neither. But she'll treat half the parish if she gets the chance. I
     know many young fellers as go to the Spotted Deer just because they know she'll treat 'em.
     She's a-doin' of it now—there's lots of 'em. And allus changin' such a queer lot of money
     too—odd half-crowns,—years and years old—King George the Third, sir. No—it's strange—very
     strange.”
The two walked on into the darkness, still talking.

Meanwhile, inside the Spotted Deer Bessie Costrell was treating her hangers-on. She had drunk
     one glass of gin and water—it had made a beauty of her in the judgment of the tap-room, such a
     kindling had it given to her brown eyes and such a redness to her cheek. Bessie, in truth, had
     reached her moment of physical prime. The marvel was that there were no lovers in
      addition to the drinking and the extravagance. But the worst of the village
     scandalmongers knew of none. Since this new phase of character in her had developed, she would
     drink and make merry with any young fellow in the place, but it went no farther. She was
      bonne camarade with all the world—no more. Perhaps at bottom
     some coolness of temperament protected her; nobody, at any rate, suspected that it had anything
     to do with Isaac, or that she cared a ha'porth for so lugubrious and hypocritical a
     husband.
She had showered drinks on all her friends, and had, moreover, chattered and screamed herself
      hoarse, when the church-clock outside slowly struck eight.
     She started, changed countenance, and got up to pay at once.
“Why, there's another o' them half-crowns o' yourn, Bessie,” said a consumptive-looking girl
     in a bedraggled hat and feathers, as Mrs. Costrell handed her coin to the landlord. “Wheriver
     do yer get 'em?”
“If yer don't ask no questions, I won't tell yer no lies,” said Bessie, with quick impudence.
     “Where did you get them hat and feathers?”
There was a coarse laugh from the company. The girl in the hat reddened furiously, and she
     and Bessie—both of them in a quarrelsome state—began to bandy words.
Meanwhile the landlord was showing the coin to his assistant at the bar.
“Rum, ain't it? I niver seed one o' them pieces in the village afore this winter, an' I've
     been 'ere twenty-two year come April.”
A decent-looking labourer, who did not often visit
      the Spotted Deer, was leaning over the bar and caught the
     words.
“Well, then, I 'ave,” he said promptly. “I mind well as when I were a lad, sixteen year ago,
     my fayther borrered a bit o' money off John Bolderfield, to buy a cow with—an' there was 'arf
     of it in them 'arf-crowns.”
Those standing near overheard. Bessie and the girl stopped quarrelling. The landlord,
     startled, cast a sly eye in Bessie's direction. She came up to the bar.
“What's that yer sayin'?” she demanded. The man repeated his remark.
“Well, I dessay there was,” said Bessie—“I dessay there was. I s'pose there's plenty of 'em.
     Where do I get 'em?—why, I get 'em at Bedford, of course, when I goes for my money.”
She looked round defiantly. No one said anything; but everybody instinctively suspected a
     lie. The sudden silence was striking.
“Well, give me my change, will yer?” she said
      impatiently to the landlord. “I can't stan' here all
     night.”
He gave it to her, and she went out showering reckless good-nights, to which there was little
     response. The door had no sooner closed upon her than every one in the tap-room pressed round
     the bar in a close gathering of heads and tongues.
Bessie ran across the green and began to climb the hill at a rapid pace. Her thin woollen
     shawl blown back by the wind left her arms and bosom exposed. But the effects of the spirit in
     her veins prevented any sense of cold, though it was a bitter night.
Once or twice, as she toiled up the hill, she gave a loud sudden sob.
“Oh my God!” she said to herself. “My God!”
When she was half-way up she met a neighbour.
“Have yer seen Isaac?” Bessie asked her, panting.
“'Ee's at the Club, arn't 'ee?” said the woman.
      “Well, they won't be up yet. Jim tolt me as Muster
     Perris”—Muster Perris was the vicar of Clinton Magna—“'ad got a strange gen'leman stayin' with
     'im, and was goin' to take him into the Club to-night to speak to 'em. 'Ee's a bishop, they
     ses—someun from furrin parts.”
Bessie threw her good-night and climbed on.
When she reached the cottage the lamp was flaming on the table and the fire was bright. Her
     lame boy had done all she had told him, and her miserable heart softened. She hurriedly put out
     some food for Isaac. Then she lit a candle and went up to look at the children. They were all
     asleep in the room to the right of the stairs—the two little boys in one bed, the two little
     girls in the other, each pair huddled together against the cold, like dormice in a nest. Then
     she looked, conscience-stricken, at the untidiness of the room. She had bought the children a
     wonderful number of new clothes lately, and the family being quite unused to such abundance,
     there was no place to
      keep them in. A new frock was flung down in a corner just as
     it had been taken off; the kitten was sleeping on Arthur's last new jacket; a smart hat with a
     bunch of poppies in it was lying about the floor; and under the iron beds could be seen a
     confusion of dusty boots, new and old. The children were naturally reckless like their mother,
     and they had been getting used to new things. What excited them now, more than the acquisitions
     themselves, was that their mother had strictly forbidden them ever to show any of their new
     clothes to their father. If they did, she would beat them well, she said. That they understood;
     and life was thereby enriched, not only by new clothes but by a number of new emotions and
     terrors.
If Bessie noted the state of the room, she made no attempt to mend it. She smoothed back the
     hair from the boys' foreheads with a violent, shaky hand, and kissed them all, especially
     Arthur. Then she went out and closed the door behind her.
Outside she stood a moment on the tiny landing
      —listening. Not a sound; but the cottage walls were thin. If
     any one came along the lane with heavy boots she must hear them. Very like he would be half an
     hour yet.
She ran down the stairs and shut the door at the bottom of them, opening into the kitchen. It
     had no key or she would have locked it; and in her agitation, her state of clouded brain, she
     forgot the outer door altogether. Hurrying up again, she sat down on the topmost step, putting
     her candle on the boards beside her. The cupboard at the stair-head where John had left his
     money was close to her left hand.
As she sank into the attitude of rest, her first instinct was to cry and bemoan herself. Deep
     in her woman's being great floods of tears were rising, and would fain have spent themselves.
     But she fought them down, rapidly passing instead into a state of cold terror—terror of Isaac's
     step—terror of discovery—of the man in the public-house.
There was a mousehole in the skirting of the stairs
      close to the cupboard. She slipped in a finger, felt along an
     empty space behind, and drew out a key.
It turned easily in the cupboard lock, and the two boxes stood revealed, standing apparently
     just as they stood when John left them. In hot haste Bessie dragged the treasure-box from under
     the other, starting at every sound in the process, at the thud the old wooden trunk made on the
     floor of the cupboard as its supporter was withdrawn, at the rustle of her own dress. All the
     boldness she had shown at the Spotted Deer had vanished. She was now the mere trembling and
     guilty woman.
The lock on Bolderfield's box had been forced long before; it opened to her hand. A heap of
     sovereigns and half-sovereigns lay on one side, divided by a wooden partition from the few
     silver coins, crowns and half-crowns, still lying on the other. She counted both the gold and
     silver, losing her reckoning again and again, because of the sudden anguish of listening that
     would overtake her.

Thirty-six pounds on the one side, not much more than thirty shillings on the other. When
     John left it there had been fifty-one pounds in gold, and rather more than twenty pounds in
     silver, most of it in half-crowns. Ah! she knew the figures well.
Did that man who had spoken to the landlord in the public-house suspect? How strange they had
     all looked! What a silly fool she had been to change so much of the silver, instead of sticking
     to the gold! Yet she had thought the gold would be noticed more.
When was old John coming back? He had written once from Frampton to say that he was “laid up
     bad with the rheumatics,” and was probably going into the Frampton Infirmary. That was in
     November. Since then nothing had been heard of him. John was no scholar. What if he died
     without coming back? There would be no trouble then, except—except with Isaac.
Her mind suddenly filled with wild visions,—of
      herself marched through the village by Watson, as she had
     once seen him march a poacher who had mauled one of Mr. Forrest's keepers—of the towering walls
     of Frampton jail—of a visible physical shame which would kill her—drive her mad. If, indeed,
     Isaac did not kill her before any one but he knew! He had been that cross and glum all these
     last weeks—never a bit of talk hardly—always snapping at her and the children. Yet he had never
     said a word to her about the drink—nor about the things she had bought. As to the “things” and
     the bills, she believed that he knew nothing—had noticed nothing. At home he was always
     smoking, sitting silent, with dim eyes, like a man in a dream—or reading his father's old
     books, “good books,” which filled Bessie with a sense of dreariness unspeakable—or pondering
     his weekly paper.
But she believed he had begun to notice the drink. Drinking was universal in Clinton, though
     there was not much drunkenness. Teetotalers were unknown, and Isaac himself drank his beer
     freely, and a glass
      of spirits, like anybody else on occasion. She had been used
     for years to fetch his beer from the public, and she had been careful. But there were
     signs—
Oh! if she could only think of some way of putting it back—this thirty odd pounds. She held
     her head between her hands, thinking and thinking. Couldn't that little lawyer man to whom she
     went every month at Bedford, to fetch her legacy money—couldn't he lend it her, and keep her
     money till it was paid? She could make up a story, and give him something for himself to induce
     him to hold his tongue. She had thought of this often before, but never so urgently as now. She
     would take the carrier's cart to Bedford next day, while Isaac was at work, and try.
Yet all the time despair was at her heart. So hard to undo! Yet how easy it had been to take
     and to spend. She thought of that day in September, when she had got the news of her legacy—six
     shillings a week from an old aunt—her fathers aunt, whose very existence she had forgotten. The
      wild delight of it! Isaac got sixteen shillings a week in
     wages—here was nearly half as much again. She was warned that it would come to an end in two
     years. But none the less it seemed to her a fortune—and all her life, before it came, mere hard
     pinching and endurance. She had always been one to spend where she could. Old John had often
     rated her for it. So had Isaac. But that was his money. This was hers, and he who, for
     religious reasons, had never made friends with or thought well of any of her family,
     instinctively disliked the money which had come from them, and made few inquiries into the
     spending of it.
Oh! the joy of those first visits to Frampton, when all the shops had seemed to be there for
     her, and she their natural mistress! How ready people had been to trust her in the village! How
     tempting it had been to brag and make a mystery! That old skinflint, Mrs. Moulsey, at “the
     shop,” she had been all sugar and sweets then.
And a few weeks later—six, seven weeks later—
      about the beginning of October, these halcyon days had all
     come to an end. She owed what she could not pay—people had ceased to smile upon her—she was
     harassed, excited, worried out of her life.
Old familiar wonder of such a temperament! How can it be so easy to spend, so delightful to
     promise, and so unreasonably, so unjustly difficult, to pay?
She began to be mortally afraid of Isaac—of the effect of disclosures. One night she was
     alone in the cottage, almost beside herself under the pressure of one or two claims she could
     not meet—one claim especially, that of a little jeweller, from whom she had bought a gold ring
     and a brooch at Frampton—when the thought of John's hoard swept upon her—clutched her like
     something living and tyrannical, not to be shaken off.
It struck her all in an instant that there was another cupboard in the little parlour,
     exactly like that on the stairs. The lower cupboard had a key—what if it fitted?
The Devil must have been eager and active that
      night, for the key turned in the lock with a smoothness that
     made honesty impossible—almost foolish. And the old, weak lock on the box itself—why, a chisel
     had soon made an end of that! Only five minutes—it had been so quick—there had been no trouble.
     God had made no sign at all.
Since! All the village smiles—the village flatteries recovered—an orgie of power and
     pleasure—new passions and excitements—above all, the rising passion of drink, sweeping in
     storms through a weak nature that alternately opened to them and shuddered at them. And through
     everything the steadily dribbling away of the hoard—the astonishing ease and rapidity with
     which the coins—gold or silver—had flowed through her hands! How could one spend so much in
     meat and dress, in beer and gin, in giving other people beer and gin? How was it possible? She
     sat lost in miserable thoughts, a mist around her....
“Wal, I niver!” said a low, astonished voice at the foot of the stairs.

Bessie rose to her feet with a shriek, the heart stopping in her breast. The door below was
     ajar, and through the opening peered a face—the vicious, drunken face of her husband's eldest
     son, Timothy Costrell.
The man below cast one more look of amazement at the woman standing on the top stair, at the
     candle behind her, at the open box. Then an idea struck him: he sprang up the stairs at a
     bound.
“By gosh!” he said, looking down at the gold and silver. “By gosh!”
Bessie tried to thrust him back. “What are you here for?” she asked fiercely, her trembling
     lips the colour of the whitewashed wall behind. “You get off at onst, or I'll call yer
     father.”
He pushed her contemptuously aside. The swish of her dress caught the candle, and by good
     fortune put it out, or she would have been in a blaze. Now there was only the light from the
     paraffin lamp in the kitchen below striking upwards through the open door.

She fell against the doorway of her bedroom, panting and breathless, watching him.
He seated himself in her place, and stooped to look at the box. On the inside of the lid was
     pasted a discoloured piece of paper, and on the paper was written, in a round, laborious hand,
     the name, “John Bolderfield.”
“My blazes!” he said slowly, his bloodshot eyes opening wider than ever. “It's old John's
     money! So yo've been after it, eh?”
He turned to her with a grin, one hand on the box. He had been tramping for more than three
     months, during which time they had heard nothing of him. His filthy clothes scarcely hung
     together. His cheeks were hollow and wolfish. From the whole man there rose a sort of
     exhalation of vice. Bessie had seen him drunken and out at elbows before, but never so much of
     the beast as this.
However, by this time she had somewhat recovered herself, and, approaching him, she stooped
     and tried to shut the box.

“You take yourself off,” she said, desperately, pushing him with her fist. “That money's no
     business o' yourn. It's John's, an' he's comin' back directly. He gave it us to look after, an'
     I wor countin' it. March!—there's your father comin'!”
And with all her force she endeavoured to wrench his hand away. He tore it from her, and hit
     out at her backwards—a blow that sent her reeling against the wall.
“Yo take yer meddlin' fist out o' that!” he said. “Father ain't coming, and if he wor, I
     'spect I could manage the two on yer—Keowntin it—” he mimicked her. “Oh! yer a
     precious innercent, ain't yer? But I know all about yer. Bless yer, I've been in at the Spotted
     Deer to-night, and there worn't nothin' else talked of but yo and yor goin's on. There won't be
     a tongue in the place to-morrow that won't be a-waggin' about yer—yur a public charickter, yo
     are—they'll be sendin' the reporters down on yer for a hinterview. ‘Where the devil do she get
     the money?’ they says.”

He threw his curly head back and laughed till his sides shook.
“Lor, I didn't think I wor going to know quite so soon! An' sich queer 'arf-crowns, they ses,
     as she keeps a-changin'. Jarge somethin'—an old cove in a wig. An' 'ere they is, I'll be
     blowed,—some on 'em. Well, yer a nice 'un, yer are!”
He stared her up and down with a kind of admiration.
Bessie began to cry feebly—the crying of a lost soul.
“Tim, if yer'll go away an' hold yer tongue, I'll give yer five o' them suverins, and not
     tell yer father nothin'.”
“Five on 'em?” he said, grinning. “Five on 'em, eh?”
And dipping his hands into the box, he began deliberately shovelling the whole hoard into his
     trousers and waistcoat pockets.
Bessie flung herself upon him. He gave her one business-like blow which knocked her down
     against the bedroom door. The door yielded to her fall, and
      she lay there half stunned, the blood dripping from her
     temple.
“Noa, I'll not take 'em all,” he said, not even troubling to look where she had fallen. “That
     'ud be playing it rayther too low down on old John. I'll leave 'im two—jest two—for luck.”
He buttoned up his coat tightly, then turned to throw a last glance at Bessie. He had always
     disliked his father's second wife, and his sense of triumph was boundless.
“Oh! yer not hurt,” he said; “yer shammin. I advise yer to look sharp with shuttin' up.
     Father'll be up the hill in two or three minutes now. Sorry I can't 'elp yer, now yer've set me
     up so comfortabul. Bye-bye! ”
He ran down the stairs. She, as her senses revived, heard him open the back-door, cross the
     little garden, and jump the hedge at the end of it.
Then she lay absolutely motionless, till suddenly there struck on her ear the distant sound
     of heavy steps. They roused her like a goad. She dragged
      herself to her feet, shut the box, had just time to throw it
     into the cupboard and lock the door, when she heard her husband walk into the kitchen. She
     crept into her own room, threw herself on the bed, and wrapped her head and eyes in an old
     shawl, shivering so that the mattresses shook.
“Bessie, where are yer?”
She did not answer. He made a sound of astonishment, and, finding, no candle, took the lamp
     and mounted the stairs. They were covered with traces of muddy snow, and at the top he stooped
     to examine a spot upon the boards. It was blood; and his heart thumped in his breast.
“Bessie, whatever is the matter?”
For by this time he had perceived her on the bed. He put down the lamp and came to the
     bedside to look at her.
“I've 'ad a fall,” she said, faintly. “I tripped up over my skirt as I wor comin' up to look
     at Arthur. My head's all bleedin'. Get me some water from over there.”

His countenance fell sadly. But he got the water, exclaiming when he saw the wound.
He bathed it clumsily, then tied a bit of rag round it, and made her head easy with the
     pillow. She did not speak, and he sat on beside her, looking at her pale face, and torn, as the
     silent minutes passed, between conflicting impulses. He had just passed an hour listening to a
     good man's plain narrative of a life spent for Christ, amid fever-swamps, and human beings more
     deadly still. The vicar's friend was a missionary bishop, and a High Churchman; Isaac, as a
     staunch Dissenter by conviction and inheritance, thought ill both of bishops and Ritualists.
     Nevertheless he had been touched; he had been fired. Deep, though often perplexed instincts in
     his own heart had responded to the spiritual passion of the speaker. The religious atmosphere
     had stolen ahout him, melting and subduing.
And the first effect of it had been to quicken suddenly his domestic conscience; to make him
     think painfully of Bessie and the children as he
      climbed the hill. Was his wife going the way of his son? And
     he, sitting day after day like a dumb dog, instead of striving with her!
He made up his mind hurriedly. “Bessie,” he said, stooping to her and speaking in a strange
     voice, “Bessie, had yer been to Dawson's?”
Dawson was the landlord of the Spotted Deer.
Bessie was long in answering. At last she said, almost inaudibly—
“Yes.”
She fully understood what he had meant by the question, and she wondered whether he would
     fall into one of his rages, and beat her.
Instead, his hand sought clumsily for hers.
“Bessie, yer shouldn't; yer mustn't do it no more; it'll make a bad woman of yer. I know as
     I'm not good to live with; I don't make things pleasant to yer; but I've been thinkin'; I'll
     try if yo'll try.”
Bessie burst into tears. It seemed as though her life were breaking within her. Never since their
      early married days had he spoken to her like this. And she
     was in such piteous need of comfort; of some strong hand to help her out of the black pit in
     which she lay. The wild impulse crossed her to sit up and tell him—to throw it all on Timothy,
     to show him the cupboard and the box. Should she tell him; brave it all now that he was like
     this? Between them they might find a way—make it good.
Then the thought of the man in the public-house, of the half-crowns, a host of confused and
     guilty memories, swept upon her. How could she ever get herself out of it? Her heart beat so
     that it seemed a live creature strangling and silencing her. She was still fighting with her
     tears and her terror when she heard Isaac say—
“I know yer'll try, and I'll help yer. I'll be a better husband to yer, I swear I will. Give
     us a kiss, old woman.”
She turned her face, sobbing, and he kissed her cheek.

Then she heard him say in another tone—
“An' I got a bit o' news down at the Club as will liven yer up. Parkinson was there; just
     come over from Frampton to see his mother; an' he says John will be here to-morrer or next day.
     'Ee seed him yesterday—pulled down dreadful—quite the old man, 'ee says. An' John told him as
     he was comin' 'ome directly to live comfortable.”
Bessie drew her shawl over her head.
“To-morrer, did yer say?” she asked in a whisper.
“Mos' like. Now you go to sleep; I'll put out the lamp.”
But all night long Bessie lay wide awake in torment, her soul hardening within her, little by
     little.
