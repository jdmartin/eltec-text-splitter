XV THE TIME TRAVELLER'S RETURN
" So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the machine. The
     blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue.
     I breathed with greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The
     hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim shadows of houses, the
     evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently,
     when the million dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognize our own petty and
     familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the night and day
     flapped slower and slower. Then the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently,
     now, I slowed the mechanism down.
"I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you that when I set out,
     before my
      velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett had walked across the room, travelling,
     as it seemed to me, like a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when she
     traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her
     previous ones. The door at the lower end opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back
     foremost, and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered. Just before that
     I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed like a flash.
"Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory, my tools, my
     appliances just as I had left them. I got off the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my
     bench. For several minutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was my old
     workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept there, and the whole thing have been
     a dream.
"And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner of the laboratory. It
     had come to rest again in the north-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you the
     exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the Morlocks
     had carried my machine.

"For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through the passage here,
     limping, because my heel was still painful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the Pall
      Mall Gazette on the table by the door. I found the date was indeed to-day, and looking at
     the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o'clock. I heard your voices and the clatter of
     plates. I hesitatedâ€”I felt so sick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the
     door on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story."
