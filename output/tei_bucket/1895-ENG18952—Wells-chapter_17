Epilogue
One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he swept back into
     the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into
     the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian brutes
     of the Jurassic times. He may even now—if I may use the phrase—be wandering on some
     plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or beside the lonely
      saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in
     which men are still men, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome
     problems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own part, cannot think that these
     latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man's
     culminating time! I say, for my own part. He, I know—for the question had been discussed among
     us long before the Time Machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind,
     and saw in the growing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall
     back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as though
     it were not so. But to me the future is still black and blank—is a vast ignorance, lit at a few
     casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white
     flowers—shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle—to witness that even when mind and
     strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man.
