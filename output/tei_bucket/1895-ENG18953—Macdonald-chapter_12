FRIENDS AND FOES
COMING, in one of the channels, upon what seemed a little shrub, the outlying picket, I
     trusted, of an army behind it, I knelt to look at it closer. It bore a small fruit, which, as I
     did not recognise it, I feared to gather and eat. Little I thought that I was watched from
     behind the rocks by hundreds of eyes eager with the question whether I would or would not take
     it.
I came to another plant somewhat bigger, then to another larger still, and at length to
     clumps of a like sort; by which time I saw that they were not shrubs but dwarf-trees. Before I
     reached the bank of this second branch of the river-bed, I found the channels so full of them
     that it was with difficulty I crossed such as I could not jump. In one I heard a great rush, as
     of a multitude of birds from an ivied wall, but saw nothing.
I came next to some large fruit-bearing trees, but what they bore looked coarse. They stood
     on the edge of a hollow, which evidently had once been the basin of a lake. From the left a
     forest seemed to flow into and fill it; but while the trees above were of many sorts, those in
     the hollow were almost entirely fruit-bearing.
I went a few yards down the slope of grass mingled with moss, and stretched myself upon it
     weary. A little farther down stood a tiny tree full of rosiest apples no bigger than small
     cherries, its top close to my hand; I pulled and ate one of them. Finding it delicious, I was
     in the act of taking another, when a sudden shouting of children, mingled with laughter clear
     and sweet as tile music of a brook, startled me with delight.
"He likes our apples! He likes our apples! He's a good giant! He's a good giant!" cried many
     little voices.
"He's a giant!" objected one.
"He is rather big," assented another, "but littleness isn't everything! It won't
     keep you from growing big and stupid except you take care!"
I rose on my elbow and stared. Above and about and below me stood a multitude of children,
     apparently of all ages, some just able to run alone, and some about twelve or thirteen. Three
     or four seemed older. They stood in a small knot, a little apart, and were less excited than
     the rest. The many were chattering in groups, declaiming and contradicting, like a crowd of
     grown people in a city, only with greater merriment, better manners, and more sense.
I gathered that, by the approach of my hand to a second apple, they knew that I liked the
     first; but how from that they argued me good, I did not see, nor wondered that one of them at
     least should suggest caution. I did not open my mouth, for I was afraid of frightening them,
     and sure I should learn more by listening than by asking questions. For I understood nearly all
     they said— at which I was not surprised: to understand is not more wonderful than to love.
There came a movement and slight dispersion among them, and presently a sweet,
     innocent-looking, lovingly roguish little fellow handed me a huge green apple. Silence fell on
     the noisy throng; all waited expectant.
"Eat, good giant," he said.
I sat up, took the apple, smiled thanks, and would have eaten; but the moment I bit into it,
     I flung it far away.
Again rose a shout of delight; they flung themselves upon me, so as nearly to smother me;
     they kissed my face and hands; they laid hold of my legs; they clambered about my arms and
     shoulders, embracing my head and neck. I came to the ground at last, overwhelmed with the
     lovely little goblins.
"Good, good giant!" they cried. "We knew you would come! Oh you dear, good, strong
     giant!"
The babble of their talk sprang up afresh, and ever the jubilant shout would rise anew from
     hundreds of clear little throats.
Again came a sudden silence. Those around me drew back; those atop of me got off and began
     trying to set me on my feet. Upon their sweet faces, concern had taken the place of
     merriment.
"Get up, good giant!" said a little girl. "Make haste! much haste! He saw you throw his apple
     away!"
Before she ended, I was on my feet. She stood pointing up the slope. On the brow of it was a
     clownish, bad-looking fellow, a few inches taller than myself. He looked hostile, but I saw no
     reason to fear him, for he had no weapon, and my little friends had vanished every one.
He began to descend, and I, in the hope of better footing and position, to go up. He growled
     like a beast as he turned toward me.
Reaching a more level spot, I stood and waited for him. As he came near, he held out his
     hand. I would have taken it in friendly fashion, but he drew it back, threatened a blow, and
     held it out again. Then I understood him to claim the apple I had flung away, whereupon I made
     a grimace of dislike and a gesture of rejection.
He answered with a howl of rage that seemed to say, "Do you dare tell me my apple was not fit
     to eat?"
"One bad apple may grow on the best tree," I said.
Whether he perceived my meaning I cannot tell, but he made a stride nearer, and I stood on my
     guard. He delayed his assault, however, until a second giant, much like him, who had been
     stealing up behind me, was close enough, when he rushed upon me. I met him with a good blow in
     the face, but the other struck me on the back of the head, and between them I was soon
     overpowered.
They dragged me into the wood above the valley, where their tribe lived—in wretched huts,
     built of fallen branches and a few stones. Into one of these they pushed me, there threw me on
     the ground, and kicked me. A woman was present, who looked on with indifference.
I may here mention that during my captivity I hardly learned to distinguish the women from
     the men, they differed so little. Often I wondered whether I had not come upon a sort of
     fungoid people, with just enough mind to give them motion and the expressions of anger and
     greed. Their food, which consisted of tubers, bulbs, and fruits, was to me inexpressibly
     disagreeable, but nothing offended them so much as to show dislike to it. I was cuffed by the
     women and kicked by the men because I would not swallow it.
I lay on the floor that night hardly able to move, but I slept a good deal, and woke a little
     refreshed. In the morning they dragged me to the valley, and tying my feet, with a long rope,
     to a tree, put a flat stone with a saw-like edge in my left hand. I shifted it to the right;
     they kicked me, and put it again in the left; gave me to understand that I was to scrape the
     bark off every branch that had no fruit on it; kicked me once more, and left me.
I set about the dreary work in the hope that by satisfying them I should be left very much to
     myself—to make my observations and choose my time for escape. Happily one of the dwarf-trees
     grew close by me, and every other minute I plucked and ate a small fruit, which wonderfully
     refreshed and strengthened me.
