CHAPTER III.
With the peculiar good fortune which has attended the oracle of all ages, Digby's prediction
     came true, and Jack did come home that evening when every one had stopped talking about him,
     and there was a universal tendency among his brothers and sisters to avoid the topic of his
     arrival. It was tea-time, and the Squire was standing in the middle of the drawing-room and
     allowing himself to be coaxed on to his favorite subjects by certain methods known only to his
     children; though Lady Joan, with her accustomed shrewdness, and partly from a desire to fall
     into the spirit of her surroundings, however dull they might be, also lent her aid in drawing
     him out, and Sir Marcus became a willing and unconscious victim.
"Interested in duck-breeding, did you say?" he exclaimed eagerly; "then you shall see
     something you can't see in Pont Street or any of your swell West End places," forgetting for
     the moment his envy of Lady Joan's charming house in town. "You shall come over one of our
     famous duckeries, and see what you've been eating with green peas all the season, and learn how
     we breed ducks in Murville. It isn't every one who gets the opportunity of coming to the very
     centre of the most important village industry in the home counties, and it is quite time you
     saw how the laboring man is kept from starvation by a little help and a little encouragement.
     Why, let me tell you, though I am a modest man, God knows, and it is not I who should say it,
     that if it had not been for my letters to the papers, the duck interest would have completely
     died out in Murville long ago. And where would the working-man have been then? Do you know, my
     dear young lady, that I, that is, Murville, or rather, I should say, my letter to the county
     paper has been quoted in the 'Daily Liberal'? There's fame for you! You didn't know you had
     come to such a world-renowned place, eh? Ah, we are not so hidden in Murville, after all; that
     is, the—the cause of the elevation of the laborer has its opportunities even in a small village
     like this."
"Even a duck has its portion in the scheme of Providence," murmured Lady Joan into her
     tea-cup; "I wish I could find out all these wonderful things for myself, they are so improving.
     For instance, I shall never mind paying a guinea a couple in February, now that I know I shall
     be doing a great national good by buying them."
"You have got hold of quite the wrong idea," interrupted Digby, "a most anti-socialistic
     idea, of which I could not believe even you to be capable. As if the luxury of the
     rich could be of the least avail—"
A jaded expression crept over the visage of Helen at this point, and his younger brothers
     irreverently urging him to "play lightly, as they had heard that old wheeze before," the
     derided prophet merely regretted the absence of bears, and smiled sadly. His father gladly
     filled up the breach.
"Eh, what? Socialism, did you say? Of course it is Socialism in its noblest form, when—when
     we get a notice in the 'Daily Liberal,' and without paying for it too! It was none of your
     cooked-up jobs, carried through with bribery and corruption, let me tell you, it was all fair
     and above board; Editor's a personal friend of mine, don't you see, and he wouldn't
     have quoted from my letter if he hadn't thoroughly appreciated it. You can't get over facts
     with any amount of Socialism; give me facts, that's what I always say," concluded Sir Marcus,
     happily innocent that all his life his one aim had been to avoid facts and the unpleasant
     truths they had forced upon him.
"I can hear wheels," said Lady Raleigh, suddenly. As she had made the same remark at
     intervals during the day, no one paid her any particular attention except Helen, who put out a
     protecting hand to the tea-table, as if she anticipated a rush. This time, however, there was
     undoubtedly a carriage coming up the drive; and Lady Raleigh rose to her feet unsteadily, and
     became melodramatic.
"I can feel it is my boy," she said, winding her shawl tightly round her; "come to him,
     Marcus, come to our long-lost child."
"Don't make a fool of yourself," growled Sir Marcus, bluntly; he had suddenly resigned his
     position in the middle of the room, and was sitting uncomfortably on the edge of the sofa
     instead; "he's only been away two years, and there's no more chance of his being lost than
     there is of your going on a five-mile walk."
He felt he had fired a double shot by his remark; but there came a yell from the children on
     the doorstep, and his wife swept out of the room with theatrical movements, and Sir Marcus felt
     more uncomfortable than before.
"Leave him to me, children; let me have my boy's first kiss," cried Lady Raleigh, in the
     hall.
"Just look," said the practical Helen, from the window: "he has hired Bunce's best trap, and
     we haven't paid his bill for two quarters."
Lady Joan sat, and turned over the leaves of a magazine with her eyes discreetly lowered, and
     wished that the means of escape were not so completely cut off, and that she could get into the
     garden. Family jars were intensely amusing to her critical nature; but after a whole day of
     them she felt that she could reasonably dispense with any more just now, and, from the Squire's
     attitude, another storm was evidently brewing.
"Hadn't you better come out, sir?" suggested Digby.
"No, sir, I will not come out," answered Sir Marcus, with a show of determination. "Have I
     not already told you that I have done with the rascal forever? I meant what I said, sir, and I
     will not see him nor speak to him; he—he can go to some one else to pay his debts!"
And, unconscious that he had put more feeling into the end of his speech than into anything
     else he had said, the Squire looked at his son and his daughter as if vaguely imploring them to
     support him in the step he had taken. In his most impetuous actions Sir Marcus always looked
     for a supporter. Yet, much as Digby admitted the justice of his father's anger, and much as
     Helen might censure the prodigal herself, there was too much of the esprit de corps in
     them that ran through the blood of all the Raleighs and made them a formidable enemy to the
     outsider, to allow them to acquiesce in the Squire's resentment; and he shifted his ground a
     little and tried another stratagem.
"Don't you see the trouble and the misery that is coming upon me through the extravagance of
     this young scamp? How is it you are so short-sighted, so dense about it? I tell you he is
      ruining me, this Jack you are all so fond of; and in ruining me he is taking the
     bread out of your own mouths, and out of the mouths of your brothers and sisters. Hey? Do you
     see now?"
And finding that mercenary argument did not produce the effect he wanted, Sir Marcus fled
     from the sound of voices coming dangerously near, and beat a sheepish retreat into his library
     on the opposite side of the hall.
"It is curious," said Digby, in his oratorical way, "how the father can forgive anything but
     want of solid success. He doesn't care a hang that Jack has been the most popular fellow in the
     colony, but if he had made his pile and had something to show for his popularity, then he would
     proclaim it on the housetops. What a curious age it is, and how we love to judge by results! By
     the way, Jack will have a warm time if the father keeps it up, won't he?"
Even the prophet has to drop into the colloquial sometimes.
"Good thing too, it's what he wants," said the inconsistent Helen; and they both glanced at
     the expressionless face of Lady Joan as she scanned the article on "Chinese architecture," and
     they left her to go and join the throng in the porch.
In the library on the other side of the hall stood Sir Marcus, his back to the door and his
     feet set very square on the hearthrug, trying to drown the noise of welcome in the porch by
     rustling the newspaper in his hands loudly, while he kept his eyes obstinately fixed on the
     Premier's speech on fruit-growing for the million.
"Capital speech, capital speech," he said out loud, beginning it vaguely for the third time;
     "what I have always said myself in fact, but I never could get anybody to listen to me. Why—why
     the devil are they making such a row in the garden?"—as the window became darkened by the
     passing of many figures—"coming into the hall, are they? Let them come into the hall by all
     means, I can't stop them, it's no longer my own house, I suppose; but they sha'n't
     come in here anyhow; I hope I have a remnant of authority left—and—eh, what? is that the beggar
     laughing? bless him!—that is, confound his impudence! what right has he to laugh when I don't
     mean to forgive him? I—I've been a weak fool all my life, but I'm not going to give in this
     time; it—it's a duty I owe to the younger ones to make an example of him, whatever it costs me
     to do it; not that it costs me anything, of course, not anything at all, of course; he—he has
     forfeited my love, the—the rascal, and I won't give in this time. Why—why the devil
     don't they stop his laughing when I mean to cast him off? Pack of women and children, with no
     sense of the responsibilities of life!—" the columns began to vanish into mist, and the hall
     seemed filled with one shout of laughter; the Squire gasped and recovered himself—"It's my duty
     as a father to withhold my forgiveness; what else is a poor man to do when he has such an
     enormous family? A mountain of debts at his back, I'll be bound, and he thinks he is going to
     get round me to pay them all—as if I wouldn't help him if I could, bless his—hang his
     improvidence! but when there are eleven of them—such absurdity on the part of Lettice, always
     told her it was an unnecessary thing to have such a tribe of them; but there! no one ever has
     listened to me, and now they must bear the consequences among them. Wh—what? who's that at the
     door? There's no one in here, I tell you, the—the room's empty, and I don't mean to see you—I'm
     not going to be made a fool of when I've kept it up all day—why doesn't he go away, eh?"
The Squire's voice had sunk into a whisper, and the "Daily Liberal" shook like a leaf in the
     breeze.
"And the dear old guv, where is he? Why doesn't he come out as he always does? Hasn't any one
     told him I am here?"
"I tell you this is my room; it isn't much that belongs to me, except five sons doing
     nothing, and six unmarried daughters, but—but this room is my property, and I won't have any
     one in, I tell you—what a fool I was not to lock the door—eh, what? who's that, eh? Damn the
     looking-glass!"
There was a mirror over the fireplace, and the fireplace was opposite the door. It was too
     much for Sir Marcus; if the boy had shown the least sign of shame, of nervousness at meeting
     him, it would have been easier to keep up a semblance of anger; but, as usual, Jack's bluntness
     of vision saved him where finer instincts would have been his ruin.
"Hullo, father, here I am! All right, father? I say, isn't it awfully jolly to be together
     again, eh, father?"
The premier's speech on fruit-growing for the million fluttered down into the coal scuttle;
     and the Squire wiped his spectacles violently, and gave in to the fascination of the single man
     who never worked. And when Digby strolled in ten minutes later, he found the prodigal filling
     his father's pipe with Canadian tobacco, and telling him American anecdotes, while the little
     room resounded with their laughter.
"Come in, Digby, and listen to this fellow," said Sir Marcus, jovially; "did you ever know
     such a fellow as Jack? It's a pity you don't try America, Digby, it would do you a
     world of good, man!"
Digby accepted the situation and his eviction with a laugh, not only because, as he had said
     to Lady Joan, he knew he would be received back into favor again on the morrow when the
     fascination of the prodigal would have exhausted itself for the time, but also from a lurking
     hope that he would at last have some chance of talking to their fair guest, whom the Squire had
     as yet entirely monopolized, in the way he usually monopolized any stranger who would lend a
     willing and fresh ear to his hobbies. But the musician did not get his chance that evening,
     though he tried very hard for it. Jack's return proved but a doubtful assistance to him: to
     begin with, it caused an alteration in the dinner-table, by which he found himself out of the
     range of her conversation; it also made the conversation in the drawing-room afterwards more
     hopelessly general than ever, for they all sat round in a circle and listened to the American
     anecdotes, and when the American anecdotes flagged for a moment Digby had to go to the piano
     and play the returned wanderer's favorite airs, while the hero himself took the opportunity of
     opening a desperate flirtation with Lady Joan under cover of the crashing chords of his eldest
     brother.
The musician was full thirty years old, and had been in love almost as many times as he had
     photos in his West End studio; like his father, it was only the trifling circumstances of life,
     or its visions, that seemed to him to be worthy of serious consideration, and like his father
     he had retained his boyish temperament past the age when such a temperament is sufficient for
     the demands of circumstance. From the first his connection with Lady Joan had been unusual. She
     had not begun by fascinating him, and he had not begun by giving her singing-lessons. She was
     one of the few people of his acquaintance who knew of that secret marriage of his which had
     left him a widower three years ago, with a baby son whom Sir Marcus would not acknowledge, and
     who did not regard it either as a boyish entanglement from which his wife's death had luckily
     released him, or as a reason for abstaining from future marriage altogether. Not that she had
     any definite views on the subject of boyish entanglements or second marriages, for Lady Joan
     never had definite views on anything, they were too much trouble to defend, and she would not
     have taken up any position which would not lend itself to modification on occasion; but she was
     unconventional, and she knew it, and in spite of her boast that she was a woman of the world,
     there was enough of the school-girl in her to give her an exquisite delight in shocking other
     people who were not unconventional. So hers was the only hand that was held out to Digby when
     he came to Relton after his wife's death, in search of a home for his child; and it was she who
     braved the many-tongued slander of an idle country town, and helped him to find what he wanted
     in the motherly landlady of the "Relton Arms," with whom he could leave the boy in safety. The
     arrangement necessarily brought him constantly to Relton, when he was naturally prompted by
     gratitude and courtesy to leave his card at the Hall; but it was some time before she began to
     have any real interest for him. It was true that she was a beautiful woman, but her beauty and
     her wit were of a subtle kind, unlike the obvious and doll-like charms that usually attracted
     him in women; she showed him that she found him interesting, but she did not adore him like his
     other lady friends, and she disputed his dicta, and she did not understand his music. After a
     time these very differences drew them together, and they passed into the desperately dangerous
     stage of friendship, in which the man had to confess to himself that he was again in love, and
     the woman had to ask herself if he meant anything, and whether she was to continue to be
     natural and pleasant to him, or whether the time had come for her in the eyes of society to
     avoid him and pretend she did not care for him. Lady Joan, hating the laws of society, and
     dreading still more the chain of another man's will, broke the connection at this point and
     went abroad for a year, and was away long enough for Digby to fall in and out of another hot
     love affair, and returned on the day of his reception in the studio to find him rather more
     interesting than before, and herself made weaker in her resolution by a year's sojourn with a
     lady companion. Digby on his part was persuading himself that her return to England had caused
     the revival of his old love, and that this attachment which had begun so coldly and forced
     itself into his heart by the most estimable instincts of gratitude and friendship, was superior
     to all the other attachments of his life, which had begun with infatuation and ended with
     indifference, and was therefore to be cherished as the only real feeling he had ever had for
     any woman.
"I'm not the sort of man to be a bachelor," he said to himself earnestly, somewhere about
     midnight that evening, as he leaned out of his bedroom window and smoked a cigarette
     meditatively. "Some fellows ought never to marry; I told Dick Stephens so when he got engaged,
     and he was separated from his wife within a year of their marriage. But I am not like Dick
     Stephens. I am really a most domesticated sort of man, and it is time I settled down. I am
     tired of being a Bohemian; every wretched little pygmy who writes ballads and lets his hair
     grow and doesn't wash, is a Bohemian. And there is the boy, too; he ought to have a mother of
     course, poor little chap: we both want a woman about us, don't we, Sonny? Yes, there is no
     doubt that it is my duty to Sonny to marry very soon."
In the room above, among the cushions on the sofa, lay Lady Joan with her hair down and a fan
     in her hand, opposite a full-length mirror; in her most secret moments Lady Joan liked to
     assure herself that she played the part picturesquely.
"I like him. He is fresh, and original, and amusing. He doesn't bore me, and I can flirt with
     him—safely. He has no theories about things, and he does not want to upset creation, and he
     doesn't take life so desperately seriously. It is such a blessing to meet some one who is
     content with the age as it is—bah! what a smell of tobacco smoke!"
And she rose, shut the window with a bang, and went to bed, where she slept soundly till the
     morning.
"It is curious," murmured the musician, lighting another cigarette, "how Fate seems to have
     propelled her towards me at every crisis of my life; just after Mary died, for instance, and
     again before I met Norah!—poor little Norah! and then again the other day, when I really had
     made up my mind to go to Africa, and she came back from the Continent in time to prevent me.
     And now—ah, I believe I could write that song now."
And he went to the writing-table and tried to set some impassioned words of Swinburne to
     music; but although the situation demanded that he should have been specially inspired, he
     found himself incapable of writing a note, and had to give up the task in despair.
"My brain is overwrought; I am not going to sleep to-night," he said, and put the bromide by
     his bedside.
After that he also shut the window and went to bed, where he likewise slept soundly till the
     morning.
