CHAPTER VI
“CONSTANTINE,” he called. “Où est il? savez-vous où il
       est—Monsieur Leversedge?”
Now, I am, I trust, the last person in the world to be guilty of an impertinence towards my
      elders; but, as Mr. Perry pursued his active way towards us, the word pecky rose
      unbidden to my lips. His expression denoted desire for some object on which to wreak a measure
      of vengeance. A cherry, perhaps, would do; perhaps a worm or fly; possibly—for have not even
      doves, under stress of emotion, been known to use their tender beaks upon their
      fellow-doves?—possibly he coveted a human victim. At sight of me, however, I observed him make
      an effort to summon a more genial aspect, and overlay his evident irascibility with a varnish
      of playfulness. He shook his finger waggishly at me; and my heart fell. Could this, indeed, be
      a father of heroic children?
“Ah ha! I see, I see!” he exclaimed. “The mystery touches on explanation. ‘This is the
      cause, the cause, my soul.’ Hence Constantine
       plays truant. When you two young gentlemen get together
      there is no hope of you.”
He turned to Leversedge, and as he did so the spirit of peckiness resumed full sway.
“We have been expecting you,” he cried. “Charlotte has been visibly disturbed by your
      absence.”
“Oh, has she? I'm sure I am very sorry,” Leversedge said. “I understood some friends of
      yours were there, and—”
“Precisely,” returned Mr. Perry quite excitedly. “That is the point. Friends of ours are
      here. Mr. Percy Gerrard and Mrs. Septimus Mertyns are kindly calling upon us. Most talented
      person, I am sure, Mrs. Mertyns,—an advantage, Constantine, as I was saying recently to Mr.
      Hammond, a positive advantage for one whom, like yourself, I may call a débutant in the London world, to have the entrée of her charming house.”
During the progress of this somewhat confused exordium, Leversedge's vaguely-distracted brow
      had gathered into a quite definite frown. He was bothered, annoyed, and, for once, did not try
      to conceal the fact.
“I have not the honour of knowing Mrs. Mertyns,” he said.
“Precisely,” cried Mr. Perry again. “That, as I remark, is the point. Charlotte perceived
      this was a most favourable opportunity for effecting the
       introduction. She is very thoughtful, very—dear girl,”—here
      he smiled in a really kingly manner,—“very wise; she notes, and never undervalues, a social
      opportunity. For which I commend her. Indifference in social matters is, rightly understood,
      but the mask of ignorance— 
Ignorance, that churlish sin,
Which, seeking to cloak others, shows itself
Still basest born of all.”

“Dear me!” murmured Leversedge, lifting his shoulders, as he drew a long breath.
“Charlotte took for granted you would follow us up from the boat immediately. When she found
      you did not do so, she was disappointed, I had almost said pained; for she recognised your
      mistake. Mamma, remarking her disappointment—affection lends wings to perception, Mr.
      Hammond—interrupting me in the midst of a most interesting conversation with Mr. Gerrard upon
      the deepening of the conservative sentiment among the educated artisans of our great
      commercial centres, whispered to me to come and tell you. And here I am;—me voilà, as I may say, Mr. Hammond, here I am.”
“Yes, you are very sensibly here, Mr. Perry: and it is, as always, a happiness to be in your
      company,” I replied, with effusion.
I had an idea Leversedge intended revolt. I
       wanted to give him time to mature that excellent
      intention.
Mr. Perry glanced at me sharply; then he again addressed our companion.
“Well, Constantine, I have delivered myself of my mission. Why this delay?”
“Because”—Leversedge spoke very slowly—“I will explain why to Charlotte later, and she will
      understand,”—he paused,—“yes, she'll understand; because I don't, to tell the truth, feel very
      much inclined to go and see these people just now. I—I am not in the humour.”
“But—but—this is unheard of,” cried Mr. Perry. “Not inclined,—this is incredible. Not
      inclined,—this is insanity.”
“Oh no, it isn't; it is disinclination,” Leversedge replied, pushing his hands down into the
      pockets of his boating coat and smiling wearily. “Nothing worse than disinclination. Not
      insanity, not just yet,—at least, I believe not.”
“I fail to grasp your meaning.” Mr. Perry looked vicious.
“Oh, it's very simple. As I say, I will explain to Charlotte; she'll understand.”—Leversedge
      repeated the phrase more as one who needs, than as one who has, a conviction of the truth of
      that which he asserts.—“We will leave it all in her hands. It may be better in the longrun for
      me not to know these people at all.”

At this rejoinder Perry père lost himself utterly for the
      moment, and, in the excess of his irritation, literally danced round his future
      son-in-law.
“Not to know them? But don't you recognise that it is absolutely incumbent upon you to know
      my daughter's very cultivated and interesting circle of friends? It is your duty, and I may
      add your privilege, to pay them all possible attention. What are you thinking of? Pray, who
      have you to look to but them? Who have you to push you socially? Why, yours and my daughter's
      future happiness is wholly dependent upon their attitude towards you—upon their receiving you,
      taking you up, and putting you through, in short.”
I ought to have gone away and left the combatants. I admit that I ought. But the natural man
      is strong in me, and curiosity is strong in the natural man. I was tempted, and I fell; that
      is, I stayed—stayed to see Leversedge clasp his hands behind him, and bow slightly from the
      waist.
“So our happiness is dependent upon Charlotte's friends taking us up and putting us through,
      is it?” he answered calmly. “Well, I own the matter had not occurred to me in that light. I
      hoped our happiness drew a little more water than that. But I may be wrong, of course, Mr.
      Perry, and you may be right. I shall know more about it when I have explained things to
      Charlotte; and if I find a strict observance of social duties will secure our happiness,
       you may be very certain I shall do my best to observe
      them.—Ah!” he added, “here she is.”
His face went very pale, but his eyes were clear and steady and his jaw set. Morally, the
      small battle had braced him.
Miss Perry's cheeks appeared charmingly flushed, her abundant hair slightly disordered. The
      drawing together of her lips suggested a sense of injury, an inclination to tears. She was
      extremely pretty, as she halted at the edge of the shadow thrown by the plane trees, a radiant
      perspective of wooded shore bathed in golden sunshine and the fair expanse of the azure lake
      behind her, the white swans floating motionless, the gaily-painted boats.
“Ah, Constantine,” she exclaimed in tones of plaintive reproach, “what cause you have given
      me for vexation!”
Leversedge stepped out into the sunshine towards her.
“No,” she said, raising her hands, “repentance comes too late. They have gone. It is useless
      now, and I wanted you so greatly to see them.”
“Look here, my dearest child, I am glad they are gone, for I want greatly to see you.”
There was a certain air of mastery about Leversedge just then, which was not to be gainsaid.
      Without the smallest apology, he put his arm round the young lady's shoulders and drew her
      aside. Miss Perry looked startled. She was
       I imagine, unaccustomed to such practical declarations of
      affection in public.
“Never mind your friends; they won't break their hearts at not seeing me. They'll keep.
      Let's sit down on the wall over there. I've a whole lot to tell you. I ought to have told you
      before, but I shirked it.”
“Constantine!” the girl murmured. Her expression was strange. The dewy eyes were frightened,
      the rest of her face sharpened into resemblance of the paternal rat.
Leversedge must have seen the fright, for I heard him speak soothingly. I trusted he did not
      see the rat.
“Come, come, my dear sir,” I cried, “in this delightful idyll you and I clearly have no
      part. Let us remove ourselves with all possible despatch.”
I ventured to let my hand rest upon the sleeve of Mr. Perry's ill-brushed coat.
“I am amazed at the events of the last quarter of an hour,” he said severely as he walked
      away. “I may go further,—I may employ the term dumfoundered. The anxieties of a parent are
      cruel, Mr. Hammond. The pelican strips from her breast feathers wherewith to line the nest for
      her young; and then the young, in the most unexpected manner—I am sure sometimes most
      unexpected—get out of the nest and fly away. That is how Mamma and myself feel just now, Mr.
      Hammond, I assure you we do.”

Mr. Perry drew up suddenly, took out his handkerchief, and wiped his head well round.
“I am at sea,” he cried. “I give you my word, Mr. Hammond, I am completely at sea.”
“Never fear,” I returned cheerfully; “if I have the honour of knowing you truly, you are one
      of those elect souls who are very safe to come into port at last.”
Mr. Perry eyed me shrewdly, and then decided to take the speech in good part; so told me it
      reminded him of a capital story of the late Earl of Beaconsfield and a deputation of
      shipowners from Cardiff, which story he proceeded to tell me, as we strolled towards the
      hotel, at the fullest of full length.
