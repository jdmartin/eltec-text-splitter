CHAPTER ELEVEN
THE KISS
By half-past five o'clock, Mr. Tregenza's black lugger was off again in a gray dawn all
      tangled with gold on the eastern horizon.
His mother had given Tom an early breakfast at half-past four, and the youngster, agape and
      dim-eyed at first, speedily brightened up, for he had a willing listener, in the candle-light
      and poured a tale of moving incidents into Thomasin's proud but uneasy mind.
"Them Pritchards sez as they'll make a busker [Footnote: Busker—A rare good
      fisherman.] of me, 'cause it blawed a bit issterday marnin', but 'twas all wan to me; an' you
      abbun no call to fret yourself, nohow, mother, 'cause faither's 'lowed to be the best sailor
      in the fleet an' theer ban't a better foul-weather boat sails from Newlyn than ourn."
He chattered on, larding his discourse with new words picked up aboard, and presently rolled
      off to get things shipshape just as his father came down to breakfast.
When the men had gone, little remained to be done that day, and, by half-past seven, about
      which hour Mrs. Tregenza went into the village that she might whine with a widow who had two
      boys in the fleet, Joan found herself free until the afternoon. She determined therefore to
      reach Gorse Point before the artist should arrive there, and set off accordingly.
Early though she was, she had but a short time to wait, for Barron appeared with his big
      canvas by nine o'clock. She thought he showed more pleasure than usual at the sight of her.
      Certainly he shook hands and congratulated her upon such early hours.
"This is an unexpected pleasure, Joan. You must have been up betimes indeed."
"Iss fay, us took breakfus' by five, an' faither sailed 'fore half-past. 'Tis busy times for
      fishin' folk when the mackerl begins shoalin'." 
"I'm glad I came back to my den in the fields yonder and didn't stop in Newlyn last night.
      You must see my little cow-byre some day or other, Joan. I've made it wonderfully snug. Farmer
      Ford is good enough to let me take possession of it for the present; and I've got food and
      drink stowed away, and a beautiful bed of sweet, withered bracken. I sleep well there, and the
      dawn comes in and wakens me."
"You ban't feared o' piskeys nor nothin' in a lawnsome plaace like thicky byre?"
"No, no—the rats are rather intrusive, though."
"But they'm piskeys or spriggans so like's not! You see, the lil people takes all manner o'
      shaapes, Mister Jan; an' they chaanges 'em tu, but every time they chaanges they've got to
      alter into somethin' smaller than what they was before. An' so, in coorse of time, they do say
      they comes down into muryans an' such like insects."
"Piskeys or no piskeys, I've caught several in a trap and killed them."
"They'm gashly things, rats, an' I shouldn't think as no good piskeys would turn into
      varmints like them."
"More should I. But something better than rats came to see me last night, Joan. Guess who it
      was." 
"I dunnaw."
"Why, you came!"
"Me, Mister Jan! You must a bin dreamin'!"
"Yes, of course I was; but such a lovely dream, Joan! You see, men who paint pictures and
      love what is beautiful and dream about beautiful things and beautiful people see all sorts of
      visions sometimes. I have pictures in my head a thousand times more splendid than any I shall
      ever put upon canvas, because mere paint-brushes cannot do much, even when they are in the
      cleverest hands; but a man's brain is not bound down by material, mechanical matters. My brain
      made a picture of you last night—a picture that came and looked at me on my fern bed—a picture
      so real, so alive that I could see it move and hear it laugh. You think that wonderful. It
      isn't really, because my brain has done nothing but think of you now for nearly six weeks. My
      eye studies you and stamps you upon my brain; then, when night comes, and no man works, and
      the world is dark and silent, my brain sets off on its own account and raises up a magic
      vision just to show me what you really are—how different to this poor daub here."
"Lard, Mister Jan! I never heard tell of sich a coorious thing as that."
"And the pretty dream-Joan can talk almost as well as you can! Why, last night, while I was
      half awake and half asleep, she put her hand upon my shoulder and said kind things, but I
      dared not move or kiss her hand at first for fear she would vanish if I did."
Joan laughed.
"That is a funny story, sure 'nough," she said. "I 'specs 'twas awnly another fairy body,
      arter all."
"No, it wasn't. She had your voice and your spirit in her; and that picture which my brain
      painted for me was so much better than the thing my hand has painted that, in the morning, I
      was almost tempted to destroy this altogether. But I didn't."
"An' what did this here misty sort o' maid say to 'e?"
"Strange things, strange things. Things I would give a great deal to hear you say. It seemed
      that you had come, Joan, it seemed that you had purposely come from your little cottage on the
      cliff through the darkness before dawn. Why? To share my loneliness, to brighten my poor
      shadowy life. Dreams are funny things, are they not? What d'you think you said?"
"Sure I dunnaw."
"Why, you said that you were not going to leave me any more; that you believed in me and
      that you had come to me because it was bad for a man to live all alone in the world. You said
      that you felt alone too—without me. And it made me feel happy to hear you say that, though I
      knew, all the time, that it was not the real beautiful Joan who spoke to me."
Thereupon the girl asked a question which seemed to argue some sharpening of intelligence
      within her.
"An' when I spoke that, what did you say, Mister Jan?"
"I didn't say anything at all. I just took that sweet Joan-of-dreams into my arms and kissed
      her."
He was looking listlessly out over the sea as he spoke, and Joan felt thankful his eyes were
      turned away from her, for this wonderful dream incident made her grow hot all over. He seemed
      to divine by her silence that his answer to her question had not added to her happiness.
"I shouldn't have told you that, Joan, only you asked me. You see, in dreams, we are real in
      some senses, though unreal in others. In dreams the savage part of us comes to the top and
      Nature can whisper to us. She chooses night to do so and often speaks to men in visions,
      because by day the voice of the world is in their ears and they have no attention for any
      other. It was strange, too, that I should fancy such a thing—should imagine I was kissing
      you—because I never kissed a woman in my life."
But from her point of view this falsehood was not so alluring as he meant to make it
      sound.
"'Twould be wrong to kiss any maiden, I reckon, onless you was tokened to her or she were
      your awn sister."
"But, as we look at life, we're all brothers and sisters, Joan—with Nature for our mother.
      We agreed about that long ago."
He turned to his easel, and she went and stood where her feet had already made a brown mark
      on the grass.
"I seen you last night, but you dedn' see me," she said, changing the conversation with
      abruptness.
"Yes, I did," he answered, "sitting under the shadow of the lighthouse, waiting for Mr.
      Tregenza, I expect."
"An' you never took no note o' me!"
He flung down his brushes, turned away from the picture before he had touched it, and went
      and lay near the edge of the cliff.
"Come here, Joan, and I will tell you why I didn't notice you, though I longed to do so.
      Come and sit down by me and I'll explain why I seemed so rude."
She came slowly and sat down some distance from him, putting her elbows on her knees and
      looking away to sea.
"'Tweern't kind," she said, "but when you'm with other folks, I s'pose you'm ashamed o' me
      'spite what you tawld me 'bout yourself."
"You mustn't say that, Joan, or you'll make me unhappy. Ashamed of you! Is it likely I'm
      ashamed of the only friend I've got in the world? No, I'm frightened of losing you; I'm
      selfish; I couldn't make you known to any other man because I should be afraid you'd like him
      better than me, and then I should have no friend at all. So I wouldn't speak and reveal my
      treasure to anybody else. I'm very fond of my friend, and very proud of her, and as greedy as
      a miser over his gold."
Joan took a long breath before this tremendous assertion. He had told her in so many words
      that he was fond of her; and he had mentioned it most casually as a point long since decided.
      Here was the question which she had asked herself so often answered once for all. Her heart
      leaped at tidings of great joy, and as she looked up into his face the man saw infinite wonder
      and delight in her own. Mind was adding beauty to flesh, and he, fast losing the artist's
      instinct before another, thought she had never looked so lovely as then.
"Oh, Mister Jan, you'm fond o' me!"
"Why, didn't you know it, Joan? Did it want my words to tell you so? Hadn't you guessed
      it?"
He rose slowly and approached his picture.
"Oh, how I wish this was a little more like my dream and like reality! I need inspiration,
      Joan; I have reached a point beyond which I cannot go. My colors are dead; my soul is dead.
      Something must happen to me or I shall never finish this."
"Ban't you so well as you was?"
"No, Joan, I'm not. A thing has come between me and my happiness, between me and my picture.
      I know not what to call it. Nature has sent it."
"Then 'tis right an' proper, I s'pose?"
"I suppose so, but it stops work. It makes my hand shake and my heart throb fast and my
      brains grow hot."
"Can't 'e take no physic for't?"
"Why, yes, but I hesitate."
He turned to her and went close to her.
"Let me look at you, Joan—close—very close—so close that I can feel your breath. It was so
      easy to learn the furze; it is so hard to learn you."
"Sure I've comed out butivul in the picksher."
"Not yet, not yet."
He put his hands on her shoulders and looked into her eyes until she grew nervous and
      brushed her hand across her cheek. Then, without a second's warning, he bent down and kissed
      her on the mouth.
"Mister Jan! How could 'e! 'Tis wrong—wrong of 'e! I'd never a thot—"
She started from him, wild, alarmed, blushing hotly; and he shook his head at her dismay and
      answered very calmly, very seriously:
"It was not wrong, Joan, or I should not have done it. You heard me ask to whom I should
      pray for inspiration, and Nature told me I must seek it from you. And I have."
"You shouldn't never a done it. I trusted 'e so!"
"But I had to do it. Nature said 'Kiss her, and you will find what you want.' Do you
      understand that? I have touched you and I am awake and alive again; I have touched you, Joan,
      and I am not hopeless and sad, but happy. Nature thought of me, Joan, when she made you and
      brought you into the world; and she thought of sweet Joan when she fashioned Jan. Believe
      it—you must believe it."
"You did ought to a arsked me."
"Listen. Nature let you live quiet in the country—for me, Joan. She let me live all lonely
      in the world—for you. Only for you. Can't you understand?"
"You did ought to a arsked me. Kissing be wrong 'tween us. You knaws it, Mr. Jan." 
"It is right and proper and fair and beautiful," he said quietly. "My heart sang when I
      kissed you, Joan, and so did yours. D'you know why? Because we are two halves of a whole.
      Because the sunshine of your life would go out without me; because my life, which never had
      any sunshine in it until now, has been full of sunshine since I knew Joan."
"I dunnaw. 'Twadden a proper thing to do, seein' how I trusted 'e."
"We are children of Nature, Joan. I always do what she tells me. I can't help it. I have
      obeyed her all my life. She tells me to love you, Joan, and I do. I'm very sorry. I thought
      she had told you to love me, but I suppose I was wrong. Never mind this once. Forgive me,
      Joan. I'll even fight Nature rather than make you angry with me. Let me finish my picture and
      go away. Come. I've no business to waste your precious time, though you have been so kind and
      generous with it. Only I was tired and hopeless and you came like a drink of wine to me, Joan;
      and I drank too much, I suppose."
He picked up his brushes, spoke in a sad minor key, and seemed crushed and weary. The flash
      died from his face and he looked older again. Joan, the mistress of the situation, found it
      wholly bitter. She was bewildered, for affairs had proceeded with such rapidity. He had
      declared frankly that he loved her, and yet had stopped there. To her ideas it was impossible
      that a man should say as much as that to a woman and no more. Love invariably meant ultimate
      union for life, Joan thought. She could not understand any other end to it. The man talked
      about Nature as a little child talks of its mother. He had deemed himself entirely in the
      right; yet something—not Nature, she supposed—had told her that he was wrong. But who was she
      to judge him? Who was she to say where his conduct erred? He loved truth. It was not a lie to
      kiss a girl. He promised nothing. How could he promise anything or propose anything? Was she
      not another man's sweetheart? That doubtless had been the reason why he had said no more than
      that he loved her. To love her could be no sin. Nature had told him to; and God knew how she
      loved him now.
But she could not make it up with him. A cold curtain seemed to have fallen between them.
      The old reserve which had only melted after many meetings, was upon him again. He stood, as it
      seemed, on the former pedestal. A strange, surging sensation filled her head—a sense of
      helpless fighting against a flood of unhappy affairs. All the new glory of life was suddenly
      tarnished through her own act, and she felt that things could never be the same again.
She thought and thought. Then John Barron saw Joan's blue eyes begin to wink ominously, the
      corners of her bonny mouth drag down and something bright twinkle over her cheek. He took no
      notice, and when he looked up again, she had moved away and was sitting on the grass crying
      bitterly with her hands over her face. The sun was bright, a lark sang overhead; from adjacent
      inland fields came the jolt and clank of a plow with a man's voice calling to his horses at
      the turns. The artist put down his palette and walked over to Joan.
"My dear, my dear," he said, "d'you know what's making you so unhappy?"
She sobbed on and did not answer.
"I can tell you, I think. You don't quite know whether to believe me or not, Joan. That is
      very natural. Why should you believe me? And yet if you knew—"
She sat up, swallowed some of her tears, and smudged her face with her knuckles. He took a
      clean handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to her. It was cool and pleasant, and she
      went on crying a while, but tears which were comforting and different to the first stinging
      drops bred from a sudden, forlorn survey of life. He talked on, and his voice soothed her. He
      kept his distance, and presently, as her ruffled spirit grew calmer, his remarks assumed a
      brighter note.
"Has my poor little Lady of the Gorse forgiven me at last? She won't punish me any more, I
      know, and it is a very terrible punishment to see tears in her eyes."
Then she found her tongue again and words to answer him, together with fluttering sighs that
      told the tears were ended.
"I dunnaw why for I cried, Mr. Jan, but I seemed 'mazed like. I'm a stupid fule of a maid, I
      reckon, an' I s'pose 'tis auld-fashioned notions as I've got 'bout what be right an' wrong.
      But, coorse, you knaws better'n what I can; an' you'd do me no hurt 'cause you loves me—you've
      said it; an'—an'—I love 'e tu, Mister Jan, I 'sure 'e—better'n anything in all the world."
"Why, that's good, sweet news, Joan; and Nature told me the truth after all! We're bound to
      love one another. She made us for that very reason!"
He knew that her mind was full of the tangles of life and that she wanted him to solve some
      of the riddles just then uppermost in her own existence. He felt that Joe was in her thoughts,
      and he easily divined her unuttered question as to why Nature had sent Joe before she had sent
      him. But, though answers and explanations of her troubles were not likely to be difficult, he
      had no wish to make them or to pursue the subject just then. Indeed, he bid Joan depart an
      hour before she need have done so. Her face was spoiled for that sitting, and matters had
      progressed up to the threshold of the barrier. Before that could be broken down, she must be
      made to feel that she was necessary to the happiness of his life; as he already felt that she
      was necessary to the completion of his picture. She loved him very dearly, and he, though love
      was not possible to his nature, could feel the substitute. He had fairly stepped out of his
      impersonal shell into reality. Presently he would return to his shell again. For a moment a
      model had grown more to him than a picture; and he told himself that he must obey Nature in
      order adequately to serve Art.
He picked up the handkerchief he had lent Joan, looked at the dampness of the tear-stains,
      and then spread it in the sun to dry.
