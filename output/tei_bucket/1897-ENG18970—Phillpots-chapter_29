CHAPTER ONE
OF THE CROSSES
The significance of the ancient crosses in Joan Tregenza's latest phase of mental growth
      becomes much finer after learning somewhat more concerning them than she could ever know. The
      ephemeral life of one unhappy woman viewed from these granite records of Brito-Celtic pagan
      and Christian faith, examined in its relation to these hoary splinters of stone, grows an
      object of some pathetic interest. Such memorials of the past as are here indicated, vary
      mightily in age. The Christian monuments are not older than the fifth century, but many have
      been proved palimpsests and rise on pagan foundations dating from a time far more ancient than
      their own. The relics are divided into two classes by antiquarians: Pillar Stones and
      Sculptured Crosses. The former occur throughout the Celtic divisions of Great Britain, and are
      sometimes marked with the Chi Rho monogram, or early rude cross form. In most cases these
      earlier erections indicated a grave, while the sculptured crosses either denoted boundaries of
      sanctuary, or were raised promiscuously where men and women passed or congregated, their
      object being to encourage devotion and lead human thoughts heavenward. The designs on these
      monuments are usually a bad imitation of Irish key patterns and spirals; but many, in
      addition, show crucifixes in their midst, with pre-Norman figures depicting the Christ in a
      loose tunic or shirt, his head erect and his body alive, after the Byzantine fashion. The
      mediaeval mode of carving a corpse on the cross is of much later date and may not be observed
      before the twelfth century.
More than three hundred of these sculptured crosses have been discovered within the confines
      of Cornwall. In churchyards and churchyard walls they stand; they have even been discovered
      wrought into the fabric of the churches themselves; the brown moor likewise knows them, for
      they stud its wildernesses and rise at the crossways of many lonely roads; while elsewhere,
      villages hold them in their hearts, and the emblem rises daily before the sight of generation
      upon generation. In hedges they are also to be seen, and in fields; many have been rescued
      from base uses; and all have stood through the centuries as the sign and testimony of
      primitive Cornish faith, even as St. Piran's white cross on a black ground, the first banner
      of Cornwall, bore aloft the same symbol in days when the present emblem, with its fifteen
      bezants and its motto, "One and All," was not dimly dreamed of.
These ancient crosses now rose like gray sentinels on the gray life of Joan Tregenza. At
      Drift she was happily placed among them, and many, not necessary to separately name, lay
      within the limit of her daily wanderings, and her superstitious nature, working with the
      new-born faith, wove precious mystery into them. Much she loved the more remote and lonely
      stones, for beside them, hidden from the world's eye, she could pray. Those others about which
      circled human lives attracted her less frequently. To her the crosses were sentient creatures
      above the fret of Time, eternally watching human affairs. The dawn of art as shown in early
      religious sculpture generally amuses an ignorant mind, but, to Joan, the little shirted
      figures of her new Saviour, which opened blind eyes on the stones she loved, were matter for
      sorrow rather than amusement. They did by no means repel her, despite the superficial
      hideousness of them; indeed, with a sort of intuition, Joan told herself that human hands had
      fashioned them somewhere in the dawn of the world when yet her Lord's blood was newly shed, at
      a time before men had learned skill to make beautiful things.
Once, beside the foot of the cross which stood in Sancreed [Footnote: This fine sculptured
      cross has since these events been placed within the said churchyard, at the desire of Mr. A.
      G. Langdon, the greatest living authority on the subject of Cornish remains.] churchyard wall,
      between two tree-trunks under a dome of leaves, the girl found growing a spotted persicaria,
      and the force of the discovery at such a spot was great to her. Familiar with the legend of
      the purple mark on every leaf of the plant, nothing doubting that it had aforetime grown at
      the foot of the true cross and there been splashed with the blood of her Master, Joan accepted
      the old story that henceforth the weed was granted this proud livery and badge of blood. And
      now, finding it here, the fable revived with added truth and conviction, the legend of the
      persicaria was as true to her as that other of the Lord's resurrection from death. Thus her
      views of Nature suffered some approach to debasement in a new direction, but this degradation,
      so to call it, brought mighty comfort to her soul, daily rounded the ragged edges of life,
      woke merciful trust and belief in a promised life of bliss beyond the grave, and embroidered
      thereupon a patchwork, not unbeautiful, built of fairy folk-lore, saintly legend and venerable
      myth. Her credulous nature accepted right and left; anything that harbored a promise or was
      lovely or wonderful in itself found acceptance; and Joan read into the very pulses of the
      summer world the truth as she now understood it. Cornwall suddenly became a new Holy Land to
      the girl. Here the circumstances of life chimed with those recorded in the New Testament, and
      it was an easy mental achievement to transplant her Saviour from a historical environment into
      her own. She pictured Him as walking amid Uncle Chirgwin's ripening corn; she saw Him place
      His hands on the heads of the little children at cottage doors; she imagined Him standing upon
      one of the stranded luggers in Newlyn harbor with the gulls floating round His head and the
      fishermen listening to his utterance.
The growing mother instincts in Joan also developed about this season. They leaped from
      comparative quiescence into activity; they may indeed be recorded as having arisen within her
      after a manner not less sudden than had the new faith itself, which was exhibited to you as
      blossoming with an abruptness almost violent, because it thus occurred. Now most channels of
      thought led Joan to her unborn infant, and there came at length an occasion upon which she
      prayed for the first time that her child might be justified in its existence.
The petition was raised where, in the past, she had uttered one widely different: at the
      altar-stone in the ruined baptistery of Saint Madron. Thither on a day in early August, Joan
      traveled by short cuts over fields which brought the chapel within reach of Drift. The scene
      had changed from that of her former visit, and summer was keeping the promises of spring.
      Yellow stars of biting stone-crop covered the walls of the ruin; the fruit of the blackthorn
      was growing purple, of the hawthorn, red; the lesser dodder crept, like pink lacework, over
      furze and heather; bright-eyed euphrasy and sweet wild thyme were murmured over by many bees;
      at the altar's foot grew brake fern and towering foxgloves; while upon the sacred stone itself
      brambles laid their fruit, a few ripe blackberries shining from clusters of red and green.
      Seeding grasses and docks likewise nourished within the little chapel, and ragged robins and
      dandelions brought the best beauty they had. Among which matters, hid in loneliness, to the
      sound of that hymn of life which rises in a whisper from all earth at summer noon, Joan prayed
      for her baby that it might not be born in vain.
