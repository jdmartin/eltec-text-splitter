CHAPTER TWO
HOME
Among the varied ambitions now manifested by Joan was one already hinted at—one which
      increased to the displacement of smaller interests: she much desired to see again her home, if
      but for the space of an hour. The days and weeks of an unusually smiling summer brought
      autumn, and with it the cutting of golden grain; but the bustle and custom of harvest failed
      to draw Joan among her kind. Human life faded somewhat, even to the verge of unreality with
      her. Silence fell upon her, and a gravity of demeanor which was new to the beholders. Uncle
      Chirgwin and Mary were alike puzzled at this sign, and, misunderstanding the nature of the
      change, feared that the girl's spiritual development must be meeting unseen opposition. Whims
      and moods were proper to her condition, so the farmer maintained; but the fancy of eternally
      sequestering herself, the conceit of regarding as friends those ancient stones of the moor and
      crossroads, was beyond his power to appreciate. To Mary such conduct presented even greater
      elements of mystery. Yet the fact faced them, and the crosses came in time to be one of the
      few subjects which Joan cared to talk upon. Even then it was to her uncle alone she opened her
      heart concerning them: Mary never unlocked the inner nature of her cousin.
"I got names o' my awn for each of 'em," Joan confessed, "an' I seem they do knaw my comin'
      an' my secrets an' my troubles. They teach me the force o' keepin' my mouth shut; an' much
      mixin' wi' other folks arter the silence o' the stones 'mazes me—men an' wummen do chatter
      so."
"An' so did you, lassie, an' weern't none the worse. Us doan't hear your purty voice enough
      now."
"'Tis better thinkin' than talkin', Uncle Thomas. I abbun nort to talk 'bout, you see, but a
      power o' things to think of. The auld stones speaks to me solemn, though they can't talk.
      They'm wise, voiceless things an' brings God closer. An' me, an' all the world o' grass an'
      flowers, an' the lil chirruping griggans [Footnote: Grasshoppers.] do seem so young beside
      'em; but they'm big an' kind. They warm my heart somethin' braave; an' they let the gray
      mosses cling to 'em an' the dinky blue butterflies open an' shut their wings 'pon 'em, an' the
      bramble climb around theer arms. They've tawld me a many good things; an' fust as I must be
      humbler in my bearin'. Wance I said I'd forgive faither, an' I thot 'twas a fair thing to say;
      now I awnly wants en to forgive me an' let me come to my time wi' no man's anger hot agin me.
      If I could win just a peep o' home. I may never see it no more arter, 'cause things might fall
      out bad wi' me."
"'Tis nachrul as you harp on it; an', blame me, if I sees why you shouldn' go down-long. Us
      might ride in the cart an' no harm done."
"Ay, do 'e come, theer's a dear sawl. Just to look upon the plaace—"
"As for that, if us goes, us must see the matter through an' give your faither the chance to
      do what's right by 'e."
"He'll not change; but still I'd have en hear me tell I'm in sorrer for the ill I brot 'pon
      his name."
"Ay, facks! 'Tis a wise word an' a right. Us'll go this very arternoon. You get a odd pound
      or so o' scald cream, an' I'll see to a basket o' fruit wi' some o' they scoured necterns, as
      ban't no good for sellin', but eats so well as t'others. Iss, we'll go so soon as dinner be
      swallowed. Wishes doan't run in a body's head for nothin'."
Uncle Chirgwin's old market-cart, with the gray horse and the squeaking wheel, rattled off
      to Newlyn some two hours later, and the ordeal, longed for at a distance, towered tremendous
      and less beautiful at nearer approach. When they started, Joan had hoped that her father might
      be at home; as they neared Newlyn she felt a growing relief in the reflection that his
      presence ashore was exceedingly improbable. Her anxieties were forgotten for a few moments at
      sight of the well-known outlines of the hills above the village. Now arrish-mows—little
      thatched stacks some eight feet high—glimmered in the pale gilded stubbles of the fields; the
      orchards gleamed with promise; the foliage of the elms was at its darkest before the golden
      dawn of autumn. Well-remembered sights rose on Joan's misty eyes with the music proper to
      them; then came the smell of the sea and the jolting of the cart, going slowly over rough
      stones. Narrow, steep streets and sharp corners had to be traversed not only with caution but
      at a speed which easily placed Joan within the focus of many glances. Troubles and humiliation
      of a sort wholly unexpected burst suddenly upon her, bringing the girl's mind rudely back from
      dreams born of the familiar scene. Newlyn women bobbed about their cottage doors with hum and
      stir, and every gossip's mouth was full of news at this entry. Doors and windows filled with
      curious heads and bright eyes; there was some laughter in the air; fishermen got up with
      sidelong looks from the old masts or low walls whereon, during hours of leisure, they sat in
      rows and smoked. Joan, all aflame, prayed Uncle Chirgwin to hasten, which he did to the best
      of his power; but their progress was of necessity slow, and local curiosity enjoyed full scope
      and play. Tears came to the girl's eyes long before the village was traversed; then, through a
      mist of them, she saw a hand stretched to meet her own and heard a voice which rang kindly on
      her ears. It was Sally Trevennick, who faced the spiteful laughter without flinching and said
      a few loud, friendly words, though indeed her well-meant support brought scant comfort with it
      for the victim.
"Lard sakes! Joan, doan't 'e take on so at them buzzin' fools! 'Tedn' the trouble, 'tis the
      money make 'em clatter! Bah! Wheer's the wan of them black-browed gals as 'alf the money
      wouldn' buy? You keep a bold faace, an' doan't let 'em see as their sniggerin's aught more to
      'e than dog-barking."
"Us'll be theer in a minute," added Mr. Chirgwin, "an' I'll drive back agin by Mouzle; then
      you'll 'scape they she-cats. I never thot as you'd a got to stand that dressin' down in a
      plaace what's knawed you an' yours these many years."
Joan asked Sally Trevennick whether she could say if Gray Michael was on the water, and she
      felt very genuine thankfulness on learning that Sally believed so. Two minutes later the
      spring-cart reached level ground above the sea, then, whipping up his horse, Uncle Chirgwin
      increased the pace, and very quickly Joan found herself at the door of home.
Thomasin was within, and, hearing the sound of wheels cease before the cottage, came forth
      to learn who had arrived. Her surprise was only equaled by her alarm at sight of Joan and Mr.
      Chirgwin. So frightened indeed did she appear that both the newcomers supposed Mr. Tregenza
      must be within. Such, however, was not the case, and Joan's stepmother explained the nature of
      her fears.
"He'm to sea, but the whole world do knaw you be come, I'll lay; an' he'll knaw tu. Sure's
      death some long-tongued female will babble it to en 'fore he's off the quay. Then what?"
"'Tedn' your fault anyways," declared Uncle Thomas. "Joan's wisht an' sad to see home agin,
      as was right an' proper; an' in her present way she've got to be humored. So I've brot her,
      an' what blame comes o't my shoulders is more'n broad enough to carry. I wish, for my paart,
      as Michael was home, so's I might faace en when Joan says what her've comed to say. I be
      gwaine to Penzance now, 'pon a matter o' business, an' I'll come back here in an hour or so
      an' drink a dish o' tea along with you 'fore we staarts."
He drove away immediately, and for a while Joan was left with Mrs. Tregenza. The latter's
      curiosity presently soothed her fears, and almost the first thing she began to talk about was
      that "will and testament" which she had long since urged upon her stepdaughter. But the girl,
      moving about in the well-known orchard, had no attention for anything but the sights, sounds
      and scents around her. Silently and not unhappily she basked in old sensations renewed; and
      they filled her heart. Meanwhile Thomasin kept up a buzz of conversation concerning Joan's
      money and Joan's future.
"Touchin' that bit o' writin'! Do 'e see to it, soas; 'tis awnly wisdom. Theer's allus a
      fear wi' the fust, specially in the case o' a pin-tail built lass like you be. An' if you was
      took, which God forbid, theer'd be that mort o' money to come to Michael, him bein' your
      faither—that is, s'pose the cheel was took tu, which God forbid likewise. An' he'd burn
      it—every note—I mean Michael. Now if you was to name Tom—just in case o' accidents—? He'm of
      your awn blood by's faither."
"But my baaby must be fust."
"In coorse er must. 'Tis lawful an' right. Love childern do come as sweet an' innercent on
      to the airth as them born o' wedlock—purty sawls. 'Tis the fashion to apprentice 'em to theer
      faithers mostly, an' they be a sort o' poor cousins o' the rightful fam'ly; but your lil
      wan—well—theer edn' gwaine to be any 'poor cousin' talk 'bout en—if en do live. But I was
      talkin' o' the will."
"I've writ it out all fair in ink 'cordin' as Uncle Chirgwin advised," said Joan. "Fust
      comes my cheel, then Tom. Uncle sez theer ban't no call to name others. I wanted hisself to
      take a half on it, but he said theer weren't no need an' he wouldn't nohow."
"Quite right," declared Thomasin. "Iss fay! He be a plain dealer an' a good righteous
      man."
Joan's thoughts meanwhile were mainly concerned with her surroundings, and when she had
      walked thrice about the garden, visited the pigs, peeped into the tool-house to smell the
      paint and twine, noted the ripening plums and a promising little crop of beets coming on in
      the field beyond, she went indoors. There a pair of Michael's tall sea-boots stood in the
      chimney corner, with a small pair of Tom's beside them; the old, well-remembered crockery
      shone from the dresser; geraniums and begonias filled the window; on a basket at the right of
      the fireside stood a small blue plate with gold lettering upon it and a picture of Saltash
      Bridge in the middle. The legend ran—A present for a good girl. It was a gift from
      her father to Joan, on her tenth birthday. She picked it up, polished it, and asked for a
      piece of paper to wrap it in, designing to carry the trifle away with her.
Every old nook and corner had been visited by the time that Uncle Chirgwin returned. Then
      all sat down to eat and drink, and the taste of the tea went still further to quicken Joan's
      memory.
Mrs. Tregenza gave them such information as suggested itself to her during the progress of
      the meal. She was chiefly concerned about her son.
"Cruel 'ard worked he be, sure 'nough," she murmured. "'Tis contrary to reason a boy can
      graw when he's made to sweat same as Tom be. An' short for his age as 'tis. But butivul broad,
      an' 'mazin' strong, an' a fine sight to see en ate his food. Then the Gosp'lers—well, they'm
      cold friends to the young. A bwoy like him caan't feel religion in his blood same as grawed
      folks."
"Small blame to en," said Joan promptly. "Let en go to church an' hear proper holy ministers
      in black an' white gownds, an' proper words set down in print, same as what I do now."
"I'd as soon not have my flaish creep down the spine 'pon Sundays as not," confessed
      Thomasin, "but Michael's Michael, an' so all's said."
Uncle Chirgwin went to smoke a pipe and water his horse at this juncture; but he returned
      within less than ten minutes.
"It's blowin'," he said, "an' the fust skew o' gray rain's breakin' over the sea. I knawed
      'twas comin' by my corns. The bwoats is sailin' back tu—a frothin' in proper ower the lumpy
      water."
"Then you'd best be movin'," said Mrs. Tregenza. "I judged bad-fashioned weather was comin'
      tu when I touched the string o' seaweed as hangs by the winder. 'Tis clammy to the hand. God
      save us!" she continued, turning from the door, "theer's ourn at the moorin's! They've been
      driv' back 'fore us counted 'pon seein' 'em by the promise of storm. Get you gone, for the
      love o' the Lard; an' go Mouzle way, else you'll run on top o' Michael for sure."
"Ban't no odds if us do. Joan had a mind to see en," answered the farmer; but Joan spoke for
      herself. She explained that she now wished to depart without seeing her father if
      possible.
It was, however, too late to escape the meeting. Even as the twain bade Mrs. Tregenza a
      hasty farewell, heavy feet sounded on the cobbles at the cottage door and a moment later
      Tregenza entered. His oilskins were wet and shiny; half a dozen herrings, threaded through the
      gills on a string, hung from his right hand.
