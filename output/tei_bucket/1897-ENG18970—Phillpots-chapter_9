CHAPTER NINE A WEDDING
Joan Tregenza went home in a dream that day. She did not know where to begin thinking.
      "Mister Jan" had told her so many astounding things; and her own heart, too, had made bold
      utterances—concerning matters which she had crushed out of sight with some shame and many
      secret blushes until now. But, seen in the light of John Barron's revelations, this emotion
      which she had thrust so resolutely to the back of her mind could remain there no more. It
      arose strong, rampant and ridiculous; only from her point of view no humor distinguished it.
      This man, then, was like herself, made of the same flesh and blood, sprung from the people.
      That fact, though possessing absolutely no significance whatever in reality, struck Joan with
      great force. Her highly primitive instincts stretched a wide gulf between the thing called
      "gentleman" and other men; which was the result of training from parents of the old-fashioned
      sort, whose world lay outside and behind the modern spirit; who had reached the highest
      development of their intelligence and formed their opinions before the passing of the
      Education Act. Gray Michael naturally held the great ones of the earth as objects of pity from
      an eternal standpoint, but birth weighed with him, and, in temporal concerns, he treated his
      superiors with all respect and civility when rare chance brought him into contact with them.
      He viewed uneasily the last outcome of progress and the vastly increased facilities for
      instruction of the juvenile population. The age was sufficiently godless, in his judgment; and
      he had found that a Board School education was the first nail in the coffin of every young
      man's faith.
Joan, therefore, allowing nothing for the value of riches, of education, of intellect, was
      content to accept Barron's own cynical statement in a spirit widely different from the
      speaker's. He had sneered at himself, just as he had sneered at his own dead father. But Joan
      missed all the bitterness of his speech. To her he was simply a wondrously honest man who
      loved truth for itself, who could never utter anything not true, who held it no offense to
      speak truth even of the dead. Gentle or simple, he seemed infinitely superior to all men whom
      she had met with. And yet this beautiful nature walked through the world quite alone. He had
      asked her to remember him when he was gone; he had said that she was his friend. And he cared
      little for women—there was perhaps no other woman in the world he had called a friend. Then
      the girl's heart fluttered at the presumption of her silly, soaring thoughts, and she glanced
      nervously to the right and to the left of the lonely road, as though fearful that some hidden
      eavesdropper might peep into her open mind. The magic spell was upon her. This little, pale,
      clever man, so quiet, so strange, so unlike anything else within her seventeen years of
      experience, had wrought Nature's vital miracle, and Joan, who, until then, believed herself in
      love with her sailor sweetheart, now stood aghast before the truth, stood bewildered between
      the tame and bloodless fantasy of her affection for Joe Noy and this wild, live reality. She
      looked far back into a past already dim and remembered that she had told Joe many times how
      she loved him with all her heart. But the words were spoken before she knew that she possessed
      a heart at all. Yet Joe then formed no inconsiderable figure in life. She had looked forward
      to marriage with him as a comfortable and sufficient background for present existence; she had
      viewed Joe as a handsome, solid figure—a man well thought of, one who would give her a home
      with bigger rooms and better furniture in it than most fishermen's daughters might reasonably
      hope for. But this new blinding light was more than the memory of Joe could face uninjured. He
      shriveled and shrank in it. Like St. Michael's Mount, seen afar, through curtains of rain, Joe
      had once bulked large, towering, even grand, but under noonday sun the great mass dwindles as
      a whole though every detail becomes more apparent; and so with poor Joe Noy. Removed to a
      distance of a thousand miles though he was, Joan had never known him better, never realized
      the height, breadth, depth of him so acutely as now she did. The former ignorance in such a
      case had been bliss indeed, for whereunto her present acquired wisdom might point even she
      dared not consider. Any other girl must have remained sufficiently alive to the enormous
      disparity every way between herself and the artist; and Joan grasped the difference, but from
      the wrong point of view. The man's delicacy of discernment, his wisdom, his love of the things
      which she loved, his fine feeling, his humility—all combined in Joan's judgment to place him
      far above herself, though she had not words to name the qualities; but whereas another lowly
      woman, reaching this point, must, if she possessed any mother-wit or knowledge of the world,
      have awakened to the danger and grown guarded, Joan, claiming little wit to speak of, and
      being an empty vessel so far as knowledge of the world was concerned, saw no danger and
      allowed her thoughts to run away with her in a wholly insane direction. This she did for two
      reasons: because she felt absolutely safe, and because she suspected that Nature, who was
      "Mister Jan's" God, had now come to be her God also. The man was very wise, and he hated
      everything which lacked truth: therefore he would always do what was right, and he would not
      be less true to her than he was to the world. Truth was his guiding star, and he had always
      found Nature true. Therefore, why should not Joan find it true? Nature was talking to her now
      and teaching her rapidly. She must be content to wait and learn. The two men, Noy and Barren,
      fairly represented the opposite views of life each entertained, and Joan felt the new music
      wake a thousand sleeping echoes in her heart while the old grew more harsh and unlovely as she
      considered it. Joe had so many opinions and so little information; "Mister Jan" knew
      everything and asserted nothing save what Nature had taught him. Joe was so self-righteous and
      overbearing, so like her father, so convinced that Luke Gospeldom was the only gate to glory;
      "Mister Jan" had said there was more of the Everlasting God in a bluebell than in the whole of
      the Old Testament; he had declared that the smell of the gorse and the sunshine on the deep
      sea were better things than the incense and banners at St. Peter's; he had asserted that the
      purring of kittens was sweeter to the Father of all than the thunder of a mighty organ played
      in the noblest cathedral ever made with hands. All these foolish and inconsequent comparisons,
      uttered thoughtlessly by Barron's lips while his mind was on his picture, seemed very fine to
      Joan; and the finer because she did not understand them. Again, Joe rarely listened to her;
      this man always did, and he liked to hear her talk: he had declared as much.
Her brains almost hurt Joan on her way back to the white cottage that morning. They seemed
      so loaded; they lifted her up high above the working-day world and made her feel many years
      older. Such reflections and ideas came to grown women doubtless, she thought. A great unrest
      arose from the shadows of these varied speculations—a great unrest and disquiet—a feeling of
      coming change, like the note in the air when the swallows meet together in autumn, like the
      whisper of the leaves on the high tops of the forest before rain. Her heart was very full. She
      walked more slowly as the thoughts weighed heavier; she went back to her home round-eyed and
      solemn, wondering at many things, at the extension of the horizon of life, at the mental
      picture of Joe standing clearly out of the mists, viewed from a woman's standpoint.
That day much serving awaited her; but, at every turn and pause in the small affairs of her
      duty, Joan's mind swooped back like a hawk to the easel on Gorse Point; and when it did, her
      cheeks flushed and she turned to bend over sink or pig's trough to hide the new fire that
      burned in her heart and lighted her eyes.
Mrs. Tregenza, who had suffered from neuralgia and profound depression of spirit upon Tom's
      departure to the sea, but who comforted herself even in her darkest hour by reflection that no
      lugger boy ever joined the fishing fleet with such an equipment of new clothes as her son, was
      somewhat better and more cheerful now that the lad had made his first trip and survived it.
      Moreover, Tom would be home again that night in all probability, and, since Michael was last
      ashore, the butcher from Paul had called and offered three shillings and sixpence more for the
      next pig to be killed than ever a Tregenza pig had fetched until that day. Life therefore held
      some prosperity in it, even for Thomasin.
After their dinner both women, the elder with a shawl muffled about her face, went down the
      road to Newlyn to see a sight. They stopped at George Trevennick's little house. It had a
      garden in front of it with a short flagstaff erected thereon, and all looked neat, trim and
      ship-shape as became the home of a retired Royal Navy man. A wedding was afoot, and Mr.
      Trevennick, who never lost an opportunity to display his rare store of bunting, had
      plentifully shaken out bright reds and yellows, blues and greens. The little flags fluttered
      in four streamers from the head of the flagstaff, and their colors looked harsh and crude
      until associated with the human interests they marked.
Already many children gazed with awe from the road, while a favored few, including the
      Tregenzas, stood in Mr. Trevennick's garden, which was raised above the causeway. Great
      good-humor prevailed, together with some questionable jesting, and Joan heard the merriment
      with a sense of discomfort. They would talk like this when Joe came back to marry her; but the
      great day of a maid's life had lost its greatness for her now. The rough, good-natured fun
      grated on her nerves as it had never grated before; because, though she only guessed at the
      sly jokes of her elders, something told her that "Mister Jan" would have found no pleasure in
      such merriment. Mrs. Tregenza talked, Mr. Trevennick smoked, and Sally Trevennick, the old
      sailor's daughter, entertained the party and had a word for all. She was not young, and not
      well-favored, and unduly plump, but a sweet-hearted woman nevertheless, with a great love for
      the little children. This indeed presently appeared, for while the party waited there happened
      a tragedy in the street which brought extreme sorrow to a pair of very small people. They had
      a big crabshell full of dirt off the road which they drew after them by a string, and in which
      they took no small pride and pleasure; but a young sailor, coming hastily round a corner,
      trampled upon the shell, smashed it, and passed laughing on. The infants, overwhelmed by this
      sudden disaster to their most cherished earthly possession, crushed to the earth by this
      blotting out of the sunshine of the day, lifted up their voices and wept before the shattered
      ruins. One, the biggest, dropped the useless string and put his face against the wall, that
      his extreme grief might be hidden; but the smaller hesitated not to make his sorrows widely
      known. He bawled, then took a deep breath and bawled again. As the full extent of his loss was
      borne in upon him, he absolutely danced with access of frenzied grief; and everybody laughed
      but fat Sally Trevennick. Her black eyes grew clouded, and she went down into the road to
      bring comfort to the sufferers.
"Never mind, then; never mind, you bwoys; us'll get 'e another braave shell, so us will.
      Theer, theer, give over an' come 'long wi' me an' see the flags. Theer's many bigger auld
      crabshells wheer that comed from, I lay. Your faither'll get 'e another."
She took a hand of each babe and brought them into the garden, from which they could look
      down upon their fellows. Such exaltation naturally soothed their sufferings, and amid many
      gasps and gurgles they found a return to peace in the close contemplation of Mr. Trevennick's
      flagstaff and the discussion of a big saffron pasty.
Presently the bridegroom and his young brother passed on the way to church. Both looked the
      reverse of happy; both wore their Sunday broadcloth, and both swung along as fast as their
      legs would carry them. They were red hot and going five miles an hour; but, though Mousehole
      men, everybody in Newlyn knew them, and they were forced to run the gauntlet of much
      chaff.
"Time was when they did use to thrash a new-married couple to bed," said Mr. Trevennick.
      "'Twas an amoosin' carcumstance an' I've 'elped at many, but them good auld doin's is dyin'
      out fast."
Mrs. Tregenza was discussing the bridegroom's family.
"He be a poor Billy-be-damned sort o' feller, I've allus heard, an' awnly a common tinner,
      though his faither were a grass cap'n at Levant Mine."
"But he's a steady chap," said Sally; "an' them in his awn station sez he's reg'lar at
      church-goin' an' well thot 'pon by everybody. 'Tedn' all young pairs as parson'll ax out, I
      can tell 'e. He wants to knaw a bit 'fore 'e'll marry bwoys an' gals; but theer weren't no
      trouble 'bout Mark Taskes."
"Sure I'm glad to hear it, Sally, 'cause if he caan't do everything, everything won't be
      done. They Penns be a pauper lot—him a fish-jouster as ain't so much as his awn donkey an'
      cart, an' lame tu. Not that 'twas his awn fault, I s'pose, but they do say a lame chap's never
      caught in a good trick notwithstandin'."
"Here comes the weddeners!" said Joan, "but 'tedn' a very braave shaw," she added. "They'm
      all a-foot, I do b'lieve."
"Aw, my dear sawl! look at that now!" cried Mrs. Tregenza. "Walkin', ackshally walkin'.
      Well—well!"
The little bride advanced between her father and mother, while relations and friends marched
      two and two behind. A vision it was of age and youth, of bright spring flowers, of spotless
      cotton and black broadcloth. A matron or two marched in flaming colors; a few fishermen wore
      their blue jerseys under their reefer jackets; the smaller children were led by hand; and the
      whole party numbered twelve all told. Mr. Penn looked up at the flags as he limped along, and
      a great delight broke out upon his face; the bride's mother beamed with satisfaction at a
      compliment not by any means expected, for the Penns were a humble folk; and the bride blushed
      and stole a nervous peep at the display. Mr. Penn touched his hat to the party in the garden,
      and Mr. Trevennick, feeling the eye of the multitude upon him, loudly wished the wedding party
      well as it passed by.
"Good speed to 'e an' to the maid, Bill Penn. May she live 'appy an' be a credit to all
      parties consarned."
"Thank 'e, thank 'e, kindly, Mr. Trevennick. An' us takes it mighty favorable to see your
      butivul flags a hangin' out—mighty favorable, I 'sure 'e."
So the party tramped on and ugly Sally looked after them with dim eyes; but Mrs. Tregenza's
      thin voice dried them. 
"A bad come-along o't for a gal to walk 'pon sich a day. They did ought to a got her a lift
      to her weddin', come what might."
"Maybe 'tis all wan to them poor dears. A coach an' four 'orses wouldn' make that cheel no
      better pleased. God bless her, did 'e look 'ow she flickered up when she seed faither's flags
      a flyin'?"
"Theer's a right way an' a wrong o' doin' weddin's, Sarah, an' 'tedn' a question whether a
      gal's better pleased or no. It's all wan to a dead corpse whether 'tis took to the yard in a
      black hearse wi' plumes, same as what us shall be, or whether 'tis borne 'pon wan o' them four
      'anded stretchers used for carryin' fishin' nets, same as poor Albert Vallack was a while
      back—but wan way's proper an' t'other 'edn'."
"They'm savin' the money for the feed. Theer's gwaine to be a deal o' clome liftin' at
      Perm's cottage bimebye," said another of the party.
"No honeymoon neither, so I hear tell," added Mrs. Tregenza.
"But Taskes have bought flam-new furniture for his parlor, they sez," declared the former
      speaker.
"Of coorse. Still no honeymoon 'tall! Who ever heard tell of sich a thing nowadays? I wonder
      they ban't 'shamed."
"Less shame, Mrs. Tregenza, than trapsing off to Truro or somewheers an' wastin' their time
      an' spendin' money they'll be wanting back agin 'fore Christmas," retorted Sally, with some
      warmth.
But Mrs. Tregenza only shook her head and sighed.
"You speaks as a onmarried wummon, Sarah; but if you comed to be a bride you'd sing
      dif-fer'nt. No honeymoon's wrong, an' your faither'll tell the same."
Mr. Trevennick admitted that no honeymoon was bad. He went further and declared the omission
      of such an institution to be unprincipled. He even said that had he known of this serious
      defect in the ceremonies he should certainly have abstained from lending the brightness of his
      bunting to them. Then he went to eye the flags from different points of view, while Sally, in
      a minority of one, turned to Joan.
"And what do you say?" she asked. "You'm 'mazin' quiet an' tongue-tied for you. I s'pose
      you'm thinkin' of the time when Joe Noy comes home. I lay you'll have a honeymoon
      anyways."
"Iss, that you may depend 'pon," said Mrs. Tregenza.
And Joan, who had in truth been thinking of her sweetheart's return, grew red, whereat they
      all laughed. But she felt secretly superior to every one of them, for the shrinking process
      began to extend beyond Joe now. A fortnight before, she had been much gratified by allusions
      to the future and felt herself an important individual enough. Then, she must have shared her
      stepmother's pity at the poverty of the pageant which had just passed by. But now the world
      had changed. Matrimony with Joe Noy was not a subject which brought present delight to her,
      but the little bride who had just gone to her wedding filled Joan's thoughts. What was in that
      girl's heart, she greatly wondered. Did Milly Penn feel for long-legged Mark Taskes what Joan
      felt for "Mister Jan"? Was it possible that any other woman had ever experienced similar
      mysterious splendors of mind? She could not tell, but it seemed unlikely to her; it appeared
      improbable that an ordinary man had power to inspire another heart with such golden magic as
      glorified her own.
Presently she departed with her stepmother, whereupon Sally Trevennick relieved her pent-up
      feelings.
"Thank the Lard that chitter-faaced wummon edn' gwaine to the weddin' any ways! Us knaws
      she's a dear good sawl 'nough; but what wi' her sour voice, an' her sour way o' talkin', an'
      her sour 'pinions, she'm enough to set a rat-trap's teeth on edge."
