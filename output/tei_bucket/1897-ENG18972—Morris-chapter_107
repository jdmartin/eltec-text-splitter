 Chapter II ~ Birdalone Taketh Counsel with Her Wood-Mother Concerning the Matter of Sir
      Hugh 
On that same day went Birdalone to the Oak of Tryst and called her wood-mother to her, and
      she came glad and smiling, and kissed and embraced Birdalone, and said unto her: Now I see
      that thou art well content with this last matter I have done for thee, whereas thou art come
      to crave a new gift of me. How knowest thou that? said Birdalone, laughing. Said Habundia:
Wouldst thou have come to me so soon otherwise from out of all that happiness? I have come
      to tell thee of my rede, said Birdalone, and to ask thee if thou art like-minded with me
      thereon. Said the wood-wife: And what is thy rede, my child? Wood-mother, said Birdalone, we
      deem that it were good for us all to go down into Utterhay where I was born, and to take up
      our abode therein.
Said the wood-wife: This rede I praise, and even so would I have counselled you to do; but I
      abided to see if it should come from out of thy breast, and now even so it hath done;
      wherefore I understand thy wisdom and rejoice in thee. And now crave thy boon, my child, and
      thou shalt have it without fail.
Yea, said Birdalone, that will I, and the more that it is a simple one and easy for thee to
      do. Thou knowest that Hugh the Green Knight hath come with my she-friends seeking us all the
      way from under the Green Mountains, and he hath left there goods that he needs must have and
      folk whom he loves; and now he would go back thither, and fetch all that away hither, and see
      to his matters as soon as may be. And I would have thee counsel us what to do, whether to
      build a barque, as perchance we may get it done, and sail the lake therein to the Castle of
      the Quest or thereabout, and thence to ride to his land; or else to take thy guidance and
      safe-conduct through the wood, and to bring his folk back the same way.
Said the wood-wife: As to the way by water, I may help you little therein, and meseemeth
      that way be many traps and wiles and many perils. Wherefore I bid you try it not, but let the
      Green Knight come up hither to this tree tomorrow before noon, all horsed and armed and
      arrayed, and there shall he find three men armed in green gear, horsed well, and leading two
      sumpter-beasts with them; and they shall be his until he giveth them back unto me. But if he
      doubteth any thing betwixt the wood’s end and under the Green Mountains, let him wage what
      folk he will besides, for these my men will have money enough of his with them. But by no
      means let him send them away till he hath done with the wood altogether, both betwixt here and
      the western dwelt-land, and here and Utterhay, save thou be with him. But while these be with
      him, both he and whatsoever money he bringeth shall be sure from all peril whiles they be in
      the wood. Now, my child, was not this the boon thou camest up hither to ask of me?
Yea verily, said Birdalone; yet also I came up hither to praise thee and thank thee and love
      thee. And she threw herself into Habundia’s arms and kissed and caressed her, and Habundia her
      in like wise.
Spake the wood-wife: Thou art the beloved child of my wisdom; and now I see of thee that
      thou wilt be faithful and true and loving unto me unto the end. And I think I can see that
      thou and thy man shall do well and happily in Utterhay; and the Green Knight also and thy
      she-friends. And whatsoever thou wilt of me that I may do for thee or thy friends, ask it
      freely, and freely shalt thou have it. But this I will bid thee, that the while the Green
      Knight shall be gone about his matter, thou shalt come hither to me often; and thy friends
      also thou shalt bring to me, that I may see them and talk to them and love them. And specially
      shalt thou bid Atra unto me; for meseems she is so wise already that I may learn her more
      wisdom, and put that into her heart which may solace her and make her to cease from fretting
      her own heart, and from grief and longing overmuch. And I were fain to reward her in that she
      hath forborne to grudge against thee and to bear thee enmity. For I know, my child, not from
      mine own heart, but from the wisdom I have learned, how hardly the children of Adam may bear
      to have that which they love taken away from them by another, even if they themselves might in
      the long last have wearied of it and cast it away their own selves. Go now, my child, and do
      thy friend to wit what I will do for him.
Therewith they parted, and Birdalone fared home to the house, and found the fellowship of
      them all sitting by the brookside, and talking sweetly together in all joy and hope of what
      their life should be in the new land whereto Birdalone would lead them. Straightway then she
      told them of Hugh and his journey, and how well he should be guarded in the wood both coming
      and going. And they thought that right good, and they thanked her and praised her, and took
      her into their talk, and she sat down by them happily.
