 Chapter XIV ~ Of Birdalone’s Fishing 
Now were the days wearing toward wheat-harvest, and nought befel to tell of, save that on a
      morn the witch-wife called Birdalone to her, and said: Now is little to be done till the wheat
      is ready for the hook, and thy days are idle; or what is that word that fell from thee that
      other day, that there be good swims for fish about the eyots? Canst thou swim across bearing
      thine angle, and back again therewith, and thy catch withal? Yea, certes, said Birdalone
      gaily; with one hand I may swim gallantly, or with my legs alone, if I stir mine arms ever so
      little. I will go straightway if thou wilt, lady; but give me a length of twine so that I may
      tie my catch about my middle when I swim back again.
Therewith she went forth lightly to fetch her angle, which was in a shed without; but just
      as she took it in her hand, a sudden thought came to her, so wary as she was grown. She undid
      the bosom of her gown, and took forth her serpent-ring; for she bore it next to her skin, made
      fast to the bosom of her smock; but now she hid it carefully in the thickest of her brow-hair,
      which was very thick and soft. Withal the tress of Habundia’s hair she bore ever mingled with
      her own.
No sooner had she done it, but she was glad; for she heard the dame calling her, who, when
      she came to the house-door, spake and said: Now shall I fare with thee down to the water, and
      look to thy garments lest they be fouled by some straying beast. And therewith she looked
      curiously on Birdalone, and knit her brows when she saw that the maiden changed countenance in
      nowise.
Down to the water went they, and the witch sat down close to where Birdalone should take the
      water, and watched her do off her raiment, and eyed her keenly when she was bare, but said
      nought. Birdalone turned her head as she stood knee-deep, and said: How long shall I abide,
      lady, if I have luck? As long as thou wilt, said the dame: most like I shall be gone by then
      thou comest back, even if thou be away no long while.
Fell Birdalone to swimming then, and when she was more than half over, the witch, stirring
      no more than need was, got hold of her raiment, which was but the old grey coat over a smock,
      and ransacked it, but found nought, as well ye may wot. And when she had done, she sat down
      again in heavy mood as it seemed, and watched Birdalone swimming, and when she beheld her body
      come forth out of the water, and pass out of sight amongst the flowers of the eyot, she arose
      and went her ways home.
Birdalone looked through the willow-boughs, and saw her turn away; then she fared to her
      fishing with a smile, and soon had plenteous catch from under the willow-boughs. Then, whereas
      the day was very calm and fair, and the dame had given her holiday, she wandered about the
      eyot, and most in a little wood of berry-trees, as quicken and whitebeam and dog-wood, and
      sported with the birds, who feared her not, but came and sat on her shoulders, and crept about
      her feet. She went also and stood a while on the southern shore, and looked on the wide water
      dim in the offing under the hot-weather haze, and longed to be gone beyond it. Then she turned
      away, and to the other shore, and gat her fish and strung them on the string, and made them
      fast to her middle, and so took the water back again to the yellow strand, where now was no
      one awaiting her. But before she did on her garments, she looked on them, and saw that they
      lay not as she had left them, whereby she knew well that the witch-wife had handled them.
Amidst all this the day was wearing to an end, and again she saw the smoke of the
      cooking-fire going up into the air from the chimney of the house; and she smiled ruefully,
      thinking that the witch might yet find an occasion for ransacking her raiment. But she plucked
      up heart, and came home with her catch, and the dame met her with a glum face, and neither
      praised her nor blamed her, but took the fish silently. Such ending had that day.
