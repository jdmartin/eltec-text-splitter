 Chapter XVIII ~ Of Spring-Tide and the Mind of Birdalone 
Now was the winter gone and the spring-tide come again, and with the blossoming of the earth
      blossomed Birdalone also. Nought sweeter of flesh might she be than erst, but there was now a
      new majesty grown into her beauty; her limbs were rounded, her body fulfilled, her skin
      sleeked and whitened; and if any mother’s son had beheld her feet as they trod the meadow
      besprinkled with saffron and daffodil, ill had it gone with him were he gainsaid the kisses of
      them, though for the kissing had he fared the worse belike.
That spring-tide, amidst of April, she followed the witch-wife down to the Sending Boat for
      the third time; and there went everything as erst, and she deemed now that the lesson was well
      learned, and that she was well-nigh as wise as the witch herself therein.
But the day after she went about somewhat pensive, as though a troublous thought were on
      her; and when, three days thereafter, she met the wood-mother, she spake to her even as they
      parted, and said: Mother, much wisdom hast thou learned me, and now this at the last withal,
      that hitherto there has been shame in my life; and now fain were I to be done with it. Fair
      child, said Habundia, little is the shame though this woman hath had the upper hand of thee
      and hath used thee cruelly: how mightest thou, a child, strive with her? But now I see and
      know that there is an end of that; that she feareth thee now, and will never again raise a
      hand against thee save thou fall wholly into her power; as thou shalt not, my child. Be
      comforted then for what is gone by! Nay, mother, said Birdalone, it is not that which
      troubleth me; for, as thou sayest, what else might I do? But thy wisdom which thou hast set in
      my heart hath learned me that for these last months I have been meeting guile with guile and
      lies with lies. And now will I do so no more, lest I become a guileful woman, with nought good
      in me save the fairness of my body. Wherefore hearken, sweet mother! What is done, is done;
      but when it cometh to the day, which is speedily drawing nigh, that I must part from thee, it
      may be for a long while, then will I not fare to the Sending Boat by night and cloud and with
      hidden head, but will walk thither in broad day, and let that befall which must befall.
Changed then Habundia’s face and became haggard and woeful, and she cried out: O if I could
      but weep, as ye children of Adam! O my grief and sorrow! Child, child! then will betide that
      falling into her hands which I spake of e’en now; and then shall this wretch, this servant of
      evil, assuredly slay thee there and then, or will keep thee to torment thee till thy life be
      but a slow death. Nay, nay, do as I should do, and fare with hidden head, and my ring on thy
      finger. Or else, O child, how wilt thou hurt me!
Birdalone wept; but presently she fell to caressing the mother’s hand, and said: This is thy
      doing, wherein thou hast made me wise. Yet fear not: for I deem that the witch-wife will not
      slay me, whereas she looketh to have some gain of me; moreover, in the evil of her heart is
      mingled some love toward me, whereof, as erst I told thee, I have a morsel of compassion.
      Mother, she will not slay me; and I say that she shall not torment me, for I will compel her
      to slay me else. It is my mind that she will let me go. Said the mother: Yea, mayhappen, yet
      but as a bird with a string to its leg. If it be so, said Birdalone, then let my luck prevail
      over her guile; as well it may be, since I have known thee, O wise mother!
The wood-wife hung her head and spake nought for a while; then she said: I see that thou
      wilt have it so, and that there is something in thine heart which we, who are not children of
      Adam, may not understand; yet once wert thou more like unto us. Now all I may say is, that
      thou must rule in this matter, and that I am sad.
Then she looked down again and presently raised a brighter face, and said: Belike all shall
      be better than I thought. Then she kissed Birdalone and they parted for that time.
