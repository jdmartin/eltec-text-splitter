Chapter IX ~ Birdalone Cometh Before the Champions in Her New Array
Now the time was come when Birdalone had all her gear ready, and the women were to abide in
      the castle as her serving-damsels while the Champions were away.
So now in the summer eve, an hour before sunset, Birdalone did on the richest of her new
      raiment, and came into the hall where sat the Three together, and Sir Aymeris with them. She
      was so clad, that she had on a green gown with broidered sleeves, and thereover a white
      cote-hardie welted with gold, and gold-embroidered; on her feet were gold shoon of
      window-work, pearled and gemmed; and on her head a rose garland; on her neck she bore the
      Golden Knight’s collar; her loins were girt with the Black Squire’s girdle; and on her wrist
      was the Green Knight’s ancient gold ring; and she carried in her arms Aurea’s gown and
      Viridis’ shift and Atra’s shoon.
Rather sunrise than sunset it seemed, as verily Birdalone she came into the hall with bright
      eager eyes, and flushed cheeks, and countenance smiling with love. The men stood up all, and
      would come down from the dais to meet her; but she bade them go back, and sit each in his
      place till she stood before them.
Up the hall then she walked, and every step of hers seemed lovelier than the last, till she
      came to them and gave unto each his keepsake, and said: Champions, now is mine errand all
      done, save that tomorrow I must show you the manner of the Sending Boat. Now there is nought
      save the darkness of the coming night to hinder you from this last deal of your Quest; and it
      is I that have brought you to this, and have done this good unto you, if no more good I do in
      the world. Wherefore I pray you to love me ever, and bear me ever in your minds.
They gazed on her, and were overcome by her loveliness and grace, and by the kindness and
      valiancy of her heart. Next arose the Golden Knight, Baudoin to wit, and took a cross from his
      breast, and held it up, and spake: Maiden, thou sayest well, and never shall we forget thee,
      or cease to love thee; and here I swear by God upon the Tree, that it shall be a light thing
      for me to die for thee, if in any need I find thee. Brethren, will ye not swear the same? And
      this is but thy due, maiden, for I declare unto thee, that when thou didst enter the hall e’en
      now, it was as if the very sun of heaven was coming in unto us.
Thereon the other two took the Rood and swore upon it: and Hugh was hushed and meek and
      sad-faced after he had sworn; but Arthur the Black Squire bowed down his head and wept, and
      his fellows marvelled nought thereat, neither did Birdalone; and all her body yearned toward
      him to solace him.
Now turned Sir Baudoin to the castellan and said: Sir Aymeris, I will now swear thee to
      guard this lady as the apple of thine eye whiles we three be away, and therein to spare
      neither thyself nor others. For thou seest well what grief it would be to us if she came to
      any harm.
And to me also, said the castellan. And therewith he swore upon the Rood, and then came
      round the table, and knelt before Birdalone, and kissed her hands.
Thereafter were they all silent a space; and then came Birdalone to the inner side of the
      table and sat betwixt Baudoin and Hugh. But the Black Squire took up the word and spake:
      Birdalone, sweet child, one thing is to be said, to wit, that it were well that thou keep
      within walls while we be away; or at least that thou go but a little beyond the castle, and
      never but within a half bowshot, save thou be well accompanied. For there be men of violence
      dwelling no great way off, reivers and rovers, who would be well pleased to take from us
      anything which we deem dear; besides others who would think the lifting of such a jewel good
      hap indeed. Sir Aymeris, have a care of the Red Knight; and if thou mightest come by a few
      more stout lads, to wage them, it were well.
Birdalone heeded not what the castellan answered, such a shaft of joy went to her heart when
      she heard that friend speak her own name in such wise as he had never done erst, and that
      before them all. She but murmured some yeasay to that which Arthur had spoken unto her, and
      then she held her peace for the sweetness of that moment.
So there they sat and talked a while in dear and pleasant converse; and Hugh fell to asking
      her of her life in the House under the Wood, and she answered all frankly and simply, and the
      more she told the dearer she seemed to them.
Thus drew night in, till folk came flockmeal into the hall; for needs must be feast and
      banquet for triumph of the furtherance of the Quest; and the most of men were merry; but
      somewhat sober were all the three Champions, so that whoso ran might read it in their faces.
      As for Birdalone, she showed cheerful to all that folk which loved her and praised her; but
      inwardly sorrow had come home to her heart.
