Chapter XV ~ Birdalone Lacketh Little of Drowning, But Cometh Latterly to the Green Eyot
On swam Birdalone, not as one who had a mind to drown her for the forgetting of troubles,
      but both strongly and wisely; and she turned over on to her back, and looked on the stars
      above her, and steered herself by them thitherward whereas she deemed was the land under the
      wood. When she had been gone from the evil isle for an hour or so, there rose a fair little
      wind behind her, which helped her forward, but scarce raised the water more than a little
      ripple.
Still she swam on, and it was some three hours she began to weary, and then she floated on
      her back and let the wind and water have its way with her; and now the night was as dark as it
      would be ere dawn.
Thus it went for another hour, that whiles she swam on and whiles she floated; and now her
      heart began to fail her, and the great water was no longer unto her a wet highway, but a
      terrible gulf over which she hung fainting.
Nevertheless she did not give up doing what she might: she floated supine a long while, and
      then, when she had gathered a little strength, turned over again and struck out, still
      steering her by the stars. But she had scarce made three strokes ere her arms met something
      hard and rough; and at first in her forlornness she deemed she had happened on some dread
      water monster, and for terror of it she sank down into the deep, but came up presently blinded
      and breathless, and spread abroad her arms, and again they came on the thing aforesaid, and
      this time found that it was nought alive, but the bole of a tree sitting high out of the
      water. So she clomb up on to it with what might she had left, and sat her down, and saw in the
      dim light that it was big, and that there was a fork betwixt two limbs reaching up into the
      air, and she thrust herself in between these two limbs and embraced one of them, so that she
      might scarce tumble off; and a great content and happiness came over her that she had thus
      escaped from the death of the deep; but therewithal weariness overcame her, and she slept,
      whether she would or not; and the bole went on over the waters no slower than might have been
      looked for, whether it were by the pushing on of the south wind, or by the hand of Weird that
      would not have her die.
Long she slumbered, for when she awoke it was broad day and the sun was shining high in the
      heavens, and she cleared her eyes and looked around, and saw before her the land, but yet blue
      in the offing. And the tree-bole was yet speeding on towards the shore, as if it were being
      drawn there by some bidding of might.
Now indeed grew Birdalone happy, and she thought if any had helped her it must have been the
      wood-mother once again; and she said to herself that she should soon meet with that helper;
      nor heeded she that she was naked and unfurnished of any goods, whereas she deemed indeed that
      it was but to ask and have of her friend.
For a while indeed she knew not whither she was wending, and if her face were verily turned
      toward the land under the wood; but as the morning wore the blue distance began to grow green,
      and then she saw that a great wood was indeed before her, and thereafter, as it cleared yet
      more, she knew the land she was nearing for the meadows of the House under the Wood, and it
      was not long thence ere she saw clear and close Green Eyot and Rocky Eyot, though the house
      was yet hidden from her by the green shores of the first of those two isles.
Shortly to tell it, her tree-bole floated with her past the outer ness of Green Eyot, and
      came ashore in that same sandy bight where erst she was wonted to make her body ready for the
      water. She stepped ashore all glad to feel the firm warm sand underneath her foot-soles, and
      as one drunk with joy she was when the tall flowery grass of the latter May was caressing her
      legs as they shook the seed-dust off the bents, and smote the fragrance out of the blossoms;
      and she might scarce at first lift her eyes from their familiar loveliness. Glad she was
      indeed, but exceeding worn and weary with the long voyage, and all the longing and fear and
      hope which had encompassed her that while. She lifted up her eyes but once, and saw the
      witchâ€™s house standing where it was wont, but no shape of man moving about it; then she turned
      aside to a little brake of thorn and eglantine in the meadow hard by, and laid her down on the
      grass in the shade thereof, and almost before her head touched the ground she fell asleep, and
      slept there long and peacefully.
