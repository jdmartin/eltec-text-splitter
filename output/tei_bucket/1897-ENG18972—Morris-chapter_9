 Chapter IX ~ Of Birdaloneâ€™s Swimming 
Full fair was the morrow morn, and Birdalone arose betimes before the sun was up, and she
      thought she would make of this a holiday before the swink afield began again, since the witch
      was grown good toward her. So she did on her fair shoes, and her new raiment, though the green
      gown was not fully done, and said to herself that she would consider what she would do with
      her holiday when she was amidst of her bathing.
So she went down to the water-side, and when she was standing knee-deep in the little sandy
      bight aforesaid, she looked over to Green Eyot, and was minded to swim over thither, as oft
      she did. And it was a windless dawn after a hot night, and a light mist lay upon the face of
      the water, and above it rose the greenery of the eyot.
She pushed off into the deep and swam strongly through the still water, and the sun rose
      while she was on the way, and by then she had laid a hand on the willow-twigs of the eyot, was
      sending a long beam across the waters; and her wet shoulders rose up into the path of it and
      were turned into ruddy gold. She hoisted herself up, and climbing the low bank, was standing
      amongst the meadow-sweet, and dripping on to its fragrance. Then she turned about to the green
      plain and the house and the hedge of woodland beyond, and sighed, and said softly: A pity of
      it, to leave it! If it were no better otherwhere, and not so fair?
Then she turned inward to the eyot, which had done her nought but good, and which she loved;
      and she unbound her hair, and let it fall till the ends of the tresses mingled with the heads
      of the meadow-sweet, and thereafter walked quietly up into the grassy middle of the isle.
She was wont to go to a knoll there where the grass was fine, and flowery at this time with
      white clover and dog violet, and lie down under the shade of a big thorn with a much-twisted
      bole: but today some thought came across her, and she turned before she came to the thorn, and
      went straight over the eyot (which was but a furlong over at that place) and down to the
      southward-looking shore thereof. There she let herself softly down into the water and thrust
      off without more ado, and swam on and on till she had gone a long way. Then she communed with
      herself, and found that she was thinking: If I might only swim all the water and be free.
And still she swam on: and now a light wind had been drawn up from the west, and was driving
      a little ripple athwart the lake, and she swam the swiftlier for it awhile, but then turned
      over on her back and floated southward still. Till on a sudden, as she lay looking up toward
      the far-away blue sky, and she so little and low on the face of the waters, and the lake so
      deep beneath her, and the wind coming ever fresher from the west, and the ripple rising higher
      against her, a terror fell upon her, and she longed for the green earth and its well-wrought
      little blossoms and leaves and grass; then she turned over again and swam straight for the
      eyot, which now was but a little green heap far away before her.
Long she was ere she made land there, and the sun was high in the heavens when she came, all
      spent and weary, to the shadow of the hawthorn-tree; and she cast herself down there and fell
      asleep straightway. Forsooth her swim was about as much as she had might for.
When she awoke it lacked but an hour of noon-tide, and she felt the life in her and was
      happy, but had no will to rise up for a while; for it was ajoy to her to turn her head this
      way and that to the dear and dainty flowers, that made the wide, grey, empty lake seem so far
      away, and no more to be dealt with than the very sky itself.
At last she arose, and when she had plucked and eaten some handfuls of the strawberries
      which grew plenteously on the sweet ground of the eyot, she went down to the landward-looking
      shore, and took the water, and swam slowly across the warm ripple till she came once more to
      the strand and her raiment. She clad herself, and set her hand to her pouch and drew forth
      bread, and sat eating it on the bank above the smooth sand. Then she looked around, and stood
      up with her face toward the house, to see if the dame would call to her. But she saw the witch
      come out of the porch and stand there looking under the sharp of her hand toward her, and
      thereafter she went back again into the house without giving any sign. Wherefore Birdalone
      deemed that she had leave that day, and that she might take yet more holiday; so she stepped
      lightly down from her place of vantage, turned her face toward the east, and went quietly
      along the very lip of the water.
