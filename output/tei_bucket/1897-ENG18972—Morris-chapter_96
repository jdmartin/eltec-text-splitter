Chapter XXIV ~ The Wood-Mother Changeth Her Form to That of A Woman Stricken in Years
When the morrow came, there yet lay Arthur sleeping peacefully, and Birdalone awoke from the
      slumber which had at last fallen on her, and looked about her and saw not Habundia in the
      cave; so she arose and bent over Arthur and kissed him, and so went forth and stood in the
      door and looked about her. And she was still dim-eyed with her just departed slumber and the
      brightness of the morning sunlight, and she scarce knew whether it were a part of a dream, or
      a sight that was verily before her, that she seemed to see one coming across the brook toward
      her, stepping heedfully from stone to stone thereof: a woman stricken in years, but slim and
      trim and upright, clad in a gown of green cloth, with a tippet of some white fur. When she was
      come on to the greensward she spake to Birdalone in a sweet voice, but thin with eld, and gave
      her the sele of the day; and Birdalone was somewhat afraid to see a newcomer, but she greeted
      her, drawing back a little from her shyly. But the old woman said: What maketh thee here, my
      daughter? Dost thou not know that this is my land and my house, and that I am said not to be
      unmighty in these woods?
I pray thee pardon me if I have done amiss, said Birdalone; but here have I a sick friend, a
      young man, and I would pray thee suffer him to abide here in this cave a little longer; for
      there hath been also another friend, a woman, but she hath gone out while I slept, belike to
      gather simples, for she is wise in leechcraft, and is tending the sick man. I pray thee humbly
      to suffer us lest we lose our friend.
As she spake, she heard the carline chuckle softly, and at last she said: Why, Birdalone, my
      dear, dost thou not know me after all these years? Look on me again, look! and thou shalt see
      that I am not so much changed from what thou sawest me last night. I am still thine image, my
      dear, only I was the image of what thou wert, and now I the image of what thou shalt be when
      two score years and ten of happy life have worn for thee. Tell me, am I now aught like to thy
      mother in the flesh?
How hast thou frighted me, mother, said Birdalone; I thought that my friend had forsaken me,
      and that perchance the new-comer was another witch like unto the old one, and that I was never
      to be at rest and happy. But as to my mother in the flesh, nay, thou art not now wholly like
      unto her; and sooth to say I shall be fainer when thou hast thine own shape of me young back
      again, for I love thee not so much as now thou art.
The wood-wife laughed: Well, she said, thou shalt not see over-much of me in this shape; and
      that the less because of something I shall now tell thee, to wit, that I have been thinking
      the matter over, and I would have thee leave us twain together alone before the young man
      awaketh. I would have thee get thee home and abide him there; it shall not be long I promise
      thee; and this also, that he shall come home to thee sound in body and whole in limb.
Birdalone’s countenance fell, and she said: Why this second mind, mother? why, I pray thee?
      Said Habundia: I fear for thy love lest he be not strong enough to open his eyes upon thy
      face; but after he hath been a day in the woods, and I have spoken to him diversely and
      cheered him with the hope of meeting thee, he may well be strong enough to seek thee for a
      mile’s length, and find thine house first and then thee. So now wilt thou obey me? Nay, if
      thou must needs weep, I will be gone into the thicket till thou hast done, thou wilful!
      Birdalone smiled through her tears, and said: I pray thee pardon my wilfulness, mother, and I
      will depart without turning back into the cave. Nay, said Habundia, there is no need for so
      much haste as that: I will in now, and do my leechdoms with the sick man. But do thou go
      across the stream, thou barefoot, and thou wilt find on the other side, by the foot of the
      quicken-tree yonder, honeycombs and white bread and a bicker of wild goats’ milk. Bathe thee
      then if thou wilt, and bring those matters over hither; and then shalt thou go in and kiss thy
      mate’s sick face with thy fresh one, and thereafter shall we sit here by the ripple of the
      water and break our fast; and lastly, thou shalt go in and kiss again and then take to the
      road. But tell me, deemest thou surely that thou canst find it again? Yea, surely, mother,
      said Birdalone; I am wood-woman enough for that; and now I will do all thy will. And therewith
      she stepped out lightly on to the greensward and sought up the stream till she found a
      smooth-grounded pool meet for her bath, and when that was done, she fetched the victual and
      came back to the wood-wife; then they two sat down together, and ate and drank while the water
      rippled at their feet. But when they were done, Birdalone gat her into the cave again, and
      kissed the sleeping man fondly, and came forth lightly and stood a moment before the
      wood-wife, and said: Tell me this at least, mother, when shall he be there? To-morrow quoth
      the wood-wife; and, for my part, I would keep thee within doors and abide him there, lest
      there be trouble; for he may not yet be as strong as the strongest. Birdalone hung down her
      head and answered not, but said presently: Farewell, wood-mother, and be thou blessed. Then
      she took up her bow and betook her lightly to the woodland way, and the wood-wife stood
      looking at her till the thicket had hidden her, and then turned back and went into the
      cave.
