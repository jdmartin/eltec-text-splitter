Chapter XXVII ~ Sir Arthur Cometh to the House Under the Wood
So came Arthur into the meadows, and went eagerly but warily over the dewy grass. And here
      and there a cow rose before him and went bundling down the mead a little way, and the owls
      cried out from behind him, and a fox barked from the thicket’s edge. Then he found himself on
      the stream-side, and he stayed and looked from side to side, and lo! on the other side of the
      stream a little house that looked familiar to him as a yeoman’s dwelling in the builded lands,
      and the thatch thereon shone under the moon and its windows were yellow with candle-light; and
      so homely it seemed to him, that he thrust his sword into the sheath and lightly crossed the
      brook, and came to the door and laid his hand upon the latch and lifted it and shoved the
      door, and all was open before him.
His eyes, coming from the night, dazzled with the bright light of the candles, but he saw a
      fair woman rising up in her place, and he said: May a traveller in the woodland be welcome
      here to-night, dealing with all in all honour?
But the woman came toward him holding out her two hands, and ere he could cry out that he
      knew her, she had thrown herself upon him, and had cast her arms about him and was kissing his
      face, and murmuring: O welcome indeed! welcome, welcome, and welcome! And so sore did his past
      grief and his desire move him, that he was weak before her, and held down his hands and let
      her do. And both those were breathless with wonder and joy and longing; and they stood aloof a
      little in a while and looked on each other, she with heaving bosom and streaming eyes, and he
      with arms stretched forth and lips that strove with his heart’s words and might not utter
      them; but once more she gave herself to him, and he took her in his arms strongly now, so that
      she was frail and weak before him, and he laid his cheek to her cheek and his lips to her
      lips, and kissed her eyes and her shoulders and murmured over her. And then again they stood
      apart, and she took him by the hand and led him to the settle, and set him down by her, and
      herself by him; and a while they said nought. Then she spake as one who had come to herself
      and was calm, though her heart was aflame for love: Tell me, love, when thine hand was on the
      latch didst thou look to find me here in this house? for thine hand it was that waked me; I
      heard not thy foot before the threshold, for I was weary and slumbering. Alas! that I lost the
      sound of thy feet! He spake, and his voice sounded false unto him, as if it came from
      another’s mouth: I wot not; the woman that led me nearby seemed to bid me hope. Then he said:
      Nay, the sooth is that I should have died if I had not found thee here; I have been sick so
      long with hoping.
Again were they silent till she said: I would that I had heard thee crossing the brook. But
      the wood-wife bade me look for thee no earlier than tomorrow; else had I time enough; and I
      would have made the house trim with the new green boughs, and dighted our bed with rose
      blooms; and I would have done on me my shining gown that the wood-wife gave me. For indeed she
      was but clad in her scanty smock and nought else.
But he laid his head on her bosom and kissed her all about, and said: Nay, my own love, it
      is well, it is better. And she murmured over him: O friend, my dear, think not that I had will
      to hide me from thee. All that is here of me is thine, and thine, and thine.
And she took his hand and they arose together, and she said: O friend, I fled from thee once
      and left thee lonely of me because I deemed need drave me to it; and I feared the strife of
      friends, and confusion and tangle. Now if thou wilt avenge thee on me thou mayest, for I am in
      thy power. Yet will I ask thee what need will drive thee to leave me lonely?
He said: The need of death. But she said: Mayhappen we shall lie together then, as here
      to-night we shall lie.
