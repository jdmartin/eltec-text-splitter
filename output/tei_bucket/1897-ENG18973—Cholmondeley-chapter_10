CHAPTER X.

“Pour connaître il faut savoir ignorer.”—Amiel.
“Doll,” said Mr. Loftus, the morning after the ball, when all the guests had departed, except
     the Pierpoints, “I do not expect absolute perfection in my fellow-creatures, but it appeared to
     me that you fell rather below your usual near approach to it last night. What do you
     think?”
Doll answered nothing.
“You see,” went on Mr. Loftus, “after twelve o“clock, when everyone unmasked, was the time
     when I should naturally have introduced Sibyl to many of our friends
      and neighbours, as this was her first public appearance since her marriage, and I
     could not do so on our arrival. The fact that she had left the house without me, and—without my
     knowledge—was unfortunate.”
It had been more than unfortunate in reality. Mr. Loftus, whose marriage had made a great
     sensation in his own county, had been begged on all sides, as soon as the masks were off, to
     introduce his wife, and, though he had not shown any surprise at her non-appearance and Doll's,
     he had at last been obliged to retire to the men's cloak-room and wait there till his carriage
     came, so as to obscure the fact that she had departed without him. He had been annoyed at what
     he took to be Doll's heedlessness of appearances.
“She felt ill, and wished to go home,”
      said Doll, reddening, and not perceiving that he was offering an explanation
     which did not cover the ground. He would have been perfectly satisfied with it himself.
“I greatly fear that she is ill,” said Mr. Loftus; “but she was quite well when she
     went to the ball last night. She is very delicate and excitable. Is it possible that anything
     occurred to upset her?”
Mr. Loftus fixed his keen steel-gray eyes on Doll. He had seen, as he saw everything, Doll's
     momentary jealousy of him the evening before.
For the life of him Doll could not think what to say. It seemed impossible to tell Mr. Loftus
     the truth, and he had but little of that inventive talent which envious persons with a small
     vocabulary call lying. That little had been used up the night
      before. Yet, perhaps, if he had been aware that Mr. Loftus had seen him with
     Sibyl in the gallery in an attitude which allowed of but few interpretations, his slow mind
     might have grasped the nettly fact that he must explain.
Mr. Loftus waited.
“My boy,” he said at last, “I am not only Sibyl's husband”—he saw Doll wince—“but I am also,
     I verily believe, her best friend.”
There was no answer.
A slight, almost imperceptible, change came over Mr. Loftus's face. He paused a moment, and
     then went on quietly:
“Sibyl is most generous about money—too generous. I am almost afraid of taking an unfair
     advantage of it, though she presses me to do so. But I am pushing on the repairs everywhere;
     and I am re
     building Greenfields and Springlands from the ground. They will get to work again
     directly the frost is over. I have the plans here, if you would like to look at them.”
He drew a roll out of the writing-table drawer, and spread it on the table. Doll perceived
     with intense relief that the subject was dropped, and he knew Mr. Loftus well enough to be
     certain that it would never under any circumstances be reopened. But as he looked at the plans,
     and Mr. Loftus pointed out the new well and the various advantages of the designs, it dawned
     upon Doll's consciousness that he was losing something which he had always regarded as a secure
     possession, and which nothing could replace—Mr. Loftus's confidence.
He had seen it withdrawn in this gentle
      fashion from other people, who did not find out for years afterwards that it was
     irrevocably gone. And he became aware that he could not bear to lose it.
“Here,” said Mr. Loftus, putting on his silver-rimmed pince-nez, “is, or ought to be, the new
     private road leading out on to the H—— highroad. I decided to make it, Doll, not only for the
     convenience of the farm, but also because I cannot let that row of cottages with any certainty
     until there is an easier means of access to them. My father always intended to make a road
     there. I only hope,” he said at last, letting the map fly back into a roll, “that I shall live
     to pay for all I am doing, but I can't pay for unfinished contracts. If I don't, Doll, you will
     have to raise a mortgage on the property to pay for the actual improvements on it. Sibyl has
     left all her
      fortune to me, I believe; but as I am certain to go first, Wilderleigh will not
     be the gainer.”
And it passed through Mr. Loftus's mind for the first time that perhaps, after all, Sibyl
     might still marry Doll some day. How he had once wished for that marriage he remembered with a
     sigh.
“It may be. Youth turns to youth,” said Mr. Loftus to himself, as he went up to his wife's
     room after Doll had left.
Sibyl was ill. A chill, or a shock, or excitement—who shall say which?—had just touched the
     delicate balance of her health and overset it. It toppled over suddenly without warning,
     without any of the preliminary struggles by which a strong constitution or a strong will staves
     off the advance of illness. She gave way entirely and at once, and the night after
      the night of the ball it would have been difficult to recognise, in the sunk,
     colourless face and motionless figure, the brilliant, lovely young girl in her little diamond
     crown.
Sibyl's illness did not prove dangerous, but it was long. Lady Pierpoint, who had nursed her
     before, sent her daughters home, and took her place again by the bedside, with the infinite
     patience which she had learned in helping her husband down the valley towards the death which
     at last became the one goal of all their longing, and which had receded before them with every
     toiling step towards it, till they had both wept together because he could not, could not die.
     Perhaps it was because her husband had gone through the slow mill of consumption that Lady
     Pierpoint's heart had so much tenderness for Sibyl,
      for whom only a year ago she had dreaded the same fate.
Mr. Loftus had the nervous horror of, and repugnance to, every form of illness which as often
     accompanies a refined and sympathetic nature as it does an obtuse and selfish one. And his
     lonely existence had not brought him into contact with that inevitable side of domestic life.
     He was extraordinarily ignorant about it, and his natural impulse was to avoid it.
But he stood by his wife's bedside, adjusted his pince-nez, and accepted the situation. For
     many days Sibyl would take nothing unless given it by himself, would rouse herself for no voice
     but his. Lady Pierpoint marvelled to see him come into Sibyl's room at night in his long gray
     dressing-gown, to administer the food or medicine which the nurse put into his
      hand. His patience and his kindness did not flag, but it seemed to Lady Pierpoint
     as if at this eleventh hour they should not have been demanded of him; and it wounded her—why,
     it would be hard to say—to watch him do for Sibyl with painstaking care the little things which
     in her own youth her young husband had done for her, the little things which in wedded life are
     the great things.
Mr. Loftus sometimes made a mistake, and once he forgot that he was married, and was found
     pacing in the rose-garden oblivious of everything except a political crisis—but only once. He
     was faithful in that which is least.
Lady Pierpoint felt with a twinge of conscience that when she had endeavoured to bring about
     this marriage she had been
      selfishly engrossed in Sibyl's welfare. She had not thought enough of his.
And gradually Sibyl recovered, and went about the house again, wan and feeble, and Lady
     Pierpoint left Wilderleigh.
