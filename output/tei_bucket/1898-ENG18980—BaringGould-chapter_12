CHAPTER XII.THE FALL OF THE VEILS.
 Lucius and Domitia stepped out of the boat; he moored it to the side, and they walked
      together to the little temple. This was not one to which a college of priests was attached,
      nor even an ædiculum, with a guardian who had charge of it, to open it on special festivals;
      it had been erected by the father of Corbulo in deference to the wish of his wife, who had
      taken it into her head to become a votary of Isis, this having become a fashionable cult. But
      on her death the doors had been closed, and it had fallen into neglect, till the return of
      Longa Duilia from the East with the Chaldee Magus from Antioch. It was now fashionable to
      dabble in sorcery, and a distinguished lady liked to be able to talk of her Magus, to seek his
      advice, and, at table, air a superficial familiarity with the stars, and the Powers and Æons,
      the endless genealogies of emanations from the primæval and eternal Light. 
 Longa had engaged the Magus when at Antioch, but when somewhat summarily sent to Europe by
      her husband, she had not taken her Chaldæan magician with her. As, however, she had no wish to
      appear in Rome without him, she had laid it on her husband when he returned to bring the man
      with him, and if he did not return himself, to despatch the Magus to her. 

 On her arrival in the villa at Gabii, she had given up the temple of Isis to Elymas, and he
      had converted it into a place for study. 
 Before the door hung a heavy curtain, and this Lamia raised to allow Domitia to pass
      within. The interior would have been wholly dark, but that a brazier with glowing charcoal
      stood within, and into the fire the magician threw gums, that flamed up and diffused a
      fragrant smoke. 
 By the flicker Domitia observed that a bed was laid above a small fissure in the marble
      floor—a rent caused by earthquake—through which vapor of an intoxicating nature issued. 
 On this bed lay a woman, or rather a figure that Domitia took to be that of a woman, but it
      was covered with much drapery that concealed face and hands. 
 The brazier was near the head, and by it stood Elymas in a tall headdress, with horns
      affixed, that met in front. He wore a black garment reaching to the feet. 
 In the darkness nothing could be seen save his erect figure, and face shining out like a
      lamp, when he cast resinous drops on the fire, and the motionless couched form of the woman. 
 Domitia, somewhat frightened, put her hand on the arm of Lamia, to make sure that he was
      present and could assist her, should need for assistance arise;—that is to say, should her
      courage fail, or the visions she expected to see prove too alarming. 
 Then the Magus said: 
 “As I have told thee, lady, out of the ineffable Light stream rays that are both luminous
      and life-producing. These rays penetrate to the lowest profundity of
      matter, and as they pass through the higher atmospheres, gather about them the
      particles of vapor, and become angels and demons. But other rays passing further down, and
      assuming grosser envelopes, become men and women, some more animal than others, some with
      higher spiritual natures than the rest, according as in them matter or spirit dominates. And
      the rays darting into further depths become the beasts of the field, the fishes of the sea,
      even the very worm that bores in the soil. As thou knowest, he who stands on a high mountain
      can see far horizons to right and to left as well as the objects below him. So, to the
      Eternal, all is visible, the past on one side, the present before Him, and the future on the
      other side, all in one vision. To Him there is no past, and no present, and no future, for
      Time is not—all is comprehended in one view. But we, who are below, see only the present,
      remember the past, and conjecture what is future. If we would see future as well as past, we
      must rise above matter, mount from our base level to the altitude of spirit. Thence all is
      clear. But this is not possible to all, only to those elect ones in whom the flesh is subdued,
      and to it the spirit remains attached only by a fibre. Such is Helena. Through her thou shalt
      see what thou desirest. Now behold!” 
 He pointed into the darkness before him, and both Domitia and Lucius saw a spark that grew
      in intensity and shone like a star. 
 “That,” said Elymas, “is a crystal. It is the lens through which the rays of the Eternal
      and Immortal Light pass to the soul of Helena, out of Infinite Altitude and Illimitable Space.
      She is enveloped in seven veils. Now she lieth in a trance, and seeth naught.
      But I will invoke this Fount of Life and Light and Knowledge, and will gather the
      rays together into her soul through yonder crystal, and she will see in vision what thou
      desirest. Seven veils cover her, and seven are the revelations that will be made. I cannot
      assure thee that all will be future—some may be scenes of the past, for to the All-Seeing, the
      Eye of Eternity, there is neither past nor future; all is present.” 
 “Well, so be it,” said Lamia, “By the past we can judge the future. Let us see things that
      have been and we can form some notion of what is shown us as future. If the one be incorrect,
      then the other is untrustworthy.” 
 “Thou shalt behold nothing,” said the Magus, “for it is not thou who consultest me, but the
      lady Domitia Longina.” 
 “How shall I see, and not he who stands beside me?” asked the girl. Her heart fluttered
      with apprehension. 
 The sorcerer stooped, and drew from under the covering the right hand of the prostrate
      woman, and bade Domitia hold it. 
 She took the hand in hers; it was stiff and cold as that of a corpse, and she shuddered. 
 “Hold her hand in thine,” said Elymas, “and I will invoke the Source of Spirits, and as I
      withdraw each veil that covers her face, she will see something, and she seeing it, the sense
      of sight will pass through her hand to thee, and thou wilt see also, inwardly, yet very
      really. Only let not go her hand, or all will become dark.” 
 Then he went before the crystal, that stood on an altar like a truncated column; and he
      uttered words rapidly in a strange tongue, then turned, threw a hand
      ful of spices upon the coals, and a dense aromatic smoke filled the interior. It
      dissipated, and Domitia uttered a faint cry.

 “What ails thee?” asked Lucius. 
 Thinking she was frightened, he added—“Let us go forth. This is mere jugglery.” 
 “But I see,” she said in tremulous tones. 
 “What dost thou see?” 
 “O Lucius! It is the garden at Cenchræa—and my father! O, my father!” she sobbed. 
 One veil had been withdrawn. 
 “Enough,” said Lucius. “I think naught of this: every one is aware how the noble Cnæus
      Corbulo came by his death.” 
 “Then see again,” said the Magus. He took hold of a second veil that covered the prostrate
      woman, drew it off, and let it fall on the ground. 
 Lucius felt the left hand of Domitia contract suddenly on his arm. He looked before him,
      but saw nothing save the crystal, in which moved lights. It was iridescent as an opal. 
 Then Domitia exclaimed: 
 “It was he! the physician Luke—who cut the thong. But for him, we should have run down the
      Imperial trireme. He did it!” 
 “What mean you?” asked the young man in surprise. 
 “Lucius, I see it all—the sea, the vessel on which is Nero carousing;—ourselves—we are
      running at her. And he has cut the thong, the paddle flies up, and our course is altered.” 
 Then the Magus uttered a few words, and withdrew the third veil. 

 The young man heard his companion breathing heavily; but she said nothing. He waited awhile
      and then, stooping to her, asked: 
 “Seest thou aught?” 
 “Yes,” she answered in a whisper. “Yet not with my bodily eyes, I know not how—but I see—” 
 “What?” 
 “The end of Nero. Now thou hast thrown the mantle over his face—enough!” 
 Then Elymas turned and said: 
 “Hitherto thou hast beheld that which is past. Sufficeth it? or wilt thou even look into
      that which is to be?” 
 “It sufficeth,” said Lucius, and would have drawn his companion away. But she held to the
      hand of the woman on the bed, and said firmly: 
 “No, my friend. Now I have seen things that are past, I will even look into the future. It
      was for this I came hither.” 
 And now again did the magician utter prayers, and wave his hands. Thereupon strange lights
      and changes appeared in the crystal, and it seemed of milky moonlight hue, yet with shoots as
      of lightning traversing it. All at once the Magus took off the fourth veil and cast it on the
      marble floor. 
 Lucius remained motionless, looking at the changing light in the crystal, and feeling the
      nervous hand of Domitia twitching on his arm. He thought that he heard her laugh, but almost
      immediately with a cry, she loosed her hand from the unconscious woman on the couch, threw her
      arms round the neck of Lamia, and sank sobbing on his breast. 
 It was some time before she was sufficiently re
      covered to speak, and then was reluctant to disclose what she had seen. Lucius,
      however, urged her with gentle persuasion, and, clinging to him, between sobs, in whispers she
      confided: 
 “Oh, Lucius! I thought—I—I saw that the day had come when you and I—Lucius, when I went to
      your house and was lifted across the threshold, and then, as I stretched my hands to you and
      took yours—then, all at once, a red face came up behind—whence I know not—and two long hands
      thrust us apart. Then I let go—I let go—and—and I saw no more.” 
 “When that day comes, my Domitia, no hands shall divide us, no face be thrust between. Now
      come forth. You have seen enough.” 
 “Nay, I will look to the end.” She took the hand of Helena, into which some flexibility and
      warmth were returning. 
 “Art thou willing?” asked the Magus. 
 She nodded, and the fifth veil fell. 
 For full five minutes Domitia stood rigid, without moving a muscle, hardly breathing. 
 Then Lucius said: 
 “See what a purple light shines out of the crystal. What is thy vision now, Domitia? By the
      light that beams, it should be right royal.” 
 “It is royal,” she said in faint tones. “Lucius! what that Christian prophet spoke, that
      have I also seen—the beast with seven heads, one wounded to the death, and there cometh up
      another out of the deadly wound, and—it hath the red face I saw but just now. And it climbeth
      to a throne and lifteth me up to sit thereon. Away with the vision. It offendeth me. It maketh
      my blood turn ice cold!” 

 “Hast thou a desire to see further?” asked the Magus. 
 “I can see naught worse than this,” said Domitia. 
 A shudder ran through her, and her teeth chattered as with frost. 
 Then Elymas again waved his hands, and chanted, “Askion, Kataskion, lix, Tetras,
      damnameneus,” and raised and cast down the sixth veil. 
 At once from the crystal a red light shone forth, and suffused the whole cell of the temple
      with a blood-colored illumination, and by it Lucius could see that there was in it no image
      present, only a dense black veil behind the altar on which the stone glowed like a carbuncle.
      He heard the breath pass through the teeth of Domitia, like the hissing of a serpent. He
      looked at her, her face was terrible, inflamed. The eyes stiffened, the teeth were set, the
      brow knitted and lowering. Then she said: 
 “I stand on the beast, and the sword of my father pierces his heart.” 
 Lucius wondered; there was a look of hate, a hideousness in her face, such as he had not
      conceived it possible so beautiful and sweet a countenance could have assumed. 
 Then Elymas cast off the last veil. 
 For a moment all was darkness. The red light in the crystal had expired. In stillness and
      suspense, not without fear, all waited, all standing save Helena, who had recovered from her
      trance, and she paused expectant on her couch. 
 Then a minute spark appeared in the crystal, of the purest white light, that grew, rapidly
      sending out wave on wave of brilliance, so intense, so splendid, so daz
      zling, that the magician, unable to endure the effulgence, turned and threw
      himself into a corner, and wrapped his head about with his mantle. And the medium turned with
      a cry, as though the light caused her physical pain, buried her face in the pillow, and groped
      on the floor for the veils to cast over her head to exclude the light. 
 Lucius, unable to endure the splendor, covered his eyes with his palm. 
 But Domitia looked at it, and her face grew soft, the scowl went from her brow, and a
      wondrous tenderness and sorrow came into her eyes; great tears rose and rolled down her
      cheeks, and glittered like diamonds in the dazzling beam. 
 Then she said with a sob: 
 “Ubi lux—ibi Felicitas.” 
 Suddenly an explosion. The orb was shattered into a thousand sparks, and all was black
      again in the temple—black as deepest night. 
 Then Lucius caught Domitia to him, put his hand behind him, drew back the curtain, and
      carried her forth into the calm evening air, and the light of the aurora hanging over the
      setting sun. 
 She sobbed, gradually recovered herself, drew a profound sigh, and said: 
 “Oh, Lucius! where is light, there is felicity!”
