CHAPTER X.THE ACCURSED FIELD.
 No notice was taken by Domitian of the presence in the palace of the murdered actor’s
      widow. It concerned him in no way, and he allowed the unfortunate woman to remain there, under
      the care of his wife, and without making any protest. 
 Domitia found an interest and a delight in the society of the paralyzed woman, so simple in
      mind, gentle in thought, always cheerful, ever serene, who lived in an atmosphere of love and
      harbored no resentments. 
 She marvelled at what she saw, but it was to her an unattainable condition. Her own
      affections were seared, and a gnawing hate against the man who had blighted her life, and to
      whom she was tied, ever consumed her. 
 She was like a dead plant in the midst of spring vegetation. It looks down on the beautiful
      life about its feet, but itself puts forth no buds, shows no signs of mounting sap. 
 Every now and then Glyceria approached the topic of the Fish, and the mysteries involved in
      the symbol, but would not disclose them, for she saw that Domitia, however miserable she felt,
      however hopeless, was not in a frame of mind to receive and welcome the interpretation. For in
      her, the one dominating passion was
      hate—a desire to have her wrongs revenged, and a chafing at her powerlessness to
      do anything to revenge them. 
 Her treatment by Domitian was capricious. At one time he neglected her; then he went
      sometimes out of his way to offer her a slight; at others he made real efforts to heal the
      breach between them, and to show her that he loved her still. 
 But he met with not merely a frosty but a contemptuous reception, that sent him away, his
      vanity hurt, and his blood in a ferment. 
 In her indifference to life, she was able to brave him without fear, and he knew that if he
      ordered her to execution she would hail death as a welcome means of escape from association
      with himself. 
 His blundering and brutal tyranny was no match for her keen wit cutting into him, and
      maddening him. He revenged himself by a coarse insult or by a side blow at her friends. She
      was without ambition. Many a woman would have endured his treatment without repining, for the
      sake of the splendor with which she could surround herself, and the towering position which
      she occupied. But neither had any attraction for Domitia. The one thing she did desire, to be
      left alone in retirement, in the country, that he could not, he would not accord her. 
 Usually, when he was in his splendid villa at Albanum, she elected to remain in Rome, and
      when he came to the palace on the Palatine, if permitted, she escaped to Albanum; but he would
      not always suffer this. 
 Thus a wretched life was dragged on, and the heart of Domitia became harder every day. It
      would have become as adamant but for the presence of Glyceria,
      whom the Empress sincerely loved, and who exercised a subtle, softening and
      purifying influence on the princess. 
 Glyceria saw how the Empress suffered, and she pitied her, saw how hopeless the conditions
      were for improvement; she saw also what was hidden to other eyes, that circumstances were
      closing round and drawing towards a crisis. 
 Beyond a certain point Glyceria could effect nothing, once only did she dare to suggest
      that the Augusta should assume a gentler demeanor towards the sovereign of the world, but she
      was at once cut back with the words:— 
 “There, Glyceria, I allow no interference. He has wronged me past endurance. I can never
      forgive. I have but one hope, I make but one prayer—and that for revenge.” 
 When Domitian was at Albanum, the Empress enjoyed greater freedom. She was not compelled
      when she went out, to journey in state; and she could make excursions into the country as she
      pleased. The absence of gardens on the Palatine and the throng of servants and officers made
      it an almost intolerable residence to her, beautiful as the situation was, and splendid as
      were the edifices on it. Nor was this all. Domitian had not rested content with the palaces
      already erected and crowding the summit of the rock,—those of Augustus, of Tiberius, and of
      Caligula, he must build one himself, and to find material, he tore down the golden house of
      Nero. 
 But the construction of his palace served still further to reduce the privacy of the
      Palatine, for it was thronged with masons, carpenters and plasterers. In
      deed the Palatine hill-top was almost as crowded and as noisy as was the Forum
      below. 
 From this, then, Domitia was glad to escape to a little villa on the Via Nomentana, on a
      height above the Anio, commanding a view of the Sacred Mount. 
 On one occasion, when Domitian was away at Albanum, she had been at this modest retreat,
      where she was surrounded by a few servants, and to which she had conveyed Glyceria, to enjoy
      the pure air and rest of the country. 
 But she was obliged to return to Rome; and with a small retinue, and without heralds
      preceding her, she started, and in the morning arrived at the Porta Collina. Then Eboracus,
      coming to the side of the litter, said:— 
 “Lady, there is a great crowd, and the street is full to choking. What is your good
      pleasure? shall we announce who you are, and command a passage?” 
 “Nay,” answered the princess, “my good Eboracus, let us draw aside, and the swarm will
      pass, then we can go our way unconcerned. I am in no precipitate haste, and, in faith, every
      minute I am outside Rome, the better satisfied am I.” 
 “But, madam, it is an ill spot, we are opposite the Accursed Field.” 
 “That matters not. It is but for a brief while. Go forward, Eboracus, and inquire what this
      crowd signifies. Methinks the people are marvellously still. I hear no shout, not even a
      murmur.” 
 “There be priests leading the way.” 
 “It is some religious rite. Run forward, Eboracus, and make inquiries. That boy bears an
      inverted torch.” 
 The sight was extraordinary. A procession of priests
      was advancing in silence, and an enormous crowd followed through the gate,
      pouring forth like water from a sluice, yet without a word spoken. The only sound was that of
      the tramp of feet. 
 The place where Domitia had halted was just outside the Collina gateway, where was the wall
      of Servius Tullius and in its moat, thirty feet deep, but dry, out of which rose the wall of
      massive blocks to another thirty above the level of the ground. 
 This ditch was a pestilential refuse place into which the carcasses of beasts, foul rags,
      sometimes even the bodies of men, and all the unmentionable filth of a great city were cast.
      So foul was the spot, so unwholesome the exhalations that no habitations were near it, and the
      wide open space before the wall went by the designation of the Accursed Field. 
 And now, through the gateway came a covered hearse, and at each corner walked a youth in
      mourning garb, one bearing a lamp and oil, another milk in a brass vessel, a third water, and
      a fourth bread. Now, and now only, with a shudder of horror, did Domitia suspect what was
      about to take place. She saw how that as the crowd deployed, it thickened about one portion of
      the bank of the ditch, and she saw also the battlements above crowded with the faces of men
      and women leaning over to look down into the dyke. And there, at one spot in the fosse stood
      three men. Instinctively Domitia knew who they were—the executioner and his assistants. 
 But who was to be put to death—and on what charge, and by what means? 
 Now the hearse was slowly brought to the edge of the moat and the curtains were raised. 

 Then Domitia saw how that within, prostrate, lay a woman, bound hand and foot to the posts
      by leather straps, with her face covered, and her mouth muffled that her cries might not be
      heard. 
 She saw the attendants of the priests untie the thongs and the unfortunate woman was raised
      to a sitting posture, yet still her face was veiled, and her hands were held by servants of
      the pontiff. Now one by one the attendants descended into the moat bearing the lamp and the
      bread and milk, and each handed what he had borne in the procession to the executioner, who
      gave each article as received to one of his deputies; and the man immediately disappeared with
      it. 
 Domitia’s heart beat furiously, she put forth her head to look, and discovered a hole at
      the base of the wall, and through this hole she discerned the twinkling light of the lamp as
      it passed within, then it was lost. The bread followed, the milk and the water, all conveyed
      into some underground cellar. 
 And now the chief pontiff present plucked the veil from the face of the victim, and with a
      gasp—she could not cry out, the power was taken from her—the Empress recognized Cornelia. 
 She made an effort to escape from her litter, and fly to her friend with outstretched arms,
      but Eboracus, who with white face had returned, caught and restrained her. 
 “Madam,” he said in a low tone, vibrating with emotion, “I pray you, for the sake of the
      Gods—do nothing rash. Stay where you are. No power—not that of the Sacred Twelve can save
      her.” 
 “Ye Gods! But what has she done?” 
 “She has been accused of breach of her vows, and
      condemned by the Augustus, as Chief Priest—” in a lower tone, hardly above a
      whisper, “unheard in her defence.” 
 “I must go to her.” 
 “You must not. Nothing can save her. Pray for a speedy death.” 
 With glazed eyes, with a surging in her ears, and throbbing in the temples—as in some
      paralyzing nightmare—Domitia looked on. 
 And now the gag was removed, and with dignity the Great Mother of the Vestals descended
      from the bier. She stood, tall and with nobility in her aspect, and looked round on the crowd,
      then down into the moat, at the black hole under the roots of the wall. 
 “Citizens, by the sacred fire of Vesta, I swear I am innocent of the charge laid against
      me, and for which I am sentenced. No witnesses have been called. I have not been suffered to
      offer any defence. I knew not, citizens, until I was told that I was sentenced, that any
      accusation had been trumped up against me. Thou, O Eternal God—above all lights in the
      firmament, Thou, O Sovereign Justice that holdest true balances—I invoke Thee—I summon the
      Chief Pontiff who has sentenced me, before your just thrones, to answer for what is done unto
      me this day. I summon him for midnight three days hence.” 
 Then the deputy of the Chief Pontiff, who presided at the execution, Domitian being absent
      at Albanum (he being Pontifex Maximus), raised his arms to heaven in silent prayer. 
 His prayer ended, he extended his hand to Cornelia, but she refusing his help, unaided
      descended into the fosse. 

 The vast concourse was as though turned to stone by a magician’s wand—so immovable was it
      and so hushed. Some swallows swept screaming along the moat, and their shrill cries sent a
      shudder through the entire concourse, wrought to such a tension, that even the note of the
      birds was an intolerable addition. 
 The Vestal reached the mouth of the pit—the ends of a ladder could be seen at the threshold
      of this opening. It was evident that the opening gave access to a vault of some depth. 
 Beside it were stones from the wall piled up, and mortar. As soon as the Abbess reached the
      opening, she turned, and again declared her innocence. “The Emperor,” said she in clear, firm
      tones, “has adjudged me guilty, knowing that my prayers have obtained for him victory, triumph
      and an immortal name. I repeat my summons. I bid him answer before the throne on high, at
      midnight, three days hence.” 
 Then she looked steadily at the blue sky—then up at the sun,—to take a last view of light.
      With calmness, with fortitude, she turned, and entering the opening began to disappear,
      descending the ladder. 
 In so doing her veil caught in one of the ends of the side poles of the ladder. She must
      have reascended a step or two, for her hand was visible disengaging the white veil, and
      then—hand and veil disappeared. 
 Immediately stones were caught up, trowels and mortar seized, and with incredible celerity
      the opening was walled up. The pontiff applied his leaden seal. 
 “Be speedy! Remove her! Run—” shouted Eboracus, for his mistress had fallen back in the
      litter in a dead faint,—“At once—to the Palace!”
