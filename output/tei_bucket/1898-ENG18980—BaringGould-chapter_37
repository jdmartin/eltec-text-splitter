CHAPTER XI.AGAIN: THE SWORD OF CORBULO.
 Eboracus was able to open a way for the litter through the crowd, now clustered on the bank
      of the dyke, watching as the workmen threw down earth and stones, and buried deep that portion
      of the wall in which was the vault where the unhappy Abbess Cornelia was buried alive. And now
      the populace broke forth in sighs and tears, and in murmurings low expressed at the injustice
      committed in sentencing a woman without allowing her to know that she had been accused, and of
      saying a word in her own defence. Some of the crowd was drifting back into Rome, and by
      entering this current, the train of Domitia travelled along. 
 Eboracus returned from the head of the litter repeatedly to the side, to look within and
      ascertain whether his mistress were recovering. At the first fountain he stopped the convoy
      and obtained for her water to bathe her face, and at a little tavern, he procured strong
      Campanian wine, which he entreated her to sip, so as to nerve her. 
 As the litter approached the Forum, the crowd again coagulated and at last remained
      completely stationary. Again the street was blocked. 
 Eboracus went forward and forced his way through, that he might ascertain the cause, and
      whether the
      block was temporary and would speedily cease. He came back in great agitation,
      and said hastily to his mistress:— 
 “Lady, you cannot proceed. Suffer me to recommend that you go to the Carinæ and tarry
      there—with your lady mother for a while, till your strength is restored, and till the streets
      be more open.” 
 “Eboracus—what is going on? tell me.” 
 “Madam, there is something being transacted in the comitium that causes
      all the approaches to be packed with people. We might make a circuit—but, lady! I think if you
      would deign to repose for an hour at your mother’s house, after what you have suffered, it
      would be advisable.” 
 “Tell me what is taking place in the comitium.” 
 “I should prefer, lady, not to be asked.” 
 “But I have asked.” 
 “Then, dear mistress, do not require of me to make answer.” 
 “Answer truly. Tell me no lie. What is it?” 
 He hesitated. Then Domitia said:— 
 “Look at my hand, it is firm, it does not tremble. Nothing that I hear can be worse than
      what I have seen.” 
 “Lady—your strength has already failed.” 
 “And now I have gathered my resolution together, and can bear anything. I adjure you, by
      your duty to me—answer me, what is taking place in the comitium, what is it
      that causes the streets leading thereto to be impassable.” 
 “If I must reply——” 
 “If you do not, I will have you scourged.” 
 “Nay, lady, that is not like thee. It is not fear that
      will make me speak, but because I know that if I do not, the information can be
      got from another.” 
 “Well—what is it?” 
 “The knight Celer, on the same charge as that which lost the Great Mother Cornelia, is
      being whipped to death with the scorpion.”

 “By the same orders? To my mother’s in the Carinæ.” 
 Hastily Domitia drew the curtains of her litter, and was seen no more, spoke no more till
      she reached the door of Longa Duilia. 
 Here she descended and entered the house. 
 “My dear Domitia! my august daughter! What a pleasure! What an honor!” 
 The lady Duilia started up to embrace the Empress. 
 Domitia received the kiss coldly, and sank silent on a stool. 
 Her mother looked at her with surprise. Domitia was waxen white, her eyes with dark rings
      about them, and unnaturally large and bright. The color had left her lips and these were
      leaden in hue. 
 Domitia did not speak, did not move. She remained for some moments like a statue. 
 “As the Gods love me!” exclaimed her mother after a long pause, “you are not going to be
      ill, surely—nothing dangerous, nothing likely to end unhappily. Ye Gods! and I have so much I
      want you to do for me. Tell me, I entreat you. Hide nothing from me. You are suffering. Where
      is it? What is it? Shall I send for a doctor?” 
 “Mother, no doctor can cure me. It is here,” Domitia pressed her hands to her heart—“and
      here,”
      to her temples. “I am the most miserable, the most unfortunate of women.” 
 “Ye Gods! He has divorced you?” 
 “No, mother. I would that he had.” 
 “Then what is the matter? Have you eaten what disagrees with you? As the Gods love me! you
      should not come out such a figure. Who was your face-dresser to-day? she ought to be
      crucified! Not a particle of paint—white as ivory. Intolerable—and it has given me such a
      turn.” 
 Domitia made no reply. 
 “But what is it? What has made you look like Parian marble?” 
 “The Great Mother Cornelia—” Domitia could say no more, a lump rose in her throat and
      choked her. Then all at once she began to shiver as though frost-stricken and her teeth
      chattered. 
 “I have an essence—you must take that,” said the lady Duilia. “My dear, I know
      all about that. An estimable lady. I mean she was so till the Augustus decreed otherwise. I am
      sorry, and all that—but you know—well, these things do happen and must, and I dare be bound
      that some are glad, as it makes an opening for another needy girl, of good family of course.
      What is one person’s loss is another’s gain. The world is so and we can’t alter it, and a good
      thing, I say, that it is so.” 
 “Mother—she was innocent.” 
 “Well, well, we know all about that. Of course it was all nonsense what was charged against
      her, that we quite understand. It would never have done for the real truth to have been
      advertised.” 
 “And what was the truth?” 

 “My dear Domitia! How can you ask such a silly, infantile question? It was your doing, you
      must understand that. You threw yourself on her protection, embraced the altar of Vesta, and
      Cornelia with the assistance of Celer did what she could to further your object in leaving
      Rome. If people will do donkey-like things they must get a stick across their backs. It is so,
      and always will be so in this world, and we cannot make it otherwise.” 
 “I thought so. I was sure it was so,” said Domitia gravely. There was an infinity of
      sadness, of despair in her tone. “Mother, I bring misfortune upon all with whom I have to do.” 
 “Ye Gods! not on me! I hope to be preserved from that! Do not speak such unlucky words—they
      are of bad omen.” 
 “I cannot help it, mother, it is true. I am the most unfortunate of women myself——” 
 “You speak rank folly. Ye Gods forgive me! saying such a thing to one who is herself
      divine. But, it is so—you are positively the most fortunate of women. What more do you desire?
      You are the Augusta, the people swear by your genius and fortune.” 
 “By my fortune! Alack poor souls!” 
 “And is it not a piece of good fortune to be raised so high that there is none above you?” 
 “My fortune! The Gods know—if they know anything—that I would gladly exchange my lot with
      that of a poor woman in a cottage who spins and sings, or of a girl among the mountains who
      keeps goats and is defended by a boisterous dog. Mother, listen to me. I have brought
      misfortune on Lucius Lamia, I have caused the death of that harmless actor Paris, I have
      been the occasion of Cornelia being—buried alive—watching the expiring of the one
      lamp. Ye Gods! Ye Gods! I shall go mad—and of Celer also.—He——” 
 She held her face, rocked herself on the seat and sobbed as if her heart would break. 
 “Yes,” said the old lady, roused to anger at her daughter’s lack of appreciation of the
      splendor of her position. “Yes, child, and mischief you will work on every one, if you
      continue in the same course. Do men say that the Augustus is morose? Who made him so?—you by
      your behavior. Do they say that he is severe in his judgments? Who has hardened him and made
      him cruel?—You—who have dried up all the springs of tenderness in his breast. He was not so at
      first. If he be what men think—it is your work. You with your stinging words goaded him to
      madness and as he cannot or will not beat you, as you deserve, he deals the blows on some one
      else. Of course he cuts away such as you regard and love—because they obtain that to which he
      has a right, but which you deny him.” 
 “He—he—a right!” 
 Domitia started up, anger, resentment, hatred flared in her eyes, stiffened the muscles of
      her whole face, made her hair bristle above her brow. 
 “He a right, mother! he who tore me away from my dear Lamia, to whom I had given my whole
      heart, to whom I had been united by your sanction and our union blessed by the Gods! He who
      violated hospitality, the most sacred rights that belong to a house, who repaid your kindness
      in saving his life—when he was hunted like a wolf, by breaking and destroying, by trampling
      under his accursed heel, the brittle, innocent heart of the daughter of her who had protected
      him! No, mother, I owed him no love. I have never given him any, because he never
      had a right to any. Mother—this must have an end.” 
 She sank into silence that continued for some while. 
 Duilia did not speak. She did not desire another such explosion, lest the slaves should
      hear and betray what had been said. Presently, however, she whispered coaxingly:—

 “My dear Domitia, you are overwrought. You have eaten something that has affected your
      temper. I find gherkins always disagree with me. There, go and take a little ginger in white
      wine, and sleep it off.” 
 Domitia rose, stiffly, as though all her joints were wooden. 
 “Yes, mother, I will go. But there is one thing I desire of thee. I have long coveted it,
      as a remembrancer of my father—may I take it?” 
 “Anything—anything you like.” 
 Domitia went to the wall and took down the sword of Corbulo, there suspended. 
 “It is this, mother. I need it.” 
 Then she departed. 
 “That sword—ah!” said Duilia. “It has been a little overdone. I have caught my guests
      exchanging winks when I alluded to it, and dropped a tear. O by all means she shall have it.
      It has ceased to be of use to me.”
