CHEVENIX CASTLE
Chevenix Castle,

8th November.

Chevenix Castle

Dearest Mamma,—I am sure I shall enjoy myself here. The train was so late, and only two other
     people were coming by it besides me, so we all drove up in the omnibus together. One was a man,
     and the other a woman, and she glared at me, and fussed her maid so about her dressing-bag, and
     it was such a gorgeous affair, and they had such quantities of luggage, and the only thing they
     said on the drive up was how cold it was, and they wondered when we should get there. And when
     we did arrive, there was only just time to rush up and dress for dinner; all the other people
     had come by an earlier train. I left them both in the care of the groom of the chambers, as
     even Cousin Octavia had gone upstairs, and there was not a soul about, but she had left a
     message for me; and while Agnès was clawing the things out of the trunks, I went to her
     room.
She was just having her hair done, but she did not mind a bit, and was awfully glad to see
     me. She is a dear. Her hair is as dark as anything underneath, but all the outside is
     a bright red. She says it is much more attractive like that, but it does look odd before the
     front thing is on, and that is a fuzzy bit in a net, like what Royalties have. And then she has
     lots of twist-things round at the back, and although it doesn't look at all bad when the
     diamond stick-ups are in and she is all arranged. She went on talking all the time while her
     maid was fixing it, just as if we were alone in the room. She told me I had grown six inches
     since she was with us at Arcachon three years ago, and that I was quite good-looking. She said
     they had a huge party for the balls, some rather nice people, and Lady Doraine and one or two
     others she hated. I said why did she have people she hated—that I would not if I were a
     Countess like her; so she said those were often the very ones one was obliged to have, because
     the nice men wouldn't come without them.

The Test of a Gentleman

She hoped I had some decent clothes, as she had got a tame millionaire for me. So I said if
     it was Mr. Wertz she need not bother because I knew him; and, besides, I only intended to marry
     a gentleman, unless, of course, I should get past twenty and passé, and then, goodness
     knows what I might take. She laughed, and said it was ridiculous to be so particular,
     but that anyway that would be no difficulty, as every one was a gentleman now who paid for
     things.
Then she sent me off to dress, just as she began to put some red stuff on her lips. It is
     wonderful how nice she looks when everything is done, even though she has quite a different
     coloured chest to the top bit that shows above her pearl collar, which is brickish-red from
     hunting. So is her face, but she is such a dear that one admires even her great big nose and
     little black eyes, which one would think hideous in other people. I met Tom just going into her
     room as I came out; he said he had come to borrow some scent from her. He looks younger than
     she does, but they were the same age when they got married, weren't they?
He kissed me and said I was a dear little cousin, and had I been boxing any one's ears
     lately. Before I could box his for talking so, Octavia called out to him to let me go, or I
     should be late, and had I not to scurry just? Agnès fortunately had everything ready, but I
     fussed so that my face was crimson when I got downstairs, and every one was already there.
There seemed to be dozens of people. You will see in the list in the Morning Post
     to-morrow what a number of the Nazeby set there are here.
Lord Valmond is here, but he did not see me until we were at dinner. I went in with Mr.
     Hodgkinson, who is contesting this Division; he is quite young and wears an eyeglass, which he
     keeps dropping. He really looks silly, but they say he says some clever things if you give him
     time, and that he will be a great acquisition to the party he has joined now, as it is much
     easier to get made a peer by the Radicals; and that is what he wants, as his father made a huge
     fortune in bones and glue.
He did not talk to me at all, but eat his dinner at first, and then said: "I don't believe in
     talking before the fish, do you?"
So I said: "No, nor till after the ices, unless one has something to say."
He was so surprised that his eyeglass dropped, and he had to fumble to find it, so by that
     time I had begun to talk to old Colonel Blake, who was at the other side of me.

The Game of Bridge

Lady Doraine was looking so pretty; her hair has grown much fairer and nicer than it was at
     Nazeby. Lord Doraine is here too; his eyes are so close together! He plays a game called
     "Bridge" with Mr. Wertz and Mr. Hodgkinson and Tom all the time—I mean in the afternoon before
     dinner—so Mr. Hodgkinson told me when we got to dessert. I suppose it was the first thing he
     had found to say! I asked him if it was a kind of leapfrog; because don't you remember we
     called it "Bridge" when you had to jump two? He said No; that it was a game of cards, and much
     more profitable if one had the luck of Lord Doraine, who had won heaps of money from Mr. Wertz.
     Afterwards, in the drawing-room, Lady Doraine came up to me and asked me where I had been
     hiding since the Nazeby visit, and when she heard I had been in France, she talked a lot about
     the fashions. She has such a splendid new rope of pearls, and such lovely clothes. The Rooses
     are here too, and Jane has a cold in her head. She says she heard by this evening's post that
     Miss La Touche is going to be married to old Lord Kidminster, and that he is "too deaf to have
     heard everything, so it is just as well." I can't see why, as Miss La Touche is so nice, and
     never talks rubbish; so I think it a pity he can't hear all she says, don't you?
Lady Doraine calls Octavia "darling!" She stood fiddling with her diamond chain and purring
     over her frock, so I suppose she is fond of her in spite of Octavia hating her.

An Englishman's Views

After dinner Lord Valmond came up to me at once. I felt in such a good temper, it was hard to
     be very stiff, he seemed so awfully glad to see me. He said I might have let him know what day
     it was that I crossed over to France after leaving Hazeldene Court—he would have taken such
     care of me. I said I was quite able to take care of myself. Then he asked me if the people were
     nice in France? and when I said perfectly charming, he said some Frenchwomen weren't bad but
     the men were monkeys. I said it showed how little he knew about them, I had found them
     delightful, always polite and respectful and amusing, quite a contrast to some English people
     one was obliged to meet.
His eyes blazed like two bits of blue fire, and when he looked like that, it made my heart
     beat, Mamma, I don't know why. He is so nice-looking, of course no Frenchman could compare to
     him, but I was obliged to go on praising them because it annoyed him so. He said I must have
     stayed there ages, he had been wondering and wondering when he was to see me again. He said Mr.
     Hodgkinson was an ass, and he had been watching us at dinner.
Then Lord Doraine came up and Lady Doraine introduced him to me, and he said a number of nice
     things, and he has a charming voice; and Mr. Wertz came up too, and spoke to me; and then Lady
     Doraine called Lord Valmond to come and sit on the little sofa by her, and she looked at him so
     fondly that I thought perhaps Lord Doraine might not like it. He tried not to see, but Mr.
     Wertz did, and I think he must have a kind heart, because he fidgeted so, and almost
     at once went and joined them to break up the tête-à-tête, so that Lord Doraine might not be
     teased any more, I suppose. And every one went to bed rather early, because of the ball and
     shoot to-morrow, and I must jump in too, as I am sleepy, so good-night, dearest Mamma.—Your
     affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.
Chevenix Castle,

9th November.

The Peers' Sad Case

Dearest Mamma,—Such a lot to tell you, and no time, as I must go down to tea. We passed
     rather a boring morning after the men had started for their shoot. Only a few people were down
     for breakfast, and none of the men who weren't guns. I suppose they were asleep. But Lady Grace
     Fenton was as cross as a bear because she wanted to go and shoot too. She is just like a man,
     and does look so odd and almost improper in the evening in female dress. And Tom won't have
     women out shooting, except for lunch. Lady Doraine and Lady Greswold talked by the fire while
     they smoked, and Lady Greswold said she really did not know where the peers were to turn to now
     to make an honest penny, their names being no more good in the City, and that it was abominably
     hard that now, she had heard, they would have to understand business and work just like
     ordinary Stock Exchange people if they wanted to get on, and she did not know what things were
     coming to.
At lunch, in the châlet in the wood, it was rather fun. Mr. Hodgkinson and Lord Doraine sat
     on either side of me. Lord Valmond came up with the last guns, rather late, and he looked round
     the table and frowned. He seems quite grumpy now, not half so good-tempered as he used to be. I
     expect it is because Mrs. Smith isn't here.
Mr. Wertz was so beautifully turned out in the newest clothes and the loveliest stockings,
     and he had two loaders and three guns, and Lord Doraine told me that he had killed three
     pheasants, but the ground was knee-deep in cartridges round him, and Tom was furious, as he
     likes an enormous bag. So I asked why, if Mr. Wertz was not a sportsman, had he taken the huge
     Quickham shoot in Norfolk? Then Mr. Hodgkinson chimed in: "Oh! to entertain Royalty and the
     husbands of his charming lady friends!" and he fixed his eyeglass and looked round the corner
     of it at Lord Doraine, who drank a glass of peach brandy.
After lunch the men had to start quickly, as we had dawdled so, and so we turned to go back
     to the house.
Octavia put her arm through mine, and we were walking on, when Lady Doraine joined us, with
     the woman who had glared at me in the omnibus. She looked as if she hated walking. She is not
     actually stout, but everything is as tight as possible, and it does make her puff. She was
     awfully smart, and had the thinnest boots on. Lady Doraine was being so lovely to her, and
     Octavia was in one of her moods when she talks over people's heads, so we had not a very
     pleasant walk, until we came to the stable gate, when Octavia and I went that way to see her
     new hunters. We had hardly got out of hearing when she said—
"Really, Elizabeth, how I dislike women!"

The Millionaires

So I asked her who the puffing lady was, and she said a Mrs. Pike, the new Colonial
     millionairess.
"Horrid creature, as unnecessary as can be!"
So I asked her why she had invited her, then. And she said her sister-in-law, Carry, had got
     round Tom and made a point of it, as she was running them, and now Carry had got the measles
     and could not come to look after the creature herself; and it would serve her right if Folly
     Doraine took them out of her hands. And so you see, Mamma, everything has changed from your
     days, because this isn't a person you would dream of knowing. I don't quite understand what
     "running them" means, and as Octavia was a little out of temper, I did not like to ask her; but
     Jane Roose is sure to know, so I will find out and tell you.
I went and played with the children when we got in. They are such ducks, and we had a
     splendid romp. Little Tom is enormous for five, and so clever, and Gwynnie is the image of
     Octavia when her hair was dark. Now I must go down to tea.

Teaching Patience

7.30.—I was so late. Every one was there when I got down in such gorgeous tea-gowns; I wore
     my white mousseline delaine frock. The Rooses have the look of using out their summer best
     dresses. Jane's cold is worse. The guns had got back, and came straggling in one by one, as
     they dressed, quickly or slowly; and Lord Doraine had such a lovely velvet suit on, and he said
     such nice things to me; and Lord Valmond sat at the other side, and seemed more ill-tempered
     than ever. I can't think what is the matter with him. At last he asked me to play Patience with
     him; so I said that was a game one played by oneself, and he said he knew quite a new one which
     he was sure I would like to learn; but I did not particularly want to just then. Lady Doraine
     was showing Mr. Wertz her new one at the other side of the hall. There are some cosy little
     tables arranged for playing cards, with nice screens near, so that the other people's counting,
     etc., may not put one out.
Mrs. Pike was too splendid for words, in petunia satin, and sable, and quantities of pearl
     chains; and Tom was trying to talk to her. Nobody worries about Mr. Pike much; but Lord Doraine
     took him off to the billiard-room, after collecting Mr. Wertz, to play "Bridge"—everybody plays
     "Bridge," I find—and then Lady Doraine came and joined Lord Valmond and me on the big sofa.
Lord Valmond hardly spoke after that, and she teased him and said: "Harry, what a child you
     are!" and she looked as sweetly malicious as the tortoise-shell cat at home does when it is
     going to scratch while it is purring. And presently Dolly Tenterdown came over to us (he is in
     Cousin Jack's battalion of the Coldstreams, and he looks about fifteen, but he behaves very
     "grown up"), and he asked Lady Doraine to come and teach him her new "Patience"; and they went
     to one of the screen tables, and Lord Valmond said he was a charming fellow, but I thought he
     looked silly, and I do wonder what she found to say to him. She must be quite ten
     years older than he is, and Jane Roose says it is an awful sign of age when people play with
     boys.
Lord Valmond asked me to keep him some dances to-night, but I said I really did not know what
     I should do until it began, as I had never been at a ball before. I haven't forgiven him a bit,
     so he need not think I have. Now I must stop. Oh! I am longing to put on my white tulle, and I
     do feel excited.—Your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.

P.S.—I asked Jane Roose what "running them" means, and it's being put on to things in
     the City, and having all your bills paid if you introduce them to people; only you sometimes
     have to write their letters for them to prevent them putting the whole grand address, etc.,
     that is in the Peerage; and she says it is quite a profession now, and done by the best people,
     which of course must be true, as Carry is Tom's sister. E.

10th November.

A Modern Industry

Dearest Mamma,—Oh! it was too, too lovely, last night. I am having my breakfast in bed
     to-day, just like the other grown-up people, and it really feels so grand to be writing to you
     between sips of tea and nibbles of toast and strawberry jam! Well, to tell you about the ball.
     First my white tulle was a dream. Octavia said it was by far the prettiest débutante frock she
     had ever seen; and when I was dressed she sent for me to her room, and Tom was there too, and
     she took out of a duck of a white satin case a lovely string of pearls and put it round my
     throat, and said it was their present to me for my first ball! Wasn't it angelic of them? I
     hugged and kissed them both, and almost squashed Tom's buttonhole into his pink coat, I was so
     pleased, but he said he didn't mind; and then we all went down together, and no one else was
     ready, so we looked through the rooms. The dancing, of course, was to be in the picture
     gallery, and the flowers were so splendid everywhere, and Octavia was quite satisfied. It is a
     mercy it is such a big house, for we weren't put out a bit beforehand by the preparations.
I don't know if you were ever like that, Mamma, but I felt as if I must jump about and sing,
     and my cheeks were burning. Octavia sat down and played a valse, and Tom and I opened the ball
     by ourselves in the empty room, and it was fun, and then we saw Lord Valmond peeping
     in at the door, and he came up and said Tom was not to be greedy, and so I danced the two last
     rounds with him, and he had such a strange look in his eyes, a little bit like Jean when he had
     the fit, and he never said one word until we stopped.

Forgiveness

Then Octavia went out of the other door, and I don't know where Tom went, but we were alone,
     and so he said, would I forgive him for everything and be friends, that he had never been so
     sorry for anything in his life as having offended me. He really seemed so penitent, and he does
     dance so beautifully, and he is so tall and nice in his pink coat; and, besides, I remembered
     his dinner with Aunt Maria, and how nasty I had been to him at Hazeldene! So I said, all right
     I would try, if he would promise never to be horrid again; and he said he wouldn't; and then we
     shook hands, and he said I looked lovely, and that my frock was perfect; and then Tom came back
     and we went into the hall, and everybody was down, and they had drawn for partners to go in to
     dinner while we were in the ballroom. Tom had made Octavia arrange that we should draw, as he
     said he could not stand Lady Greswold two nights running. Octavia said she had drawn for Lord
     Valmond because he wasn't there, and that his slip of paper was me, and he said on our
     way into the dining-room that Octavia was a brick. We had such fun at dinner. Now that
     I have forgiven him, and have not to be thinking all the time of how nasty I can be, we get on
     splendidly.

The Ball

Mr. Wertz was at the other side of me with Mrs. Pike; but as he isn't "running" them he had
     not to bother to talk to her, and he is really very intelligent, and we three had such an
     amusing time. Lord Valmond was in a lovely temper. Jane Roose said afterwards in the
     drawing-room that it was because Mrs. Smith was coming with the Courceys to the ball. Lady
     Doraine had drawn Mr. Pike, who is melancholy-looking, with a long Jew nose; but she woke him
     up and got him quite animated by dessert, and Mrs. Pike did not like it one bit. I overheard
     her speaking to him about it afterwards, and he said so roughly, "You mind your own climbing,
     Mary; you ought to be glad as it's a titled lady!" Well, then, by the time we were all
     assembled in the hall, every one began to arrive. Oh, it was so, so lovely! Every one looked at
     me as I stood beside Octavia at first, because they all knew the ball was given for me, and
     then for the first dance I danced with Tom, and after that I had heaps of partners, and I can't
     tell you about each dance, but it was all heavenly. I tried to remember what you said and not
     dance more than three times with the same person, but, somehow, Lord Valmond got four, and
     another—but that was an extra.
Mrs. Smith did come with the Courceys, and she was looking so smart with a beautiful gown on,
     and Jane Roose said it was a mercy Valmond was so rich; but I don't see what that had to do
     with it. I saw him dancing with her once, but he looked as cross as two sticks, perhaps because
     she was rather late. Do you know, Mamma, a lot of the beauties we are always reading about in
     the papers as having walked in the Park looking perfectly lovely were there, and some of them
     are quite, quite old—much older than you—and all trimmed up! Aren't you astonished?
     And one has a grown-up son and daughter, and she danced all the time with Dolly Tenterdown, who
     was her son's fag at Eton, Lord Doraine told me. Isn't it odd? And another was the lady that
     Sir Charles Helmsford was with on the promenade at Nice, when you would not let me bow to him,
     do you remember? And she is as old as the other!
Lord Doraine was rather a bother, he wanted to dance with me so often; so at last I said to
     Octavia I really was not at my first ball to dance with old men (he is quite forty), and what
     was I to do? And she was so cross with him, and I could see her talking to him about it when
     she danced with him herself next dance; and after that till supper he disappeared—into the
     smoking-room, I suppose, to play "Bridge."

At Supper

I went in to supper first with the Duke of Meath—he had just finished taking in Octavia—he is
     such a nice boy; and then, as we were coming out, we went down a corridor, and there in a
     window-seat were Lord Valmond and Mrs. Smith, and he was still gloomy, and she had the same
     green-rhubarb-juice look she had the last night at Nazeby. He jumped up at once, and said to me
     he hoped I had not forgotten I had promised to go in to supper with him, so I said I had just
     come from supper; and while we were speaking Mrs. Smith had got the Duke to sit down beside
     her, and so I had to go off with Lord Valmond, and he seemed so odd and nervous, and as if he
     were apologising about something; but I don't know what it could have been, as he had not asked
     me before to go in to supper with him.
He seemed to cheer up presently, and persuaded me to go back into the supper-room, as he said
     he was so hungry, and we found a dear little table, with big flower things on it, in a corner;
     but when we got there he only played with an ortolan and drank some champagne, but he did take
     such a while about it; and each time I said I was sure the next dance was beginning he said he
     was still hungry. I have never seen any one have so much on his plate and eat so little. At
     last I insisted on going back, and when we got to the ballroom an extra was on, and he said I
     had promised him that, but I hadn't. However, we danced, and after that, having been so long
     away at supper, and one thing and another, my engagements seemed to get mixed, and I danced
     with all sorts of people I hadn't promised to in the beginning. At last it came to an end, and
     when the last carriage had driven away, we all went and had another hot supper.

End of the Ball

Mr. Pike would sit next to Lady Doraine, and he was as gay as a blackbird, and I heard
     Octavia saying to Lady Greswold that Carry had better hurry up and get that house in Park
     Street, or Lady Doraine would have it instead. Then we all went to bed, and Lord Valmond
     squeezed my hand and looked as silly as anything, and Jane Roose, who saw, said I had better be
     careful, as he was playing me off against Mrs. Smith. It was great impertinence of her, I
     think—don't you?—especially as Mrs. Smith had gone, so I can't see the point.—Now I am going to
     get up. Your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.
Chevenix Castle,

13th November.

Tableaux

Dearest Mamma,—I enjoyed my self last night quite as much as at the ball here; but first, I
     must tell you about Thursday and yesterday. The morning after the ball here no one came down
     till lunch, and in the afternoon Lady Doraine suggested we should have some tableaux in the
     evening, and so we were busy all the time arranging them. They were all bosh; but it was so
     amusing.
Mrs. Pike lent every one her tea-gowns—she has dozens—and they did splendidly for the Queen
     of Sheba; and Mr. Pike played Charles I. having his head cut off, as Lady Doraine told him he
     had just the type of lofty melancholy face for that. I was the Old Woman in the Shoe, with all
     the biggest people for children; but the best of all was Dolly Tenterdown as "Bubbles." Lord
     Doraine and Mr. Wertz and Tom and some others played "Bridge" all the time while we were
     arranging them; but Lord Valmond was most useful, and in such a decent temper. After they were
     over we danced a little, and it was all delightful.

A Game of Patience

Yesterday, the day of the county ball in Chevenix, they shot again; and it rained just as we
     all came down ready to start for the lunch; so we couldn't go, and had to lunch indoors without
     most of the men. Mr. Pike hadn't gone shooting, because I heard Tom saying the night before to
     Lady Doraine that he wouldn't chance the party being murdered again, and that she must keep him
     at home somehow. So she did, and taught him Patience in the hall after lunch; and Mrs. Pike
     went and wanted to learn it too, but Lady Doraine—who was lovely to her—somehow did not make
     much room on the sofa, so she had to go and sit somewhere else.

A Broad Hint

Half the people were playing "Bridge," and the rest were very comfortable, and smoking
     cigarettes, of course; so Mrs. Pike did too. Her case is gold, with a splendid monogram in big
     rubies on it; but I am sure it makes her feel sick, because she puffs it out and makes it burn
     up as soon as she can without its being in her mouth. She had to go and lie down after that, as
     she said she would be too tired for the ball; but nobody paid much attention.
It was more lively at tea-time, when the guns came in. And Lord Doraine would sit by me; he
     talked about poetry, and said dozens of nice things about me, and all sorts of amusing ones
     about every one else; and Lord Valmond, who had gone to write some letters at a table near,
     seemed so put out with every one talking, that he could not keep his attention, and at last
     tore them up, and came and sat close to us, and told Lord Doraine that he could see Mr. Wertz
     was longing for "Bridge." And so he got up, and laughed in such a way, and said, "All right,
     Harry, old boy," and Valmond got crimson—I don't know what at—and looked as cross as a bear for
     a few minutes. We had rather a hurried dinner.

The Duchess's Ball

My white chiffon is as pretty as the tulle, and Octavia was quite pleased with me. There were
     omnibuses and two broughams for us to go in. Octavia took me with her alone in one. I wanted to
     go in one of the omnibuses—it looked so much gayer—but she wouldn't let me. It is not much of a
     drive, as you know, and we all got there at the same time almost, and our party did look so
     smart as we came in. Octavia sailed like a queen up the room to a carpeted raised place at the
     end, and there held a sort of court.
The Duchess of Glamorgan was already there with her three daughters, and their teeth stick
     out just like Mrs. Vavaseur's; only they look ready to bite, and she was always smiling. The
     men of their party were so young, and looked as if they would not hurt a fly, and the Duchess
     had me introduced to her and asked about you. And Mrs. Pike tried to join in the conversation,
     and the Duchess fixed on her pince-nez and looked at her for quite ten seconds, and
     then said, when she had retired a little, "Who is this gorgeous person?" And when I said Mrs.
     Pike, she said, "I don't remember the name," in a tone that dismissed Mrs. Pike from the
     universe as far as she was concerned; and Jane Roose says she is almost the only Duchess who
     won't know parvenues, and that is what makes her set so dull.
There were such a lot of funny frumpy people at the other end of the room—"the rabble," Mrs.
     Pike called them. "Let us walk round and look at the rabble," she said to Lord Doraine, who was
     standing by her. And they went.

The Ride Home

I had such lots of partners I don't know what any one else did; I was enjoying myself so, and
     I hope you won't be annoyed with me, as I am afraid I danced oftener than three times with Lord
     Valmond. Mrs. Smith seemed to be with the little Duke a great deal, and she glared at me
     whenever she passed. I like English balls much better than French, though, perhaps, I can't
     judge, as I was never at a real one there. But Englishmen are so much better-looking, and
     everybody doesn't get so hot, and it is nice having places to sit out and talk without feeling
     you are doing something wrong. Coming home, Octavia made Lady Doraine and Mrs. Pike go in her
     brougham, and she and I went in one of the omnibuses. Lord Doraine sat between me and Octavia,
     and I suppose he was afraid of crushing her dress, for he positively squashed me, he sat so
     close. Lord Valmond was at the other side of me, and somebody must have been pushing him,
     because he sat even nearer me than Lord Doraine, and between them I could hardly breathe; it
     was fortunate it was a cold night.
Before we got to the Park gates somehow the light went out, and all the way up the avenue
     people held each of my hands. I could not see who they were, and I tried to get them away, but
     I couldn't, and I was afraid to kick like I did to Charlie Carriston, as it might have been Mr.
     Hodgkinson who was sitting opposite, and so there would have been no good in kicking Lord
     Doraine, or Lord Valmond; but I just made my fingers as stiff as iron and left them alone. It
     is a surprise to me, Mamma, to find that gentlemen in England behave like this, I call it
     awfully disappointing, and I am sure they could not have done so when you were young, it seems
     they are just as bad as the French. I told Octavia about it when she came to tuck me up in bed;
     and she only went into a fit of laughter, and when I was offended, she said she would see that
     the next time I went to a ball with her, that I had a chaperon on each side coming home.

An Awkward Situation

I bowed as stiffly as I could in saying good-night to Lord Doraine and Lord Valmond, and they
     both looked so astonished, that perhaps it was Mr. Hodgkinson after all; it is awkward
     not knowing, isn't it? This morning all the guests are going, and on Monday, as you know, Tom
     and Octavia take me with them to stay at Foljambe Place, with the Murray-Hartleys for the
     Grassfield Hunt Ball. It will be fun, I hope, but I can never enjoy myself more than I have
     done here.—Now, good-bye, dear Mamma, your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.

The Murray-Hartleys


P.S.—Octavia says the Murray-Hartleys aren't people you would know, but one must go
     with the times, and she will take care of me. E.
