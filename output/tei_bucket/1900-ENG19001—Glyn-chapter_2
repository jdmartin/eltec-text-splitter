London out of Season

Dearest Mamma,—The train from Nazeby was so late and Aunt Mary seemed to think it was my
     fault—so unreasonable of her, just because they had waited lunch for me. I don't believe I like
     visiting very near relations as much as ones further off. They feel they can say anything to
     you. I am glad I have only got to sleep here the one night. I had not eaten my omelette before
     Aunt Mary began about my hair. She said of course it was very nice curling like that, but it
     was a pity I did not wear a net over it all to keep it more tidy. She was sure you spoilt me,
     even though we are rich, letting me have such smart clothes. She had heard from Nazeby, that I
     had had on a fresh frock every day. I don't know who could have written to her. She has got to
     look much older in the two years we have been abroad and the corners of her mouth shut with a
     snap. Perhaps it is having to spend part of the year with her mother-in-law.

Cousinly Curiosity

Lettice and Clara are just the same as they were, not a bit of difference since they came
     out. They are as tidy as can be, not a hair escapes from their nets! and their heads look as if
     they had dozens of hairpins in them, and because it is out of the season they have gone back to
     their country high linen collars, and they look as if they were choking. I hate linen collars,
     don't you, Mamma? Two Ethridge aunts are staying here besides me, and we all have to sit
     together in the morning-room, as everything is covered up in the drawing-rooms, ready for being
     shut up next week, when they go to Scotland. After lunch the girls did nothing but question me
     about what we had done at Nazeby. They said Lady Cecilia only asks them to the dullest parties.
     They knew every one's name, they had carefully read them in the Morning Post. They
     wanted especially to know about Lord Valmond because Lettice had danced with him once this
     season. They thought him awfully good-looking. I said he was an odious young man and very rude.
     So Lettice said she supposed he had not spoken to me, as he never speaks to girls. I told them
     that was quite a mistake as he had spoken to me all the time, but I hated him. And do you know,
     Mamma, they looked as if they did not believe a word I was saying; which was not very polite I
     think.
When we got upstairs they wanted to see all my clothes, but fortunately Agnès had only taken
     out one or two things, and they asked me to let their maid take patterns of everything. Of
     course I could not refuse, but I hate my things being mauled over by strange females, and Agnès
     was simply furious. I am sure she will scratch the maid when she comes to ask for a frock. They
     tried on my hats all at the wrong angle, first Clara, then Lettice, and made faces and gave
     little screams at themselves in the glass, and no wonder, for they looked perfect guys in them,
     with their tight "tongy" hair. Then they tossed them on to the bed as they finished with them,
     and Agnès kept muttering to herself like distant thunder. Finally Lettice danced a pas
      seul with the white rose toque perched on the back of her head, and she made such kicks
     and jumps that it lurched off, and landed in the water jug! At that Agnès got beside
     herself.
"Fi! donc, Mademoiselle!" she screamed, "ça c'est trop fort!"

On the Water Shoot

The hat is quite spoilt, so please write and order me another one from Caroline's, like a
     nice, sweet, pretty, darling Mamma. At tea they were all so interested when I told them I was
     going to stay in France with the de Croixmares. One of the Ethridge aunts (Rowena) pricked up
     her ears at once, and asked me if Madame de Croixmare was not my godmother, and had she not
     been a great friend of poor papa's. So I told her yes, and that I was going there for three
     weeks. She and Aunt Mary exchanged looks, I don't know why, but it irritated me, Mamma, and I
     rather snapped at Aunt Mary when she began about my hair again. And presently I heard her
     saying to the other aunt that it was a pity girls nowadays were allowed to be impertinent to
     their elders.
Of course there was not a thing to do, every one having left Town, so in the evening Uncle
     Geoffrey took us to the Exhibition to go down in the Water Shoot. That is lovely,
     Mamma, only I had to sit beside Lettice, because Clara was frightened and would be with her
     father. A horrid man behind, who, I suppose, was not holding on, flopped right on to us at the
     bump in the water, and then said, "Beg pardon, dears," and it made Uncle Geoffrey so cross he
     would not let us go down any more, and we had to go home and to bed. I am just scribbling this
     before breakfast.
We go on to Great-aunt Maria's by the eleven train. I am glad Cousin Octavia is going to take
     me out next season instead of Aunt Mary, which was first suggested. I know I should not have
     been good with her. She is not a bit like you, darling Mamma. I hope you are better; I shan't
     see you again until next Saturday, when I leave Heaviland Manor. It is a long time.—With love
     from your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.
