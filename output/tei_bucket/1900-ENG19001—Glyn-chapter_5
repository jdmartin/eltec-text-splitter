CHÂTEAU DE CROIXMARE
Château De Croixmare,

16th August.

A Formidable Godmother

Dearest Mamma,—What a crossing we had, perfectly disgusting! The sky was without a cloud, but
     such a wind that every one was sick, so one could not enjoy oneself. Agnès became rapidly
     French too directly we landed at Dieppe, and the carriage was full of stuffy people, who would
     not have a scrap of window open; however, Jean was waiting for us at Paris. We snatched some
     food at the restaurant, and then caught the train to Vinant. Jean is quite good-looking, but
     with an awfully respectable expression. Any one could tell he was married even without looking
     at his wedding ring. He was polite, and made conversation all the time in the train, and as the
     engine kept puffing and shrieking I was obliged to continually say "Pardon?" so it
     made it rather heavy. I think he has changed a good deal since their wedding—let me see—that
     must be eight years ago, as I was nine then; I hardly remembered him.
Godmamma was waiting for us in the hall when we arrived. Château de Croixmare is a nice
     place, but I am glad I am not French. It was the hottest night of the year almost, and
     not a breath of air in the house, every shutter closed and the curtains drawn. Héloise had gone
     to bed with a migraine, Godmamma explained, but Victorine was there. She has grown up
     plain, and looks much more than five years older than me. They weren't in evening dress, or
     even tea-gowns like in England—it did seem strange.
Mme. de Croixmare looks a dragon! I can't think how poor papa insisted upon my having such a
     godmother. Her face is quite white, and her hair so black and drawn off her forehead, and she
     has a bristly moustache. She is also very up right and thin, and walks with an ebony stick, and
     her voice is like a peacock's. She looked me through and through, and I felt all my French
     getting jumbled, and it came out with such an English accent; and after we had bowed a good
     deal, and said heaps of Ollendorfish kind of sentences, I was given some "sirop" and water, and
     conducted to bed by Victorine. She is a big dump with a shiny complexion, and such a very small
     mouth, and I am sure I shall hate her, she isn't a bit good-natured-looking like Jean. The
     house is really fine Louis XV., and my bedroom and cabinet de toilette are delicious, so is my
     bed; but the attitude of Agnès—such a conscious pride in the superiority of France—nearly drove
     me mad.
There isn't a decent dressing-table mirror, only one in an old silver frame about eight
     inches square, and that is sitting on the writing-table—or what would be the writing-table, if
     there happened to be any pens and things, which there aren't. All the hanging places open out
     of the panels of the wall, there are no wardrobes, only beautiful marble-topped
      bureaux; but I was so tired.

A French Family at Home

I left Agnès to settle everything and jumped into bed. This morning I woke early, and had the
     loveliest cup of chocolate, but such a silly bath, and almost cold water. There are no
     housemaids, and nothing is done with precise regularity like at home, although they are so
     rich. Agnès had to fish for everything of that sort herself, and such a lot of talking went on
     in the passage between her and the valet de chambre, before I even got this teeny tiny
     tray to splash in. However, I did get dressed at last, and went for a walk in the garden—not a
     soul about but a few gardeners. The begonias are magnificent, but there is no look of park
     beyond the garden, or nice deer and things that we would have for such a house in England. It
     is more like a sort of big villa.
I saw Jean at last in the distance, going round and round a large pond on his bicycle. He did
     look odd! in a thick striped jersey, and the tightest knickerbockers; almost as low as a
     "scorcher." He jumped off and made a most polite bow, and explained he was doing it for
     exercise. But I do think that an idiotic reason—don't you, Mamma? It would be just as much
     exercise on a road. However, he assured me that, like that, he knew exactly how many miles he
     went on the flat before breakfast, so I suppose it was all right.
I saw he wanted to continue his ride, so I walked on, and presently came to a summer-house,
     where Victorine and the dame de compagnie were doing their morning reading. There were
     also the two little girls building castles out of a heap of sand, and with them the most
     hideous German maid you ever saw. They are queer-looking little monkeys, Yolande is like Jean,
     but Marie—there are three years between them—is as black as ink—but where was I? Oh,
     yes!--well, by this time I was so hungry I could have eaten them, German bonne and
     all! Fortunately Godmamma turned up, and we strolled back to déjeûner. Héloise was in
     the salon, and she is charming, such a contrast to the rest of the party. She was beautifully
     dressed and so chic. We took to each other at once, she has not picked up that solid
     married look like Jean, so perhaps it is only the husbands who get it in France.
There was a good deal of ceremony going in to breakfast. Jean gave his mother his arm, and we
     trotted behind. The dining-room is a perfect room, except there is no carpet, and the food was
     lovely, only I do hate to see a great hand covered with a white cotton glove, plopping a dish
     down on the lighted thing in the middle, so that one has to look at the next course all the
     time one is finishing the last one. The way in which the two little monkeys and the German maid
     devoured their breakfast quite took one's appetite away. There seemed to be numbers of
     men-servants, who wore white cotton gloves, and their liveries buttoned up to the throat, which
     takes away that nice clean-shirt-look of our servants at home.

French Servants

This afternoon we are going to pay a visit of ceremony to the Comte and Comtesse de
     Tournelle; we are going with them on their yacht down the Seine to-morrow. It is Jean and
     Héloise who have arranged to take me—it is kind of them, and it will be fun; and I am glad it
     is not considered proper for young French girls to go without their mothers, because we shall
     get rid of Victorine, and the voyage will be more agreeable. Agnès and the other maids and
     valets are going by train, and will meet us with the luggage at the different places we stop at
     each night, as the Sauterelle is too small to carry everything. I must go and get
     ready now, so good-bye, dear Mamma.—Your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.
