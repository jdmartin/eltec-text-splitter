A Visit to Rouen

Dearest Mamma,—To-day has been the loveliest I ever remember, not a cloud in the sky. We
     landed at Rouen the day before yesterday about six, and the hotel we stopped at was quite
     decent, and although the windows of my room looked upon the inner courtyard they at least had
     shutters. I wanted to go and see the marks the flames of Joan of Arc's burning had made on the
     wall, but every one was so hungry, we had to have dinner so early, there wasn't time.
      Canard à la Rouennaise is good, it is done here with a wine called Grenache.
     I had two helpings, and just as we were finishing, the Vicomte and "Antoine" came in from the
     station. They aren't in uniform now, but their hair does stick up so, and somehow their clothes
     don't look comfortable. I liked them in uniform best. Madame de Vermandoise talked to "Antoine"
     across the table quite a lot. That is the only way one may speak directly to a person, it
     seems. After dinner we went in search of some place of amusement, but there was no theatre
     open, so we had to content ourselves with a walk along the quay, and then we came back and
     drank sirop. It is sweet and nice, and you can have it raspberry, or
     gooseberry, or what you like, and I am sure if the people in England who drink nasty old ports
     and things could have it they would like it much better. The Baronne calls all the men by their
     end names like "Tournelle," "Croixmare," "Trémors," etc., and every one is very devoted to
     her, and I daresay she is even older than you, mamma; isn't it wonderful? Jean now always sits
     beside me, I suppose he thinks he is my host, but I would rather have the Vicomte de la
     Trémors, who is very amusing. But to go back to Rouen. It was a treat to sleep fearlessly in a
     clean bed after Vernon, and I actually had a bath in the morning. I don't know where Agnès
     retrieved it from.

"Coiffer St. Catherine"

You can see Joan of Arc's flames quite plain, we went there as soon as we were dressed.
     "Antoine" would insist it was only the black from a smoky chimney, but I paid no attention to
     him. The Horloge is nice, and we did a lot of churches, but they always look to me
     just the same, and any way they all smell alike, and I don't think I shall bother with any
     more. We had breakfast on the Sauterelle, but it was so fine after we left Vernon, and
     yesterday, that we could have it each day in the bows under the awning, and so had not to wash
     our forks and plates. The Châteaux are so picturesque, and such woods! after you leave Rouen.
     Héloise did not sleep yesterday. "Antoine" talked so much, no one could really have had a
     comfortable nap. In the afternoon the Marquise told us our fortunes; she said Héloise would
     marry twice, which made her look as pleased as Punch, but Jean did not think it at all funny,
     though every one else laughed She told me I should probably be an old maid ("Coiffer St.
      Catherine"), and so I said in that case I should run pins into the horrid old saint's
     head: I simply won't be an old maid, Mamma, so they need not make any more
     predictions. However, it would be worse to be one here than at home, because even up to forty,
     if you aren't married, you mayn't go to the nice theatres, or talk to people alone, or even
     speak much more than "Yes" and "No," and you generally get a nasty moustache or something. We
     saw a whole family of elderly girls at our hotel at Rouen, and they all had moustaches or moles
     on the cheek.
We got here (Caudebec) yesterday soon after four. Our inn looks right on to the Seine, and is
     as old nearly as the one at Vernon, but fortunately beautifully clean. Only you have to get at
     your room through somebody else's. Mine is beyond the Baronne's and Madame de Vermandoise gets
     at hers through the Comtesse de Tournelle's. Hers is the most ridiculous place, with a red
     curtain hanging across so that sometimes it can be turned into two; and such a thing happened
     last night. "Antoine" went in with the Comte de Tournelle to help him to shut the window, as
     Madame de Tournelle couldn't, when a gust of wind blew the door shut, and whether there was a
     spring lock or not I don't know, but any way nothing would induce it to open again. So there
     they were. We had stayed up rather late; the landlord and the servants were in bed. They
     rattled and shook and pushed, but to no purpose.

A Misadventure

There was only a board partition between my room and Madame de Vermandoise's, so I could hear
     everything, and Tournelle said there was nothing for it but that "Antoine" would have to sleep
     in the other bed in her room. She screamed a great deal, and they all laughed very much, and
     all talked at once, so I suppose that was why I could not understand quite everything they were
     saying. At last the Baronne rushed into my room to discover what the noise was. She looks
     perfectly odd when going to bed; a good deal seemed to have come off; she is as thin
     as a lath; and on the dressing table was such a sweet lace nightcap, with lovely baby curls
     sewed to its edge, and when she put that on she did look sweet. It isn't that she has no hair
     herself, it's thick and brown; but she explained that having to wear a nightcap because of
     ear-ache, she found it more becoming with the curls. I suppose it is on account of the waiters
     coming in with the breakfast that they have to be so particular in France how they look in
     bed.
But to go on about the door. We sent the Baronne's maid and Agnès to try and find the
     landlord; but, after exploring untold depths below and above, they only succeeded in unearthing
     Hippolyte. He came up from his bed looking just like that very clever Missing Link that was at
     Barnum's, do you remember?—the one that sometimes was an Irishwoman, and could do housework in
     a cage by itself. I don't know exactly what Hippolyte had on, but it ended up with a petticoat
     of red and black plaid, and a pair of grey linen trousers over his shoulders; his whiskers and
     hair were standing straight on end, and his shaved bits were bluer than ever at night. He said
     a good deal of the French equivalent of, "Here's a pretty kettle of fish," and shrugged so that
     I was afraid the petticoat would slip off; and finally, when all the pushing and pulling had no
     effect on the door, he said people must resign themselves to the accidents of travel, and as
     there were four beds, he did not see that they had too much to complain of.

"Not Much to Complain of"

At this moment Héloise came out of her room to see what the commotion was. She understood it
     was her husband locked in the room, and she laughed too very much, and said they must just stay
     there; but when she heard the voice of "Antoine" she seemed to think the situation grave—I
     suppose because he is not married—and she also did everything she could to open the door. Of
     course if they had been Englishmen they would have simply kicked it down, and got out without
     more ado, but the French aren't strong enough for that.
Héloise became quite disagreeable about it, though as it wasn't Jean I can't think what
     business it was of hers. She said it was because "Antoine" did not really try, and she was sure
     he had done it on purpose, upon which Madame de Vermandoise gurgled with mirth. I could hear
     both sides you see, because of the wooden partition. "Antoine" came into the inner room and
     said he was "Doux comme un petit agneau," but the Marquise said that he was "Un loup dans une
     peau de mouton," and must go away. Finally the whole of the rest of the party in different
     stages of déshabillé got collected outside the door. No landlord was to be found
     anywhere. Then the old Baron suggested quite a simple plan, which was for Madame de Tournelle
     to share Madame de Vermandoise's room, and to leave the Comte and "Antoine" in her room.
No one seemed to have thought of this before; and that is what they finally did, and at last
     we got to sleep. In the morning no landlord could still be found, and we had no coffee, but
     presently he arrived accompanied by two gendarmes and goodness knows what other rabble
     armed with sticks, and they wanted to proceed upstairs. We heard every sort of
      "Sacrés!" going on between them and Hippolyte, and eventually the landlord almost
     crawled up apologising, and opened the door with his key.

A Cautious Landlord

It appears that hearing the noise of the door being tried to be opened and Madame de
     Vermandoise's screams, he had thought it wiser to decamp for the night, as two years ago there
     had been a murder there, and he had had "beaucoup d'embêtement," he said, on account of it, and
     was determined not to be mixed up in one again, "En ces affaires là, il est bien assez tôt
     d'arriver le lendemain," he said.
Everybody was still laughing too much over the situation to be angry with him; and the
     coffee, which we got at last, was so good it made up for it; but you should have heard the
      plaisanteries they made over the night's adventure!
Caudebec is an odd place; it used to be inhabited by hundreds of Protestant beaver
     hat-makers, who fled from there after the Edict of Nantes' affair, and so there are streets of
     deserted houses still, and so old, one has a stream down the middle. I would not go into the
     church: the usual smell met me at the door; so the Vicomte and Jean and I went for a walk, and
     now we are just going to start on the Sauterelle again, and this must be posted. I
     have managed to write it on my knee, sitting on a stone bench outside the inn door.—Good-bye,
     dear Mamma, with love from your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.
