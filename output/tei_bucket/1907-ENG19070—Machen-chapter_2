II
Lucian was growing really anxious about his manuscript. He had gained enough experience at
     twenty-three to know that editors and publishers must not be hurried; but his book had been
     lying at Messrs Beit's office for more than three months. For six weeks he had not dared to
     expect an answer, but afterwards life had become agonizing. Every morning, at post-time, the
     poor wretch nearly choked with anxiety to know whether his sentence had arrived, and the rest
     of the day was racked with alternate pangs of hope and despair. Now and then he was almost
     assured of success; conning over these painful and eager pages in memory, he found parts that
     were admirable, while again, his inexperience reproached him, and he feared he had written a
     raw and awkward book, wholly unfit for print. Then he would compare what he remembered of it
     with notable magazine articles and books praised by reviewers, and fancy that after all there
     might be good points in the thing; he could not help liking the first chapter for instance.
     Perhaps the letter might come tomorrow. So it went on; week after week of sick torture made
     more exquisite by such gleams of hope; it was as if he were stretched in anguish on the rack,
     and the pain relaxed and kind words spoken now and again by the tormentors, and then once more
     the grinding pang and burning agony. At last he could bear suspense no longer, and he wrote to
     Messrs Beit, inquiring in a humble manner whether the manuscript had arrived in safety. The
     firm replied in a very polite letter, expressing regret that their reader had been suffering
     from a cold in the head, and had therefore been unable to send in his report. A final decision
     was promised in a week's time, and the letter ended with apologies for the delay and a hope
     that he had suffered no inconvenience. Of course the "final decision" did not come at the end
     of the week, but the book was returned at the end of three weeks, with a circular thanking the
     author for his kindness in submitting the manuscript, and regretting that the firm did not see
     their way to producing it. He felt relieved; the operation that he had dreaded and deprecated
     for so long was at last over, and he would no longer grow sick of mornings when the letters
     were brought in. He took his parcel to the sunny corner of the garden, where the old wooden
     seat stood sheltered from the biting March winds. Messrs Beit had put in with the circular one
     of their short lists, a neat booklet, headed: Messrs Beit & Co.'s Recent
      Publications.
He settled himself comfortably on the seat, lit his pipe, and began to read: "A Bad Un to
      Beat: a Novel of Sporting Life, by the Honorable Mrs. Scudamore Runnymede, author of
      Yoicks, With the Mudshire Pack, The Sportleigh Stables, etc., etc., 3 vols. At all
     Libraries." The Press, it seemed, pronounced this to be a "charming book. Mrs.
     Runnymede has wit and humor enough to furnish forth half-a-dozen ordinary sporting novels."
     "Told with the sparkle and vivacity of a past-mistress in the art of novel writing," said the
      Review; while Miranda, of Smart Society, positively bubbled with enthusiasm.
     "You must forgive me, Aminta," wrote this young person, "if I have not sent the description I
     promised of Madame Lulu's new creations and others of that ilk. I must a tale unfold; Tom came
     in yesterday and began to rave about the Honorable Mrs. Scudamore Runnymede's last novel, A
      Bad Un to Beat. He says all the Smart Set are talking of it, and it seems the police have
     to regulate the crowd at Mudie's. You know I read everything Mrs. Runnymede writes, so I set
     out Miggs directly to beg, borrow or steal a copy, and I confess I burnt the midnight oil
     before I laid it down. Now, mind you get it, you will find it so awfully chic." Nearly
     all the novelists on Messrs Beit's list were ladies, their works all ran to three volumes, and
     all of them pleased the Press, the Review, and Miranda of Smart
      Society. One of these books, Millicent's Marriage, by Sarah Pocklington Sanders,
     was pronounced fit to lie on the school-room table, on the drawing-room bookshelf, or beneath
     the pillow of the most gently nurtured of our daughters. "This," the reviewer went on, "is high
     praise, especially in these days when we are deafened by the loud-voiced clamor of self-styled
     'artists.' We would warn the young men who prate so persistently of style and literature,
     construction and prose harmonies, that we believe the English reading public will have none of
     them. Harmless amusement, a gentle flow of domestic interest, a faithful reproduction of the
     open and manly life of the hunting field, pictures of innocent and healthy English girlhood
     such as Miss Sanders here affords us; these are the topics that will always find a welcome in
     our homes, which remain bolted and barred against the abandoned artist and the scrofulous
     stylist."
He turned over the pages of the little book and chuckled in high relish; he discovered an
     honest enthusiasm, a determination to strike a blow for the good and true that refreshed and
     exhilarated. A beaming face, spectacled and whiskered probably, an expansive waistcoat, and a
     tender heart, seemed to shine through the words which Messrs Beit had quoted; and the
     alliteration of the final sentence; that was good too; there was style for you if you wanted
     it. The champion of the blushing cheek and the gushing eye showed that he too could handle the
     weapons of the enemy if he cared to trouble himself with such things. Lucian leant back and
     roared with indecent laughter till the tabby tom-cat who had succeeded to the poor dead beasts
     looked up reproachfully from his sunny corner, with a face like the reviewer's, innocent and
     round and whiskered. At last he turned to his parcel and drew out some half-dozen sheets of
     manuscript, and began to read in a rather desponding spirit; it was pretty obvious, he thought,
     that the stuff was poor and beneath the standard of publication. The book had taken a year and
     a half in the making; it was a pious attempt to translate into English prose the form and
     mystery of the domed hills, the magic of occult valleys, the sound of the red swollen brook
     swirling through leafless woods. Day-dreams and toil at nights had gone into the eager pages,
     he had labored hard to do his very best, writing and rewriting, weighing his cadences,
     beginning over and over again, grudging no patience, no trouble if only it might be pretty
     good; good enough to print and sell to a reading public which had become critical. He glanced
     through the manuscript in his hand, and to his astonishment, he could not help thinking that in
     its measure it was decent work. After three months his prose seemed fresh and strange as if it
     had been wrought by another man, and in spite of himself he found charming things, and
     impressions that were not commonplace. He knew how weak it all was compared with his own
     conceptions; he had seen an enchanted city, awful, glorious, with flame smitten about its
     battlements, like the cities of the Sangraal, and he had molded his copy in such poor clay as
     came to his hand; yet, in spite of the gulf that yawned between the idea and the work, he knew
     as he read that the thing accomplished was very far from a failure. He put back the leaves
     carefully, and glanced again at Messrs Beit's list. It had escaped his notice that A Bad Un
      to Beat was in its third three-volume edition. It was a great thing, at all events, to
     know in what direction to aim, if he wished to succeed. If he worked hard, he thought, he might
     some day win the approval of the coy and retiring Miranda of Smart Society; that
     modest maiden might in his praise interrupt her task of disinterested advertisement, her
     philanthropic counsels to "go to Jumper's, and mind you ask for Mr. C. Jumper, who will show
     you the lovely blue paper with the yellow spots at ten shillings the piece." He put down the
     pamphlet, and laughed again at the books and the reviewers: so that he might not weep. This
     then was English fiction, this was English criticism, and farce, after all, was but an
     ill-played tragedy.
The rejected manuscript was hidden away, and his father quoted Horace's maxim as to the
     benefit of keeping literary works for some time "in the wood." There was nothing to grumble at,
     though Lucian was inclined to think the duration of the reader's catarrh a little exaggerated.
     But this was a trifle; he did not arrogate to himself the position of a small commercial
     traveler, who expects prompt civility as a matter of course, and not at all as a favor. He
     simply forgot his old book, and resolved that he would make a better one if he could. With the
     hot fit of resolution, the determination not to be snuffed out by one refusal upon him, he
     began to beat about in his mind for some new scheme. At first it seemed that he had hit upon a
     promising subject; he began to plot out chapters and scribble hints for the curious story that
     had entered his mind, arranging his circumstances and noting the effects to be produced with
     all the enthusiasm of the artist. But after the first breath the aspect of the work changed;
     page after page was tossed aside as hopeless, the beautiful sentences he had dreamed of refused
     to be written, and his puppets remained stiff and wooden, devoid of life or motion. Then all
     the old despairs came back, the agonies of the artificer who strives and perseveres in vain;
     the scheme that seemed of amorous fire turned to cold hard ice in his hands. He let the pen
     drop from his fingers, and wondered how he could have ever dreamed of writing books. Again, the
     thought occurred that he might do something if he could only get away, and join the sad
     procession in the murmuring London streets, far from the shadow of those awful hills. But it
     was quite impossible; the relative who had once promised assistance was appealed to, and wrote
     expressing his regret that Lucian had turned out a "loafer," wasting his time in scribbling,
     instead of trying to earn his living. Lucian felt rather hurt at this letter, but the parson
     only grinned grimly as usual. He was thinking of how he signed a check many years before, in
     the days of his prosperity, and the check was payable to this didactic relative, then in but a
     poor way, and of a thankful turn of mind.
The old rejected manuscript had almost passed out of his recollection. It was recalled oddly
     enough. He was looking over the Reader, and enjoying the admirable literary
     criticisms, some three months after the return of his book, when his eye was attracted by a
     quoted passage in one of the notices. The thought and style both wakened memory, the cadences
     were familiar and beloved. He read through the review from the beginning; it was a very
     favorable one, and pronounced the volume an immense advance on Mr. Ritson's previous work.
     "Here, undoubtedly, the author has discovered a vein of pure metal," the reviewer added, "and
     we predict that he will go far." Lucian had not yet reached his father's stage, he was unable
     to grin in the manner of that irreverent parson. The passage selected for high praise was taken
     almost word for word from the manuscript now resting in his room, the work that had not reached
     the high standard of Messrs Beit & Co., who, curiously enough, were the publishers of the
     book reviewed in the Reader. He had a few shillings in his possession, and wrote at
     once to a bookseller in London for a copy of The Chorus in Green, as the author had
     oddly named the book. He wrote on June 21st and thought he might fairly expect to receive the
     interesting volume by the 24th; but the postman, true to his tradition, brought nothing for
     him, and in the afternoon he resolved to walk down to Caermaen, in case it might have come by a
     second post; or it might have been mislaid at the office; they forgot parcels sometimes,
     especially when the bag was heavy and the weather hot. This 24th was a sultry and oppressive
     day; a grey veil of cloud obscured the sky, and a vaporous mist hung heavily over the land, and
     fumed up from the valleys. But at five o'clock, when he started, the clouds began to break, and
     the sunlight suddenly streamed down through the misty air, making ways and channels of rich
     glory, and bright islands in the gloom. It was a pleasant and shining evening when, passing by
     devious back streets to avoid the barbarians (as he very rudely called the respectable
     inhabitants of the town), he reached the post-office; which was also the general shop.
"Yes, Mr. Taylor, there is something for you, sir," said the man. "Williams the postman
     forgot to take it up this morning," and he handed over the packet. Lucian took it under his arm
     and went slowly through the ragged winding lanes till he came into the country. He got over the
     first stile on the road, and sitting down in the shelter of a hedge, cut the strings and opened
     the parcel. The Chorus in Green was got up in what reviewers call a dainty manner: a
     bronze-green cloth, well-cut gold lettering, wide margins and black "old-face" type, all
     witnessed to the good taste of Messrs Beit & Co. He cut the pages hastily and began to
     read. He soon found that he had wronged Mr. Ritsonâ€”that old literary hand had by no means
     stolen his book wholesale, as he had expected. There were about two hundred pages in the pretty
     little volume, and of these about ninety were Lucian's, dovetailed into a rather different
     scheme with skill that was nothing short of exquisite. And Mr. Ritson's own work was often very
     good; spoilt here and there for some tastes by the "cataloguing" method, a somewhat
     materialistic way of taking an inventory of the holy country things; but, for that very reason,
     contrasting to a great advantage with Lucian's hints and dreams and note of haunting. And here
     and there Mr. Ritson had made little alterations in the style of the passages he had conveyed,
     and most of these alterations were amendments, as Lucian was obliged to confess, though he
     would have liked to argue one or two points with his collaborator and corrector. He lit his
     pipe and leant back comfortably in the hedge, thinking things over, weighing very coolly his
     experience of humanity, his contact with the "society" of the countryside, the affair of the
      The Chorus in Green, and even some little incidents that had struck him as he was
     walking through the streets of Caermaen that evening. At the post-office, when he was inquiring
     for his parcel, he had heard two old women grumbling in the street; it seemed, so far as he
     could make out, that both had been disappointed in much the same way. One was a Roman Catholic,
     hardened, and beyond the reach of conversion; she had been advised to ask alms of the priests,
     "who are always creeping and crawling about." The other old sinner was a Dissenter, and, "Mr.
     Dixon has quite enough to do to relieve good Church people."
Mrs. Dixon, assisted by Henrietta, was, it seemed, the lady high almoner, who dispensed these
     charities. As she said to Mrs. Colley, they would end by keeping all the beggars in the county,
     and they really couldn't afford it. A large family was an expensive thing, and the girls
      must have new frocks. "Mr. Dixon is always telling me and the girls that we must not
      demoralize the people by indiscriminate charity." Lucian had heard of these sage
     counsels, and through it them as he listened to the bitter complaints of the gaunt, hungry old
     women. In the back street by which he passed out of the town he saw a large "healthy" boy
     kicking a sick cat; the poor creature had just strength enough to crawl under an outhouse door;
     probably to die in torments. He did not find much satisfaction in thrashing the boy, but he did
     it with hearty good will. Further on, at the corner where the turnpike used to be, was a big
     notice, announcing a meeting at the school-room in aid of the missions to the Portuguese.
     "Under the Patronage of the Lord Bishop of the Diocese," was the imposing headline; the
     Reverend Merivale Dixon, vicar of Caermaen, was to be in the chair, supported by Stanley
     Gervase, Esq., J.P., and by many of the clergy and gentry of the neighborhood. Senhor Diabo,
     "formerly a Romanist priest, now an evangelist in Lisbon," would address the meeting. "Funds
     are urgently needed to carry on this good work," concluded the notice. So he lay well back in
     the shade of the hedge, and thought whether some sort of an article could not be made by
     vindicating the terrible Yahoos; one might point out that they were in many respects a simple
     and unsophisticated race, whose faults were the result of their enslaved position, while such
     virtues as they had were all their own. They might be compared, he thought, much to their
     advantage, with more complex civilizations. There was no hint of anything like the Beit system
     of publishing in existence amongst them; the great Yahoo nation would surely never feed and
     encourage a scabby Houyhnhnm, expelled for his foulness from the horse-community, and the witty
     dean, in all his minuteness, had said nothing of "safe" Yahoos. On reflection, however, he did
     not feel quite secure of this part of his defense; he remembered that the leading brutes had
     favorites, who were employed in certain simple domestic offices about their masters, and it
     seemed doubtful whether the contemplated vindication would not break down on this point. He
     smiled queerly to himself as he thought of these comparisons, but his heart burned with a dull
     fury. Throwing back his unhappy memory, he recalled all the contempt and scorn he had suffered;
     as a boy he had heard the masters murmuring their disdain of him and of his desire to learn
     other than ordinary school work. As a young man he had suffered the insolence of these wretched
     people about him; their cackling laughter at his poverty jarred and grated in his ears; he saw
     the acrid grin of some miserable idiot woman, some creature beneath the swine in intelligence
     and manners, merciless, as he went by with his eyes on the dust, in his ragged clothes. He and
     his father seemed to pass down an avenue of jeers and contempt, and contempt from such animals
     as these! This putrid filth, molded into human shape, made only to fawn on the rich and
     beslaver them, thinking no foulness too foul if it were done in honor of those in power and
     authority; and no refined cruelty of contempt too cruel if it were contempt of the poor and
     humble and oppressed; it was to this obscene and ghastly throng that he was something to be
     pointed at. And these men and women spoke of sacred things, and knelt before the awful altar of
     God, before the altar of tremendous fire, surrounded as they professed by Angels and Archangels
     and all the Company of Heaven; and in their very church they had one aisle for the rich and
     another for the poor. And the species was not peculiar to Caermaen; the rich business men in
     London and the successful brother author were probably amusing themselves at the expense of the
     poor struggling creature they had injured and wounded; just as the "healthy" boy had burst into
     a great laugh when the miserable sick cat cried out in bitter agony, and trailed its limbs
     slowly, as it crept away to die. Lucian looked into his own life and his own will; he saw that
     in spite of his follies, and his want of success, he had not been consciously malignant, he had
     never deliberately aided in oppression, or looked on it with enjoyment and approval, and he
     felt that when he lay dead beneath the earth, eaten by swarming worms, he would be in a purer
     company than now, when he lived amongst human creatures. And he was to call this loathsome
     beast, all sting and filth, brother! "I had rather call the devils my brothers," he said in his
     heart, "I would fare better in hell." Blood was in his eyes, and as he looked up the sky seemed
     of blood, and the earth burned with fire.
The sun was sinking low on the mountain when he set out on the way again. Burrows, the
     doctor, coming home in his trap, met him a little lower on the road, and gave him a friendly
     good-night.
"A long way round on this road, isn't it?" said the doctor. "As you have come so far, why
     don't you try the short cut across the fields? You will find it easily enough; second stile on
     the left hand, and then go straight ahead."
He thanked Dr. Burrows and said he would try the short cut, and Burrows span on homeward. He
     was a gruff and honest bachelor, and often felt very sorry for the lad, and wished he could
     help him. As he drove on, it suddenly occurred to him that Lucian had an awful look on his
     face, and he was sorry he had not asked him to jump in, and to come to supper. A hearty slice
     of beef, with strong ale, whisky and soda afterwards, a good pipe, and certain Rabelaisian
     tales which the doctor had treasured for many years, would have done the poor fellow a lot of
     good, he was certain. He half turned round on his seat, and looked to see if Lucian were still
     in sight, but he had passed the corner, and the doctor drove on, shivering a little; the mists
     were beginning to rise from the wet banks of the river.
Lucian trailed slowly along the road, keeping a look out for the stile the doctor had
     mentioned. It would be a little of an adventure, he thought, to find his way by an unknown
     track; he knew the direction in which his home lay, and he imagined he would not have much
     difficulty in crossing from one stile to another. The path led him up a steep bare field, and
     when he was at the top, the town and the valley winding up to the north stretched before him.
     The river was stilled at the flood, and the yellow water, reflecting the sunset, glowed in its
     deep pools like dull brass. These burning pools, the level meadows fringed with shuddering
     reeds, the long dark sweep of the forest on the hill, were all clear and distinct, yet the
     light seemed to have clothed them with a new garment, even as voices from the streets of
     Caermaen sounded strangely, mounting up thin with the smoke. There beneath him lay the huddled
     cluster of Caermaen, the ragged and uneven roofs that marked the winding and sordid streets,
     here and there a pointed gable rising above its meaner fellows; beyond he recognized the piled
     mounds that marked the circle of the amphitheatre, and the dark edge of trees that grew where
     the Roman wall whitened and waxed old beneath the frosts and rains of eighteen hundred years.
     Thin and strange, mingled together, the voices came up to him on the hill; it was as if an
     outland race inhabited the ruined city and talked in a strange language of strange and terrible
     things. The sun had slid down the sky, and hung quivering over the huge dark dome of the
     mountain like a burnt sacrifice, and then suddenly vanished. In the afterglow the clouds began
     to writhe and turn scarlet, and shone so strangely reflected in the pools of the snake-like
     river, that one would have said the still waters stirred, the fleeting and changing of the
     clouds seeming to quicken the stream, as if it bubbled and sent up gouts of blood. But already
     about the town the darkness was forming; fast, fast the shadows crept upon it from the forest,
     and from all sides banks and wreaths of curling mist were gathering, as if a ghostly leaguer
     were being built up against the city, and the strange race who lived in its streets. Suddenly
     there burst out from the stillness the clear and piercing music of the réveillé,
     calling, recalling, iterated, reiterated, and ending with one long high fierce shrill note with
     which the steep hills rang. Perhaps a boy in the school band was practicing on his bugle, but
     for Lucian it was magic. For him it was the note of the Roman trumpet, tuba mirum spargens
      sonum, filling all the hollow valley with its command, reverberated in dark places in the
     far forest, and resonant in the old graveyards without the walls. In his imagination he saw the
     earthen gates of the tombs broken open, and the serried legion swarming to the eagles. Century
     by century they passed by; they rose, dripping, from the river bed, they rose from the level,
     their armor shone in the quiet orchard, they gathered in ranks and companies from the cemetery,
     and as the trumpet sounded, the hill fort above the town gave up its dead. By hundreds and
     thousands the ghostly battle surged about the standard, behind the quaking mist, ready to march
     against the moldering walls they had built so many years before.
He turned sharply; it was growing very dark, and he was afraid of missing his way. At first
     the path led him by the verge of a wood; there was a noise of rustling and murmuring from the
     trees as if they were taking evil counsel together. A high hedge shut out the sight of the
     darkening valley, and he stumbled on mechanically, without taking much note of the turnings of
     the track, and when he came out from the wood shadow to the open country, he stood for a moment
     quite bewildered and uncertain. A dark wild twilight country lay before him, confused dim
     shapes of trees near at hand, and a hollow below his feet, and the further hills and woods were
     dimmer, and all the air was very still. Suddenly the darkness about him glowed; a furnace fire
     had shot up on the mountain, and for a moment the little world of the woodside and the steep
     hill shone in a pale light, and he thought he saw his path beaten out in the turf before him.
     The great flame sank down to a red glint of fire, and it led him on down the ragged slope, his
     feet striking against ridges of ground, and falling from beneath him at a sudden dip. The
     bramble bushes shot out long prickly vines, amongst which he was entangled, and lower he was
     held back by wet bubbling earth. He had descended into a dark and shady valley, beset and
     tapestried with gloomy thickets; the weird wood noises were the only sounds, strange,
     unutterable mutterings, dismal, inarticulate. He pushed on in what he hoped was the right
     direction, stumbling from stile to gate, peering through mist and shadow, and still vainly
     seeking for any known landmark. Presently another sound broke upon the grim air, the murmur of
     water poured over stones, gurgling against the old misshapen roots of trees, and running clear
     in a deep channel. He passed into the chill breath of the brook, and almost fancied he heard
     two voices speaking in its murmur; there seemed a ceaseless utterance of words, an endless
     argument. With a mood of horror pressing on him, he listened to the noise of waters, and the
     wild fancy seized him that he was not deceived, that two unknown beings stood together there in
     the darkness and tried the balances of his life, and spoke his doom. The hour in the matted
     thicket rushed over the great bridge of years to his thought; he had sinned against the earth,
     and the earth trembled and shook for vengeance. He stayed still for a moment, quivering with
     fear, and at last went on blindly, no longer caring for the path, if only he might escape from
     the toils of that dismal shuddering hollow. As he plunged through the hedges the bristling
     thorns tore his face and hands; he fell amongst stinging-nettles and was pricked as he beat out
     his way amidst the gorse. He raced headlong, his head over his shoulder, through a windy wood,
     bare of undergrowth; there lay about the ground moldering stumps, the relics of trees that had
     thundered to their fall, crashing and tearing to earth, long ago; and from these remains there
     flowed out a pale thin radiance, filling the spaces of the sounding wood with a dream of light.
     He had lost all count of the track; he felt he had fled for hours, climbing and descending, and
     yet not advancing; it was as if he stood still and the shadows of the land went by, in a
     vision. But at last a hedge, high and straggling, rose before him, and as he broke through it,
     his feet slipped, and he fell headlong down a steep bank into a lane. He lay still,
     half-stunned, for a moment, and then rising unsteadily, he looked desperately into the darkness
     before him, uncertain and bewildered. In front it was black as a midnight cellar, and he turned
     about, and saw a glint in the distance, as if a candle were flickering in a farm-house window.
     He began to walk with trembling feet towards the light, when suddenly something pale started
     out from the shadows before him, and seemed to swim and float down the air. He was going down
     hill, and he hastened onwards, and he could see the bars of a stile framed dimly against the
     sky, and the figure still advanced with that gliding motion. Then, as the road declined to the
     valley, the landmark he had been seeking appeared. To his right there surged up in the darkness
     the darker summit of the Roman fort, and the streaming fire of the great full moon glowed
     through the bars of the wizard oaks, and made a halo shine about the hill. He was now quite
     close to the white appearance, and saw that it was only a woman walking swiftly down the lane;
     the floating movement was an effect due to the somber air and the moon's glamour. At the gate,
     where he had spent so many hours gazing at the fort, they walked foot to foot, and he saw it
     was Annie Morgan.
"Good evening, Master Lucian," said the girl, "it's very dark, sir, indeed."
"Good evening, Annie," he answered, calling her by her name for the first time, and he saw
     that she smiled with pleasure. "You are out late, aren't you?"
"Yes, sir; but I've been taking a bit of supper to old Mrs. Gibbon. She's been very poorly
     the last few days, and there's nobody to do anything for her."
Then there were really people who helped one another; kindness and pity were not mere myths,
     fictions of "society," as useful as Doe and Roe, and as non-existent. The thought struck Lucian
     with a shock; the evening's passion and delirium, the wild walk and physical fatigue had almost
     shattered him in body and mind. He was "degenerate," decadent, and the rough rains and
     blustering winds of life, which a stronger man would have laughed at and enjoyed, were to him
     "hail-storms and fire-showers." After all, Messrs Beit, the publishers, were only sharp men of
     business, and these terrible Dixons and Gervases and Colleys merely the ordinary limited clergy
     and gentry of a quiet country town; sturdier sense would have dismissed Dixon as an old humbug,
     Stanley Gervase, Esquire, J.P., as a "bit of a bounder," and the ladies as "rather a shoddy
     lot." But he was walking slowly now in painful silence, his heavy, lagging feet striking
     against the loose stones. He was not thinking of the girl beside him; only something seemed to
     swell and grow and swell within his heart; it was all the torture of his days, weary hopes and
     weary disappointment, scorn rankling and throbbing, and the thought "I had rather call the
     devils my brothers and live with them in hell." He choked and gasped for breath, and felt
     involuntary muscles working in his face, and the impulses of a madman stirring him; he himself
     was in truth the realization of the vision of Caermaen that night, a city with moldering walls
     beset by the ghostly legion. Life and the world and the laws of the sunlight had passed away,
     and the resurrection and kingdom of the dead began. The Celt assailed him, becoming from the
     weird wood he called the world, and his far-off ancestors, the "little people," crept out of
     their caves, muttering charms and incantations in hissing inhuman speech; he was beleaguered by
     desires that had slept in his race for ages.
"I am afraid you are very tired, Master Lucian. Would you like me to give you my hand over
     this rough bit?"
He had stumbled against a great round stone and had nearly fallen. The woman's hand sought
     his in the darkness; as he felt the touch of the soft warm flesh he moaned, and a pang shot
     through his arm to his heart. He looked up and found he had only walked a few paces since Annie
     had spoken; he had thought they had wandered for hours together. The moon was just mounting
     above the oaks, and the halo round the dark hill brightened. He stopped short, and keeping his
     hold of Annie's hand, looked into her face. A hazy glory of moonlight shone around them and lit
     up their eyes. He had not greatly altered since his boyhood; his face was pale olive in color,
     thin and oval; marks of pain had gathered about the eyes, and his black hair was already
     stricken with grey. But the eager, curious gaze still remained, and what he saw before him lit
     up his sadness with a new fire. She stopped too, and did not offer to draw away, but looked
     back with all her heart. They were alike in many ways; her skin was also of that olive color,
     but her face was sweet as a beautiful summer night, and her black eyes showed no dimness, and
     the smile on the scarlet lips was like a flame when it brightens a dark and lonely land.
"You are sorely tired, Master Lucian, let us sit down here by the gate."
It was Lucian who spoke next: "My dear, my dear." And their lips were together again, and
     their arms locked together, each holding the other fast. And then the poor lad let his head
     sink down on his sweetheart's breast, and burst into a passion of weeping. The tears streamed
     down his face, and he shook with sobbing, in the happiest moment that he had ever lived. The
     woman bent over him and tried to comfort him, but his tears were his consolation and his
     triumph. Annie was whispering to him, her hand laid on his heart; she was whispering beautiful,
     wonderful words, that soothed him as a song. He did not know what they meant.
"Annie, dear, dear Annie, what are you saying to me? I have never heard such beautiful words.
     Tell me, Annie, what do they mean?"
She laughed, and said it was only nonsense that the nurses sang to the children.
"No, no, you are not to call me Master Lucian any more," he said, when they parted, "you must
     call me Lucian; and I, I worship you, my dear Annie."
He fell down before her, embracing her knees, and adored, and she allowed him, and confirmed
     his worship. He followed slowly after her, passing the path which led to her home with a
     longing glance. Nobody saw any difference in Lucian when he reached the rectory. He came in
     with his usual dreamy indifference, and told how he had lost his way by trying the short cut.
     He said he had met Dr. Burrows on the road, and that he had recommended the path by the fields.
     Then, as dully as if he had been reading some story out of a newspaper, he gave his father the
     outlines of the Beit case, producing the pretty little book called The Chorus in
     Green. The parson listened in amazement.
"You mean to tell me that you wrote this book?" he said. He was quite roused.
"No; not all of it. Look; that bit is mine, and that; and the beginning of this chapter.
     Nearly the whole of the third chapter is by me."
He closed the book without interest, and indeed he felt astonished at his father's
     excitement. The incident seemed to him unimportant.
"And you say that eighty or ninety pages of this book are yours, and these scoundrels have
     stolen your work?"
"Well, I suppose they have. I'll fetch the manuscript, if you would like to look at it."
The manuscript was duly produced, wrapped in brown paper, with Messrs Beit's address label on
     it, and the post-office dated stamps. 
"And the other book has been out a month." The parson, forgetting the sacerdotal office, and
     his good habit of grinning, swore at Messrs Beit and Mr. Ritson, calling them damned thieves,
     and then began to read the manuscript, and to compare it with the printed book.
"Why, it's splendid work. My poor fellow," he said after a while, "I had no notion you could
     write so well. I used to think of such things in the old days at Oxford; 'old Bill,' the tutor,
     used to praise my essays, but I never wrote anything like this. And this infernal ruffian of a
     Ritson has taken all your best things and mixed them up with his own rot to make it go down. Of
     course you'll expose the gang?"
Lucian was mildly amused; he couldn't enter into his father's feelings at all. He sat smoking
     in one of the old easy chairs, taking the rare relish of a hot grog with his pipe, and gazing
     out of his dreamy eyes at the violent old parson. He was pleased that his father liked his
     book, because he knew him to be a deep and sober scholar and a cool judge of good letters; but
     he laughed to himself when he saw the magic of print. The parson had expressed no wish to read
     the manuscript when it came back in disgrace; he had merely grinned, said something about
     boomerangs, and quoted Horace with relish. Whereas now, before the book in its neat case,
     lettered with another man's name, his approbation of the writing and his disapproval of the
     "scoundrels," as he called them, were loudly expressed, and, though a good smoker, he blew and
     puffed vehemently at his pipe.
"You'll expose the rascals, of course, won't you?" he said again.
"Oh no, I think not. It really doesn't matter much, does it? After all, there are some very
     weak things in the book; doesn't it strike you as 'young?' I have been thinking of another
     plan, but I haven't done much with it lately. But I believe I've got hold of a really good idea
     this time, and if I can manage to see the heart of it I hope to turn out a manuscript worth
     stealing. But it's so hard to get at the core of an ideaâ€”the heart, as I call it," he went on
     after a pause. "It's like having a box you can't open, though you know there's something
     wonderful inside. But I do believe I've a fine thing in my hands, and I mean to try my best to
     work it."
Lucian talked with enthusiasm now, but his father, on his side, could not share these ardors.
     It was his part to be astonished at excitement over a book that was not even begun, the mere
     ghost of a book flitting elusive in the world of unborn masterpieces and failures. He had loved
     good letters, but he shared unconsciously in the general belief that literary attempt is always
     pitiful, though he did not subscribe to the other half of the popular faithâ€”that literary
     success is a matter of very little importance. He thought well of books, but only of printed
     books; in manuscripts he put no faith, and the paulo-post-futurum tense he could not
     in any manner conjugate. He returned once more to the topic of palpable interest.
"But about this dirty trick these fellows have played on you. You won't sit quietly and bear
     it, surely? It's only a question of writing to the papers."
"They wouldn't put the letter in. And if they did, I should only get laughed at. Some time
     ago a man wrote to the Reader, complaining of his play being stolen. He said that he
     had sent a little one-act comedy to Burleigh, the great dramatist, asking for his advice.
     Burleigh gave his advice and took the idea for his own very successful play. So the man said,
     and I daresay it was true enough. But the victim got nothing by his complaint. 'A pretty state
     of things,' everybody said. 'Here's a Mr. Tomson, that no one has ever heard of, bothers
     Burleigh with his rubbish, and then accuses him of petty larceny. Is it likely that a man of
     Burleigh's position, a playwright who can make his five thousand a year easily, would borrow
     from an unknown Tomson?' I should think it very likely, indeed," Lucian went on, chuckling,
     "but that was their verdict. No; I don't think I'll write to the papers."
"Well, well, my boy, I suppose you know your own business best. I think you are mistaken, but
     you must do as you like."
"It's all so unimportant," said Lucian, and he really thought so. He had sweeter things to
     dream of, and desired no communion of feeling with that madman who had left Caermaen some few
     hours before. He felt he had made a fool of himself, he was ashamed to think of the fatuity of
     which he had been guilty, such boiling hatred was not only wicked, but absurd. A man could do
     no good who put himself into a position of such violent antagonism against his
     fellow-creatures; so Lucian rebuked his heart, saying that he was old enough to know better.
     But he remembered that he had sweeter things to dream of; there was a secret ecstasy that he
     treasured and locked tight away, as a joy too exquisite even for thought till he was quite
     alone; and then there was that scheme for a new book that he had laid down hopelessly some time
     ago; it seemed to have arisen into life again within the last hour; he understood that he had
     started on a false tack, he had taken the wrong aspect of his idea. Of course the thing
     couldn't be written in that way; it was like trying to read a page turned upside down; and he
     saw those characters he had vainly sought suddenly disambushed, and a splendid inevitable
     sequence of events unrolled before him.
It was a true resurrection; the dry plot he had constructed revealed itself as a living
     thing, stirring and mysterious, and warm as life itself. The parson was smoking stolidly to all
     appearance, but in reality he was full of amazement at his own son, and now and again he
     slipped sly furtive glances towards the tranquil young man in the arm-chair by the empty
     hearth. In the first place, Mr. Taylor was genuinely impressed by what he had read of Lucian's
     work; he had so long been accustomed to look upon all effort as futile that success amazed him.
     In the abstract, of course, he was prepared to admit that some people did write well and got
     published and made money, just as other persons successfully backed an outsider at heavy odds;
     but it had seemed as improbable that Lucian should show even the beginnings of achievement in
     one direction as in the other. Then the boy evidently cared so little about it; he did not
     appear to be proud of being worth robbing, nor was he angry with the robbers.
He sat back luxuriously in the disreputable old chair, drawing long slow wreaths of smoke,
     tasting his whisky from time to time, evidently well at ease with himself. The father saw him
     smile, and it suddenly dawned upon him that his son was very handsome; he had such kind gentle
     eyes and a kind mouth, and his pale cheeks were flushed like a girl's. Mr. Taylor felt moved.
     What a harmless young fellow Lucian had been; no doubt a little queer and different from
     others, but wholly inoffensive and patient under disappointment. And Miss Deacon, her
     contribution to the evening's discussion had been characteristic; she had remarked, firstly,
     that writing was a very unsettling occupation, and secondly, that it was extremely foolish to
     entrust one's property to people of whom one knew nothing. Father and son had smiled together
     at these observations, which were probably true enough. Mr. Taylor at last left Lucian along;
     he shook hands with a good deal of respect, and said, almost deferentially:
"You mustn't work too hard, old fellow. I wouldn't stay up too late, if I were you, after
     that long walk. You must have gone miles out of your way."
"I'm not tired now, though. I feel as if I could write my new book on the spot"; and the
     young man laughed a gay sweet laugh that struck the father as a new note in his son's life.
He sat still a moment after his father had left the room. He cherished his chief treasure of
     thought in its secret place; he would not enjoy it yet. He drew up a chair to the table at
     which he wrote or tried to write, and began taking pens and paper from the drawer. There was a
     great pile of ruled paper there; all of it used, on one side, and signifying many hours of
     desperate scribbling, of heart-searching and rack of his brain; an array of poor, eager lines
     written by a waning fire with waning hope; all useless and abandoned. He took up the sheets
     cheerfully, and began in delicious idleness to look over these fruitless efforts. A page caught
     his attention; he remembered how he wrote it while a November storm was dashing against the
     panes; and there was another, with a queer blot in one corner; he had got up from his chair and
     looked out, and all the earth was white fairyland, and the snowflakes whirled round and round
     in the wind. Then he saw the chapter begun of a night in March: a great gale blew that night
     and rooted up one of the ancient yews in the churchyard. He had heard the trees shrieking in
     the woods, and the long wail of the wind, and across the heaven a white moon fled awfully
     before the streaming clouds. And all these poor abandoned pages now seemed sweet, and past
     unhappiness was transmuted into happiness, and the nights of toil were holy. He turned over
     half a dozen leaves and began to sketch out the outlines of the new book on the unused pages;
     running out a skeleton plan on one page, and dotting fancies, suggestions, hints on others. He
     wrote rapidly, overjoyed to find that loving phrases grew under his pen; a particular scene he
     had imagined filled him with desire; he gave his hand free course, and saw the written work
     glowing; and action and all the heat of existence quickened and beat on the wet page. Happy
     fancies took shape in happier words, and when at last he leant back in his chair he felt the
     stir and rush of the story as if it had been some portion of his own life. He read over what he
     had done with a renewed pleasure in the nimble and flowing workmanship, and as he put the
     little pile of manuscript tenderly in the drawer he paused to enjoy the anticipation of
     tomorrow's labor.
And thenâ€”but the rest of the night was given to tender and delicious things, and when he
     went up to bed a scarlet dawn was streaming from the east.
