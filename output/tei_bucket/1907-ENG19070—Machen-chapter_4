IV
In the course of the week Lucian again visited Caermaen. He wished to view the amphitheatre
     more precisely, to note the exact position of the ancient walls, to gaze up the valley from
     certain points within the town, to imprint minutely and clearly on his mind the surge of the
     hills about the city, and the dark tapestry of the hanging woods. And he lingered in the museum
     where the relics of the Roman occupation had been stored; he was interested in the fragments of
     tessellated floors, in the glowing gold of drinking cups, the curious beads of fused and
     colored glass, the carved amber-work, the scent-flagons that still retained the memory of
     unctuous odors, the necklaces, brooches, hair-pins of gold and silver, and other intimate
     objects which had once belonged to Roman ladies. One of the glass flagons, buried in damp earth
     for many hundred years, had gathered in its dark grave all the splendors of the light, and now
     shone like an opal with a moonlight glamour and gleams of gold and pale sunset green, and
     imperial purple. Then there were the wine jars of red earthenware, the memorial stones from
     graves, and the heads of broken gods, with fragments of occult things used in the secret rites
     of Mithras. Lucian read on the labels where all these objects were found: in the churchyard,
     beneath the turf of the meadow, and in the old cemetery near the forest; and whenever it was
     possible he would make his way to the spot of discovery, and imagine the long darkness that had
     hidden gold and stone and amber. All these investigations were necessary for the scheme he had
     in view, so he became for some time quite a familiar figure in the dusty deserted streets and
     in the meadows by the river. His continual visits to Caermaen were a tortuous puzzle to the
     inhabitants, who flew to their windows at the sound of a step on the uneven pavements. They
     were at a loss in their conjectures; his motive for coming down three times a week must of
     course be bad, but it seemed undiscoverable. And Lucian on his side was at first a good deal
     put out by occasional encounters with members of the Gervase or Dixon or Colley tribes; he had
     often to stop and exchange a few conventional expressions, and such meetings, casual as they
     were, annoyed and distracted him. He was no longer infuriated or wounded by sneers of contempt
     or by the cackling laughter of the young people when they passed him on the road (his hat was a
     shocking one and his untidiness terrible), but such incidents were unpleasant just as the smell
     of a drain was unpleasant, and threw the strange mechanism of his thoughts out of fear for the
     time. Then he had been disgusted by the affair of the boys and the little dog; the
     loathsomeness of it had quite broken up his fancies. He had read books of modern occultism, and
     remembered some of the experiments described. The adept, it was alleged, could transfer the
     sense of consciousness from his brain to the foot or hand, he could annihilate the world around
     him and pass into another sphere. Lucian wondered whether he could not perform some such
     operation for his own benefit. Human beings were constantly annoying him and getting in his
     way, was it not possible to annihilate the race, or at all events to reduce them to wholly
     insignificant forms? A certain process suggested itself to his mind, a work partly mental and
     partly physical, and after two or three experiments he found to his astonishment and delight
     that it was successful. Here, he thought, he had discovered one of the secrets of true magic;
     this was the key to the symbolic transmutations of the Eastern tales. The adept could, in
     truth, change those who were obnoxious to him into harmless and unimportant shapes, not as in
     the letter of the old stories, by transforming the enemy, but by transforming himself. The
     magician puts men below him by going up higher, as one looks down on a mountain city from a
     loftier crag. The stones on the road and such petty obstacles do not trouble the wise man on
     the great journey, and so Lucian, when obliged to stop and converse with his fellow-creatures,
     to listen to their poor pretences and inanities, was no more inconvenienced than when he had to
     climb an awkward stile in the course of a walk. As for the more unpleasant manifestations of
     humanity; after all they no longer concerned him. Men intent on the great purpose did not
     suffer the current of their thoughts to be broken by the buzzing of a fly caught in a spider's
     web, so why should he be perturbed by the misery of a puppy in the hands of village boys? The
     fly, no doubt, endured its tortures; lying helpless and bound in those slimy bands, it cried
     out in its thin voice when the claws of the horrible monster fastened on it; but its dying
     agonies had never vexed the reverie of a lover. Lucian saw no reason why the boys should offend
     him more than the spider, or why he should pity the dog more than he pitied the fly. The talk
     of the men and women might be wearisome and inept and often malignant; but he could not imagine
     an alchemist at the moment of success, a general in the hour of victory, or a financier with a
     gigantic scheme of swindling well on the market being annoyed by the buzz of insects. The
     spider is, no doubt, a very terrible brute with a hideous mouth and hairy tiger-like claws when
     seen through the microscope; but Lucian had taken away the microscope from his eyes. He could
     now walk the streets of Caermaen confident and secure, without any dread of interruption, for
     at a moment's notice the transformation could be effected. Once Dr. Burrows caught him and made
     him promise to attend a bazaar that was to be held in aid of the Hungarian Protestants; Lucian
     assented the more willingly as he wished to pay a visit to certain curious mounds on a hill a
     little way out of the town, and he calculated on slinking off from the bazaar early in the
     afternoon. Lord Beamys was visiting Sir Vivian Ponsonby, a local magnate, and had kindly
     promised to drive over and declare the bazaar open. It was a solemn moment when the carriage
     drew up and the great man alighted. He was rather an evil-looking old nobleman, but the clergy
     and gentry, their wives and sons and daughters welcomed him with great and unctuous joy.
     Conversations were broken off in mid-sentence, slow people gaped, not realizing why their
     friends had so suddenly left them, the Meyricks came up hot and perspiring in fear lest they
     should be too late, Miss Colley, a yellow virgin of austere regard, smiled largely, Mrs. Dixon
     beckoned wildly with her parasol to the "girls" who were idly strolling in a distant part of
     the field, and the archdeacon ran at full speed. The air grew dark with bows, and resonant with
     the genial laugh of the archdeacon, the cackle of the younger ladies, and the shrill
     parrot-like voices of the matrons; those smiled who had never smiled before, and on some maiden
     faces there hovered that look of adoring ecstasy with which the old maidens graced their
     angels. Then, when all the due rites had been performed, the company turned and began to walk
     towards the booths of their small Vanity Fair. Lord Beamys led the way with Mrs. Gervase, Mrs.
     Dixon followed with Sir Vivian Ponsonby, and the multitudes that followed cried, saying, "What
     a dear old man!"â€”"Isn't it kind of him to come all this way?"â€”"What a sweet
     expression, isn't it?"â€”"I think he's an old love"â€”"One of the good old sort"â€”"Real
     English nobleman"â€”"Oh most correct, I assure you; if a girl gets into trouble, notice to quit
     at once"â€”"Always stands by the Church"â€”"Twenty livings in his gift"â€”"Voted for the Public
     Worship Regulation Act"â€”"Ten thousand acres strictly preserved." The old lord was leering
     pleasantly and muttering to himself: "Some fine gals here. Like the looks of that filly with
     the pink hat. Ought to see more of her. She'd give Lotty points."
The pomp swept slowly across the grass: the archdeacon had got hold of Mr. Dixon, and they
     were discussing the misdeeds of some clergyman in the rural deanery.
"I can scarce credit it," said Mr. Dixon.
"Oh, I assure you, there can be no doubt. We have witnesses. There can be no question that
     there was a procession at Llanfihangel on the Sunday before Easter; the choir and minister went
     round the church, carrying palm branches in their hands."
"Very shocking."
"It has distressed the bishop. Martin is a hard-working man enough, and all that, but those
     sort of things can't be tolerated. The bishop told me that he had set his face against
     processions."
"Quite right: the bishop is perfectly right. Processions are unscriptural."
"It's the thin end of the wedge, you know, Dixon."
"Exactly. I have always resisted anything of the kind here."
"Right. Principiis obsta, you know. Martin is so imprudent. There's a
      way of doing things." 
The "scriptural" procession led by Lord Beamys broke up when the stalls were reached, and
     gathered round the nobleman as he declared the bazaar open.
Lucian was sitting on a garden-seat, a little distance off, looking dreamily before him. And
     all that he saw was a swarm of flies clustering and buzzing about a lump of tainted meat that
     lay on the grass. The spectacle in no way interrupted the harmony of his thoughts, and soon
     after the opening of the bazaar he went quietly away, walking across the fields in the
     direction of the ancient mounds he desired to inspect.
All these journeys of his to Caermaen and its neighborhood had a peculiar object; he was
     gradually leveling to the dust the squalid kraals of modern times, and rebuilding the splendid
     and golden city of Siluria. All this mystic town was for the delight of his sweetheart and
     himself; for her the wonderful villas, the shady courts, the magic of tessellated pavements,
     and the hangings of rich stuffs with their intricate and glowing patterns. Lucian wandered all
     day through the shining streets, taking shelter sometimes in the gardens beneath the dense and
     gloomy ilex trees, and listening to the plash and trickle of the fountains. Sometimes he would
     look out of a window and watch the crowd and color of the market-place, and now and again a
     ship came up the river bringing exquisite silks and the merchandise of unknown lands in the Far
     East. He had made a curious and accurate map of the town he proposed to inhabit, in which every
     villa was set down and named. He drew his lines to scale with the gravity of a surveyor, and
     studied the plan till he was able to find his way from house to house on the darkest summer
     night. On the southern slopes about the town there were vineyards, always under a glowing sun,
     and sometimes he ventured to the furthest ridge of the forest, where the wild people still
     lingered, that he might catch the golden gleam of the city far away, as the light quivered and
     scintillated on the glittering tiles. And there were gardens outside the city gates where
     strange and brilliant flowers grew, filling the hot air with their odor, and scenting the
     breeze that blew along the streets. The dull modern life was far away, and people who saw him
     at this period wondered what was amiss; the abstraction of his glance was obvious, even to eyes
     not over-sharp. But men and women had lost all their power of annoyance and vexation; they
     could no longer even interrupt his thought for a moment. He could listen to Mr. Dixon with
     apparent attention, while he was in reality enraptured by the entreating music of the double
     flute, played by a girl in the garden of Avallaunius, for that was the name he had taken. Mr.
     Dixon was innocently discoursing archeology, giving a brief résumé of the view
     expressed by Mr. Wyndham at the last meeting of the antiquarian society.
"There can be no doubt that the temple of Diana stood there in pagan times," he concluded,
     and Lucian assented to the opinion, and asked a few questions which seemed pertinent enough.
     But all the time the flute notes were sounding in his ears, and the ilex threw a purple shadow
     on the white pavement before his villa. A boy came forward from the garden; he had been walking
     amongst the vines and plucking the ripe grapes, and the juice had trickled down over his
     breast. Standing beside the girl, unashamed in the sunlight, he began to sing one of Sappho's
     love songs. His voice was as full and rich as a woman's, but purged of all emotion; he was an
     instrument of music in the flesh. Lucian looked at him steadily; the white perfect body shone
     against the roses and the blue of the sky, clear and gleaming as marble in the glare of the
     sun. The words he sang burned and flamed with passion, and he was as unconscious of their
     meaning as the twin pipes of the flute. And the girl was smiling. The vicar shook hands and
     went on, well pleased with his remarks on the temple of Diana, and also with Lucian's polite
     interest.
"He is by no means wanting in intelligence," he said to his family. "A little curious in
     manner, perhaps, but not stupid."
"Oh, papa," said Henrietta, "don't you think he is rather silly? He can't talk about
     anythingâ€”anything interesting, I mean. And he pretends to know a lot about books, but I heard
     him say the other day he had never read The Prince of the House of David or
      Ben-Hur. Fancy!"
The vicar had not interrupted Lucian. The sun still beat upon the roses, and a little breeze
     bore the scent of them to his nostrils together with the smell of grapes and vine-leaves. He
     had become curious in sensation, and as he leant back upon the cushions covered with glistening
     yellow silk, he was trying to analyze a strange ingredient in the perfume of the air. He had
     penetrated far beyond the crude distinctions of modern times, beyond the rough: "there's a
     smell of roses," "there must be sweetbriar somewhere." Modern perceptions of odor were, he
     knew, far below those of the savage in delicacy. The degraded black fellow of Australia could
     distinguish odors in a way that made the consumer of "damper" stare in amazement, but the
     savage's sensations were all strictly utilitarian. To Lucian as he sat in the cool porch, his
     feet on the marble, the air came laden with scents as subtly and wonderfully interwoven and
     contrasted as the harmonica of a great master. The stained marble of the pavement gave a cool
     reminiscence of the Italian mountain, the blood-red roses palpitating in the sunlight sent out
     an odor mystical as passion itself, and there was the hint of inebriation in the perfume of the
     trellised vines. Besides these, the girl's desire and the unripe innocence of the boy were as
     distinct as benzoin and myrrh, both delicious and exquisite, and exhaled as freely as the scent
     of the roses. But there was another element that puzzled him, an aromatic suggestion of the
     forest. He understood it at last; it was the vapor of the great red pines that grew beyond the
     garden; their spicy needles were burning in the sun, and the smell was as fragrant as the fume
     of incense blown from far. The soft entreaty of the flute and the swelling rapture of the boy's
     voice beat on the air together, and Lucian wondered whether there were in the nature of things
     any true distinction between the impressions of sound and scent and color. The violent blue of
     the sky, the song, and the odours seemed rather varied symbols of one mystery than distinct
     entities. He could almost imagine that the boy's innocence was indeed a perfume, and that the
     palpitating roses had become a sonorous chant.
In the curious silence which followed the last notes, when the boy and girl had passed under
     the purple ilex shadow, he fell into a reverie. The fancy that sensations are symbols and not
     realities hovered in his mind, and led him to speculate as to whether they could not actually
     be transmuted one into another. It was possible, he thought, that a whole continent of
     knowledge had been undiscovered; the energies of men having been expended in unimportant and
     foolish directions. Modern ingenuity had been employed on such trifles as locomotive engines,
     electric cables, and cantilever bridges; on elaborate devices for bringing uninteresting people
     nearer together; the ancients had been almost as foolish, because they had mistaken the symbol
     for the thing signified. It was not the material banquet which really mattered, but the thought
     of it; it was almost as futile to eat and take emetics and eat again as to invent telephones
     and high-pressure boilers. As for some other ancient methods of enjoying life, one might as
     well set oneself to improve calico printing at once.
"Only in the garden of Avallaunius," said Lucian to himself, "is the true and exquisite
     science to be found."
He could imagine a man who was able to live in one sense while he pleased; to whom, for
     example, every impression of touch, taste, hearing, or seeing should be translated into odor;
     who at the desired kiss should be ravished with the scent of dark violets, to whom music should
     be the perfume of a rose-garden at dawn.
When, now and again, he voluntarily resumed the experience of common life, it was that he
     might return with greater delight to the garden in the city of refuge. In the actual world the
     talk was of Nonconformists, the lodger franchise, and the Stock Exchange; people were
     constantly reading newspapers, drinking Australian Burgundy, and doing other things equally
     absurd. They either looked shocked when the fine art of pleasure was mentioned, or confused it
     with going to musical comedies, drinking bad whisky, and keeping late hours in disreputable and
     vulgar company. He found to his amusement that the profligate were by many degrees duller than
     the pious, but that the most tedious of all were the persons who preached promiscuity, and
     called their system of "pigging" the "New Morality."
He went back to the city lovingly, because it was built and adorned for his love. As the
     metaphysicians insist on the consciousness of the ego as the implied basis of all thought, so
     he knew that it was she in whom he had found himself, and through whom and for whom all the
     true life existed. He felt that Annie had taught him the rare magic which had created the
     garden of Avallaunius. It was for her that he sought strange secrets and tried to penetrate the
     mysteries of sensation, for he could only give her wonderful thoughts and a wonderful life, and
     a poor body stained with the scars of his worship.
It was with this object, that of making the offering of himself a worthy one, that he
     continually searched for new and exquisite experiences. He made lovers come before him and
     confess their secrets; he pried into the inmost mysteries of innocence and shame, noting how
     passion and reluctance strive together for the mastery. In the amphitheatre he sometimes
     witnessed strange entertainments in which such tales as Daphnis and Chloe and The
      Golden Ass were performed before him. These shows were always given at nighttime; a
     circle of torch-bearers surrounded the stage in the center, and above, all the tiers of seats
     were dark. He would look up at the soft blue of the summer sky, and at the vast dim mountain
     hovering like a cloud in the west, and then at the scene illumined by a flaring light, and
     contrasted with violent shadows. The subdued mutter of conversation in a strange language
     rising from bench after bench, swift hissing whispers of explanation, now and then a shout or a
     cry as the interest deepened, the restless tossing of the people as the end drew near, an arm
     lifted, a cloak thrown back, the sudden blaze of a torch lighting up purple or white or the
     gleam of gold in the black serried ranks; these were impressions that seemed always amazing.
     And above, the dusky light of the stars, around, the sweet-scented meadows, and the twinkle of
     lamps from the still city, the cry of the sentries about the walls, the wash of the tide
     filling the river, and the salt savor of the sea. With such a scenic ornament he saw the tale
     of Apuleius represented, heard the names of Fotis and Byrrhaena and Lucius proclaimed, and the
     deep intonation of such sentences as Ecce Veneris hortator et armiger Liber advenit
      ultro. The tale went on through all its marvelous adventures, and Lucian left the
     amphitheatre and walked beside the river where he could hear indistinctly the noise of voices
     and the singing Latin, and note how the rumor of the stage mingled with the murmur of the
     shuddering reeds and the cool lapping of the tide. Then came the farewell of the cantor, the
     thunder of applause, the crash of cymbals, the calling of the flutes, and the surge of the wind
     in the great dark wood.
At other times it was his chief pleasure to spend a whole day in a vineyard planted on the
     steep slope beyond the bridge. A grey stone seat had been placed beneath a shady laurel, and
     here he often sat without motion or gesture for many hours. Below him the tawny river swept
     round the town in a half circle; he could see the swirl of the yellow water, its eddies and
     miniature whirlpools, as the tide poured up from the south. And beyond the river the strong
     circuit of the walls, and within, the city glittered like a charming piece of mosaic. He freed
     himself from the obtuse modern view of towns as places where human beings live and make money
     and rejoice or suffer, for from the standpoint of the moment such facts were wholly
     impertinent. He knew perfectly well that for his present purpose the tawny sheen and shimmer of
     the tide was the only fact of importance about the river, and so he regarded the city as a
     curious work in jewelry. Its radiant marble porticoes, the white walls of the villas, a dome of
     burning copper, the flash and scintillation of tiled roofs, the quiet red of brickwork, dark
     groves of ilex, and cypress, and laurel, glowing rose-gardens, and here and there the silver of
     a fountain, seemed arranged and contrasted with a wonderful art, and the town appeared a
     delicious ornament, every cube of color owing its place to the thought and inspiration of the
     artificer. Lucian, as he gazed from his arbour amongst the trellised vines, lost none of the
     subtle pleasures of the sight; noting every nuance of color, he let his eyes dwell for
     a moment on the scarlet flash of poppies, and then on a glazed roof which in the glance of the
     sun seemed to spout white fire. A square of vines was like some rare green stone; the grapes
     were massed so richly amongst the vivid leaves, that even from far off there was a sense of
     irregular flecks and stains of purple running through the green. The laurel garths were like
     cool jade; the gardens, where red, yellow, blue and white gleamed together in a mist of heat,
     had the radiance of opal; the river was a band of dull gold. On every side, as if to enhance
     the preciousness of the city, the woods hung dark on the hills; above, the sky was violet,
     specked with minute feathery clouds, white as snowflakes. It reminded him of a beautiful bowl
     in his villa; the ground was of that same brilliant blue, and the artist had fused into the
     work, when it was hot, particles of pure white glass.
For Lucian this was a spectacle that enchanted many hours; leaning on one hand, he would gaze
     at the city glowing in the sunlight till the purple shadows grew down the slopes and the long
     melodious trumpet sounded for the evening watch. Then, as he strolled beneath the trellises, he
     would see all the radiant facets glimmering out, and the city faded into haze, a white wall
     shining here and there, and the gardens veiled in a dim glow of color. On such an evening he
     would go home with the sense that he had truly lived a day, having received for many hours the
     most acute impressions of beautiful color.
Often he spent the night in the cool court of his villa, lying amidst soft cushions heaped
     upon the marble bench. A lamp stood on the table at his elbow, its light making the water in
     the cistern twinkle. There was no sound in the court except the soft continual plashing of the
     fountain. Throughout these still hours he would meditate, and he became more than ever
     convinced that man could, if he pleased, become lord of his own sensations. This, surely, was
     the true meaning concealed under the beautiful symbolism of alchemy. Some years before he had
     read many of the wonderful alchemical books of the later Middle Ages, and had suspected that
     something other than the turning of lead into gold was intended. This impression was deepened
     when he looked into Lumen de Lumine by Vaughan, the brother of the Silurist, and he
     had long puzzled himself in the endeavor to find a reasonable interpretation of the hermetic
     mystery, and of the red powder, "glistening and glorious in the sun." And the solution shone
     out at last, bright and amazing, as he lay quiet in the court of Avallaunius. He knew that he
     himself had solved the riddle, that he held in his hand the powder of projection, the
     philosopher's stone transmuting all it touched to fine gold; the gold of exquisite impressions.
     He understood now something of the alchemical symbolism; the crucible and the furnace, the
     "Green Dragon," and the "Son Blessed of the Fire" had, he saw, a peculiar meaning. He
     understood, too, why the uninitiated were warned of the terror and danger through which they
     must pass; and the vehemence with which the adepts disclaimed all desire for material riches no
     longer struck him as singular. The wise man does not endure the torture of the furnace in order
     that he may be able to compete with operators in pork and company promoters; neither a steam
     yacht, nor a grouse-moor, nor three liveried footmen would add at all to his gratifications.
     Again Lucian said to himself:
"Only in the court of Avallaunius is the true science of the exquisite to be found."
He saw the true gold into which the beggarly matter of existence may be transmuted by
     spagyric art; a succession of delicious moments, all the rare flavors of life concentrated,
     purged of their lees, and preserved in a beautiful vessel. The moonlight fell green on the
     fountain and on the curious pavements, and in the long sweet silence of the night he lay still
     and felt that thought itself was an acute pleasure, to be expressed perhaps in terms of odor or
     color by the true artist.
And he gave himself other and even stranger gratifications. Outside the city walls, between
     the baths and the amphitheatre, was a tavern, a place where wonderful people met to drink
     wonderful wine. There he saw priests of Mithras and Isis and of more occult rites from the
     East, men who wore robes of bright colours, and grotesque ornaments, symbolizing secret things.
     They spoke amongst themselves in a rich jargon of colored words, full of hidden meanings and
     the sense of matters unintelligible to the uninitiated, alluding to what was concealed beneath
     roses, and calling each other by strange names. And there were actors who gave the shows in the
     amphitheatre, officers of the legion who had served in wild places, singers, and dancing girls,
     and heroes of strange adventure.
The walls of the tavern were covered with pictures painted in violent hues; blues and reds
     and greens jarring against one another and lighting up the gloom of the place. The stone
     benches were always crowded, the sunlight came in through the door in a long bright beam,
     casting a dancing shadow of vine leaves on the further wall. There a painter had made a joyous
     figure of the young Bacchus driving the leopards before him with his ivy-staff, and the
     quivering shadow seemed a part of the picture. The room was cool and dark and cavernous, but
     the scent and heat of the summer gushed in through the open door. There was ever a full sound,
     with noise and vehemence, there, and the rolling music of the Latin tongue never ceased.
"The wine of the siege, the wine that we saved," cried one.
"Look for the jar marked Faunus; you will be glad."
"Bring me the wine of the Owl's Face."
"Let us have the wine of Saturn's Bridge."
The boys who served brought the wine in dull red jars that struck a charming note against
     their white robes. They poured out the violet and purple and golden wine with calm sweet faces
     as if they were assisting in the mysteries, without any sign that they heard the strange words
     that flashed from side to side. The cups were all of glass; some were of deep green, of the
     color of the sea near the land, flawed and specked with the bubbles of the furnace. Others were
     of brilliant scarlet, streaked with irregular bands of white, and having the appearance of
     white globules in the molded stem. There were cups of dark glowing blue, deeper and more
     shining than the blue of the sky, and running through the substance of the glass were veins of
     rich gamboge yellow, twining from the brim to the foot. Some cups were of a troubled and
     clotted red, with alternating blotches of dark and light, some were variegated with white and
     yellow stains, some wore a film of rainbow colours, some glittered, shot with gold threads
     through the clear crystal, some were as if sapphires hung suspended in running water, some
     sparkled with the glint of stars, some were black and golden like tortoiseshell.
A strange feature was the constant and fluttering motion of hands and arms. Gesture made a
     constant commentary on speech; white fingers, whiter arms, and sleeves of all colours, hovered
     restlessly, appeared and disappeared with an effect of threads crossing and re-crossing on the
     loom. And the odor of the place was both curious and memorable; something of the damp cold
     breath of the cave meeting the hot blast of summer, the strangely mingled aromas of rare wines
     as they fell plashing and ringing into the cups, the drugged vapor of the East that the priests
     of Mithras and Isis bore from their steaming temples; these were always strong and dominant.
     And the women were scented, sometimes with unctuous and overpowering perfumes, and to the
     artist the experiences of those present were hinted in subtle and delicate nuances of
     odor.
They drank their wine and caressed all day in the tavern. The women threw their round white
     arms about their lover's necks, they intoxicated them with the scent of their hair, the priests
     muttered their fantastic jargon of Theurgy. And through the sonorous clash of voices there
     always seemed the ring of the cry:
"Look for the jar marked Faunus; you will be glad."
Outside, the vine tendrils shook on the white walls glaring in the sunshine; the breeze swept
     up from the yellow river, pungent with the salt sea savor.
These tavern scenes were often the subject of Lucian's meditation as he sat amongst the
     cushions on the marble seat. The rich sound of the voices impressed him above all things, and
     he saw that words have a far higher reason than the utilitarian office of imparting a man's
     thought. The common notion that language and linked words are important only as a means of
     expression he found a little ridiculous; as if electricity were to be studied solely with the
     view of "wiring" to people, and all its other properties left unexplored, neglected. Language,
     he understood, was chiefly important for the beauty of its sounds, by its possession of words
     resonant, glorious to the ear, by its capacity, when exquisitely arranged, of suggesting
     wonderful and indefinable impressions, perhaps more ravishing and farther removed from the
     domain of strict thought than the impressions excited by music itself. Here lay hidden the
     secret of the sensuous art of literature; it was the secret of suggestion, the art of causing
     delicious sensation by the use of words. In a way, therefore, literature was independent of
     thought; the mere English listener, if he had an ear attuned, could recognize the beauty of a
     splendid Latin phrase.
Here was the explanation of the magic of Lycidas. From the standpoint of the formal
     understanding it was an affected lament over some wholly uninteresting and unimportant Mr.
     King; it was full of nonsense about "shepherds" and "flocks" and "muses" and such stale stock
     of poetry; the introduction of St Peter on a stage thronged with nymphs and river gods was
     blasphemous, absurd, and, in the worst taste; there were touches of greasy Puritanism, the
     twang of the conventicle was only too apparent. And Lycidas was probably the most
     perfect piece of pure literature in existence; because every word and phrase and line were
     sonorous, ringing and echoing with music.
"Literature," he re-enunciated in his mind, "is the sensuous art of causing exquisite
     impressions by means of words."
And yet there was something more; besides the logical thought, which was often a hindrance, a
     troublesome though inseparable accident, besides the sensation, always a pleasure and a
     delight, besides these there were the indefinable inexpressible images which all fine
     literature summons to the mind. As the chemist in his experiments is sometimes astonished to
     find unknown, unexpected elements in the crucible or the receiver, as the world of material
     things is considered by some a thin veil of the immaterial universe, so he who reads wonderful
     prose or verse is conscious of suggestions that cannot be put into words, which do not rise
     from the logical sense, which are rather parallel to than connected with the sensuous delight.
     The world so disclosed is rather the world of dreams, rather the world in which children
     sometimes live, instantly appearing, and instantly vanishing away, a world beyond all
     expression or analysis, neither of the intellect nor of the senses. He called these fancies of
     his "Meditations of a Tavern," and was amused to think that a theory of letters should have
     risen from the eloquent noise that rang all day about the violet and golden wine.
"Let us seek for more exquisite things," said Lucian to himself. He could almost imagine the
     magic transmutation of the senses accomplished, the strong sunlight was an odor in his
     nostrils; it poured down on the white marble and the palpitating roses like a flood. The sky
     was a glorious blue, making the heart joyous, and the eyes could rest in the dark green leaves
     and purple shadow of the ilex. The earth seemed to burn and leap beneath the sun, he fancied he
     could see the vine tendrils stir and quiver in the heat, and the faint fume of the scorching
     pine needles was blown across the gleaming garden to the seat beneath the porch. Wine was
     before him in a cup of carved amber; a wine of the color of a dark rose, with a glint as of a
     star or of a jet of flame deep beneath the brim; and the cup was twined about with a delicate
     wreath of ivy. He was often loath to turn away from the still contemplation of such things,
     from the mere joy of the violent sun, and the responsive earth. He loved his garden and the
     view of the tessellated city from the vineyard on the hill, the strange clamor of the tavern,
     and white Fotis appearing on the torch-lit stage. And there were shops in the town in which he
     delighted, the shops of the perfume makers, and jewelers, and dealers in curious ware. He loved
     to see all things made for ladies' use, to touch the gossamer silks that were to touch their
     bodies, to finger the beads of amber and the gold chains which would stir above their hearts,
     to handle the carved hairpins and brooches, to smell odors which were already dedicated to
     love.
But though these were sweet and delicious gratifications, he knew that there were more
     exquisite things of which he might be a spectator. He had seen the folly of regarding fine
     literature from the standpoint of the logical intellect, and he now began to question the
     wisdom of looking at life as if it were a moral representation. Literature, he knew, could not
     exist without some meaning, and considerations of right and wrong were to a certain extent
     inseparable from the conception of life, but to insist on ethics as the chief interest of the
     human pageant was surely absurd. One might as well read Lycidas for the sake of its
     denunciation of "our corrupted Clergy," or Homer for "manners and customs." An artist entranced
     by a beautiful landscape did not greatly concern himself with the geological formation of the
     hills, nor did the lover of a wild sea inquire as to the chemical analysis of the water. Lucian
     saw a colored and complex life displayed before him, and he sat enraptured at the spectacle,
     not concerned to know whether actions were good or bad, but content if they were curious.
In this spirit he made a singular study of corruption. Beneath his feet, as he sat in the
     garden porch, was a block of marble through which there ran a scarlet stain. It began with a
     faint line, thin as a hair, and grew as it advanced, sending out offshoots to right and left,
     and broadening to a pool of brilliant red. There were strange lives into which he looked that
     were like the block of marble; women with grave sweet faces told him the astounding tale of
     their adventures, and how, they said, they had met the faun when they were little children.
     They told him how they had played and watched by the vines and the fountains, and dallied with
     the nymphs, and gazed at images reflected in the water pools, till the authentic face appeared
     from the wood. He heard others tell how they had loved the satyrs for many years before they
     knew their race; and there were strange stories of those who had longed to speak but knew not
     the word of the enigma, and searched in all strange paths and ways before they found it.
He heard the history of the woman who fell in love with her slave-boy, and tempted him for
     three years in vain. He heard the tale from the woman's full red lips, and watched her face,
     full of the ineffable sadness of lust, as she described her curious stratagems in mellow
     phrases. She was drinking a sweet yellow wine from a gold cup as she spoke, and the odor in her
     hair and the aroma of the precious wine seemed to mingle with the soft strange words that
     flowed like an unguent from a carven jar. She told how she bought the boy in the market of an
     Asian city, and had him carried to her house in the grove of fig-trees. "Then," she went on,
     "he was led into my presence as I sat between the columns of my court. A blue veil was spread
     above to shut out the heat of the sun, and rather twilight than light shone on the painted
     walls, and the wonderful colours of the pavement, and the images of Love and the Mother of
     Love. The men who brought the boy gave him over to my girls, who undressed him before me, one
     drawing gently away his robe, another stroking his brown and flowing hair, another praising the
     whiteness of his limbs, and another caressing him, and speaking loving words in his hear. But
     the boy looked sullenly at them all, striking away their hands, and pouting with his lovely and
     splendid lips, and I saw a blush, like the rosy veil of dawn, reddening his body and his
     cheeks. Then I made them bathe him, and anoint him with scented oils from head to foot, till
     his limbs shone and glistened with the gentle and mellow glow of an ivory statue. Then I said:
     'You are bashful, because you shine alone amongst us all; see, we too will be your fellows.'
     The girls began first of all, fondling and kissing one another, and doing for each other the
     offices of waiting-maids. They drew out the pins and loosened the bands of their hair, and I
     never knew before that they were so lovely. The soft and shining tresses flowed down, rippling
     like sea-waves; some had hair golden and radiant as this wine in my cup, the faces of others
     appeared amidst the blackness of ebony; there were locks that seemed of burnished and
     scintillating copper, some glowed with hair of tawny splendor, and others were crowned with the
     brightness of the sardonyx. Then, laughing, and without the appearance of shame, they
     unfastened the brooches and bands which sustained their robes, and so allowed silk and linen to
     flow swiftly to the stained floor, so that one would have said there was a sudden apparition of
     the fairest nymphs. With many festive and jocose words they began to incite each other to
     mirth, praising the beauties that shone on every side, and calling the boy by a girl's name,
     they invited him to be their playmate. But he refused, shaking his head, and still standing
     dumb-founded and abashed, as if he saw a forbidden and terrible spectacle. Then I ordered the
     women to undo my hair and my clothes, making them caress me with the tenderness of the fondest
     lover, but without avail, for the foolish boy still scowled and pouted out his lips, stained
     with an imperial and glorious scarlet."
She poured out more of the topaz-colored wine in her cup, and Lucian saw it glitter as it
     rose to the brim and mirrored the gleam of the lamps. The tale went on, recounting a hundred
     strange devices. The woman told how she had tempted the boy by idleness and ease, giving him
     long hours of sleep, and allowing him to recline all day on soft cushions, that swelled about
     him, enclosing his body. She tried the experiment of curious odors: causing him to smell always
     about him the oil of roses, and burning in his presence rare gums from the East. He was allured
     by soft dresses, being clothed in silks that caressed the skin with the sense of a fondling
     touch. Three times a day they spread before him a delicious banquet, full of savor and odor and
     color; three times a day they endeavored to intoxicate him with delicate wine.
"And so," the lady continued, "I spared nothing to catch him in the glistening nets of love;
     taking only sour and contemptuous glances in return. And at last in an incredible shape I won
     the victory, and then, having gained a green crown, fighting in agony against his green and
     crude immaturity, I devoted him to the theatre, where he amused the people by the splendor of
     his death."
On another evening he heard the history of the man who dwelt alone, refusing all allurements,
     and was at last discovered to be the lover of a black statue. And there were tales of strange
     cruelties, of men taken by mountain robbers, and curiously maimed and disfigured, so that when
     they escaped and returned to the town, they were thought to be monsters and killed at their own
     doors. Lucian left no dark or secret nook of life unvisited; he sat down, as he said, at the
     banquet, resolved to taste all the savors, and to leave no flagon unvisited.
His relations grew seriously alarmed about him at this period. While he heard with some inner
     ear the suave and eloquent phrases of singular tales, and watched the lamp-light in amber and
     purple wine, his father saw a lean pale boy, with black eyes that burnt in hollows, and sad and
     sunken cheeks.
"You ought to try and eat more, Lucian," said the parson; "and why don't you have some
     beer?"
He was looking feebly at the roast mutton and sipping a little water; but he would not have
     eaten or drunk with more relish if the choicest meat and drink had been before him.
His bones seemed, as Miss Deacon said, to be growing through his skin; he had all the
     appearance of an ascetic whose body has been reduced to misery by long and grievous penance.
     People who chanced to see him could not help saying to one another: "How ill and wretched that
     Lucian Taylor looks!" They were of course quite unaware of the joy and luxury in which his real
     life was spent, and some of them began to pity him, and to speak to him kindly.
It was too late for that. The friendly words had as much lost their meaning as the words of
     contempt. Edward Dixon hailed him cheerfully in the street one day:
"Come in to my den, won't you, old fellow?" he said. "You won't see the pater. I've managed
     to bag a bottle of his old port. I know you smoke like a furnace, and I've got some ripping
     cigars. You will come, won't you! I can tell you the pater's booze is first rate."
He gently declined and went on. Kindness and unkindness, pity and contempt had become for him
     mere phrases; he could not have distinguished one from the other. Hebrew and Chinese, Hungarian
     and Pushtu would be pretty much alike to an agricultural laborer; if he cared to listen he
     might detect some general differences in sound, but all four tongues would be equally devoid of
     significance.
To Lucian, entranced in the garden of Avallaunius, it seemed very strange that he had once
     been so ignorant of all the exquisite meanings of life. Now, beneath the violet sky, looking
     through the brilliant trellis of the vines, he saw the picture; before, he had gazed in sad
     astonishment at the squalid rag which was wrapped about it.
