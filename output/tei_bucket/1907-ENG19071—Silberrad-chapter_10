CHAPTER IX
THE HOLIDAY
The Dunes lay some little distance from the town, a low, but suddenly-rising hill boundary,
     that shut in the basin of flat land. They were all of pure sand, though in many places so
     matted with vegetation that it was hardly recognisable as such. Trees grew in places,
     especially on the side that fronted towards the town; the way up lay through a dense young wood
     of beech and larch, and a short, broad-leafed variety of poplar. There was no undergrowth, but
     between the dead leaves one could see that a dark green, short-piled moss had managed to find a
     hold here and there, though so smooth was it that it looked more like old enamel than a natural
     growth. The trees had the appearance of high summer, deeply, intensely green, so that they
     seemed almost blackish in mass. There was no breeze among them; even the dapples of sunlight
     which found their way through the roof of leaves hardly stirred, but lay in light patches, like
     scattered gold upon the ground. Flies and gnats moved and shimmered, a busy life, whose small
     voices were the only sound to be heard; all else was very still, with the glorious reposeful
     stillness of full summer; not oppressive, without weariness or exhaustion, rather as if the
     whole creation paused at this zenith to look round on its works, and beheld and saw that they
     were all very good.
There were no clear paths, apparently few people went
      that way; certainly there was no one about when Julia and Rawson-Clew came. It is
     true they saw a kind of little beer-garden at the foot of the slope, but there was no one
     idling about it.
"We shall have to come back here for lunch," Julia said.
And when he suggested that it was rather a pity to have to retrace their steps, she answered,
     "It doesn't matter, we are not going anywhere particular; we may just as well wander one way as
     another. When we get to the top this time we will explore to the right, and when we get there
     again after lunch, we will go to the left; don't you think that is the best way? This is to be
     a holiday, you know."
"Is a real holiday like a dog's wanderings?" Rawson-Clew inquired; "bounded by no purpose
     except dinner when hungry?"
Julia thought it must be something of the kind. "Though," she said, "dogs always seem to have
     some end in view, or perhaps a dozen ends, for though they tear off after an imaginary interest
     as if there was nothing else in the world, they get tired of it, or else start another, and
     forget all about the first."
"That must also be part of the essence of a holiday," Rawson-Clew said; "at least, one would
     judge it to be so; boys and dogs, the only things in nature who really understand the art of
     holiday-making, chase wild geese, and otherwise do nothing of any account, with an
     inexhaustible energy, and a purposeful determination wonderful to behold. Also, they forget
     that there is such a thing as to-morrow, so that must be important too."
"I can't do that," Julia said.
"You might try when you get to the top," he suggested.
      "I will try then; I don't think I could do anything requiring an effort just
     now."
Julia agreed that she could not either, and they went on up straight before them. It is as
     easy to climb a sand-hill in one place as in another, provided you stick your feet in the right
     way, and do not mind getting a good deal of sand in your boots. So they went straight, and at
     last got clear of the taller trees, and were struggling in thickets of young poplars, and other
     sinewy things. The sand was firmer, but honeycombed with rabbit holes, and tangled with
     brambles, and the direction was still upwards, though the growth was so thick, and the ground
     so bad, that it was often necessary to go a long way round. But in time they were through this
     too, and really out on the top. Here there was nothing but the Dunes, wide, curving land, that
     stretched away and away, a tableland of little hollows and hills, like some sea whose waves
     have been consolidated; near at hand its colours were warm, if not vivid, but in the far
     distance it grew paler as the vegetation became less and less, till, far away, almost beyond
     sight, it failed to grey helm grass, and then altogether ceased, leaving the sand bare. Behind
     lay the trees through which they had come, sloping downwards in banks of cool shadows to the
     map-like land and the distant town below; away on right and left were other groups of trees, on
     sides of hills and in rounded hollows, looking small enough from here, but in reality woods of
     some size. Here there was nothing; but, above, a great blue sky, which seemed very close; and,
     underfoot, low-growing Dune roses and wild thyme which filled the warm, still air with its
     matchless scent; nothing but these, and space, and sunshine, and silence.
Julia stopped and looked round, drawing in her breath;
      she had found what she had come to see—what, perhaps, she had been vaguely
     wanting to find for a long time.
"Isn't it good?" she said at last. "Did you know there was so much room—so much room
     anywhere?"
Rawson-Clew looked in the direction she did; he had seen so much of the world, and she had
     seen so little of it—that is, of the part which is solitary and beautiful. Yet he felt
     something of her enthusiasm for this sunny, empty place—than which he had seen many finer
     things every year of his life.
Perhaps this thought occurred to her, for she turned to him rather wistfully: "I expect it
     does not seem very much to you," she said; "you have seen such a great deal."
"I do not remember to have seen anything quite like this," he answered; "and if I had, what
     then? One does not get tired of things."
Julia looked at him thoughtfully. "I wonder," she said, "if one would? If one would get weary
     of it, and want to go back to the other kind of life?"
She was not thinking of Dune country, rather of the simple life it represented to her just
     then. Rawson-Clew caught the note of seriousness in her tone and reminded her that thought for
     the past or future was no part of a holiday. "Remember," he said, "you are to-day to emulate
     dogs and boys."
She laughed. "How am I to begin?" she asked. "How will you?"
"I shall sit down," he said; "I feel I could be inconsequent much better if I sat down to it;
     that is no doubt because I am past my first youth."
"No," she said, sitting down and putting her hat beside her; "it is because your
     folly-muscles are stiff from want of use; you have played lots of things, I expect—it is
      part of your necessary equipment to be able to do so, but I doubt if you have
     ever played the fool systematically. I don't believe you have ever done, and certainly never
     enjoyed anything inconsequent or foolish in your life."
"If you were to ask me," he returned, "I should hardly say you excelled in that direction
     either. How many inconsequent and foolish things have you done in your life?"
"Some, and I should like to do some more. If I were alone now, do you know what I should do?
     You see that deep hollow of sparkling white sand? I should take off my clothes and lie there in
     the sun."
Rawson-Clew turned so that his back was that way. "Do not let me prevent you," he said.
Julia made use of the opportunity to empty the sand out of her boots.
He looked round as she was finishing fastening them. "But why put them on again?" he
     asked.
"Because I haven't retired from the world, yet," she answered, "and so I can't do quite all I
     like."
"When you do retire, will this ideal summer costume also be included in the programme? Your
     taste in dress grows simpler; quite ancient British, in fact."
"The ancient Britons wore paint, and probably had fashions in it; I don't think of imitating
     them. Tell me," she said, turning now to gather the sweet-scented wild thyme, "did you ever
     really do anything foolish in your life? I should like to know."
He answered her that he had, but without convincing her. Afterwards, he came to the
     conclusion that, whatever might have been the case before, he that day qualified to take rank
     with any one in the matter.
All the same, it was a very pleasant day, and they both enjoyed it much; it is doubtful if
     any one in the town
      or its environs enjoyed that holiday more than these two, who, from different
     reasons, had probably never had so real a holiday before. They wandered over the great open
     tract of land, meeting no one; once they came near enough to the seaward edge to see the
     distant shimmer of water; once they found themselves in the part where there has been some
     little attempt at cultivation, and small patches of potatoes struggle for life, and a little
     railway crosses the sandhills. Twice they came upon the road along which, on working days, the
     peasant women bring their fish to market in the town. But chiefly they kept to the small, dense
     woods, where the sunlight only splashed the ground; or to the open solitary spaces where the
     bees hummed in the wild thyme, and the butterflies chased each other over the low rose
     bushes.
A good deal after mid-day, at a time dictated entirely by choice, and not custom, they made
     their way back to the beer garden. It was a very little place, scarcely worthy of the name; the
     smallest possible house, more like a barn than anything else, right in the shadow of the wood.
     The fare to be obtained was bad beer, excellent coffee, new bread, and old cheese; but it was
     enough, supplemented by the cakes bought yesterday in the town; Julia knew enough of the ways
     of the place to know one can bring one's own food to such places without giving offence. As in
     the morning, when they first passed it, there was no one about, every one had gone to the fair,
     except one taciturn old woman who brought the required things and then shut herself in the
     house. The meal was spread under the trees on a little green-painted table, with legs buried
     deep in sand; there were two high, straight chairs set up to the table, and a wooden footstool
     put by one for Julia, who, seeing it, said this was certainly a picnic, and it was really
     necessary to eat the broodje in the correct
      picnic way. Rawson-Clew tried, with much gravity, but she laughed till the
     taciturn old woman looked out of window, and wondered who they were, and how they came to be
     here.
When the meal was done, they went back again up the steep slope, and then away on the left.
     The country on this side was less open, and more hilly, deeper hollows and larger woods, still
     there was not much difficulty in finding the way. The latter part of the day was not so fine as
     the earlier, the sky clouded over, and, though there was still no wind, the air grew more
     chilly. They hardly noticed the change, being in a dense young wood where there was little
     light, but Julia lost something of the holiday spirit, and Rawson-Clew became grave, talking
     more seriously of serious things than had ever before happened in their curious
     acquaintanceship. They sat down to rest in a green hollow, and Julia began to arrange neatly
     the bunch of short-stemmed thyme flowers that she carried. They had been quiet for some little
     time, she thinking about their curious acquaintance, and wondering when it would end. Of course
     it would end—she knew that; it was a thing of mind only; there was very little feeling about
     it—a certain mutual interest and a liking that had grown of late, kindness on his part,
     gratitude on hers, nothing more. But of its sort it had grown to be intimate; she had told him
     things of her thoughts, and of herself, and her people too, that she had told to no one else;
     and he, which was perhaps more remarkable, had sometimes returned the compliment. And yet by
     and by—soon, perhaps—he would go away, and it would be as if they had never met; it was like
     people on a steamer together, she thought, for the space of the voyage they saw each other
     daily, saw more intimately into each other than many blood relations did, and then, when
      port was reached, they separated, the whole thing finished. She wondered when
     this would finish, and just then Rawson-Clew spoke, and unconsciously answered her thought.
"I am going back to England soon," he said.
She looked up. "Is your work here finished?" she asked.
"It is at an end," he answered; "that is the same thing."
Then she, her intuition enlightened by a like experience suddenly knew that he, too, had
     failed. "You mean it cannot be done," she said.
He opened his cigarette case, and selected a cigarette carefully. "May I smoke?" he asked;
     "there are a good many gnats and mosquitoes about here." He felt for a match, and, when he had
     struck it, asked impersonally, "Do you believe things cannot be done?"
"Yes," she answered; "I know that sometimes they cannot; I have proved it to myself."
"You have not, then, much opinion of the people who do not know when they are beaten?"
"I don't think I have," she answered; "you cannot help knowing when you are beaten if you
     really are—that is, unless you are a fool. Of course, if you are only beaten in one round, or
     one effort, that is another thing; you can get up and try again. But if you are really and
     truly beaten, by yourself, or circumstances, or something—well, there's an end; there is
     nothing but to get up and go on."
"Just so; in that case, as you say, there is not much going to be done, except going
     home."
Julia nodded. "But I can't even do that," she said. "I am beaten, but I have got to stay here
     all the same, having nowhere exactly to go."
This was the first time she had spoken even indirectly of her own future movements. "But,
     perhaps," he sug
     gested, "if you stay, you may find a back way to your object after all."
She shook her head. "It is the back way I tried. No, there is no way; it is blocked. I know,
     because it is myself that blocks it."
"In that case," he said, "I'm afraid I must agree with you; there is no way; oneself is about
     the most insurmountable block of all. I might have known that you were hardly likely to make
     any mistake as to whether you were really beaten or not."
"I should not think it was a mistake you were likely to make either," she observed.
"You think not? Well, I had no chance this time; the fact has been made pretty obvious to
     me."
She did not say she was sorry; in her opinion it was an impertinence to offer condolence to
     failure. "I suppose," she said, after a pause, "there is not a back way—a door, or window,
     even, to your object?"
"Unfortunately, no. There are no windows at the back; and as to the door—like you, it was
     that which I tried, with the result that recently—yesterday, in fact—I was metaphorically shown
     out."
Julia had learnt enough by this time, though she had not been told for certain, that her
     first suspicions were right; to be sure, it was the explosive which took Rawson-Clew to the
     little village evening after evening. She had gathered as much from various things which had
     been said, though she did not know at all how he was trying to get it, nor in what way he had
     introduced himself to Herr Van de Greutz. Whatever method he had tried it was now clear he had
     failed; no doubt been found out, for the chemist, unlike Joost Van Heigen, was the very reverse
     of unsuspecting, and thoroughly on the look-out for other nations who wanted to share his
     discovery. For
      a moment Julia wished she had been in Rawson-Clew's place; of course she, too,
     might have failed—probably would; she had no reason to think she would succeed where he could
     not; but she certainly would not have failed in this for the reason she had failed with the
     blue daffodil. The attempt would have been so thoroughly well worth making; there would have
     been some sport in it, and a foe worthy of her steel. In spite of her desire for the simple
     life, she had too much real ability for this sort of intrigue, and too much past practice in
     subterfuge, not to experience lapses of inclination for it when she saw such work being done,
     and perhaps not done well. Of this, however, she naturally did not speak to Rawson-Clew; she
     rearranged her flowers in silence for a little while, at last she said—
"It is hateful to fail."
"It is ignominious, certainly; one does not wish to blazon it from the housetops; still,
     doubtless like your crochet work, it is good discipline."
"Maybe," Julia allowed, but without conviction. "Yours seems a simple failure, mine is a
     compound one. If it is ignominious, as you say, to fail, it would have been equally ignominious
     in another way if I had succeeded. I could not have been satisfied either way."
"That sounds very complicated," Rawson-Clew said; "but then, I imagine you are a complicated
     young person."
"And you are not."
"Not young, certainly," he said, lighting another cigarette.
"Nor complicated," she insisted; "you are built on straight lines; there are given things you
     can do and can't do, would do and would not do, and might do in an emer
     gency. It is a fine kind of person to be, but it is not the kind which surprises
     itself."
Rawson-Clew blew a smoke-ring into the air; he was smiling a little.
"How old are you?" he said. "Twenty? Almost twenty-one, is it? And until you were sixteen you
     knocked about a bit? Sixteen is too young to come much across the natural man—not the artful
     dodging man, or the man of civilisation, but the natural, primitive man, own blood relation to
     Adam and the king of the Cannibal Islands. You may meet him by and by, and if you do he may
     surprise you; he is full of surprises—he rather surprises himself, that is, if his local
     habitat is ordinarily an educated, decent person."
"You have not got a natural man," Julia said shortly; she was annoyed, without quite knowing
     why, by his manner.
"Have I not? Quite likely; certainly, he has never bothered me, but I should not like to
     count on him. Since we have got to personalities, may I say that you have got a natural woman,
     and plenty of her; also a marked taste for the works of the machine, in preference to the face
     usually presented to the company?"
"The works are the only interesting part; I don't care for the drawing-room side of things;
     they are cultivated, but they are too much on the skin. I would much rather be a stoker, or an
     engineer, than sit on deck all day and talk about Florentine art, and the Handel Festival, and
     Egyptology, and the gospel of Tolstoy, and play cricket and quoits, and dance a little, and
     sing a little, and flirt a little, ever so nicely. Oh, there are lots of girls who can do all
     those things, and do them equally well; I know a few who can, well off, well-bred girls—you
     must know a great many. They are clever to begin with, and they
      are taught that way; it is a perfect treat to meet them and watch them, but I
     never want to imitate them, even if I could—and there is no danger of that. I would rather be
     in the engine-room, with my coat off, a bit greasy and very profane, and doing something. There
     would be more flesh and blood there, even if it were a bit grubby; I believe I'm more at home
     with people who can do—well, what's necessary, even if it is not exactly nice."
Rawson-Clew knew exactly the kind of woman she had described for the deck—he met them often;
     charming creatures, far as the poles asunder from the girl who spoke of them; he liked them—in
     moderation, and in their place, much as his forebears of fifty years ago had liked theirs, the
     delicate, sensitive creatures of that era. He had never regarded Julia in that light; he found
     her certainly more entertaining as a companion, though also very far short of the standard as a
     woman and an ornament.
"The people in the engine-room," he observed, "would certainly be more useful in an
     emergency; still, life is not made up entirely of emergencies."
"No," Julia answered; "and in between times such people are better not on show—I know that;
     that is why I do not care for the drawing-room side of things, I don't know enough to shine in
     them."
"Do you think it is a matter of knowledge?" he asked, "or inclination? If it comes to
     knowledge I should say you had a rather remarkable stock of an unusual sort, and at first hand.
     That may not be what is required for a complete drawing-room success, though I am not sure that
     it is not more interesting—say for an excursion—than a flitting glance at the subjects you
     mention, and about eighteen or twenty more that you did not."
     
Julia looked up, half pleased, doubtful as to whether or not to interpret this as a
     compliment; she never knew quite how much he meant of what he said; his manner was exactly the
     same, whether he was in fun or in earnest. But if she thought of asking him now she was
     prevented, for at that moment Mr. Gillat's watch slipped out of her belt into her lap, and she
     saw the time.
"How late is it!" she exclaimed. "We ought to have started half-an-hour ago; it will take me
     two hours, and more, to get home from here, even if I go by the tram in the town."
She rose as she spoke, and he rose more slowly.
"Shall I take your flowers for you?" he asked. "They seem rather inclined to tumble about;
     don't you think they would be safer in my pocket? As you say you are going to dry them, it
     won't matter crushing them."
She gave them to him, and he put the sweet-smelling bunch into his pocket, then they started
     for the edge of the wood.
"It is much colder," Julia said; "and the sun is all gone; I suppose the clouds have been
     coming gradually, but I did not notice before. If it is going to rain, we shall get decidedly
     wet before we get back."
"I am afraid so," he agreed; "you have no coat."
She told him that did not matter, she did not mind getting wet, and she spoke with a cheerful
     buoyancy that carried conviction.
When they reached the outskirts of the wood, however, they saw there was not much chance of
     rain, but a much worse evil threatened. All the distance on the seaward side was blotted out, a
     fine white mist shut out the curving land in that direction. It was blowing up towards them,
     rolling down the little hills in billowy puffs, and
      lying filmy, yet dense, in the hollows, moved by a wind unfelt here.
"A sea fog," Julia said; "I wonder how far it is coming."
Rawson-Clew wondered too; he thought, as she did, that there was every chance of its coming
     far and fast, but it did not seem necessary to either of them to say anything so unpleasantly
     and obviously probable.
They set out homewards as fast as they could; it was a long way to the place where they had
     climbed up, unfortunately all across open country, entirely without roads or definite paths,
     and the drifting sea fog was coming up fast, bound, it would seem, the same way. Soon it was
     upon them; they felt its advance in the chill that, like cold fingers, laid hold on everything;
     it came quite silently up from behind, without noticeable wind, eerily creeping up and
     enfolding everything, putting a white winding-sheet not about the earth only, but the very air
     also. The cotton blouse that Julia wore became limp and wet as if it had been dipped in water;
     she could see the fog condensing in beads on her companion's coat almost like hoar frost; it
     lay on every low-growing rose bush and bramble that they stepped upon, a curious transformer of
     all near objects, a complete obliterator of all more distant ones.
They pushed on as quickly as might be, climbing little hills, descending into hollows;
     stumbling among rabbit holes, threading their way through thickets; apparently finding
     something amusing in the patriarchal colonies of rabbit burrows that tripped them up, and
     stopping to argue, though hardly in earnest, as to whether they had passed that way or not,
     when some white-barked tree, or other landmark, loomed suddenly out of the thickening mist.
     Once it seemed the fog was going to lift; Julia thought she saw the outline of a distant hill,
     but either
      it was closed in again directly, or else she mistook a thicker fold of cloud for
     a more solid object, for it was lost almost before she pointed it out.
For something over two hours they walked and stumbled, and went up small ascents and came
     down small declines; then suddenly they came upon the white-barked tree again. It was the same
     one that they had seen more than an hour and a half ago; Rawson-Clew recognised it by a
     peculiar warty growth where the branches forked; they had now approached it from the other
     side, but clearly it was the same one, and they had come round in a circle.
He stopped and pointed it out to her. "I am afraid," he said, "we had better do what is
     recommended when the clouds come down on the mountains."
"And that is?" Julia asked.
"Sit down and wait till they shift."
She could not but see the advisability of this, also she was very tired, the going for these
     two hours had not been easy, and it had come at the end of a long day. She would not admit,
     even to herself, that she was tired, but she was, so she agreed to the waiting; after all, it
     was impossible to pretend longer that they were going to get home easily, and were not really
     hopelessly astray.
"We will go a little way in among the trees," Rawson-Clew said; "it is more sheltered, and we
     shall be able to find the way quite as easily from one place as another when the fog
     lifts."
They found as sheltered a spot as they could, and sat down under a big tree; as they did so
     his hand came in contact with Julia's wet sleeve and cold arm. "How cold you are!" he said.
     "You have nothing on."
"Oh, yes, I have," she assured him. "I did not avail myself of your permission this morning."
     
He took off his coat and put it round her.
But she threw it off again. "That won't do at all," she said; "now you have nothing on, and
     that is much more improper; women may sit in their shirt sleeves, men may not."
"Don't be absurd!" he said authoritatively; "you are to keep that on," and he wrapped it
     about her with a decision that brought home to her her youth and smallness.
"You are shutting all the damp in," she protested, shifting her point of attack, "and that is
     very unwholesome. I shan't get warm; I haven't any warmth to start with; you are wasting what
     you have got to no purpose."
But he did not waste it, for eventually it was arranged that they sat close together under
     the tree, with the coat put as far as it would go over both of them. Rawson-Clew was not given
     to thinking how things looked, he did what he thought necessary, or advisable, without taking
     any thought of that kind; so it did not occur to him how this arrangement might look to an
     unprejudiced observer, had there been any such. But Julia, with her faculty for seeing herself
     as others saw her, was much, though silently, amused as she thought of the Van Heigens. Poor,
     kind folks, they were doubtless already wondering what could have become of her; if they could
     only have seen her sitting thus, with an unknown man, what would their Dutch propriety have
     said?
"Do you suppose this fog will be in the town?" Rawson-Clew said, after a time.
"No," she answered, "I should think not; from what I have heard, I think it is very
     unlikely."
"Then the Van Heigens won't know what has become of you?"
"Not a bit in the world; they don't even know where
      I was going to-day. I did not tell them; I am afraid they will be rather uneasy
     about me, but perhaps not so very much, they know by this time I can take care of myself;
     besides, I shall be home before bed-time, if the fog lifts."
Rawson-Clew agreed, and they talked of other things. Julia held the opinion that when an evil
     has to be endured, not cured, there is no good in discussing it over and over again; she had a
     considerable gift for making the best of other things besides opportunities.
But the fog did not lift soon; it did not grow denser, but it did not grow less; it just lay
     soft and chilly, casting a white pall of silence on all things, closing day before its time,
     and making it impossible to say when evening ended and night began. Gradually the two who
     waited for its lifting fell into silence, and Julia, tired out, at last dropped asleep, her
     head tilted back against the tree-trunk, her shoulder pressed close against Rawson-Clew under
     the shelter of his coat.
He did not move, he was afraid of waking her; he sat watching, waiting in the eerie white
     stillness, until at last the space before him altered, and gradually between the trees he saw
     the faint outline of a hill, dark against the dark sky. Slowly the white mist rolled from it, a
     billowy, ghostly thing, that left a black, vague world, only dimly seen. He looked at the
     sleeping girl, then at the hill; the fog was clearing, there was no doubt about that; soon it
     would be quite gone, but it would be a very dark night, the stars would hardly show, and the
     moon was now long down. He was not at all sure of being able to find his way across this
     undulating country, so entirely devoid of prominent features, in a very dark night. Rather he
     was nearly sure that he could not do it; and though he had a by no means low opinion of Julia's
     abilities, he did not think that she could either. Also, with a sense
      of dramatic fitness equal to that of the girl's he thought their arrival in the
     town would be rather ill-timed if they started now. It would be wiser to wait till after it was
     light, though dawn was not so very early now, the summer being far advanced. So he decided, and
     Julia slept peacefully on, her head dropping lower and lower, till finally it reached his
     shoulder. But he did not move; he left it resting there, and waited, thinking of nothing
     perhaps, or anything; or perhaps of that unknown quantity, the natural man, which has a way of
     stirring sometimes even in the most civilised, at night time. So he sat and watched for the
     dawn.
