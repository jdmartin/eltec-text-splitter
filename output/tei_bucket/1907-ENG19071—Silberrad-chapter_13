CHAPTER XII
THE YOUNG COOK
It was about ten o'clock on an October night; everything was intensely quiet in the big
     kitchen where Julia stood. It was not a cheerful place even in the day time, the windows looked
     north, and were very high up; the walls and floor were alike of grey stone, which gave it a
     prison-like aspect, and also took much scrubbing, as she had reason to know. It was far too
     large a place to be warmed by the small stove now used; Julia sometimes wondered if the big one
     that stood empty in its place would have been sufficient to warm it. She glanced at it now, but
     without interest; she was very tired, it was almost bed-time, and she had done, as she had
     every day since she first joined Herr Van de Greutz's household, a very good day's work. She
     had scarcely been outside the four walls since she first came there on the day after the
     holiday on the Dunes. This had been her own choice, for, unlike all the cooks who had been
     before her, she had asked for no evenings out. Marthe, the short-tempered housekeeper, had not
     troubled herself to wonder why, she had been only too pleased to accept the arrangement without
     comment. Apart from the self-chosen confinement, the life had been hard enough; the work was
     hard, the service hard and ill-paid, and both the other inmates of the house cross-grained, and
     difficult to please. These things, however, Julia did not mind; discomfort never mat
     tered much to her when she had an end in view; in this case, too, the end should
     more than repay the worst of her two task-masters. Which was agreeable, and almost made his
     unpleasantness desirable, as providing her intended act with a justification.
She drew the coffee pot further on to the stove, and with a splinter of wood stirred the
     fire. She had the kitchen to herself, old Marthe had gone to bed; she liked going to bed early,
     with a glass of something hot, and she had soon found that the young cook could be trusted to
     finish the work down-stairs. It was her opinion that it is as well to be comfortable when you
     can, as blessings are fleeting and fickle, especially when they are cooks; so she indulged
     often both in bed and the glass, notably the glass. She had not been able to go to bed quite as
     early as she liked that day, for her master had a visitor, and there had been some trouble
     after the dinner. It was intended to be an hour later than usual to accommodate the visitor,
     but the chemist had not mentioned the fact—he seldom troubled about such trifles, expecting his
     household to divine his wishes instinctively, and resenting their failure to do so with
     indignation and some abuse. He did so to-day, and Marthe was consequently kept up later than
     she had intended, though it was Julia who came in for most of the reproof, and the trouble too;
     it was she who took away the dinner and kept it hot, and presented it afresh when the time came
     in as good condition as she could manage. There had to be a second omelet made; the first would
     not stand an hour, and so was wasted, to the indignation of Marthe. The chicken was a trifle
     dried by waiting, which called down the wrath of Herr Van de Greutz. Julia had listened to both
     of them with a meekness which was beautiful to see, albeit perhaps a little suspicious in one
     of her nature.
     
She glanced up at the clock now, then rose and fetched two thick white coffee cups, and set
     them ready on a tray, and sat down again. She wondered drowsily how long Herr Van de Greutz's
     visitor would stay. He was a German, a very great scientist; the chemist looked upon him as a
     friend and an equal, a brother in arms; they talked together freely in the cryptic language of
     science, and in German, which is the tongue best fitted to help out the other. Julia heard them
     when she went to and from with the dishes at dinner time. She did not understand chemistry, a
     fact she much regretted; had she known even half as much as Rawson-Clew, the desired end would
     have been much sooner within reach. It is a very great disadvantage to have only a very vague
     idea what it is you want. But she did understand German very well, consequently part of the
     chemists' conversation was quite intelligible to her, though they did not know it. Herr Van de
     Greutz knew and cared nothing about her; he was not even aware that she was English, though, of
     course, old Marthe was.
If the conversation had touched on the famous explosive at dinner time, Julia would have
     known it; she was always on the watch for some such occurrence. Unfortunately it had not,
     although, as she saw plainly, the German was the sort of man with whom Van de Greutz would
     discuss such things. She had still another chance of hearing something; she would soon have to
     take the coffee into the laboratory; they might be speaking of it then. She remembered once
     before Van de Greutz had spoken of it to a scientific guest at such a time; she had then heard
     some unenlightening technical details, which might have been of some value to a chemist, but
     were of no use at all to her ignorance. It was hard to come thus near, and yet be as far off as
     ever, but such things are
      likely to occur when one is in pursuit of anything, Julia knew that; she was
     prepared to wait, by and by she would find out what it was she wanted, and then—
A bell rang peremptorily; she hastily poured the strong black coffee into the two cups, and
     put a bottle of Schiedam on the tray. As she did so she noticed that it was nearly empty, so
     she fetched another full one, and added that to the tray. The bell did not ring again, although
     getting the second bottle had hindered her, for by this time the chemists had forgotten they
     wanted coffee. When she entered the laboratory, Herr Van de Greutz had just taken a bottle from
     the lower part of a cupboard near the door. Second shelf from the floor, five bottles from the
     left-hand corner. Julia observed the place with self-trained accuracy as she passed Herr Van de
     Greutz with the tray, which she carried to the table far down the room.
"This is it," Van de Greutz said; "a small quantity only, you see, but the authorities have a
     ridiculous objection to one's keeping any large one of explosive. Of course, I have more, in a
     stone house in my garden; it is perhaps safer so, seeing its nature, and the fact that one is
     always liable to small accidents in a laboratory."
Julia put down the tray, but upset some of the coffee. Seeing that excitement had not usually
     the effect of making her hand unsteady, it is possible accident had not much to do with it.
     However, it happened; she carefully wiped it up, and the two chemists, paying no more attention
     to her than if she had been a cat, went on speaking of the explosive. It was the
     explosive; their talk told her that before she had finished the wiping.
"The formula I would give for it?" Van de Greutz was saying; as she sopped up the last drops,
     he gave the formula.
     
She lifted the full bottle of Schiedam from the tray, and carried it away with her—in the
     hand farthest from the chemist's, certainly, but with as little concealment as ostentation.
     Near the door she glanced at the German, or rather, at what he held, the sample of the
     explosive. It was a white powder in a wide-necked, stoppered bottle of the size Julia herself
     called "quarter pint." The bottle was not more than two-thirds full, and had no mark on it at
     all, except a small piece of paper stuck to the side, and inscribed with the single letter "A."
     This may have been done in accordance with some private system of Herr Van de Greutz's, or it
     may have been for the sake of secrecy. The reason did not matter; the most accurate name would
     have been no more informing to Julia, but decidedly more inconvenient.
She went out and shut the door quietly; then she literally fled back to the kitchen with the
     Schiedam. Scarcely waiting to set it down, she seized a slip of kitchen paper, and scribbled on
     it the string of letters and figures that Herr Van de Greutz had given as the formula of his
     explosive. She did not know what a formula was, nor in what relation it stood to the chemical
     body, but from the talks she had heard between the chemist and his friends, she guessed it to
     be something important. Accordingly, when he said the formula, she was as careful to remember
     it accurately as she was to remember the place of the bottle on the shelf. Now she wrote it
     down just as he spoke it, and, though perhaps not exactly as he would have written it, still
     comprehensible. She pinned the piece of paper in the cuff of her dress; it would not be found
     there if, by ill luck, she was caught and searched later on. Next she went to the kitchen
     cupboard; there were several wide-necked stoppered bottles there, doubtless without the
     chemist's knowledge, but Marthe found
      them convenient for holding spices, and ginger, and such things. She took the one
     nearest in shape and size to the one which she had seen in the German's hand; emptied out the
     contents, dusted it and put in ground rice till it was two-thirds full. Then, with the
     lap-scissors, she trimmed a piece of paper to the right size, wrote "A" upon it, and stuck it
     to the side of the bottle with a dab of treacle—she had nothing else. She was hastily wiping
     off the surplus stickiness when the bell rang again. She finished what she was doing, and
     shrouded the bottle in a duster, so that there was another summons before she could set out.
     She took the Schiedam with her—of course it was that which was rung for, but also the bottle in
     the duster.
She did not hurry. "I'll give him time to put the explosive back," she thought. It was just
     possible that it would be set on a bench, perhaps in an awkward place, but from her knowledge
     of Van de Greutz's ways she guessed not. It was also, of course, possible that the cupboard
     where it was kept would be locked; in that case, nothing could be done just now—annoying, but
     not desperate; ground rice will keep, and, apparently, explosives too, so she reflected as she
     opened the laboratory door. But the cupboard was not locked, and the bottle was back in its
     place. Another from the shelf above had been taken out; the chemists were discussing that as
     they sat smoking cigars at the table far down the room, where the coffee cups stood.
"More Schiedam!" Herr Van de Greutz said, throwing the words at Julia over his shoulder. "Why
     did you bring an empty bottle?"
"I am sorry, Mijnheer," Julia answered; "there was not much, I know; I have brought
     more."
She pushed the door to with her foot as she spoke, and
      with the hand not carrying the spirit set down the duster and the bottle it held
     on a chair. The German had put his coat over the chair earlier; it stood in front of the
     cupboard, a little way from it. With the true rogue's eye for cover, Julia noted the value of
     its position, and even improved it by moving it a little to the left as she knocked against it
     in passing.
She brought the Schiedam to the table. "Shall I take the cups, Mijnheer?" she asked.
"Yes," Van de Greutz answered shortly, resenting the interruption, "and go to the devil. As I
     was saying, it is very unstable."
This was to the German, and did not concern Julia; she took the tray of cups and went. But
     near the door there was an iron tripod lying on the floor; she caught her foot in it, stumbled
     and fell headlong, dropping tray and cups with a great clatter.
There was a general exclamation of annoyance and anger from Van de Greutz, of surprise and
     commiseration from the German, and of something that might have been fright or pain from
     Julia.
"You clumsy fool!" Van de Greutz cried. "Get out of here, and don't let me see your face, or
     hear your trampling ass-hoofs again! Do you hear me, I won't have you in here again!"
The German was more sympathetic. "Have you hurt yourself?" he asked.
"No, Mijnheer, nothing," Julia answered; "only a little—my knees and elbows." Had she been
     playing Othello, though she might not have blacked herself all over, it is certain she would
     have carried the black a long way below high water mark. This was no painless stage stumble,
     but one with real bruises and a real thud.
The German had half risen; perhaps he thought of
      coming to help pick up the pieces of broken cups that were scattered between the
     cupboard and the chair. But he did not do so, for Herr Van de Greutz went on to speak of his
     unstable compound.
"I treated it with—" he said, and, seeing this was something very daring, the other's
     attention was caught.
Julia picked up the pieces alone, and carried them out on the tray, and on the tray also she
     carried a bottle wrapped into a duster. It was a wide-necked stoppered bottle, two-thirds full
     of white powder; very much like the one she had brought in, but also very much like the one
     that stood five from the end on the second shelf of the cupboard.
Soon after that she went up to her room, and took the bottle with her. Then, when she had set
     it in a place of safety, and securely locked the door, she broke into a silent laugh of
     delighted amusement. She pictured to herself Herr Van de Greutz's face when, in company with
     some other chemist, he found the ground rice, while his cook with the "ass-hoofs" carried the
     explosive to her native land.
"What a thief I should make," was her own opinion of herself. "I believe I could do as well
     as Grimm's 'Master Thief,' who stole the parson and clerk." She took up the bottle and shook a
     little of the contents into her hand; she had not the least idea how it was set off, whether a
     blow, a fall, or heat would reveal its dangerous characteristics. For a little she looked at it
     with curiosity and satisfaction. But gradually the satisfaction faded; the excitement of the
     chase was over, and the prize, now it was won, did not seem a great thing. She set the bottle
     down rather distastefully, and turned away.
"He could not have got the stuff," she told herself defiantly—"he" was Rawson-Clew—but the
     next moment,
      with the justice she dealt herself, she admitted, "Because he would not get it
     this way; he is not rogue enough; while as for me—I am a born rogue."
She pushed open the window and looked out, although it was quite dark, and the air pervaded
     with a cold, rank smell of wet vegetation. She was thinking of the other piece of roguery which
     she had meant to commit, and yet had not. She had the bulb, in spite of that; it was safe among
     her clothes—hers by a free gift, hers absolutely, yet as unable to be sold as the lock of a
     dead mother's hair. The debt of honour could not be paid by that. From her heart she wished she
     had not got the daffodil; she put it in the same category with Mr. Gillat's watch, as one of
     the things which made her ashamed of herself and of her life, even of this last act, and the
     very skill that had made it easy.
She took up the bottle again, and for a moment considered whether she should give it back to
     Herr Van de Greutz—not personally, that would hardly be safe; but she could post it from
     England after she left his service. But she did not do so; Rawson-Clew stood in the way; it was
     for him she had taken it, and her purpose in him still stood. He wanted the explosive, it would
     be to his credit and honour to have it; the government service to which he belonged would think
     highly of him if he had it—if he received it anonymously, so that he could not tell from whence
     it came, and they could not divide the credit of getting it between him and another. He wanted
     it, and he had been good to her. He had been kind when she was in trouble; he had not believed
     her when she had called herself dishonest; he had treated her as an equal, in spite of the
     affair at Marbridge, and he had asked her to marry him when he thought she was compromised by
     the holiday in the Dunes. For a moment her
      mind strayed from the point at issue, to that offer of marriage. She remembered
     the exact wording of the letter as if she had but just received it, and it pleased her afresh.
     She did not regret that she had refused him; nothing else had been possible. She did not want
     to marry him; albeit, when they had sat together under his coat, she had not shrunk from
     contact with him as she had shrunk from Joost when he had tried to take her hand—that was
     certainly strange. But she was quite sure she did not want to marry him; now she came to think
     about it, she could imagine that, were she a girl of his own class, with the looks, training
     and knowledge that belonged, she might have found him precisely the man she would have wanted
     to marry.
She went to a drawer and took out an old handkerchief. She was not a girl of that sort—deep
     down she felt inarticulately the old primitive consciousness of inferiority and superiority, at
     once jealous and contemptuous; marrying him and living always on his plane were alike
     impossible to her, but she could give him the explosive. There was not one girl among all those
     others who could have got it and given it to him!
She tore a piece from the handkerchief, and fastened it over the stopper of the bottle; then
     she got out a hat trimmed with bows of wide ribbon, and sewed the bottle into the centre bow.
     It presented rather a bulgy appearance, but by a little pulling of the other trimming it was
     hardly noticeable, and really nothing is too peculiar to be worn on the head. After that she
     went to bed.
There was trouble in Herr Van de Greutz's kitchen the next day; the young cook, who had
     behaved so admirably before, did what old Marthe called "showing the cloven
     hoof." She was impertinent, she was idle; she broke dishes, she wasted eggs, and
     she lighted a roaring fire in the big stove, in spite of the strict economy of fuel which was
     one of the first rules of the household. Finally she announced that she must have a day's
     holiday. Marthe refused point blank, whereupon the cook said she should take it, and a dispute
     ensued; Marthe called her several names, and reminded her of the fact that she had no
     character, and that she had confessed to being obliged to leave the Van Heigens in haste. Julia
     retorted that that fact was known to the housekeeper when she engaged her, and was the reason
     of the starvation wage offered. Marthe then inquired what enormity it was that she had
     committed at the Van Heigens', and intimated that it must be disgraceful indeed for a person,
     pretending to be a lady-help, to be thankful to accept the situation of cook. Julia's answer
     was scarcely polite, and very well calculated to rouse the old woman further, and, at the same
     time, she opened the door and skilfully worked herself and her antagonist into the passage, and
     some way up it, raising her voice so as to incite the other to raise hers. The result was that
     soon the noise reached Herr Van de Greutz.
Out he came in a great rage, ordering them about their business, and abusing them roundly.
     Marthe hurried back to the kitchen, effectually silenced, but Julia remained; she had not got
     her dismissal yet, and it was imperative she should get it, for there was no telling when the
     ground rice would be discovered. But she soon got what she wanted; after a very little more
     inciting, Herr Van de Greutz ordered her out of his house a great deal more peremptorily than
     she had been ordered out of the Van Heigens'. She was to go at once; she was to pack her things
     and go, and Marthe was to see that she took nothing but what was her own; she was the most un
     trustworthy and incompetent pig that the devil ever sent to spoil good food, and
     steal silver spoons.
To this Julia replied by asking for her wages. At first Van de Greutz refused; but Julia,
     with some effrontery, considering the circumstances, declined to go without them, so eventually
     he thought better of it and paid her. After that she and Marthe went up-stairs, and she packed
     and Marthe looked on, closely scrutinising everything. When all was done, and she herself
     dressed, she walked out of the house, with the formula fastened inside her cuff, and the
     explosive balanced on her head. And the old man who did the rough work about the place came
     with her, wheeling her luggage on a barrow as far as the gate. Here he shot it out, and left
     her to wait till she might hail some passing cart, and so get herself conveyed to the town.
