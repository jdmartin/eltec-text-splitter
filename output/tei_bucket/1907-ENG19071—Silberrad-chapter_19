CHAPTER XVIII
BEHIND THE CHOPPING-BLOCK
Captain Polkington, Johnny and Julia were busy in the garden. It was a fine afternoon
     following after two or three wet days and the ground was in splendid condition for planting,
     also for sticking to clothes. The sandy road to Halgrave dried quickly, but the garden, of
     heavier soil, did not, as was testified by Julia's boots—she had bought a small pair of
     plough-boy's boots that spring and was wearing them now, very pleased with the investment. By
     and by the sound of a motor broke the silence; the Captain and Johnny left off work to listen;
     at least, Johnny did; the Captain was hardly in a position to leave off, seeing that he was off
     most of his time.
"It sounds like a motor-car," Johnny said, as if he had made a discovery.
"Then it must have lost its way," Julia answered, giving all her attention to her cabbage
     plants.
Johnny said "Yes." It certainly seemed likely enough; the ubiquitous motor-car went
     everywhere certainly; even, it was possible to imagine, to remote and uninteresting Halgrave.
     But along the ill-kept sandy road which led to White's Cottage and nowhere else, none had been
     yet, nor was it in the least likely that one would ever come except by accident.
The sounds drew nearer. "It certainly is coming this
      way," the Captain said; "I will go and explain the mistake to the people."
The Captain went to the gate; but he did not stop there, nor did he explain anything. His
     eyesight, never having been subjected to strain or over work, was good, and the car, owing to
     the loose nature of the road, was not coming very fast; he saw it had only one occupant, a man
     who seemed familiar to him. For a second the Captain stared, then he turned and went into the
     house in surprising haste. He had not the least idea what had brought this man here; indeed,
     when he came to think about it, he was sure it must have been some mistake about the road. But
     he had no desire to explain; he felt he was not the person to do so, seeing that the last (and
     first) time he had seen the man was in an unpleasant interview at Marbridge. He connected
     several painful things, humiliation, undeserved epithets, and so on, with that interview and
     with the face of Rawson-Clew. Accordingly, he went into the house and waited, and the car came
     nearer and stopped.
Johnny and Julia went on with their work; they imagined the Captain was talking to the
     strangers; they had no idea of his discreet withdrawal until Julia came round the corner of the
     house to fetch a trowel, and saw Rawson-Clew coming up the path.
Julia's first feeling was blank amazement, but being a Polkington, and being that before she
     took to the simple life and its honest ways, she allowed nothing more than polite surprise to
     appear.
"Why!" she said, "I had no idea you were anywhere near here."
"I had no idea that you were until recently," he returned.
     
She wondered how recently; if it was this minute when chance brought her for the trowel—very
     likely it was, and he was here by accident.
"Have you lost your way?" she inquired.
"Not to-day."
"Where were you trying to go?"
"White's Cottage."
"Oh!" she said. He did not look amused, but she felt as if he were, and clearly it was not
     accident that had brought him.
"How did you know I was here?" she asked. "There are not many people who could have told you.
     I have retired, you know."
He settled his eyeglass carefully in the way she remembered, and looked first at the cottage
     and then at her. "I observe the retirement," he said; "but the corduroy?"
"I am wearing out my old clothes first," she answered.
Just then Johnny's voice was heard. "Hadn't I better water the plants?" it asked. Next moment
     Mr. Gillat came in sight carrying a big water can. "Julia hadn't I better—" he began, then he
     saw the visitor.
"Ah, Mr. Gillat," Rawson-Clew said. "How are you? I am glad to see you again; last time I
     called at Berwick Street you were not there."
Johnny set down the water can. "Glad to see you," he said beaming; "very glad, very glad,
     indeed"—he would have been pleased to see Rawson-Clew anywhere if for no other reason than that
     he had shown an interest in Julia's welfare.
Meanwhile Captain Polkington sat in the kitchen listening for the sound of the departing
     motor. But it did not come; everything was still except for the ceaseless singing of larks, to
     which he was so used now that it had
     come almost to seem like silence. He began to grow uneasy; what if, after all,
     Rawson-Clew were not here by accident and mistake. What if he had come on some wretched and
     uncomfortable business? The Captain could not think of anything definite, but that, he felt,
     did not make it impossible. The man certainly had not gone, he must be staying talking to
     Julia. Well, Julia could talk to him, she was more fit to see the business through than her
     father was. There was some comfort in this thought, but it did not last long, for just then the
     silence was broken, there was a sound of steps, not going down the path to the gate, but coming
     towards the kitchen door! The Captain rose hastily—it was too bad of Julia, too bad! He was not
     fit for these shocks and efforts; he was not what he used to be; the terrible cold of the
     winter in this place had told on his rheumatism, on his heart. He crossed the room quickly. The
     door which shut in the staircase banged as that of the big kitchen was pushed open.
"You had better take your boots off here, Johnny," Julia said; "you have got lots of mud on
     them."
She took off her own as she spoke, slipping out of them without having much trouble with the
     laces. Rawson-Clew watched her, finding a somewhat absurd satisfaction in seeing her small
     arched feet free of the clumsy boots.
"Are not your stockings wet?" he said.
"No," she answered; "not a bit."
"Are you quite sure? I think they must be."
"No, they are not; are they, Johnny?" She stood on one foot and put the other into Mr.
     Gillat's hand.
Johnny felt it carefully, giving it the same consideration that a wise housekeeper gives to
     the airing of sheets, then he gave judgment in favour of Julia.
"I was right, you see," she said; "they are quite dry."
     
She looked up as she spoke, and met Rawson-Clew's eyes; there was something strange there,
     something new which brought the colour to her face. She went quickly into the other kitchen and
     began to get the tea.
Johnny came to help her, and the visitor offered his assistance, too. Julia at once sent the
     latter to the pump for water, which she did not want. When he came back she had recovered
     herself, had even abused herself roundly for imagining this new thing or misinterpreting it.
     There was no question of man and woman between her and Rawson-Clew; there never had been and
     never could be (although he had asked her to marry him). It was all just impersonal and
     friendly; it was absurd or worse to think for an instant that he had another feeling, had any
     feeling at all—any more than she. And again she abused herself, perhaps because it is not easy
     to be sure of feelings, either your own or other people's, even if you want to, and it
     certainly is not easy to always want what you ought. Moreover, there was a difference; it was
     impossible to overlook it, she felt in herself or him, or both. She had altered since they
     parted at the Van Heigens', perhaps grown to be a woman. After all she was a woman, with a
     great deal of the natural woman in her, too, he had said—and he was a man, a gentleman, first,
     perhaps, polished and finished, her senior, her superior—yet a man, possibly with his share of
     the natural man, the thing on which one cannot reckon. Just then the kettle boiled and she made
     the tea.
"Where is father?" she asked; and Mr. Gillat went to look for him.
"He is up-stairs," he said when he came back; "he does not feel well, he says, not the thing;
     he'll have tea up there; I'll take it."
     
Julia looked at Rawson-Clew and laughed. "He does not feel equal to facing you," she
     said.
"Yes, yes," Johnny added, "that's it; that's what he says—I mean"—suddenly realising what he
     was saying—"he does not feel equal to facing strangers."
"Mr. Rawson-Clew is not a stranger," Julia answered; she took a perverse delight in recalling
     the beginning of the acquaintance which she knew quite well was better ignored. "How odd," she
     said, turning to Rawson-Clew, "that father should have forgotten you, just as you told me you
     had forgotten him and all about the time when you saw him."
"I expect he regarded the matter as trivial and unimportant, just as I did," Rawson-Clew
     answered; "though if I told you I had forgotten all about it I made a mistake; I can hardly say
     that; I remember some details quite plainly; for instance, your position—you stood between your
     father and me—very much as you did between me and the Van Heigens."
"I did not!" Julia said hotly, pouring the tea all over the edge of the cup; "I didn't stand
     between you and the Van Heigens. I mean—"
"Allow me!" Rawson-Clew moved the cup so that she poured the tea into it and not the
     saucer.
"Dear, dear!" Johnny said; he had not the least idea what they were talking about, but he
     fancied that one or both must be annoyed, perhaps by the upsetting of the tea; he could think
     of nothing else. "Such a mess," he said; "and such a waste. Is the cup ready? Shall I take it
     up-stairs?"
"No, thank you," Julia said; "I will take it."
Rawson-Clew did not seem to mind, and Julia, after she had lingered a little with her father,
     decided to come
     down again. If she stayed away she knew perfectly well that Johnny would do
     nothing but talk about her; moreover it was absurd to be put out because Rawson-Clew could
     answer better than Mr. Gillat; that was one of the reasons for which she had liked him.
Captain Polkington sipped his tea and ate his bread and butter peacefully. Julia had told him
     Mr. Rawson-Clew would not be staying long; she had not exactly said why he was come, it seemed
     rather as if she did not know; but apparently nothing unpleasant had happened so far and he
     would be going soon, directly after tea no doubt. So the Captain sat contentedly and listened
     for the sound of going, but he did not hear it; they were a very long time over tea, he
     thought.
They were; two of them were purposely spinning it out, the third was only a happy chorus.
     Julia was in no hurry to face the questions about the explosive which she feared must come when
     Johnny's restraining presence was removed. She knew, as soon as she was sure Rawson-Clew's
     coming was design and not accident, that he must have suspected her; he had come to talk about
     it and he would do so as soon as he got the chance, so she put it off. And he was quite willing
     to wait too; he was enjoying the present moment with a curious light-hearted enjoyment much
     younger than his years. And he was enjoying the future moment, too, in anticipation, albeit he
     was a little shy of it—he did not quite know how he was to close with the garrison in the
     citadel even though he might have taken all the outposts.
But at last tea was done and the table cleared and all the things taken to the outer kitchen
     to be washed. Julia decreed that she and Johnny were to do that, then unthinkingly she sent her
     assistant for a tea-cloth. Rawson-Clew was standing by the doorway when Johnny passed; he
     followed him out.
     
"Mr. Gillat, your plants want watering," he said, quietly but decisively.
"They do, they do," Johnny agreed; "I will have to do them by and by."
"Do them now, it is getting late."
"It is," Mr. Gillat admitted; "we were late with tea, but there's the drying of the
     cups."
"I will do that."
Johnny hesitated; Julia's wish was his law, still there seemed no harm in the exchange;
     anyhow, without quite knowing how it happened, he soon afterwards found himself in the garden
     among the water cans.
Rawson-Clew went back to the outer kitchen. Julia looked round as she heard his step, and
     seeing that he was alone, recognised the manœuvre and the arrival of the inevitable hour.
"Well," she said, coming to the point in a business-like way now that it was unavoidable;
     "what is it you want?"
"I want to know several things," he said, shutting the door. "Principally why you called your
     daffodil 'The Good Comrade?'"
"The daffodil!" she repeated in frank amazement; she was completely surprised, and for once
     she did not attempt to hide it.
"Yes," Rawson-Clew said; "why did you call it 'The Good Comrade?'"
Julia began to recover herself and also her natural caution. This was not the question she
     expected, but the rogue in her made her wary even of the seemingly simple and safe. "I called
     it after three friends," she said, "who were good comrades to me—you, Johnny and Joost Van
     Heigen. Why do you ask?"
"Because I wondered if it was a case of telepathy; I also named something 'The Good Comrade.'"
     
"You?" she said. "What did you name? Was it a dog?"
"No, a bottle—small, wide-necked, stopper fastened with a piece of torn handkerchief, about
     two-thirds full of a white powder!"
Julia had begun washing the cups; she did her best to betray no sign, and really she did it
     very well; her eyelids flickered a little and her breath came rather quickly, nothing more.
"Why did you name it?" she asked. "It is rather odd to do so, isn't it?"
"I named it after the person who gave it to me."
Julia's breath came a little quicker; she forgot to remark that the same reason had helped
     her in naming her flower; she was busy asking herself if he meant her by the good comrade.
"Perhaps I did not exactly name my bottle," he went on to say, "but it stood for the person
     to me. It was a sort of physical manifestation—rather a grotesque one, perhaps—of a spiritual
     presence which had not really left me since a certain sunny morning last year."
"That is very interesting," Julia managed to say; her native caution had not misled her; the
     innocently beginning talk had taken a devious way to the expected end.
"It was interesting," Rawson-Clew said, "but not quite satisfying, at least not to the
     natural man. He is not content with a manifestation any more than with a spiritual presence; he
     wants a corporal fact."
Julia looked up; the talk was taking an unforseen turn that she did not quite follow, so she
     looked up. And then she read something in his face that set her heart beating, that made her
     afraid, less perhaps of him than of herself, and the thrill that ran like fire through her body.
     
"I don't quite understand," she said, and dropped a cup.
It was meant to fall on the flagged floor and break; it would create a diversion, and picking
     up the pieces would give her time to get used to the suffocating heart-beats. She had enough of
     the Polkington self-mastery left to think of the manœuvre and its advisability, but not enough
     to carry it out properly; the cup fell on the doubled-up tea-cloth that lay at her feet and was
     not broken at all. Nevertheless the incident and her own contempt for her failure steadied her
     a little.
Rawson-Clew picked up the cup. "Do you not understand," he said. "It is quite simple; I have
     put it to you before, too—not in the same words, but it comes to the same—the plain terms used
     then were—will you do me the honour of becoming my wife?"
Julia's heart seemed to stop for a second, then it went on heavily as before, but she only
     asked, "Did you not get my letter, the one I wrote in Holland about that?"
"The one when you told me of your arrangements? By the way you did not mention that you were
     going to Van de Greutz's for the explosive, yes, I got that, but it was scarcely an
     answer."
"I explained that it meant 'no.'"
"In a postscript; you cannot answer a proposal of marriage in a postscript."
There really does not seem sufficient ground to justify this statement, still she did not
     combat it. "Can't I?" she said. "Then I will answer it now—no. It was good of you to offer,
     generous and honourable, but, of course, I should not accept. I mean, I could not even if there
     had been any need, and, as you see, there was not a particle of need then, still less now."
"No need, no," he answered, and there was a new note
      in his voice; "it is not a case of necessity or anything of the sort. Put all
     that nonsense of justice and honour and gratitude out of the question, you know that it does
     not come in. I own it did weigh somewhat then, but now—now I want the good comrade; I don't
     deserve her, or a tithe of what she has done for me, but I can't do without her—herself, the
     corporal fact—don't you know that?"
"No," Julia said; somehow it was all she could say.
"You don't know it? Then I'll tell you." But he did not for she prevented him.
"Please don't," she said. "You cannot really want me because you do not really know me. Oh,
     no, you do not!"
"I think I do; I know enough to begin with; the rest of the ignorance you can remedy at your
     leisure."
"My leisure is now," she said; "I will tell you several things, I will tell you how I got the
     explosive. I went as a cook and stole like a thief—you could have got it as easily as I if you
     would have stooped as readily as I did. You admire that? Perhaps so, now, but you would not if
     you had seen it being done. That is the sort of thing I do, and I will tell you the sort of
     thing I like. The day I came home from Holland I did what I liked—as soon as I reached London I
     went to Johnny Gillat, my dear old friend, who I love better than any one else in the world,
     and we had a supper of steak and onions in a back bedroom, and we enjoyed it—you see what my
     tastes are? Afterwards I heard how father had taken to drink and mother had got into debt—you
     see what a nice family we are?"
But here Rawson-Clew stopped her. "I knew something like this before," he said; "the details
     are nothing; I do not see what it has to do with the matter."
     
"It ought to have a lot," she answered. "But even if you do know it and a good deal more and
     realise it too, which is a different thing, there is still the other side. I don't know you, I
     don't even know your name."
Then he remembered that he must have signed that offer of marriage, as he signed all letters,
     and so left himself merely "H. F. Rawson-Clew" to her.
"You see," she was saying, "it is a mistake for people who don't know each other very well to
     marry, they would always be getting unpleasant surprises afterwards. Besides, it would be so
     uncomfortable; it must be pretty bad to live at close quarters with some one you were—who you
     didn't know very well, with whom you minded about things."
She had touched on something that did matter now, that might matter very much indeed;
     Rawson-Clew realised it, and realised with a start of pain, that there might be a great gulf
     between him and the good comrade after all. Her quick intuitions and perceptions had bridged it
     over and led him to forget that he was a man of years and experience while she was a girl, a
     young, shy, half-wild thing, veiled, and fearing to draw the veil for his experienced eyes.
"Tell me," he said, facing her and looking very grave and old, "is that how you feel about
     me?"
She fidgeted the tea-cloth with her foot, but being a Polkington, she was able to answer
     something. "We belong to different lots of people," she said, examining the shape the thing had
     taken on the floor; "I have got my life here, working in my garden and so on; and you have got
     yours a long way off among greater things."
"You have not answered me," he said. "Tell me—am I the man you described?"
He turned her so that she could look at him, the thing
      she dared not do. His touch was light, almost momentary, but it was too much, it
     thrilled through her wildly, irresistibly, and she drew back fearing to do anything else.
"Don't!" she said, and her voice was sharp with the anger of pain.
He stepped back a pace. "Thank you," he said; "I am answered."
Captain Polkington had been dozing; there really was nothing else to do; but suddenly he was
     aroused; there was a sound below; the motor moving at last. Yes, it was going, really going; he
     went to the window and, taking care not to be seen, watched the car go down the sandy road.
     After that he went down-stairs, and finding Johnny, who had finished his watering, persuaded
     him to come for a stroll on the heath. They took a basket to bring home anything they might
     find, and shouted news of their intention to Julia, who did not answer, then set out.
Now, in the present state of their development, motors are not things on which a man can
     always rely. More especially is this the case when any one like Mr. Gillat has had anything to
     do with them. The obliging Johnny, had arranged the inside of Rawson-Clew's car, covering up
     what he thought might be hurt by the sun and blowing sand while it stood at the roadside, and
     taking into the house when he went in to tea, anything that could be stolen if—as was quite out
     of the question—one came that way with a mind to steal. Johnny had brought back most of the
     things and replaced them before Rawson-Clew started, but not quite all. When the car had got a
     little distance down the road it, with a perversity worthy of a reasonable being, developed a
     need for the forgotten item. Rawson-Clew searched for it, could not find it,
      discovered that he could not get on without it, and, thinking if not saying
     something not very complimentary about Mr. Gillat, walked back to the cottage.
He supposed he would find Johnny in the garden, but he did not; he and the Captain were some
     way out on the heath now, and, fortunately for the latter's peace, neither saw any one approach
     the cottage. Rawson-Clew looked round the garden and finding no one decided, rather
     reluctantly, that he must go to the house. He did not want to meet Julia again; he thought it
     rather unlikely that she should still be in the kitchen, but there was a chance of it, so he
     approached with a view to reconnoitering before presenting himself. The outer kitchen, which
     partook rather of the nature of a wash-house, had a large unglazed window; when he drew near to
     this he heard a noise from within. It sounded like some one sobbing, not quiet sobs, but slow
     deep spasmodic ones like the last remains of a tempest of tears which has not spent itself but
     only been imperfectly suppressed by sheer will. Rawson-Clew paused though possibly he had no
     business to do so.
"Oh, why," one wailed from within, "why is not father dead? If he were dead—if only he had
     been dead!"
The unglazed window was large and rather high up, but Rawson-Clew was a man of fair height;
     he was also usually considered an honourable one, but when he heard the voice, saying something
     which was plainly only meant for the hearing of Omnipotence, he did not go away. He put his
     hands on the flintwork of the window-sill and in a moment found himself in the twilight of the
     unceiled kitchen.
Julia was crouching in a corner, her elbows on the old chopping-block, her face hidden on her
     tightly-clenched hands, while she struggled angrily with the shaking sobs.
      For a moment she struggled, then mastered herself somehow and looked up, perhaps
     because she meant to rise and set about her work. She had been crying hard and tears do not
     improve the average face, certainly they did not hers; and she had been trying hard to stop,
     cramming a screwed-up handkerchief into her eyes and that did not improve matters either. One
     would have said her face could have expressed nothing but the extremity of unbecoming woe, yet
     when she caught sight of Rawson-Clew standing just under the window it changed extraordinarily
     and to anger.
"Go away!" she said; "go away! Do you hear?"
Rawson-Clew did not go away; he came nearer and Julia drew further into the corner,
     ensconsing herself behind the chopping-block, and looking about as inviting of approach as a
     trapped rat.
"Julia," he said.
"Go away!" was her only answer.
"Why did you send me away?"
"Because I wanted you gone."
"Because Captain Polkington is not dead? Is that it?"
"You are a dishonourable eavesdropper! No, it wasn't that."
He sat down on the chopping-block barricading her corner so that she could not get out
     without stepping over him. "Do you know it strikes me that you are not strictly honest either,
     at least not strictly truthful just now."
Julia tugged at her skirt; the chopping-block was on the hem and he on it so that she could
     not get free. "Will you please go," she said, with a catch in her breath. That is the worst of
     these half-suppressed, unspent storms
      of tears, they have such a tendency to return and break out again
     inconveniently.
"If it were not for Captain Polkington would you have sent me away?" he asked.
"Y—e—s," she answered, fighting with her tears. "Oh, go! Please, please go!"
She crumpled herself into a small miserable heap and he leaned over the block and drew her
     into his arms.
For a moment she struggled, burrowing her head into his coat; there was a good deal of
     burrowing and not much struggling. "No, you wouldn't," he said to her hair, "you would have
     married me."
"I might have said I would, but I shouldn't really have done it," she contended without
     looking up. "I shouldn't when it came to the point. You had better let me go, I am spoiling
     your coat, my face is all wet—and I don't know where my handkerchief is."
"Take mine, you will find it somewhere. Tell me, why would you not have married me when it
     came to the point? Because your courage failed you?"
No answer; then, "I can't find that handkerchief."
"You have not tried. Are you afraid to try? Are you afraid of me? Is that why you would not
     have married me—you would have been afraid to live at close quarters with me? Do you still
     think you don't know me well enough?"
"I don't know your name."
The answer was ridiculous, but he knew how the ridiculous touched even tragedies for
     Julia.
"Hubert Farquhar Rawson-Clew," he said solemnly. "Now—"
But whatever was to have followed was prevented, for at that moment she looked up, and for
     some reason, sud
     denly decided things had gone far enough, and so freed herself.
"I don't think it matters much what I should have done," she said, "or why, either. Father is
     not dead; you ought to know better than to talk about such a thing; it is bad taste."
"Does that matter in the simple life? I thought when you retired you were going to dispense
     with falsity and pretences, and say and do honestly what you honestly thought, when it did not
     hurt other people's feelings."
"So I do," she answered; "that is why, when I thought I was alone just now, I asked out loud
     how it was that father was still alive. Since then I have seen."
"What have you seen?"
"That it is to prevent me from making a great muddle of things. If he had been dead I dare
     say I should have married you—I may as well confess it since you know—and we both should have
     repented it ever afterwards. As it is, if I were free to-morrow, I would know better than to do
     it."
He did not seem much troubled by the last statement. "We should have had to talk things
     over," he said.
"No, talking wouldn't have been any good," she answered; "there is a great distance between
     us."
He looked down at the space of red tiles that separated them. "That is rather remediable," he
     observed.
"Do you think I am not in earnest?" she said. "I am. There is a real barrier; besides all
     these things I have mentioned there is something else that cuts me off. I have a debt to pay
     you and until it is paid, if I were your own cousin, I could not stand on the same
     platform."
"A debt?" he repeated the word in surprise. His young cousin's loan to Captain Polkington had
     slipped his memory, and even if it had not, its connection with the
      present would not have occurred to him. Julia had been there, it is true, when
     the affair was talked of eighteen months ago, and he himself had unofficially paid the money to
     end the matter, but he never dreamed of connecting either her or himself with it now. Still
     less would he have dreamed that she considered herself bound to pay him what her father had
     borrowed from another.
"What debt?" he asked, thinking the word must be hyperbolical, and meant to stand for
     something quite different, though he could not imagine what.
"You have forgotten?" she said. "I thought you had; that only shows the distance more
     plainly; you have one standard for yourself and another for me."
"Tell me what it is and let us see if we cannot compound it."
But she shook her head. "It can't be compounded," she said; "you will know when I pay
     it."
"And when will that be?"
"Ten years, twenty perhaps, I don't know. I thought once or twice before I could pay it—with
     the blue daffodil once, and once when I first got the cottage and things—I thought, to be sure,
     I could do it; it seemed a Heaven-sent way. But"—with a little glint of self-derision—"Heaven
     knows better than to send those sort of easy ways to the Polkingtons; they are ill-conditioned
     beasts who only behave when they are properly laden by fate, and not often then. Now you know
     all about it, so won't you say good-bye and go?"
"I don't know about it and, what is more, I don't care. I am not going to let this unknown
     trifle, this scruple—"
Just then there came the sound of voices outside; Mr. Gillat and Captain Polkington unwarily
     coming back before the coast was clear.
     
"Yes," Johnny was saying, "he came to see me in town, you know—or rather you, but you were
     out—"
"He came to see me? He"—there was no mistaking the consternation in the Captain's tone, nor
     his meaning either.
Julia and Rawson-Clew looked at one another; both had forgotten the Captain's existence for a
     moment; now they were reminded, and though the reminder seemed incongruous it was perhaps
     opportune.
"There is father," Julia said.
And he nodded. One cannot make love to a man's daughter almost in his presence, when the
     proviso of his death is an essential to any satisfaction. Rawson-Clew went to the door.
     "Good-bye," he said, "for the present."
"Good-bye for always," she answered.
She spoke quite calmly, in much the same tone when, on the morning after the excursion to the
     Dunes, she had bid him good-bye and tried to face the consequences alone. She had had so many
     tumbles with fate that it seemed she knew how to take them now with an indifferent face. At
     least, nearly always, not quite—the wood block still lay before the corner in which she had
     crouched the marks on his coat where her tears had fallen were hardly dry. There was passion
     and to spare behind the indifferent face, passion that for once at least had broken through the
     self-mastery.
He held out his hand and she put hers into it. "Good-bye," he repeated; "good-bye for the
     present, brave little comrade."
