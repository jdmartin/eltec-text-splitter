CHAPTER XXIII
PAYMENT AND RECEIPT
On the day of Captain Polkington's funeral, a letter was brought to White's Cottage. Julia
     herself took it in, and when she saw that it was from Holland she asked the postman to wait a
     minute as she would be glad if he would post a letter for her. He sat down, nothing loth; the
     cottage was the last place on his round and he never minded a rest there. He waited while Julia
     went up-stairs with her letter. She opened it before she got to her room and barely read the
     contents; there was enclosed a cheque for thirty pounds, the price of "The Good Comrade."
It had come, then, at last, this money for which she had been waiting two years—but too late.
     The man in whose name she would have paid the debt lay dead. She had planned to clear him
     without his knowledge, reinstate him in the good opinion of his debtor without letting her hand
     be seen; and she could not, for he was dead, and there was no hand but hers, and no name to
     clear. It was not a week too late, yet so much, so bitterly much. Too late for her cherished
     plan, too late for any of the things she had hoped, too late for triumph, or joy, or
     satisfaction; too late to demonstrate the once hoped for equality; too late for the fulfilling
     of anything but a dogged purpose. For a moment she looked at the cheque, feeling the irony
     which had sent her the means of paying
      his debt now that her father lay in his coffin, indifferent to his good name and
     his honour; unable, alike, to clear or be cleared, to wrong or be wronged; removed by kindly
     death from the scope of earthly judgment, even the just thoughts of one who had suffered on his
     account.
She put down the cheque and pencilled some hasty words—"In payment of Captain Polkington's
     debt (to Mr. Rawson-Clew) discharged by Hubert Farquhar Rawson-Clew on the—November 19—"
So she wrote, then she put the slip with the cheque in an envelope and addressed it to the
     London club where the explosive had been sent.
"It will be posted before the funeral," she thought; "I'm glad—it will all end together—poor
     father!"
She went down-stairs and gave the letter to the postman. Mrs. Polkington came into the
     kitchen as she was doing so, for Mrs. Polkington was at the cottage now.
There are some women who seem designed by nature for widows, just as there are others
     designed for grandmothers and yet others for old maids. Mrs. Polkington was of the first sort;
     she seemed specially created to adorn the position of widow-hood; she certainly did adorn it;
     she was a pattern to all widows and did not miss a single point of the situation. Of course she
     came to the cottage as soon as possible after receiving news of her husband's death. The
     journey was long and expensive, the weather somewhat bad; that weighed for nothing with her;
     she was there as soon as might be, feeling, saying and doing just what a bereaved widow ought.
     The fact that she and her husband had been obliged through the force of circumstances, to live
     separate the past year did not alter her emotions, her real tears or her real grief.
     Considering the practice and experience she had had it would have been surprising if she had
     not succeeded in
      deceiving herself as well as most of her world in these things. So acute were her
     feelings that when she came into the kitchen and saw Julia dispatching the letter, she felt
     quite a shock.
"What is it?" she asked; "What is the matter?"
"Only a letter that could not wait," Julia answered.
"Surely it could have waited till to-morrow," her mother said; "under the circumstances
     surely one would be excused."
Julia thought differently but did not say so, and in silence set about some necessary
     preparation.
The Reverend Richard Frazer came to the funeral; Violet was unable to do so; he represented
     her and supported his mother-in-law too. The banker, Mr. Ponsonby, also made the tedious
     journey to Halgrave; he came out of respect for death in the abstract, and also because he
     expected affairs would want looking to, and it would suit him better to do it now than later.
     These two with Johnny, Julia and her mother, were the only mourners at the funeral; a few
     village folk, moved by curiosity, attended, but no one else; there was not even an empty
     carriage, representative of a good family, following the humble cortège. Mrs. Polkington
     observed this and felt it; an empty carriage and good livery following would have given her
     satisfaction, without in any way diminishing her sorrow and proper feeling. It is conceivable
     she would have found satisfaction in being shipwrecked in aristocratic company, without at the
     same time, suffering less than she ought to suffer.
After the funeral they returned to the cottage and had a repast of Julia's providing,
     eminently suitable to the occasion. Everything was eminently suitable, every one's behaviour,
     every one's clothes; Mr. Frazer's grave face, the banker's jerky manner—the manner of a man con
     cerned with the world's money market and ill at ease in the intrusive presence of
     death. Mrs. Polkington's voice, face, feelings, sayings, everything. Julia's own behaviour was
     perfect, though all the time she saw how it looked as plainly as if she had been another and
     disinterested person, and once or twice she had an hysterical desire to applaud a good stroke
     of her mother's or prompt a backward speech of her uncle's. Mr. Gillat, of course, did nothing
     suitable; he never did. He kept up a preternaturally cheerful appearance during the meal,
     stopping his mouth with large corks of bread, answering "Ah, yes, yes, just so,"
     indiscriminately whenever he was spoken to, and starting three separate conversations on the
     weather on his own account. As soon as the table was cleared, he fled into the back kitchen,
     shut himself in with the dishes, and was seen no more. The others remained in the sitting-room
     and talked things over, arranging plans for the future and for the immediate present. And when
     the time came and the conveyance was brought to the gate, they set out on the homeward journey
     together. Johnny did not come out of the kitchen to say good-bye; only Julia came to the
     gate.
Mr. Ponsonby was going back home; Mr. Frazer and Mrs. Polkington were going with him to spend
     the night in town and go on westwards the next morning. Mr. Frazer was anxious to get back to
     his parish, and Mrs. Polkington to her daughter, who was expecting her first baby shortly. It
     was this expected event which prevented the young rector from asking Julia to stay with him and
     Violet until such time as she and her mother could settle somewhere together. It was this same
     event which prevented Mrs. Polkington from remaining at White's Cottage and sharing Julia's
     solitude until their plans were settled. All this was explained to Julia in the best Polk
     ington manner and she seemed quite satisfied with the explanation. Mr. Ponsonby
     had to be perforce; there seemed no alternative; all the same he was not quite pleased. It was
     all sensible enough, of course, only as he saw Julia standing at the gate in the November
     afternoon, he did not quite like it.
"Look here," he said shortly, "you shut up this place here, send Mr. Gillat to his friends,
     or his rooms, or wherever he came from, and come to me. You can come and make your home with
     me, and welcome, till things are settled; there's plenty of room."
This was a good deal for Mr. Ponsonby to say, considering what an annoyance the Polkington
     family had been to him, how—not without wisdom—he had set his face against letting them into
     his house for more than twenty-four hours at a stretch, and how much this particular member had
     thwarted and exasperated him at their last meeting. Julia recognised this and recognised also
     the kindness of the brusque suggestion. She thanked him warmly for the offer though she refused
     it, assuring him that she and Johnny would be all right at the cottage.
"We do not find it lonely," she said; "we are quite happy here, happier than anywhere else, I
     think."
The banker grunted, not convinced; Mr. Frazer shook hands with Julia and said he hoped it
     would not be long before he saw her; Mrs. Polkington reiterated the remark, kissing her the
     while; then they drove away and Julia went into the house. She went into the back kitchen; Mr.
     Gillat was not there; the dishes were all put away and the place was quite tidy. Julia went
     through to the front kitchen; there she saw Johnny; he was kneeling by the Captain's old chair,
     his arms thrown across the seat, his silly pink face buried in them, his rounded shoulders
     shaking with sobs.
     
Johnny loved as a dog loves, without reason, without thought of return; not for wisdom, worth
     or deserts, just because he did love and, having once loved, loved always; forgiving
     everything, expecting nothing—foolish, faithful, true. So he loved his friend, so he mourned
     him now, be-blubbering the seat of the shabby chair which spoke so eloquently to him of the
     irritable, exacting presence now gone for ever.
"Johnny," Julia said softly; "Johnny dear."
She put a hand on the round shoulders and somehow slipped herself into the shabby chair.
"Johnny," she said, "let us sit by the fire awhile and not talk of anything at all."
So they sat together till twilight fell.
The next day there came another to Julia, one who knew nothing of what had befallen in these
     last days. It was almost twilight when he came; Johnny had gone out to collect fir-cones; Julia
     sent him, partly because their stock was low and partly because she thought it would do him
     good. She did not expect him back much before five o'clock; it would be dark by then certainly,
     but not very dark for the day was clear, with a touch of frost in the air; one of those days
     when the last of the sunset burns low down in the sky long after the stars are out. It was not
     much after four o'clock when Julia heard something approaching, certainly not Johnny nor
     anything connected with him, for it was the throb of a motor coming fast. Only once before
     since she had been at the cottage had she heard that sound on the lonely road, on the day when
     Rawson-Clew came. It could not be him now, she was sure of that. He might have received the
     money this morning certainly, but he would not come because of that, rather he would keep away;
     there was no reason why he should come. She told herself it was
      impossible, and then went to the door to see, puzzled in her own mind what she
     should say if the impossible had happened and it was he.
The throbbing had ceased by now; there was the click of the gate even as she opened the door,
     and he—it was he and no other—was coming up the little brick path in the twilight. His face was
     curiously clear in the light which lingered low down; and when she saw it and the look it wore,
     all plans of what she should say fled, and the feeling came upon her which was like that which
     came when she crouched behind the chopping-block and he barred the way. It seemed as if he had
     been pursuing and she escaping and eluding for a long time, but now—he was coming up the path
     and she was standing in the doorway with the pale light strong on her face and nowhere to fly
     to and no way of escape.
"Why did you not tell me before?" he said without any greeting at all, and he spoke as if he
     had right and authority. "Why did you let this thing weigh on you for two years and never say a
     word of it to me?"
"I was ashamed," she answered with truth. Then the spirit which still inhabits some women,
     making them willing to be won by capture, prompted her to struggle against the capitulation she
     was ready to make. "There was nothing to speak of to you or any one else," she said, with an
     effort at her old assurance, and she led the way in as she spoke. "I never meant to speak of it
     at all, I meant just to pay the debt as from father, and not myself appear in it. I did not do
     it that way, I know; I could not; I did not get the money till yesterday and—and"—the assurance
     faded away pathetically—"that was too late."
Rawson-Clew looked down, and for the first time noticed her mourning dress, and realising
     what it meant,
      remembered that convention demanded that a man, whose claim depends on another's
     death, should not push it as soon as the funeral is over. However he did not go away, the
     pathos of Julia's voice kept him.
"Late or early would have made little difference," he said; "it is just the same now as if it
     had been early. Do you think I should not have known who sent the money at whatever time and in
     whatever circumstances it was paid? Do you think I know two people who would pay a debt, which
     can hardly be said to exist, in such a way?"
But Julia was not comforted. "It is too late," she re-repeated; "too late for any
     satisfaction. I thought I would prove that we were honest and honourable by paying it; I wanted
     to show father—that I—that our standard was the same as yours, and I have not."
"No," he answered, "you have not and you never will; your standard is not the same as mine;
     mine is the honour of an accepted convention, and yours is the honour of a personal truth, a
     personal experience, the honour of the soul."
But she shook her head. "It is not really," she said; "and father—"
"As to your father," he interrupted gently, "do you not think that sometimes the potter's
     thumb slips in the making of a vessel?"
She looked up with a feeling of gratitude. "Yes," she said; "yes, that is it, if only we
     could realise it—poor father. It was partly our fault, too, mother's, all of ours—and he is
     dead now."
"I know. Let him rest in peace; we are concerned no more with his doings or misdoings; our
     concern, yours and mine is with the living."
She did not answer; a piece of wood had fallen from
      the fire and lay blazing and spluttering on the hearth; she stooped to pick it up
     and he watched her.
"I know I have no business here now," he said. "Had I known of his death before, I would not
     have come to-day; I would have waited, but since I have come—Julia—"
She was standing straight now, the wood safely back in the fire; he put his hands on her
     shoulders and turned her to him. "Julia, you and I have always dealt openly, without regarding
     appearances, let us deal so now—since I have come. Won't you let me give you a receipt?"
Julia said afterwards that receipts for the payment of such debts were unnecessary and never
     given; which was perhaps as well, for the one she received in the dusk was not of a kind
     recognised at law. Could it afterwards have been produced it would not have proved the payment
     of money, though at the time it proved several things, principally the fact that, though
     friendship and comradeship are fine and excellent things, there are simple primitive passions
     which leap up through them and transfigure them and forget them, and it is these which make man
     man, and woman woman, and life worth living, and the world worth winning and losing, too, and
     bring the kingdom of heaven to earth again.
It also proved how exceedingly firmly a man who is in the habit of wearing a single eyeglass
     must screw it into his eye, for, as Julia remarked with some surprise, the one which interested
     her did not fall out.
Mr. Gillat came home with his fir-cones at a quarter to five. And when he came he saw that,
     to him, most fascinating sight—a motor-car, standing empty and quiet
      by the gate. He looked at it with keen interest, then he looked round the empty
     landscape for its owner, and not seeing him, wondered if he was in the house. He put away the
     cones and came to the conclusion that the owner was not there and the car was an abandoned
     derelict. For which, perhaps, he may be forgiven, for there was no light at the parlour window
     and no sound of voices that he could hear from the kitchen; even when he opened the door and
     walked in he did not in the firelight see any one besides Julia at first.
"Julia," he said, bringing in the astonishing news, "there is a motor-car outside!"
"Yes," Julia answered composedly; "but it is going away soon."
"Not very soon," another voice spoke out of the gloom of the chimney corner, and Johnny
     jumped as he recognised it.
"Dear me!" he said; "dear me! Mr. Rawson-Clew! How do you do? I am pleased to see you."
The motor did not go away very soon; it stayed quite as long, rather longer, in fact, than
     Mr. Gillat expected. And when it did go, he did not have the pleasure of seeing it start; he
     somehow got shut in the kitchen while Julia went out to the gate.
When she came back she shut the door carefully, then turned to him, and he noticed how her
     eyes were shining. "Johnny," she said, "I am a selfish beast; I am going to leave you. Not yet,
     oh, not yet, but one day."
Johnny stared a moment, then said, "Of course, oh, of course, to be sure—to live with your
     mother, she'll want you. A wonderful woman."
"Not to live with my mother," Julia said emphatically. "Sit down and I will tell you all
     about it."
And she told, slowly and suitably, fearing that he
      would hardly understand the wonderful goodness of fate to her. But she need not
     have been afraid; he took her meaning at once, far quicker than she expected, for he saw no
     wonder in it, only a very great goodness for the man who had won her, and a great and radiant
     happiness for himself in the happiness that had come to her. As for his loneliness, he never
     thought of that, why should he? Of course she would leave him, it was the right and proper
     thing to do; she would leave him anyhow.
"You couldn't go on living with me here," he said; "I mean, I couldn't go on living with you;
     it wouldn't be the thing, you know; you must think of that."
Julia caught her breath between tears and laughter, but he went on stoutly: "I shall go back
     to town, to Mrs. Horn; I shall like it—at least when I get used to it. It is quite time I went
     back to town; a man ought not to stay too long in the country; he gets rusty."
"You won't go back to town," Julia said; "you will never do that. You will stay here in the
     cottage, and Mrs. Gray from next door to the shop will come and live here as your housekeeper;
     I am going to arrange it with her. She will come and she will bring her little grand-daughter
     and you will keep on living here always."
For a moment Johnny's face beamed; the prospect was exquisite; but he sternly put it from
     him. "No," he said, "I shouldn't like that; it's kind of you, but—"
"Johnny," Julia interrupted, "you should always speak the truth—you do anything else so
     badly! I don't mind if you like my plan or not, you will have to put up with it to help me;
     some one must take care of the cottage."
"But you will want to come yourself," Mr. Gillat protested.
"Never, unless you are here."
In the end Julia had her way. Johnny lived at the
      cottage, and Mrs. Gray and her grandchild came to keep house. And Billy, Mrs.
     Gray's nephew, came to help in the garden and take care of the donkey; in the spring there was
     a donkey added to the establishment, and a little tub-cart which held four children easily,
     besides Mr. Gillat. And it is doubtful if, in all the country round, there was a happier man
     than he who tended Julia's plants in Julia's garden, and drove parties of chattering children
     along the quiet lanes, and sat on warm summer evenings beside his old friend's grave in
     Halgrave churchyard. He had forgotten many things, old slights and old pains, and old losses;
     forgotten, perhaps, most things except love. Foolish Johnny, God's fool, basking in God's
     sunshine.
And Julia and Rawson-Clew were married, very quietly, without any pomp or ostentation at all.
     And if, on the honeymoon, he did not show her all the places he had thought of on the day when
     he travelled north with the girl with the carnations, it was because he had not several years
     at his disposal just then. Afterwards he made up for it as work allowed and time could be
     found. In the record of their lives there are many days noted down as holidays, even such
     holidays as that first one spent on the Dunes. In the springtime, when the bulb flowers were in
     bloom, they went once more to the Dunes and to the little old town where the Van Heigens lived.
     They were received with much ceremony by Mijnheer and his wife, and entertained at a dinner
     which lasted from four till half-past six. It is true that afterwards state had to be lain
     aside, for Julia insisted on helping to wash the priceless Nankeen china while her husband
     smoked long cigars with Mijnheer on the veranda, but that was all her own fault. Denah came to
     tea drinking, she and her lately-wed husband, the bashful son of a well-to-do shipowner. She
     was very smiling and all bustling and
      greatly pleased with herself and all things, and if she thought poorly of Julia
     for washing the plates, she thought very well of the glittering rings she had left on the
     veranda-table and well, too, of her husband, who she recognised as the mysterious "man of good
     family" they had seen on the day they drove to the wood. And afterwards when the tea drinking
     was done and the dew was falling, Julia walked with Joost among his flowers, and heard him
     speak of his hopes and ambitions, and knew that in his work he had found all the satisfaction
     that a man may reasonably hope for here.
Later, Julia and her husband walked through the tidy streets of the town, looking in at
     lighted windows, listening to the patois of the peasants and recalling past times. It was then
     that he told her how he had that day tried to buy back the streaked daffodil.
"And Mijnheer would not sell it?" she asked.
"No," he answered; "not at any price, so I am afraid that you will have to do without 'The
     Good Comrade' after all."
"I?" she said; "I can do quite well. Thank you for trying to get it; all the same I am not
     sure I want it back."
"Do you not? Then I am quite sure that I do not, indeed, I rather fancy I already have the
     real 'Good Comrade.'"
