CHAPTER III
NARCISSUS TRIANDRUS AZUREUM
The élite called to congratulate Mrs. Polkington on her daughter's engagement. All
     manner of pleasant things were said by them and by Mrs. Polkington in an atmosphere of social
     sunshine. She thought it so nice of them to come so soon, she told them so severally; she knew
     that they—"you all," "you, at least," "you, my oldest friend," according to circumstances—would
     be pleased to hear about it. She gave sundry little hints of future plans and hopes, among
     other things mentioned that it really was hard for poor Violet to have to go and cheer an
     invalid cousin just now.
"And the worst of it is," so Mrs. Polkington said, "she may have to be away some time. There
     really seems no one else to go, and one could not leave the poor dear alone at this dull time
     of the year; and, after all, Bath is not very far off; some of Richard's people live there,
     too. I should not be surprised if the young people contrive to see a good deal of each other in
     spite of everything. Indeed, had I not thought so, I think I should have insisted on Chèrie's
     going instead of Violet, although she would have had to give up her winter abroad."
Here the visitor usually made polite inquiries about this same winter abroad, and heard of a
     delightful prospect of several months to be spent in the south of France, unnecessary and
     unpleasant details all omitted.
     
"You do agree with me?" Mrs. Polkington would then ask rather anxiously, as if her hearer's
     opinion was the one that really mattered to her. "You do think it wrong to allow Chèrie to
     refuse this invitation for Violet's sake? I am very glad you think so. I had quite a difficulty
     in persuading her; but, as I told her, it was not a chance she was likely to have again. So she
     is going, and Violet will have to spend her winter in Bath. Julia? Oh, Julia was not asked in
     either case; she will be staying at home with me."
From all of which it is clear that part of Julia's plan was to be adopted. The other part
     must have found favour, too, for soon it became known that the Polkingtons were without a
     servant. Mrs. Polkington made inquiries among her friends, but could not hear of any one
     suitable; she said it was very tiresome, especially as they had taken advantage of the girl's
     empty room to invite an old Anglo-Indian friend of her husband's to stay.
Thus was the difficulty tided over, and with so good a face that few in Marbridge had any
     idea that it existed. Certainly none knew of the pinching and screwing and retrenching which
     went on indoors at No. 27. One or two tradesmen could have told of long accounts unpaid, and
     some relations living at a distance were troubled by appeals for help, a form of begging which,
     at this date of their history did not hurt the Polkingtons' sensibility much.
Mrs. Polkington suffered in body, if not in mind, during this hard time, though fortunately
     she was able to be away a month. The Captain suffered a good deal more, which was perhaps only
     just; and Johnny Gillat suffered with him, which was not just, though that did not seem to
     occur to him. As for Julia, she minded
      least of any one, though in some ways she had the most to put up with; but the
     plan was hers, and consequently she was too interested in its success to trouble about the
     inevitable discomforts of the working out.
There was one matter which did trouble her, however—the debt to Rawson-Clew. She had no
     money, and no possibility of raising any; yet it must and should be paid, for her father's name
     could not otherwise be cleared. She turned over in her own mind how she could earn enough, but
     there was little hope of that; it seemed rather a large sum for a girl to earn, and any sum was
     impossible to her; she had no gifts to take to market, no ability for any of the arts, not
     enough education for teaching, no training for commerce. The only field open to her was that of
     a nursery-governess or companion; neither was likely to enable her to pay this debt of honour
     quickly. Once, nearly a year ago, she had had a sort of half-offer of the post of companion. It
     was while she was staying with a friend; during the visit there had come to the house an old
     Dutchman of the name of Van Heigen, a business acquaintance of her host. He had stayed nearly a
     week, and in that time taken a great fancy to her.
In those first bad days after the Captain's leaving the army, the Polkingtons had lived, or
     perhaps more accurately, drifted about, a good deal abroad. It was then that Julia picked up
     her only accomplishment, a working knowledge of several languages. She had also acquired one
     other thing, perhaps not an accomplishment, a rather unusual knowledge of divers men and divers
     ways. It may have been that these qualities made her more attractive to the old Dutchman than
     the purely English game-expert daughters of the house. Or it may have been her admirable
     cooking; the cook was ill during the greater part of her visit, and her offer to help was
     gladly ac
     cepted and duly appreciated. Something, at all events, pleased the old man, so that
     before he left he asked her, half in fun, if she would come and live with his wife. This lady,
     it seemed, had bad health, and no daughters; she always had a companion of some sort, and was
     never satisfied with the one she had. In Holland, as in England, it seemed posts were not easy
     to fill satisfactorily, for those often in want of employment were also constitutionally
     inefficient.
At the time Julia had laughingly refused the offer, now she recalled it, and thought
     seriously about it. It would not be very nice, a mixture of upper servant and lady help; the
     Van Heigens were bulb growers, old-fashioned people, the lady a thorough huisvrouw,
     nothing more probably. Still that did not matter; such things need not be considered if the end
     could be attained that way. But unfortunately it did not look very likely; the Van Heigens
     would pay less to a companion than English people would, not enough to buy clothes; there was
     practically nothing to be made out of it. Julia was obliged to admit the fact to herself, and
     reluctantly to dismiss the Dutchman and his offer from her thoughts.
But curiously enough, they were brought to her mind again before long; not later, indeed,
     than that evening, when she went to a dance at a neighbour's house. At this dance she met a Mr.
     Alexander Cross. He was not a native of Marbridge, not at all like any of them; it is quite
     possible that they would have rather looked down upon him; Julia recognised that he barely came
     up to her mother's standard of a gentleman. He seemed to be a keen business man of the
     energetic new sort; he also seemed to deal in most things, flowers among them. He told Julia
     something about that part of his business, for he and it interested her so much that she asked
     him lead
     ing questions. He explained how the beautiful orchid he wore in his coat had
     decreased in value lately. A few years ago, when there had been but one specimen with just that
     marking in all the world, the plant had sold for £900; now that it had been multiplied it was
     worth only £25, nothing practically.
"It was a novelty then," he explained; "some novelties are worth a great deal. There's one I
     know of now I could do some good business with if I could get hold of it. But I can't; the old
     fool that's got it won't sell it for any price, and he can't half work it himself. It's a blue
     daffodil—Narcissus Triandrus Azureum he calls it; or rather, to give it its full title,
     Narcissus Triandrus Azureum Vrouw Van Heigen; so called, I believe, in honour of his wife, or
     his mother."
Julia wondered if the Van Heigen who owned the precious flower was the old Dutchman of her
     acquaintance. "Is he a bulb grower?" she asked, though without giving any reason for her
     question.
"Yes," Cross answered, "a Dutch bulb grower; that's why he won't make the profit he might; he
     comes of generations of growers, and they venerate their bulbs. He has cranky notions of how
     things ought to be done, and no other way will do for him."
"How did he get a blue daffodil? Do you think it is real? It seems very unusual."
"It is unusual; that's where the value comes in; but it's real fast enough, though I don't
     believe he grew the first, as he says, in his own garden. It's my opinion that one of his
     collectors sent him the first bulb; he has collectors all over the world, you know, looking for
     new things."
"What is he going to do with it?" Julia asked.
"He is multiplying it at present; at first he had only
      one, now, of course, he has a few more; when he has got enough he will hybridise.
     You don't know what that is. Cross-breed with it; use the blue with the old yellow daffodil as
     parents to new varieties. That's ticklish work; growers can't afford to do it till they have a
     fair number of the new sort; but, of course, they occasionally get something good that
     way."
Julia listened, much interested, though, to tell the truth, the money value of the thing
     fascinated her more than anything else.
"Will he never sell any of his blue bulbs?" she asked.
"Oh, yes, in time," Cross answered; "but not while they are worth anything much to the
     growers."
"What are they worth? I mean, what would it be worth if there was only one?"
"I don't know; I dare say I could get £400 for the single bulb."
"But if there were more they would not be worth so much? If there were five, what would they
     be worth?"
"Pretty well as much, very likely £300 for one bulb. Van Heigen would give a written
     guarantee with it not to sell another bulb to another grower."
"But he could keep the others himself?" Julia asked. "That would be eating his cake and
     having it too. Tell me," she said, feeling she was imitating the Patriarch when he was pleading
     for Sodom and Gomorrah, "if there were ten bulbs, what could you get for one."
Cross was amused by her interest. "A hundred pounds, I dare say," he said; "but I shall never
     have the chance. The trade will never touch those blue daffodils while they are worth having.
     When the old man does begin to sell them—when they are worth very little to the growers—he will
     sell to collectors, cranky old connoisseurs, from choice. That's what I mean when I say he
      doesn't understand business as business; he would rather sell his precious blue
     daffodils where they were what he calls 'appreciated.' He would sooner they went for a moderate
     price to people who would worship them, than make an enormous profit out of them."
"But the connoisseurs could sell them," Julia objected. "If I were a connoisseur and bought
     one when they were for sale, I could sell it to you if I liked."
"Yes, but you wouldn't," Cross said; "if you were a connoisseur you would not dream of
     parting with your bulb. You wouldn't have the slightest wish to make a hundred per cent. on
     your purchase, or two or three hundred either. Also I shouldn't buy."
"Why not?"
"I couldn't afford to have my name mixed up with the business."
Julia looked at him critically. "You could afford that the business should be done without
     your name?" she suggested.
He laughed. "I could introduce the seller, did such an impossible person exist, to some one
     who could buy."
It was Julia's turn to laugh, that soundless laugh of hers which gave the feeling of a joke
     only half shared. "For a consideration, of course," she said.
"Something would naturally stick to my fingers," Cross answered, amused rather than
     offended.
He was a good deal amused by his partner, finding her more interesting than most of the girls
     he met that evening; afterwards he forgot her, for two days later he left the place, and
     thought no more either about Miss Polkington or the talk he had had with her.
As for her, it was not clear what she thought, but the next day she wrote to London for a
     second-hand Dutch dictionary, and then went to call at the house with the
      largest library that she knew. When she came away from there she carried with her
     a book she had borrowed, a Dutch version of Gil Blas, which she remembered to have
     once seen tucked away in a corner. Shortly afterwards, as soon as the dictionary came, she set
     to reading the edifying work, and found it easier than she expected. What one learns from
     necessity in childhood stays in the memory, and a good knowledge of German and a smallish one
     of Dutch will carry one through greater difficulties than Gil Blas.
Before her mother and sisters came back to Marbridge, Julia had written to the old
     Dutchman.
When Mrs. Polkington heard Julia wanted to go to Holland and live in a Dutch family she was
     surprised. This news was not given to her till the spring had fairly set in, for it was not
     till then that Julia had been able to get everything arranged. It is no use telling people your
     plans unless you are quite sure of carrying them out, and you are never sure of that long
     before starting; at least, that was Julia's opinion. It was also her opinion that it was quite
     unnecessary to tell all details. She said she was tired of being at Marbridge, and wanted a
     complete change; also that when there were three grown-up sisters at home it seemed rather
     desirable that one should go away, for a time at least. When Violet suggested that it was odd
     to have chosen Holland in preference to France or Germany, she replied truthfully that the one
     was possible to her, the others were not.
Mrs. Polkington, who quite approved of the plan, saw no objection to Holland, adding as a
     recommendation, "It is so much more original to go there." She did not fail to remark on the
     originality when she embroidered Julia's going to her friends and acquaintances.
Captain Polkington was the only member of the family
      who regretted this going. He had always regarded Julia as something between an
     ally and a tolerant go-between; and since she had wrung from him the confession of his
     difficulties, and helped in the arrangement of them, his feeling for her had leaned more and
     more towards the former. He had even come to feel a certain protectiveness in her presence,
     which made him really sorry she was going. Johnny Gillat was sorrier still.
Johnny had gone back to dismal lodgings in town now; he only heard of the plan by letter, and
     the Captain's letters were very prolix, and not informing. Mr. Gillat's own letters were even
     worse, for if they lacked the prolixity, they lacked the little information also. On receipt of
     the Captain's information he merely wrote to ask when Julia was going, and what time she would
     be in London, as he would like to give himself the pleasure of meeting her train.
He did give himself that pleasure; he was at the station half an hour and ten minutes before
     the train, so as to be sure of being in time. He was on the platform when the train came in;
     Julia saw him, a rather ridiculous figure, his shabby coat tremendously brushed and tightly
     buttoned, a gay tie displayed to the uttermost to hide a ragged shirt front, his round, pink
     face, with its little grizzled moustache, wearing a look of melancholy which made it appear
     more than ordinarily foolish. He was standing where the part of the train which came from
     Marbridge could not possibly stop, much in the way of porters and trucks; Julia had to find him
     and find her luggage too, but he seemed to think he was of much service. Julia's hard young
     heart smote her when he gave twopence to her porter.
"Johnny," she said, as he took her ticket on the District Railway, "I am going to pay for my ticket."
     
It was only threepence, but there are people who have to consider the threepences; if Julia
     was one, she knew that Mr. Gillat was another, and she had allowed for this threepence, and he
     probably had not. He demurred, but she insisted. "Then I won't let you come with me;" and he
     gave way.
They were alone in a compartment, and he shouted above the rattle of the train something
     about her being missed at Marbridge.
"Oh, no," she said, "mother and the girls think it is a good thing I am going."
"Your father and I will miss you," Johnny told her.
"You?"
"Yes; I'll miss you very much—we both shall; we shall sit down-stairs, each side of the
     fire-place, and think how you used to come there sometimes. And when I wait in the dining-room
     when your father's not at home, I'll remember how you used to come down there and chat. We had
     many a chat, didn't we?—you and me, and Bouquet burning between us—there was nobody could trim
     Bouquet like you. But perhaps you'll be back before winter comes round again?"
"I don't know when I shall be back," was all Julia could find to say. The idea of being
     missed like this was new and strange to her; the Polkingtons' feelings were so much guided by
     what was advisable, or expedient, that there was not usually much room for simple emotions. She
     felt somehow grateful to Johnny for caring a little that she was going, though at the same time
     she was unpleasantly convinced that she did not deserve it.
"It won't be at all the same at No. 27," Mr. Gillat was saying. "Your mother—she's a
     wonderful woman, a wonderful woman, and Miss Violet's a fine girl, so's the
      other, handsome both of them; but they're in the drawing-room, you know, and
     you—you used to come down-stairs."
It did not sound very explicit, but Julia understood what he meant. Just then the train
     stopped at a station, and other passengers got in, so they had little more talk.
In time they reached Mark Lane, from whence it is no great walk to the Tower Stairs. There is
     a cheap way of going to Holland from there for those who do not mind spending twenty-four hours
     on the journey; Julia did not mind. When she and Johnny Gillat arrived at the Tower Stairs they
     saw the steamer lying in the river, a small Dutch boat, still taking in cargo from loaded
     lighters alongside. A waterman put them on board, or, rather, took them to the nearest waiting
     lighter, from whence they scrambled on board, Mr. Gillat very unhandily. A Dutch steward
     received them, and taking Johnny for a father come to see his daughter off, assured them in bad
     English that she would be quite safe, and well taken care of.
"She shall haf one cabin to herself, a bed clean. Yes, yes; there is no passenger but one, a
     Holland gentleman; he will not speak with the miss, he is friend of captain."
Johnny nodded a great many times, though he did not quite follow what was said. Then Julia
     told him he had better go, and not keep the waterman any longer.
He agreed, and began fumbling in his pocket, from whence he pulled out one of his badly-tied
     parcels.
"A keepsake," he said, putting it into her hand; then, without waiting to say good-bye, he
     scrambled over the side in such a hurry that he as nearly as possible fell into the river.
Julia ran to the side in some anxiety; some one shouted, "Look out," and some one else, "Hold
     up," and
      a third something less complimentary. Then a man laid hold of Mr. Gillat's legs
     and guided him safely on to the bobbing lighter. There he turned and waved his hat to Julia
     before he got into the waiting boat.
"Good-bye," he called.
"Good-bye," she answered. "Oh, do be careful!"
He was not careful, but the waterman had him now, and took him ashore. She watched him, his
     round face was suffused with smiles; he waved his hat once more just as he reached the stairs.
     He slipped once getting up them, but he was up now, and turned to wave once before he started
     down the street.
It was not till then that Julia became aware of a small sound close at hand; there was a good
     deal of noise going on, shouting, the rattling of cranes, and the thud of shifting bales, with
     now and then the hoot of a steamer and the escape of steam, and under all, the restless lapping
     of the water. But through it all she now heard a much smaller sound quite close, a regular
      tick, tick. She glanced at the parcel she had forgotten, then in an instant,
     as a sudden idea occurred to her, she had the paper off. Yes, it was. It was Johnny's great
     old-fashioned gold watch, with the fetter chain dangling at the end.
She stood quite still with the thing in her hand, her mouth set straight, and her eyes
     growing glitteringly bright. The round gilded face stared up at her, reminding her in some
     grotesque way of Johnny; poor, generous, honest, foolish old Johnny! She looked away quickly, a
     sudden desire not to go with this moon-faced companion took possession of her—a desire not to
     go at all, a horrible new-born doubt about it.
But feelings for abstract right and wrong, like personal likes and dislikes, do not grow
     strongly where ex
     pediency and advisability and advantage have to rule; she was only going to do what
     she must in Holland; the debt must be paid, honour demanded no less; the blue daffodil was the
     only hope of paying it. She was not going to steal a bulb exactly; she was going to get it
     somehow, as a gift, perhaps, opportunity must show how; and when it was hers, she could do with
     it as she pleased, there was no wrong in that. She must go; she must do it; the thing was so
     necessary as to be unavoidable, and not open to question. She looked down, and her eye fell on
     the watch again; it stared up at her in the same vacant way as Johnny had done that day when he
     wanted to sell it and his other things to help them out of their justly earned, sordid
     difficulties. With shame she had prevented that, feeling the cause unworthy of the sacrifice.
     But this sacrifice, for a still more unworthy cause, she was too late to prevent. Johnny had
     gone. She looked earnestly to see if he was among those who loitered about the stairs, or those
     in the more distant street. But she could not see him, he was gone clean from sight; there was
     only the busy, unfamiliar life of the river around; yellow, sunlit water; the crowded craft,
     and the great stately wonder of the Tower Bridge silently raising and parting its solid roadway
     to let some boat go, as she would soon go down to the sea.
