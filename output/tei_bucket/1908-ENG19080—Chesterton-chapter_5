CHAPTER V
THE FEAST OF FEAR
AT first the large stone stair seemed to Syme as deserted as a pyramid; but before he reached
     the top he had realised that there was a man leaning over the parapet of the Embankment and
     looking out across the river. As a figure he was quite conventional, clad in a silk hat and
     frock‑coat of the more formal type of fashion; he had a red flower in his buttonhole. As Syme
     drew nearer to him step by step, he did not even move a hair; and Syme could come close enough
     to notice even in the dim, pale morning light that his face was long, pale and intellectual,
     and ended in a small triangular tuft of dark beard at the very point of the chin, all else
     being clean-shaven. This scrap of hair almost seemed a mere oversight; the rest of the face was
     of the type that is best shaven—clear‑cut, ascetic, and in its way noble. Syme drew closer and
     closer, noting all this, and still the figure did not stir.
At first an instinct had told Syme that this was the man whom he was meant to meet. Then,
     seeing that the man made no sign, he had concluded that he was not. And now again he had come
     back to a certainty that the man had something to do with his mad adventure. For the man
     remained more still than would have been natural if a stranger had come so close. He was as
     motionless as a wax‑work, and got on the nerves somewhat in the same way. Syme looked again and
     again at the pale, dignified and delicate face, and the face still looked blankly across the
     river. Then he took out of his pocket the note from Buttons proving his election, and put it
     before that sad and beautiful face. Then the man smiled, and his smile was a shock, for it was
     all on one side, going up in the right cheek and down in the left.
There was nothing, rationally speaking, to scare anyone about this. Many people have this
     nervous trick of a crooked smile, and in many it is even attractive. But in all Syme’s
     circumstances, with the dark dawn and the deadly errand and the loneliness on the great
     drip­ping stones, there was something unnerving in it.
There was the silent river and the silent man, a man of even classic face. And there was the
     last nightmare touch that his smile suddenly went wrong.
The spasm of smile was instantaneous, and the man’s face dropped at once into its harmonious
     melancholy. He spoke without further explanation or inquiry, like a man speaking to an old
     colleague.
“If we walk up towards Leicester Square,” he said, “we shall just be in time for breakfast.
     Sunday always insists on an early breakfast. Have you had any sleep?”
“No,” said Syme.
“Nor have I,” answered the man in an ordinary tone. “I shall try to get to bed after
     breakfast.”
He spoke with casual civility, but in an utterly dead voice that contradicted the fanaticism
     of his face. It seemed almost as if all friendly words were to him lifeless conveniences, and
     that his only life was hate. After a pause the man spoke again.
“Of course, the Secretary of the branch told you everything that can be told. But the one
     thing that can never be told is the last notion of the President, for his notions grow like a
     tropical forest. So in case you don’t know, I’d better tell you that he is carrying out his
     notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths
     just now. Originally, of course, we met in a cell underground, just as your branch does. Then
     Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant. He said that if you didn’t seem
     to be hiding nobody hunted you out. Well, he is the only man on earth, I know; but sometimes I
     really think that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age. For now we flaunt
     ourselves before the public. We have our breakfast on a balcony—on a balcony, if you please—
     overlooking Leicester Square.”
“And what do the people say?” asked Syme.
“It’s quite simple what they say,” answered his guide.
“They say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are anarchists.”
“It seems to me a very clever idea,” said Syme.
“Clever! God blast your impudence! Clever!” cried out the other in a sudden, shrill voice
     which was as startling and discordant as his crooked smile. “When you’ve seen Sunday for a
     split second you’ll leave off calling him clever.”
With this they emerged out of a narrow street, and saw the early sunlight filling Leicester
     Square. It will never be known, I suppose, why this square itself should look so alien and in
     some ways so continental. It will never be known whether it was the foreign look that attracted
     the foreigners or the foreigners who gave it the foreign look. But on this particular morning
     the effect seemed singularly bright and clear. Between the open square and the sunlit leaves
     and the statue and the Saracenic outlines of the Alhambra, it looked the replica of some French
     or even Spanish public place. And this effect increased in Syme the sensation, which in many
     shapes he had had through the whole adventure, the eerie sensation of having strayed into a new
     world. As a fact, he had bought bad cigars round Leicester Square ever since he was a boy. But
     as he turned that corner, and saw the trees and the Moorish cupolas, he could have sworn that
     he was turning into an unknown Place de something or other in some foreign town.
At one corner of the square there projected a kind of angle of a prosperous but quiet hotel,
     the bulk of which belonged to a street behind. In the wall there was one large French window,
     probably the window of a large coffee‑room; and outside this window, almost literally
     overhanging the square, was a formidably buttressed balcony, big enough to contain a
     dining‑table. In fact, it did contain a dining‑table, or more strictly a breakfast‑table; and
     round the breakfast‑table, glowing in the sunlight and evident to the street, were a group of
     noisy and talkative men, all dressed in the insolence of fashion, with white waistcoats and
     expensive button‑holes. Some of their jokes could almost be heard across the square. Then the
     grave Secretary gave his unnatural smile, and Syme knew that this boisterous breakfast party
     was the secret conclave of the European Dynamiters.
Then, as Syme continued to stare at them, he saw something that he had not seen before. He
     had not seen it literally because it was too large to see. At the nearest end of the balcony,
     blocking up a great part of the perspective, was the back of a great mountain of a man. When
     Syme had seen him, his first thought was that the weight of him must break down the balcony of
     stone. His vastness did not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite
     incredibly fat. This man was planned enormously in his original proportions, like a statue
     carved deliberately as colossal. His head, crowned with white hair, as seen from behind looked
     bigger than a head ought to be. The ears that stood out from it looked larger than human ears.
     He was enlarged terribly to scale; and this sense of size was so staggering, that when Syme saw
     him all the other figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish. They were still
     sitting there as before with their flowers and frock‑coats, but now it looked as if the big man
     was entertaining five children to tea.
As Syme and the guide approached the side door of the hotel, a waiter came out smiling with
     every tooth in his head.
“The gentlemen are up there, sare,” he said. “They do talk and they do laugh at what they
     talk. They do say they will throw bombs at ze king.”
And the waiter hurried away with a napkin over his arm, much pleased with the singular
     frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs.
The two men mounted the stairs in silence.
Syme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who almost filled and broke the
     balcony was the great President of whom the others stood in awe. He knew it was so, with an
     unaccountable but instantaneous certainty. Syme, indeed, was one of those men who are open to
     all the more nameless psychological influences in a degree a little dangerous to mental health.
     Utterly devoid of fear in physical dangers, he was a great deal too sensitive to the smell of
     spiritual evil. Twice already that night little unmeaning things had peeped out at him almost
     pruriently, and given him a sense of drawing nearer and nearer to the head‑quarters of hell.
     And this sense became overpowering as he drew nearer to the great President.
The form it took was a childish and yet hateful fancy. As he walked across the inner room
     towards the balcony, the large face of Sunday grew larger and larger; and Syme was gripped with
     a fear that when he was quite close the face would be too big to be possible, and that he would
     scream aloud. He remembered that as a child he would not look at the mask of Memnon in the
     British Museum, because it was a face, and so large.
By an effort, braver than that of leaping over a cliff, he went to an empty seat at the
     breakfast‑table and sat down. The men greeted him with good-humoured raillery as if they had
     always known him. He sobered himself a little by looking at their conventional coats and solid,
     shining coffee‑pot; then he looked again at Sunday. His face was very large, but it was still
     possible to humanity.
In the presence of the President the whole company looked sufficiently commonplace; nothing
     about them caught the eye at first, except that by the President’s caprice they had been
     dressed up with a festive respectability, which gave the meal the look of a wedding breakfast.
     One man indeed stood out at even a superficial glance. He at least was the common or garden
     Dynamiter. He wore, indeed, the high white collar and satin tie that were the uniform of the
     occasion; but out of this collar there sprang a head quite unmanageable and quite unmistakable,
     a bewildering bush of brown hair and beard that almost obscured the eyes like those of a Skye
     terrier. But the eyes did look out of the tangle, and they were the sad eyes of some Russian
     serf. The effect of this figure was not terrible like that of the President, but it had every
     diablerie that can come from the utterly grotesque. If out of that stiff tie and collar there
     had come abruptly the head of a cat or a dog, it could not have been a more idiotic
     contrast.
The man’s name, it seemed, was Gogol; he was a Pole, and in this circle of days he was called
     Tuesday. His soul and speech were incurably tragic; he could not force himself to play the
     prosperous and frivolous part demanded of him by President Sunday. And, indeed, when Syme came
     in the President, with that daring disregard of public suspicion which was his policy, was
     actually chaffing Gogol upon his inability to assume conventional graces.
“Our friend Tuesday,” said the President in a deep voice at once of quietude and volume, “our
     friend Tuesday doesn’t seem to grasp the idea. He dresses up like a gentleman, but he seems to
     be too great a soul to behave like one. He insists on the ways of the stage conspirator. Now if
     a gentleman goes about London in a top hat and a frock‑coat, no one need know that he is an
     anarchist. But if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock‑coat, and then goes about on his
     hands and knees—well, he may attract attention. That’s what Brother Gogol does. He goes about
     on his hands and knees with such inexhaustible diplomacy, that by this time he finds it quite
     difficult to walk upright.”
“I am not good at goncealment,” said Gogol sulkily, with a thick foreign accent; “I am not
     ashamed of the cause.”
“Yes you are, my boy, and so is the cause of you,” said the President good-naturedly. “You
     hide as much as anybody; but you can’t do it, you see, you’re such an ass! You try to combine
     two inconsistent methods. When a householder finds a man under his bed, he will probably pause
     to note the circumstance. But if he finds a man under his bed in a top hat, you will agree with
     me, my dear Tuesday, that he is not likely even to forget it. Now when you were found under
     Admiral Biffin’s bed—”
“I am not good at deception,” said Tuesday gloomily, flushing.
“Right, my boy, right,” said the President with a ponderous heartiness, “you aren’t good at
     anything.”
While this stream of conversation continued, Syme was looking more steadily at the men around
     him. As he did so, he gradually felt all his sense of something spiritually queer return.
He had thought at first that they were all of common stature and costume, with the evident
     exception of the hairy Gogol. But as he looked at the others, he began to see in each of them
     exactly what he had seen in the man by the river, a demoniac detail somewhere. That lop‑sided
     laugh, which would suddenly disfigure the fine face of his original guide, was typical of all
     these types. Each man had something about him, perceived perhaps at the tenth or twentieth
     glance, which was not normal, and which seemed hardly human. The only metaphor he could think
     of was this, that they all looked as men of fashion and presence would look, with the
     additional twist given in a false and curved mirror.
Only the individual examples will express this half-concealed eccentricity. Syme’s original
     cicerone bore the title of Monday; he was the Secretary of the Council, and his twisted smile
     was regarded with more terror than anything, except the President’s horrible, happy laughter.
     But now that Syme had more space and light to observe him, there were other touches. His fine
     face was so emaciated, that Syme thought it must be wasted with some disease; yet somehow the
     very distress of his dark eyes denied this. It was no physical ill that troubled him. His eyes
     were alive with intellectual torture, as if pure thought was pain.
He was typical of each of the tribe; each man was subtly and differently wrong. Next to him
     sat Tuesday, the tousle‑headed Gogol, a man more obviously mad. Next was Wednesday, a certain
     Marquis de St. Eustache, a sufficiently characteristic figure. The first few glances found
     nothing unusual about him, except that he was the only man at table who wore the fashionable
     clothes as if they were really his own. He had a black French beard cut square and a black
     English frock‑coat cut even squarer. But Syme, sensitive to such things, felt somehow that the
     man carried a rich atmosphere with him, a rich atmosphere that suffocated. It reminded one
     irrationally of drowsy odours and of dying lamps in the darker poems of Byron and Poe. With
     this went a sense of his being clad, not in lighter colours, but in softer materials; his black
     seemed richer and warmer than the black shades about him, as if it were compounded of profound
     colour. His black coat looked as if it were only black by being too dense a purple. His black
     beard looked as if it were only black by being too deep a blue. And in the gloom and thickness
     of the beard his dark red mouth showed sensual and scornful. Whatever he was he was not a
     Frenchman; he might be a Jew; he might be something deeper yet in the dark heart of the East.
     In the bright coloured Persian tiles and pictures showing tyrants hunting, you may see just
     those almond eyes, those blue‑black beards, those cruel, crimson lips.
Then came Syme, and next a very old man, Professor de Worms, who still kept the chair of
     Friday, though every day it was expected that his death would leave it empty. Save for his
     intellect, he was in the last dissolution of senile decay. His face was as grey as his long
     grey beard, his forehead was lifted and fixed finally in a furrow of mild despair. In no other
     case, not even that of Gogol, did the bridegroom brilliancy of the morning dress express a more
     painful contrast. For the red flower in his button‑hole showed up against a face that was
     literally discoloured like lead; the whole hideous effect was as if some drunken dandies had
     put their clothes upon a corpse. When he rose or sat down, which was with long labour and
     peril, something worse was expressed than mere weakness, something indefinably connected with
     the horror of the whole scene. It did not express decrepitude merely, but corruption. Another
     hateful fancy crossed Syme’s quivering mind. He could not help thinking that whenever the man
     moved a leg or arm might fall off.
Right at the end sat the man called Saturday, the simplest and the most baffling of all. He
     was a short, square man with a dark, square face clean-shaven, a medical practitioner going by
     the name of Bull. He had that combination of savoir‑faire with a sort of well-groomed
     coarseness which is not uncommon in young doctors. He carried his fine clothes with confidence
     rather than ease, and he mostly wore a set smile. There was nothing whatever odd about him,
     except that he wore a pair of dark, almost opaque spectacles. It may have been merely a
     crescendo of nervous fancy that had gone before, but those black discs were dreadful to Syme;
     they reminded him of half‑remembered ugly tales, of some story about pennies being put on the
     eyes of the dead. Syme’s eye always caught the black glasses and the blind grin. Had the dying
     Professor worn them, or even the pale Secretary, they would have been appropriate. But on the
     younger and grosser man they seemed only an enigma. They took away the key of the face. You
     could not tell what his smile or his gravity meant. Partly from this, and partly because he had
     a vulgar virility wanting in most of the others it seemed to Syme that he might be the
     wickedest of all those wicked men. Syme even had the thought that his eyes might be covered up
     because they were too frightful to see.
