CHAPTER VII
THE UNACCOUNTABLE CONDUCT OF PROFESSOR DE WORMS
“SIT down!” said Sunday in a voice that he used once or twice in his life, a voice that made
     men drop drawn swords.
The three who had risen fell away from Gogol, and that equivocal person himself resumed his
     seat.
“Well, my man,” said the President briskly, addressing him as one addresses a total stranger,
     “will you oblige me by putting your hand in your upper waistcoat pocket and showing me what you
     have there?”
The alleged Pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair, but he put two fingers into
     the pocket with apparent coolness and pulled out a blue strip of card. When Syme saw it lying
     on the table, he woke up again to the world outside him. For although the card lay at the other
     extreme of the table, and he could read nothing of the inscription on it, it bore a startling
     resemblance to the blue card in his own pocket, the card which had been given to him when he
     joined the anti‑anarchist constabulary.
“Pathetic Slav,” said the President, “tragic child of Poland, are you prepared in the
     presence of that card to deny that you are in this company—shall we say de trop?”
“Right oh!” said the late Gogol. It made everyone jump to hear a clear, commercial and
     somewhat cockney voice coming out of that forest of foreign hair. It was irrational, as if a
     Chinaman had suddenly spoken with a Scotch accent.
“I gather that you fully understand your position,” said Sunday.
“You bet,” answered the Pole. “I see it’s a fair cop. All I say is, I don’t believe any Pole
     could have imitated my accent like I did his.”
“I concede the point,” said Sunday. “I believe your own accent to be inimitable, though I
     shall practise it in my bath. Do you mind leaving your beard with your card?”
“Not a bit,” answered Gogol; and with one finger he ripped off the whole of his shaggy
     head‑covering, emerging with thin red hair and a pale, pert face. “It was hot,” he added.
“I will do you the justice to say,” said Sunday, not without a sort of brutal admiration,
     “that you seem to have kept pretty cool under it. Now listen to me. I like you. The consequence
     is that it would annoy me for just about two and a half minutes if I heard that you had died in
     torments. Well, if you ever tell the police or any human soul about us, I shall have that two
     and a half minutes of discomfort. On your discomfort I will not dwell. Good day. Mind the
     step.”
The red‑haired detective who had masqueraded as Gogol rose to his feet without a word, and
     walked out of the room with an air of perfect nonchalance. Yet the astonished Syme was able to
     realise that this ease was suddenly assumed; for there was a slight stumble outside the door,
     which showed that the departing detective had not minded the step.
“Time is flying,” said the President in his gayest manner, after glancing at his watch, which
     like everything about him seemed bigger than it ought to be. “I must go off at once; I have to
     take the chair at a Humanitarian meeting.”
The Secretary turned to him with working eyebrows.
“Would it not be better,” he said a little sharply, “to discuss further the details of our
     project, now that the spy has left us?”
“No, I think not,” said the President with a yawn like an unobtrusive earthquake. “Leave it
     as it is. Let Saturday settle it. I must be off. Breakfast here next Sunday.”
But the late loud scenes had whipped up the almost naked nerves of the Secretary. He was one
     of those men who are conscientious even in crime.
“I must protest, President, that the thing is irregular,” he said. “It is a fundamental rule
     of our society that all plans shall be debated in full council. Of course, I fully appreciate
     your forethought when in the actual presence of a traitor—”
“Secretary,” said the President seriously, “if you’d take your head home and boil it for a
     turnip it might be useful. I can’t say. But it might.
The Secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger.
“I really fail to understand—” he began in high offense.
“That’s it, that’s it,” said the President, nodding a great many times. “That’s where you
     fail right enough. You fail to understand. Why, you dancing donkey,” he roared, rising, “you
     didn’t want to be overheard by a spy, didn’t you? How do you know you aren’t overheard
     now?”
And with these words he shouldered his way out of the room, shaking with incomprehensible
     scorn.
Four of the men left behind gaped after him without any apparent glimmering of his meaning.
     Syme alone had even a glimmering, and such as it was it froze him to the bone. If the last
     words of the President meant anything, they meant that he had not after all passed unsuspected.
     They meant that while Sunday could not denounce him like Gogol, he still could not trust him
     like the others.
The other four got to their feet grumbling more or less, and betook themselves elsewhere to
     find lunch, for it was already well past midday. The Professor went last, very slowly and
     painfully. Syme sat long after the rest had gone, revolving his strange position. He had
     escaped a thunderbolt, but he was still under a cloud. At last he rose and made his way out of
     the hotel into Leicester Square. The bright, cold day had grown increasingly colder, and when
     he came out into the street he was surprised by a few flakes of snow. While he still carried
     the sword‑stick and the rest of Gregory’s portable luggage, he had thrown the cloak down and
     left it somewhere, perhaps on the steam‑tug, perhaps on the balcony. Hoping, therefore, that
     the snow‑shower might be slight, he stepped back out of the street for a moment and stood up
     under the doorway of a small and greasy hair‑dresser’s shop, the front window of which was
     empty, except for a sickly wax lady in evening dress.
Snow, however, began to thicken and fall fast; and Syme, having found one glance at the wax
     lady quite sufficient to depress his spirits, stared out instead into the white and empty
     street. He was considerably astonished to see, standing quite still outside the shop and
     staring into the window, a man. His top hat was loaded with snow like the hat of Father
     Christmas, the white drift was rising round his boots and ankles; but it seemed as if nothing
     could tear him away from the contemplation of the colourless wax doll in dirty evening dress.
     That any human being should stand in such weather looking into such a shop was a matter of
     sufficient wonder to Syme; but his idle wonder turned suddenly into a personal shock; for he
     realised that the man standing there was the paralytic old Professor de Worms. It scarcely
     seemed the place for a person of his years and infirmities.
Syme was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this dehumanized brotherhood; but
     even he could not believe that the Professor had fallen in love with that particular wax lady.
     He could only suppose that the man’s malady (whatever it was) involved some momentary fits of
     rigidity or trance. He was not inclined, however, to feel in this case any very compassionate
     concern. On the contrary, he rather congratulated himself that the Professor’s stroke and his
     elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to escape from him and leave him miles behind.
     For Syme thirsted first and last to get clear of the whole poisonous atmosphere, if only for an
     hour. Then he could collect his thoughts, formulate his policy, and decide finally whether he
     should or should not keep faith with Gregory.
He strolled away through the dancing snow, turned up two or three streets, down through two
     or three others, and entered a small Soho restaurant for lunch. He partook reflectively of four
     small and quaint courses, drank half a bottle of red wine, and ended up over black coffee and a
     black cigar, still thinking. He had taken his seat in the upper room of the restaurant, which
     was full of the chink of knives and the chatter of foreigners. He remembered that in old days
     he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly aliens were anarchists. He shuddered,
     remembering the real thing. But even the shudder had the delightful shame of escape. The wine,
     the common food, the familiar place, the faces of natural and talkative men, made him almost
     feel as if the Council of the Seven Days had been a bad dream; and although he knew it was
     nevertheless an objective reality, it was at least a distant one. Tall houses and populous
     streets lay between him and his last sight of the shameful seven; he was free in free London,
     and drinking wine among the free. With a somewhat easier action, he took his hat and stick and
     strolled down the stair into the shop below.
When he entered that lower room he stood stricken and rooted to the spot. At a small table,
     close up to the blank window and the white street of snow, sat the old anarchist Professor over
     a glass of milk, with his lifted livid face and pendent eyelids. For an instant Syme stood as
     rigid as the stick he leant upon. Then with a gesture as of blind hurry, he brushed past the
     Professor, dashing open the door and slamming it behind him, and stood outside in the snow.
“Can that old corpse be following me?” he asked himself, biting his yellow moustache. “I
     stopped too long up in that room, so that even such leaden feet could catch me up. One comfort
     is, with a little brisk walking I can put a man like that as far away as Timbuctoo. Or am I too
     fanciful? Was he really following me? Surely Sunday would not be such a fool as to send a lame
     man? ”
He set off at a smart pace, twisting and whirling his stick, in the direction of Covent
     Garden. As he crossed the great market the snow increased, growing blinding and bewildering as
     the afternoon began to darken. The snow‑flakes tormented him like a swarm of silver bees.
     Getting into his eyes and beard, they added their unremitting futility to his already irritated
     nerves; and by the time that he had come at a swinging pace to the beginning of Fleet Street,
     he lost patience, and finding a Sunday teashop, turned into it to take shelter. He ordered
     another cup of black coffee as an excuse. Scarcely had he done so, when Professor de Worms
     hobbled heavily into the shop, sat down with difficulty and ordered a glass of milk.
Syme’s walking‑stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang, which confessed the
     concealed steel. But the Professor did not look round. Syme, who was commonly a cool character,
     was literally gaping as a rustic gapes at a conjuring trick. He had seen no cab following; he
     had heard no wheels outside the shop; to all mortal appearances the man had come on foot. But
     the old man could only walk like a snail, and Syme had walked like the wind. He started up and
     snatched his stick, half crazy with the contradiction in mere arithmetic, and swung out of the
     swinging doors, leaving his coffee untasted. An omnibus going to the Bank went rattling by with
     an unusual rapidity. He had a violent run of a hundred yards to reach it; but he managed to
     spring, swaying upon the splash‑board and, pausing for an instant to pant, he climbed on to the
     top. When he had been seated for about half a minute, he heard behind him a sort of heavy and
     asthmatic breathing.
Turning sharply, he saw rising gradually higher and higher up the omnibus steps a top hat
     soiled and dripping with snow, and under the shadow of its brim the short‑sighted face and
     shaky shoulders of Professor de Worms. He let himself into a seat with characteristic care, and
     wrapped himself up to the chin in the mackintosh rug.
Every movement of the old man’s tottering figure and vague hands, every uncertain gesture and
     panic‑stricken pause, seemed to put it beyond question that he was helpless, that he was in the
     last imbecility of the body. He moved by inches, he let himself down with little gasps of
     caution. And yet, unless the philosophical entities called time and space have no vestige even
     of a practical existence, it appeared quite unquestionable that he had run after the
     omnibus.
Syme sprang erect upon the rocking car, and after staring wildly at the wintry sky, that grew
     gloomier every moment, he ran down the steps. He had repressed an elemental impulse to leap
     over the side.
Too bewildered to look back or to reason, he rushed into one of the little courts at the side
     of Fleet Street as a rabbit rushes into a hole. He had a vague idea, if this incomprehensible
     old Jack‑in‑the‑box was really pursuing him, that in that labyrinth of little streets he could
     soon throw him off the scent. He dived in and out of those crooked lanes, which were more like
     cracks than thoroughfares; and by the time that he had completed about twenty alternate angles
     and described an unthinkable polygon, he paused to listen for any sound of pursuit. There was
     none; there could not in any case have been much, for the little streets were thick with the
     soundless snow. Somewhere behind Red Lion Court, however, he noticed a place where some
     energetic citizen had cleared away the snow for a space of about twenty yards, leaving the wet,
     glistening cobble‑stones. He thought little of this as he passed it, only plunging into yet
     another arm of the maze. But when a few hundred yards farther on he stood still again to
     listen, his heart stood still also, for he heard from that space of rugged stones the clinking
     crutch and labouring feet of the infernal cripple.
The sky above was loaded with the clouds of snow, leaving London in a darkness and oppression
     premature for that hour of the evening. On each side of Syme the walls of the alley were blind
     and featureless; there was no little window or any kind of eve. He felt a new impulse to break
     out of this hive of houses, and to get once more into the open and lamp-lit street. Yet he
     rambled and dodged for a long time before he struck the main thoroughfare. When he did so, he
     struck it much farther up than he had fancied. He came out into what seemed the vast and void
     of Ludgate Circus, and saw St. Paul’s Cathedral sitting in the sky.
At first he was startled to find these great roads so empty, as if a pestilence had swept
     through the city. Then he told himself that some degree of emptiness was natural; first because
     the snow‑storm was even dangerously deep, and secondly because it was Sunday. And at the very
     word Sunday he bit his lip; the word was henceforth for hire like some indecent pun. Under the
     white fog of snow high up in the heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was turned to a very
     queer kind of green twilight, as of men under the sea. The sealed and sullen sunset behind the
     dark dome of St. Paul’s had in it smoky and sinister colours—colours of sickly green, dead red
     or decaying bronze, that were just bright enough to emphasise the solid whiteness of the snow.
     But right up against these dreary colours rose the black bulk of the cathedral; and upon the
     top of the cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow, still clinging as to an
     Alpine peak. It had fallen accidentally, but just so fallen as to half drape the dome from its
     very topmost point, and to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross. When Syme
     saw it he suddenly straightened himself, and made with his sword‑stick an involuntary
     salute.
He knew that that evil figure, his shadow, was creeping quickly or slowly behind him, and he
     did not care.
It seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies were darkening that high
     place of the earth was bright. The devils might have captured heaven, but they had not yet
     captured the cross. He had a new impulse to tear out the secret of this dancing, jumping and
     pursuing paralytic; and at the entrance of the court as it opened upon the Circus he turned,
     stick in hand, to face his pursuer.
Professor de Worms came slowly round the corner of the irregular alley behind him, his
     unnatural form outlined against a lonely gas‑lamp, irresistibly recalling that very imaginative
     figure in the nursery rhymes, “the crooked man who went a crooked mile.” He really looked as if
     he had been twisted out of shape by the tortuous streets he had been threading. He came nearer
     and nearer, the lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles, his lifted, patient face. Syme
     waited for him as St. George waited for the dragon, as a man waits for a final explanation or
     for death. And the old Professor came right up to him and passed him like a total stranger,
     without even a blink of his mournful eyelids.
There was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that left Syme in a final fury.
     The man’s colourless face and manner seemed to assert that the whole following had been an
     accident. Syme was galvanised with an energy that was something between bitterness and a burst
     of boyish derision. He made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man’s hat off, called out
     something like “Catch me if you can,” and went racing away across the white, open Circus.
     Concealment was impossible now; and looking back over his shoulder, he could see the black
     figure of the old gentleman coming after him with long, swinging strides like a man winning a
     mile race. But the head upon that bounding body was still pale, grave and professional, like
     the head of a lecturer upon the body of a harlequin.
This outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus, up Ludgate Hill, round St. Paul’s
     Cathedral, along Cheapside, Syme remembering all the nightmares he had ever known. Then Syme
     broke away towards the river, and ended almost down by the docks. He saw the yellow panes of a
     low, lighted public‑house, flung himself into it and ordered beer. It was a foul tavern,
     sprinkled with foreign sailors, a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn.
A moment later Professor de Worms entered the place, sat down carefully, and asked for a
     glass of milk.
