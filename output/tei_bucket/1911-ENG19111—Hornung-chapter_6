AN AWAKENING
 It was a normal elderly gentleman, with certain simple habits, but no little distinction of
     address, who welcomed the schoolboy at his breakfast-table. The goblin inquisitor of Hyde Park
     had vanished with his hat and cloak. The excited empiric of the dark-room was a creature of
     that ruby light alone. Dr. Baumgartner was shaved and clad like other men, the iron-grey hair
     carefully brushed back from a lofty forehead, all traces of strong acids removed from his
     well-kept hands. There was a third person, and only a third, at table in the immature shape of
     a young lady whom the doctor introduced as his niece Miss Platts, and addressed as Phillida. 
 Pocket thought he had never heard of nobler atonement for unmitigable surname. He could not
     help thinking that this Phillida did not look the one
      to flout a fellow, after the fashion of the only other Phillida he had ever heard
     of, and then that it was beastly cheek to start thinking of her like that and by her Christian
     name. But he was of the age and temperament when thoughts will come of contact with young
     animals of the opposite sex. He looked at her sidelong from time to time, but all four eyes
     dropped directly they met; she seemed as shy and uninteresting as himself; her conversation was
     confined to table attentions to her uncle and his guest. 
 Pocket made more valiant attempts. A parlour billiard-table, standing against the wall,
     supplied an irresistible topic. “We have a full-size table at home,” he said, and could have
     mutilated his tongue that instant. “I like a small one best,” he assured the doctor, who shook
     his head and smiled. 
 “Honestly, sir, and snob-cricket better than the real thing! I'm no good at real games.” 
 The statement was too true, but not the preference. 
 “That must be awkward for you, at an English public school,” was the doctor's comment. 
 Pocket heaved an ingenuous sigh. It was hateful. He blamed the asthma as far as modesty
     would permit. He was modest enough in his breakfast-table talk, yet nervously egotistical, and
     apt to involve himself in lengthy explanations. He had
      two types of listener—the dry and the demure—to all he said. 
 “And they let you come up to London alone!” remarked Dr. Baumgartner when he got a chance. 
 “But it wasn't their fault that I——” 
 Pocket stopped at a glance from his host, and plunged into profuse particulars exonerating
     his house-master, but was cut short again. Evidently the niece was not to know where he had
     spent the night. 
 “I suppose there are a number of young men at your—establishment?” said the doctor,
     exchanging a glance with Miss Platts. 
 “There are over four hundred boys,” replied Pocket, a little puzzled. 
 “And how many keepers do they require?” 
 A grin apologised for the word. 
 “There must be over thirty masters,” returned Pocket more pointedly than before. He was not
     going to stand chaff about his public school from a mad German doctor. 
 “And they arm you for the battle of life with Latin and Greek, eh?” 
 “Not necessarily; there's a Modern Side. You can learn German if you like!” said Pocket, not
     without contempt. 
 “Do you?” 
 “I don't like,” said the boy gratuitously. 

 “Then we must stick to your excellent King's English.” 
 Pocket turned a trifle sulky. He felt he had not scored in this little passage. Then he
     reflected upon the essential and extraordinary kindness which had brought him to a decent
     breakfast-table that morning. That made him ashamed; nor could he have afforded to be too
     independent just yet, even had he been so disposed in his heart. His asthma was a beast that
     always growled in the background; he never knew when it would spring upon him with a roar.
     Breakfast pacified the brute; hot coffee always did; but the effects soon wore off, and the boy
     was oppressed again, yet deadly weary, long before it was time for him to go to Welbeck Street. 
 “Is there really nothing you can take?” asked Dr. Baumgartner, standing over him in the
     drawing-room, where Pocket sat hunched up in the big easy-chair. 
 “Nothing now, I'm afraid, unless I could get some of those cigarettes. And Dr. Bompas would
     kick up an awful row!” 
 “But it's inhuman. I'll go and get them myself. He should prescribe for such an emergency.” 
 “He has,” said Pocket. “I've got some stuff in my bag; but it's no use taking it now. It's
      meant to take in bed when you can have your sleep out.” 
 And he was going into more elaborate details than Dr. Bompas had done, when the other doctor
     cut him short once more. 
 “But why not now? You can sleep to your heart's content in that chair; nobody will come in.” 
 Pocket shook his head. 
 “I'm due in Welbeck Street at twelve.” 
 “Well, I'll wake you at quarter to, and have a taxi ready at the door. That will give you a
     good two hours.” 
 Pocket hesitated, remembering the blessed instantaneous effect of the first bottle under the
     bush. 
 “Would you promise to wake me, sir? You're not going out?” 
 “I shall be in again.” 
 “Then it is a promise?” 
 Pocket would have liked it in black and white. 
 “Certainly, my young fellow! Is the stuff in your bag?” 
 It was, and the boy took it with much the same results as overnight. It tasted sweeter and
     acted quicker; that was the only difference. The skin seemed to tighten on his face. His
     fingers tingled at the ends It was not at all an unpleasant sensation, especially as the labour
     in his breast came to an end as if by magic. The faintly foreign
      accents of Dr. Baumgartner sounded unduly distant in his last words from the open
     door. It was scarcely shut before the morning's troubles ceased deliciously in the cosy chair. 
 Yet they seemed to begin again directly, and this was a horrid crop! Of course he was back
     in Hyde Park; but the sky must have rained red paint in his absence, or else the earth was
     red-hot and the sky reflected it. No! the grass was too wet for that. It might have been wet
     with blood. Everything was as red as beet-root, as wet and red and one's body weltering in it
     like the slain! Reddest of all was the old photographer, who turned into Mr. Spearman in cap
     and gown, who turned into various members of the Upton family, one making more inconsequent
     remarks than the other, touching wildly on photography and the flitting soul, and between them
     working the mad race up to such a pace and pitch that Pocket woke with a dreadful start to find
     Dr. Baumgartner standing over him once more in the perfectly pallid flesh. 
 “I've had a beast of a dream!” said Pocket, waking thoroughly. “I'm in a cold perspiration,
     and I thought it was cold blood! What time is it?” 
 “A quarter to six,” said the doctor, who had invited the question by taking out his watch. 
 “A quarter to twelve, you mean!” 
 “No—six.” 

 And the boy was shown the dial, but would not believe it until he had gaped at his own
     watch, which had stopped at half-past three. Then he bounded to his feet in a puerile passion,
     and there lay the little garden, a lake of sunlight as he remembered it, swallowed up entirely
     in the shadow of the house. 
 “You promised to wake me!” gasped Pocket, almost speechless. “You've broken your word, sir!” 
 “Only in your own interest,” replied the other calmly. 
 “I believe you were waiting for me to wake—to catch my soul, or some rot!” cried the boy,
     with bitter rudeness; but he looked in vain for the stereoscopic or any other sort of camera,
     and Dr. Baumgartner only shrugged his shoulders as he opened an evening paper. 
 “I apologise for saying that,” the boy resumed, with a dignity that sounded near to tears.
     “I know you meant it for the best—to make up for my bad night—you've been very kind to me, I
     know! But I was due in Welbeck Street at twelve o'clock, and now I shall have to bolt to catch
     the six-thirty from St. Pancras.” 
 “You won't catch the six-thirty from St. Pancras,” replied Baumgartner, scarcely looking up
     from his paper. 

 “I will unless I'm in some outlandish part of London!” cried Pocket, reflecting for the
     first time that he had no idea in what part of London he was. “I must catch it. It's the last
     train back to school. I'll get into an awful row if I don't!” 
 “You'll get into a worse one if you do,” rejoined the doctor, looking over his paper, and
     not unfeelingly, at the boy. 
 “What about?” 
 Pocket held his breath instinctively as their eyes met. Baumgartner answered with increased
     compassion and restraint, a grey look on his grey face: 
 “Something that happened this morning. I fear you will be wanted here in town about it.” 
 “Do tell me what, sir!” 
 “Can you face things, my young fellow?” 
 “Is it about my people—my mother?” the boy cried wildly, at her funeral in a flash. 
 “No—yourself.” 
 “Then I can!” 
 The doctor overcame his final hesitation. 
 “Do you remember a man we left behind us on the grass?” 
 “Perfectly; the grass looked as wet as it felt just now in my dream.” 
 “Exactly. Didn't it strike you as strange that he should be lying there in the wet grass?” 
 “I thought he was drunk.” 

 “He was dead!” 
 Pocket was shocked; he was more than shocked, for he had never witnessed death before; but
     next moment the shock was uncontrollably mitigated by a sudden view of the tragic incident as
     yet another adventure of that adventurous night. No doubt one to retail in reverential tones,
     but a most thrilling adventure none the less. He only failed to see why it should affect him as
     much as the doctor suggested. True, he might be called as witness at the inquest; his very
     natural density was pierced with the awkward possibility of that. But then he had not even
     known the man was dead. 
 Had the doctor? 
 Yes. 
 Pocket wondered why he had not been told at the time, but asked another question first. 
 “What did he die of?” 
 “A bullet!” 
 “Suicide?” 
 “No.” 
 “Not murder?” 
 “This paper says so.” 
 “Does it say who did it?” 
 “It cannot.” 
 “Can you?” 
 “Yes!” 
 “Tell me.” 

 The doctor threw out both hands in a despairing gesture. 
 “Have I to tell you outright, my young fellow, that you did it yourself?”
