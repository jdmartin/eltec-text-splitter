CHAPTER I
With a little scratching (as the concierge pushed it) with the malignity of a little, quiet,
      sleek animal, the letter from Germany crept under the door the next morning, and lay there
      through the silence of the next hour or two, until Kreisler woke. Succeeding to his first
      brutal farewells to his dreams, no hopes leapt on his body, a magnificent stallion’s,
      uselessly refreshed. Soon he saw the letter. It lay there quiet, unimportant, rather matter of
      fact and sly.
Kreisler felt it an indignity to have to open it. Until his dressing was finished, it
      remained where it was. He might have been making some one wait. Then he took it up, and
      opening it, drew out between his forefinger and thumb, the cheque. This he deposited with as
      much contempt as possible, and a “phui” on the edge of his washhand stand. Then he turned to
      the letter. He read the first few fines, pumping at a cigarette, reducing it mathematically
      to ash. Cold fury entered his mind with a bound at the first words. They were the final words
      giving notice of a positive stoppage of supplies. This month’s money was sent to enable him to
      settle up his affairs and come to Germany at once.
He read the first three lines over and over again, going no further, although the news begun
      in these 
       first lines was developed throughout the two pages of the letter. Then he put it
      down beside the cheque, and crushing it under his fist, said monotonously to himself, without
      much more feeling than the sound of the word contained : “Schwein, Schwein, Schwein !”
He got up, and pressed his hand on his forehead; it was wet: he put his hands in his pockets
      and these came into contact with a cinquante centime piece. He took them out again slowly,
      went to his box and underneath an old dressing-gown found writing paper and envelopes. Then,
      referring to his father’s letter for the date, he wrote the following lines :
“1th June 19 — 
“Sir, — I shall not return as you suggest in person, but my body will no doubt be sent to
       you about the middle of next month. If — keeping to your decision — no money is sent, it
       being impossible to five without money, I shall on the seventh of July, this day next month,
       shoot myself.
“Otto Kreisler.”
Within half an hour this was posted. Then he went and had breakfast with more tranquillity
      and relish than he had known for some days. He sat up stiffly like a dilapidated but
      apparently in some way satisfied rooster at his café table. This life was now settled,
      pressure ceased. He had come to a conventional and respectable decision. His conduct the night
      before, for instance, had not been at all respectable. Death — like a monastery — was before
      him, with equivalents of a slight shaving of the head merely, a handful of vows, some
      desultory farewells, very restricted space, but none the worse for that; with something like
      the disagreeableness of a dive for one not used to deep water. But he had got into
      life, anyhow, by mistake; il s’était trompé de porte. His life might almost have been
      regarded as a long and careful preparation for voluntary death. The nightmare of Death, as it
      haunted the imaginations of the Egyptians, had here been conjured in another way.
Death was not to be overcome with embalmings and Pyramids, or fought within the souls of
      children. It was confronted as some other more uncompromising race (and yet also haunted by
      this terrible idea) might have been.
Instead of rearing smooth faces of immense stone against it, you imagine an unparalleled
      immobility in life, a race of statues, throwing flesh in Death’s path instead of basalt.
      Kreisler would have undoubtedly been a high priest among this people.
