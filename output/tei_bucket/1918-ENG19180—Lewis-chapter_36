CHAPTER II
Kreisler’s afternoon encounter with Anastasya and Soltyk had resembled Tarr’s meeting with
      him and Bertha. Kreisler had seen Anastasya and his new cafe friend one day from his window.
      His reference to possible nose-pulling was accounted for by this. The next day he had felt
      rather like seeing Anastasya again somewhere. With this object, he had patrolled the
      neighbourhood. About four o’clock, having just bought some cigarettes at the “Berne,” he
      was standing outside considering a walk in the Luxemburg, when Fraulein Vasek appeared in this
      unshunnable circus of the Quartier du Paradis. Soltyk was with her. He went over at once. With
      urbane timidity, as though they had been alone, he offered his hand. She looked at Soltyk,
      smiling. But she showed no particular signs of wanting to escape. They began strolling along
      the Boulevard, Soltyk showing every sign of impatience. She then stopped.
“Mr. Soltyk and I were just going to have the ‘ five o’clock ’ somewhere,” she said.
Soltyk looked pointedly down the Boulevard, as though that had been an improper piece of
      information to communicate to Kreisler.
“If you consent to my accompanying you, Fraulein, it would give me the greatest pleasure to
      remain in your company a little longer.”
She laughed. “Where were we going, Louis ? Didn’t you say there was a place near here ?”
“There is one over there. But I’m afraid, Fraulein Vasek, I must leave you. — I
      have——”
“Oh, must you ? I’m sorry.”
Soltyk was astonished and mortified. He did not go, looking at her doubtfully. At this point
      Kreisler had addressed him.
“I said nothing, sir, when a moment ago, you failed to return my salute. I understand you
      were going to have tea with Fraulein Vasek. Now you deprive her suddenly of the pleasure of
      your company.

So there is no further doubt on a certain point. Will you tell me at once and clearly what
      objection you have to me ?”
“I don’t wish to discuss things of that sort before this lady.”
“Will you then name a place where they may be discussed ? I will then take my leave ?”
“I see no necessity to discuss anything with you.”
“Ah, you see none. I do. And perhaps it is as well that Fraulein Vasek should hear. Will
      you explain to me, sir, how it is that you have been putting stories about having reference to
      me, and to my discredit, calculated to prejudice people against me ? Since this lady no doubt
      has heard some of your lies, it would be of advantage that you take them back at once, or else
      explain yourself.”
Before Kreisler had finished, Soltyk said to Anastasya, “I had better go at once, to save
      you this —” Then he turned to Kreisler,
“I should have thought you would have had sufficient decency left——”
“Decency, liar ? Decency, lying swine ? Decency — !What do you mean ?” said
      Kreisler, loudly, in crescendo.
Then he crossed quickly over in front of Anastasya and smacked Soltyk first smartly on one
      cheek and .then on the other.
“There is liar branded on both your cheeks ! And if you should not wish to have coward
      added to your other epithets, you or your friends will find me at the following address before
      the day is out.” Kreisler produced a card and handed it to Soltyk.
Soltyk stared at him, paralysed for the moment at this outrage, his eyes burning with the
      sweet intensity Tarr noticed that evening, taking in the incredible fact. He got the fact at
      last. He lifted his cane and brought it down on Kreisler’s shoulders. Kreisler snatched it
      from him, broke it in three and flung it in his face, one of the splinters making a little
      gash in his under lip.
Anastasya had turned round and begun walking
        away, leaving them alone. Kreisler also waited no longer, but marched rapidly
      off in the other direction.
Soltyk caught Anastasya up, and apologized for what had occurred, dabbing his lip with a
      handkerchief.
Kreisler after this felt himself fairly launched on a satisfactory little affair. Many an
      old talent would come in useful. He acted for the rest of the day with a gusto of professional
      interest. For an hour or two he stayed at home. No one came, however, to call him to account.
      Leaving word that he would soon be back, he left in search of a man to act for him.
      He remembered a Russian he had had some talk with at the Studio, and whom he had once visited.
      He was celebrated for having had a duel and blinded his opponent. His instinct now led him to
      this individual, who has already been seen in action. His qualifications for a second were
      quite unique.
Kreisler found him just finishing work. He had soon explained what he required of him. With
      great gravity he set forth his attachment for a “beautiful girl,” the discreditable behaviour
      of the Russian in seeking to prejudice her against him. In fact, he gave an entirely false
      picture of the whole situation. His honour must now be satisfied. He would
      accept nothing less than reparation by arms. Such was Kreisler, but he was himself
      very cynically. He had explained this to Volker after the following manner: “I am a hundred
      different things; I am as many people as the different types of people I have lived amongst. I
      am a ‘ Boulevardier ’ (he believed that on occasion he answered fully to that description), I
      am a ‘ Rapin ’; I am also a ‘ Korps-student.’”
In his account of how things stood he had, besides, led the Russian to understand that there
      was more in it all than it was necessary to say, and, in fact, than he could say.
      Whatever attitude Soltyk might take up, this gentleman too knew, he hinted, that they had come
      to the point in their respective relations towards this “beautiful girl” at which one of
      them 
        must disappear. In addition, he, Kreisler, had been grossly insulted in the
      very presence of the “beautiful girl” that afternoon. The Russian’s compatriot had used his
      cane. These latter were facts that would be confirmed later, for the physical facts at least
      could not be got round by Soltyk.
The Russian, Bitzenko by name, a solemnly excitable bourgeois of Petrograd, recognized a
      situation after his own heart. Excitement was a food he seldom got in such quantities, and
      pretending to listen to Kreisler a little abstractedly and uncertainly to start with, he was
      really from the first very much his man.
So Kreisler and his newly found henchman, silently and intently engaged on their evening’s
      business, have been accounted for. Soltyk had been discovered some quarter of an hour before
      Tarr’s appearance, and stared out of countenance for the whole of the time by Kreisler.
