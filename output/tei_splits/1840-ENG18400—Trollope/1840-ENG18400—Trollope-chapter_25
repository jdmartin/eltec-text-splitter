 CHAPTER XXIV. 
THE WALK PROVES TOO FATIGUING TO ONE OF THE PARTY, BUT NOT TO MISS BROTHERTON — SHE
				WANDERS FURTHER, AND MEETS WITH AN ADVENTURE, BUT AT LAST RETURNS IN SAFETY TO HER
				INN — A JOURNEY HOMEWARD, AND A FACT RELATED WITHOUT ORNAMENT.

				It is but a dreary and desolate landscape which greets the eye
				immediately without the walls of the Deep Valley factory; but to all who  are happy enough to feel that they are quitting those hideous walls for ever, it
				can hardly fail to convey a sense of beauty, freshness, and freedom, sufficient to
				expand the heart with admiration and delight. Mary felt disposed to bound along the
				grassy path beside the stream with the joyous playfulness of a child, and rather
				than have re-entered that creaking door again, would have been tempted, like another
				Undine, to plunge into the water, and take her chance of finding quarters less
				hateful beneath its rippling wave. Mrs. Tremlett breathed more freely, and seemed to
				have recovered the elastic step of youth, as she moved briskly on. But compared with
				what was passing in the breast of the ragged, dirty little creature that walked
				beside them, their feelings were most earthly cold and dull. Her small hand was
				still clasped in that of Miss Brotherton, who felt that the child was urging her
				onward, even faster than she was inclined to go, while her head upturned towards the
				towering heights which hemmed them in, seemed eagerly seeking an outlet from the
				region that her soul abhorred. 
"You are glad, dear Fanny, are you not, to know that you have left that frightful
				place?" said Mary, kindly pressing the little emaciated hand she held in hers. The
				child stopped short in her hurried walk, and looking up in her deliverer's face,
				with a doubting anxious look that it was painful to see, murmured very softly, and
				as if fearing to be overheard from within the walls,
"Shall I never, never go back again?"
"No, never Fanny! Do you think I would be so cruel as to take you back?" said
				Mary.
"I do not know if it is not all a dream," replied the child. "I have dreamed that I
				saw green grass, and felt the air upon my face, before."
"Do not be afraid, Fanny! You are not dreaming now," returned Mary. "Run on, and
				gather that fine large stalk of foxglove. You never saw such a gay flower as that in
				your dreams, did you?"
The little girl sprang forward, and falling upon her knees on the grass, plucked the
				tall flower, and pressed it to her lips, and to her heart. But though this was a
				childish action, it was not done childishly: there was an appearance of deep
				feeling, and even of devotion in her look and attitude which strongly awakened
				Mary's interest, and when the little creature rose again, and holding the flower in
				one hand, slid the other once more into that of her new friend, the heart of that
				friend yearned towards her with newly-awakened tenderness. But when she spoke to
				her, and endeavoured to lead her into conversation, the attempt entirely failed.
				There are many who might have felt disappointed and chilled by this; but Mary
				Brotherton had truer sympathy, and as, from time to time, she felt a loving
				contraction of Fanny's little fingers upon her own, and sometimes caught her looking
				up, as if by stealth into her face, she felt no misgivings as to the cause of her
				silence, but loved her the better from knowing that her heart was too full to
				speak.
 They all, and as if moved by one common impulse, walked quickly 
				forward as long as their road continued along the margin of the stream; but when it
				turned round the steep hill's base, and began to mount, their pace relaxed, Mary
				felt that her little companion dragged on her steps with labour, and perceived that
				Mrs. Tremlett was out of breath. 
"Let us sit down under this ash-tree, and wait for the jolly miller," said Miss
				Brotherton, "it cannot be very long, I think, before he overtakes us."
This proposal was the more amiable, because, in the first place, Mary could herself
				have run from the bottom of that steep hill to the top, almost without perceiving
				that it was any hill at all; and in the next, she so exceedingly disliked both the
				miller and his cart, that had she consulted her own inclinations alone, she would
				probably have preferred retracing the whole way on foot.
But very gladly was her proposal for rest accepted, by both her old and young
				companion, and long did they remain seated under their pleasant canopy before they
				any of them grew weary of it; till at length, after consulting her watch, Miss
				Brotherton expressed a doubt whether the fat miller and his lazy steed intended to
				overtake them at all.
"Good gracious, my dear! do you really think so?" said Mrs. Tremlett, considerably
				alarmed. "Why, Mary, we shall never get back to Mrs. Prescot's without him!"
"I hope I may be mistaken, my dear old woman," said her kind mistress,
				affectionately; "for I fear such a walk would be too much for you. But when I
				remember that he is paid, and remember, likewise, how very little he seemed actuated
				by any motive, save that of sordid interest, I confess that I do think it very
				probable he means to leave us in the lurch."
"Then let us walk on, Miss Mary, without saying a word more about it. The shadows are
				beginning to grow long already, and you shan't be kept out half the night by my
				laziness. Come along, little girl."
With these words, Mrs. Tremlett raised herself from between two comfortable roots,
				which had made her an excellent arm-chair; but the little girl whom she summoned to
				do likewise, though she exerted herself to get on her feet, seemed hardly able to
				stand.
"My poor Fanny, you are quite knocked up!" exclaimed Miss Brotherton, looking at her
				with great anxiety. "How in the world shall we ever be able to get her on?"
"It is only because I have not been used to walk lately," said Fanny; "that is, not
				as we have been walking now. Our work keeps us always on our legs, and that makes
				them bend about so, when I try to walk; but I can walk though it hurts me,
				and I think it would be better to die outright in getting on, rather than rest so
				near the factory — so, please ma'am, I'm quite ready to go on."
 And again the party set off, but the difficulty with which the little Fanny got
				along became more obvious at every step, and it soon became evident that to get as
				far as Mrs. Prescot's would be impossible.  The dilemma was not a
				pleasant one. They were still in a part of the road so little frequented, that it
				was probable they might wait for hours without obtaining assistance from any passer
				by, nor did either Mrs. Tremlett or Mary recollect to have seen any dwelling nearer
				than the high-road, from which they were still at a considerable distance. 
The distress of the little girl was painful to witness. At the very moment when the
				dark cloud which had seemed to settle upon her was withdrawn, and hope gradually and
				with difficulty, as to eyes long unaccustomed to its light, began to reach her; at
				that very moment her strength failed, and a sensation, like the sickness of death,
				rendered every attempt at further exertion impossible.
"I must stay here," she said; "it is the will of God."
"No, no, Fanny," said Miss Brotherton, seating herself beside her, and letting the
				languid little head drop upon her bosom; "you have no reason to think that, while I
				have a thousand to believe the contrary. It is a most strange chance which has
				brought me here, and placed you in my hands — this was by the will of God, and I
				will not believe it has so chanced, only that I may see you die."
"You must not stay here," said Fanny, feebly; "night will come presently, and you
				must go fast to get home. Do not be sorry for me — but, indeed, I think I am as bad
				as Michael was, when he fell sick, and was carried away to die."
"Did you see — " began Mary, eagerly; but suddenly stopping herself, she added, "Not
				now my poor Fanny, you must not tell me about it now — when I have got you strong
				and well at my own home, we will talk of poor Michael. Try now, to think how glad
				you will be when we have got you home, and all our difficulties are over! But
				something must be done, I know, my poor child, before this can be. How had we best
				act in this dilemma, Mrs. Tremlett? Do you think you shall have courage to remain
				with this poor child while I run on, and endeavour to find some house where we may
				get assistance?"
"Alone, Miss Mary?" replied the good woman, looking terribly alarmed. "How can I let
				you set off in a strange, wild country like this, with nobody to take care of you?
				Let us go together. Mary; nothing can hurt this little girl, you know, while we are
				away."
"Think it over once more, dear Tremlett," said Mary, "and then I believe you will
				perceive that there is more chance of your being useful to her, than to me. I shall
				get on faster without you, good nurse, and with a lighter heart than if I took you
				for company, while this little creature was left with nothing but her own melancholy
				thoughts and childish terrors to comfort her."
"Then I will stay," said the poor woman, sighing heavily: "but just think, Miss Mary,
				how I shall feel till you come back again!"
"I will not loiter to amuse myself," replied her young mistress with a cheering
				smile; "and now take my place, and let this poor little head rest on your
				shoulder."
 "She shall lie down on that bit of level turf yonder, with her head 
				upon my lap," said the old nurse, tenderly assisting Mary to lift her up. 
"God bless you, my dear good soul! I will be quickly back again," replied her
				grateful mistress. "How much more you show you love me now, than if you insisted
				upon walking after me. There! she lies as nicely as if she were in bed. If our
				faithless miller makes his appearance, keep him and his cart till I come back; tell
				him he shall have more gold, and he will stand waiting beside you, as gentle as a
				lamb."
Having said these comforting words, Mary instened onward and was speedily out of
				sight. Having reached the top of the hill, she looked anxiously round in search of a
				human dwelling, but nothing met her eye, but barren moor-land, which at some
				distance showed symptoms of cultivation, being enclosed in patches by low stone
				walls, and here and there the fragment of a stunted hawthorn fence, which seemed to
				sustain a hungry life with difficulty. Making her way across the rude and
				imperfectly-formed sunk fence, which marked the boundary of the cart-road, along
				which they had travelled in the morning, Mary found herself on a level of some
				extent, but without the slightest track to direct her steps amidst the long parched
				grass, and frequent stones with which it was covered.
"This will never do! I may walk here till I have completely lamed myself, without a
				chance of meeting any living soul," thought Mary, stopping short; "I shall do better
				by making for the high-road at once."
And having so decided, she turned about to retrace her steps, and regain the road;
				but ere she reched it, a sort of hillock at a little distance caught her eye, and
				wishing to take advantage of its elevation, for the purpose of reconnoitring, she
				turned aside to reach it. Her approach to it was from the east, and a dazzling
				sunset was in her eyes, as she made her way up the rugged side of what looked like
				one of the tumuli which served as resting-places for human bones, ere churchyards
				yawned for them. Greatly was she startled on reaching the top of it, to perceive on
				the western side, crouching in a hollow that looked as if it had been excavated by
				the shelter-seeking sheep, a strange wild figure, whose dress, as she looked down
				upon it, left its sex doubtful. The fragment of a hat, and the remnant of a jacket
				were evidently intended, by their original construction, for the use of the nobler
				sex, while something resembling a petticoat enveloping the lower half of the figure,
				suggested the probability that the masculine portion of the attire was worn by
				sufferance, and not by right.
Mary's light step among the matted tufts of coarse vegetation which covered the thin
				soil, had not been heard, and she stood looking down upon her doubtful neighbour
				with the advantage of being herself unseen.
"There goes another day!" said a voice, which though harsh and aged, was unmistakably
				female; "and the silly soul has got to wait for another."

Glad to find that her unexpected companion in this most desolate spot, was of the
				safer, because the weaker portion of the human race, the wandering heiress
				determined to address her; but deemed it wisest to approach her visibly, instead of
				startling the poor soul by speaking to her unexpectedly from the spot where she
				stood. For this purpose, she gently descended from her elevation, and making a
				little circuit, presented herself before the eyes of the sun-gazer.
The old woman, for such she was, sat nose and knees together, in a sort of hole which
				completely sheltered her in every direction but the west; and from the earnest
				manner in which her dim eyes were fixed upon the last bright rays of the setting
				sun, it seemed as if her lair was chosen on purpose to look upon it.
The appearance of Mary seemed to startle her, but not much; for after looking at her
				for a minute as if she examined her person with difficulty, because her eyes were
				dazzled by the object on which she had before been gazing, she said, pointing a
				stick that she held towards the point whence the bright orb had just
				disappeared,
"Who be you, coming to spy out old Sally at her devotions?"
"I want to find a house, my good woman, for I have left a poor child very ill at a
				short distance from hence; I want to find people who can help me to remove her."
"There are no people here," said the old woman, in a gentle but melancholy voice, and
				turning her eyes round the desolate moor as if in confirmation of the assertion.
"But perhaps you may be able to tell me where I can find some one?"
"O dear! O dear! there is no want of finding for such as you. Just go upon the
				high-road and turn yourself about, and say, 'Come to me,' and you'll be seeing 'em
				flock in, right and left, and north and south, all bowing and scraping as genteel as
				possible. 'Tis only me as lives in a hole, and prays to the sun every night to be so
				kind as not to wake me the next morning; 'tis only me that never sees any body. I am
				the only woman in all the world — all the rest have got their death in the
				factories."
There are many circumstances of more danger, that are infinitely less appalling than
				meeting, when out of sight of every other human being, a poor frail shattered
				remnant of humanity with a disordered wit. Mary shuddered as the wild speech of this
				poor creature confirmed the idea of insanity which her appearance suggested, and her
				first impulse was to turn and run. But her steps were stayed by the shrill,
				trembling voice of the old woman, who in an accent, the most helpless and forlorn,
				called after her,
"One minute — only stay one minute! Let me look at you one minute!"
 Mary turned again, and all feeling of terror was lost in pity as she beheld the
				miserable little crippled figure which was hobbling towards her. Her height hardly
				reached that of an ordinary child of twelve years old, her gait showed that her legs
				were dreadfully deformed, her uncouth garments hung about her in tatters, and as she
				painfully  rolled herself at every step round the stick by whose aid
				she was supported, it was hardly possible to conceive a more complete image of
				poverty and decrepitude, than her whole appearance offered. 
"Do not hurry so!" cried Mary, every idea of alarm lost in contemplating her
				suffering helplessness. "I will not go yet, if you wish me to stay." They were now
				close together, and the shaking creature looked up in her face, with a soft, silly
				smile, that had all the woful innocence of imbecility. With a small, skinny hand
				that was delicatelypale, and perfectly clean, she took the end of Mary's silk
				scarfand gazed upon it in a sort of ecstasy. "Oh, fine! oh, pretty, pretty, pretty!"
				she exclaimed, smoothing and patting it with her hand, as if it had been a tame and
				favourite bird. "I think," she added, with a sagacious nod, "that I know where you
				come from. This is just the things, I know, that they wear in heaven — I think I
				know where you come from." Then breaking into what sounded like a genuine laugh, she
				again repeated, "I think I know where you come from — that is what the overlooker
				man said to me," she added, lowering her voice to a whisper, "when he caught me
				running away from the factory. It is not so very long ago — I can tell you all about
				it, if you would like to hear — and it is not like the rest of the things you know,"
				touching her forehead with her forefinger; "I don't tell that backwards and
				forwards, nonsense-fashion, like the other things I talk about — that was beat in
				upon my brain by the blacksmith, and nothing can ever take it out again, they say,
				till one of the angels does it in heaven. It used to pain me a good deal," she
				continued, taking off her hat, and laying her open palm on the top of her head, "but
				since I took to sitting on my throne there, as the folks call it, and gathered the
				dew morning and night to put upon it, the pain is a deal better."
"I cannot hear your story now," said Mary, gently, "because there is a poor sick girl
				on the side of the hill that wants me very bad — she comes from the factory too, and
				she is too ill to walk — can you tell me where I can find any body to help me carry
				her?"
"Come from the factory, is she? Dear, dear, dear, dear! She will be sure to die, you
				may depend upon it — they all do die, except me. Don't you fancy that you'll ever
				take her back alive, it was only I that could bear that, and I was burnt in the head
				for it, as I told you."
"I do not want to take her back," said Mary, "I want to help her. Where do you live?
				Are there any houses or people near this place? Now, be a good woman, and take me
				where I can find somebody to help us."
"Yes, I will," replied the poor creature, in a tone which convinced Miss Brotherton
				that she understood her, and at the same time beginning to hobble on before her
				towards the road.
 Nothing probably less pressing, and less hopeless than her present position could
				have tempted Mary to trust herself to such a guide; yet she felt a strange sort of
				confidence that the old woman knew what she was about, and though aware that the
				experiment was rather a  desperate one, determined to follow wherever
				her feeble guide should lead, certain, at least, that the distance could not be very
				great. 
There was, however, much more strength and power of locomotion in the little cripple
				than she gave her credit for. Having contrived to crawl through the grassy dyke that
				fenced the moor, she crossed the road obliquely, and making her way through a very
				imperfect hedge of furze and quickset, hobbled on across a bit of miserably arid
				stubble, which presently descended abruptly, and led to a tuft of stunted
				elder-bushes, besides which stood a small farm-house, with its cow-yard, barns, and
				ricks.
Surprised and delighted to find herself so near a human dwelling, Mary had hardly
				patience to restrain her steps to the pace of her poor guide, nevertheless she had
				not the heart to leave her, for there was an expression of pride and pleasure in the
				woman's eye as she turned round from time to time as they advanced, which she felt
				it would be most cruel to check by showing that she could do without her. So it was
				together that they reached the bottom of the steep descent, and together that they
				entered the kitchen of the farm-house, where a very decent-looking, middle-aged
				woman was engaged in preparing supper. She looked exceedingly surprised at the
				appearance of Miss Brotherton, and for a moment turned her eyes from her to her
				companion, and back again, with an air that was almost bewildered; but soon
				recovering herself she courtesied with much respect, and said, "I hope you haven't
				been scared, ma'am, by falling in with this poor cretur? She is as harmless as a
				baby."
"Oh, no!" replied Mary, "she has been very kind to me, for she has brought me here,
				where I should never have been able to get without her, the house is so completely
				concealed — and I want help, ma'am, very much indeed."
"You haven't met no accident, I hope?" said the good woman, kindly, and ceasing her
				notable operations, she drew forward a wooden chair for her guest to sit upon.
"Thank you very much," said the young lady, seating herself. "Yet it is not rest I
				most want. I have a little girl with me whom I have left by the side of the road
				that leads from the mills; she is too weak and ill to get on, and I hope you will be
				able to lend me some conveyance — a cart, a waggon, any thing to take her as far as
				the King's Head, three or four miles I suppose from hence, upon the turnpike-road: I
				would pay well for it."
"From the mills?" repeated the woman staring
"Yes; from the place called Deep Valley Mill," replied Mary, "perhaps rather more
				than a mile from here."
"Oh! ma'am, I know the Deep Valley Mill well enough," was the answer. "All Mr.
				Woodcomb's own butter and milk comes from here. That is not the difficulty. But we
				shan't like to have nothing to do with carrying away any child from there."
"You need fear nothing on that point," replied Miss Brotherton, eagerly, "I have paid
				for permission to bring this child away."
 "That alters the case for certain. But — I ask your pardon, ma'am,  —
				there is something very odd too, in such a lady as you walking away from the factory
				with one of the children." 
"Indeed I do not wonder at your saying so. But believe me, I tell you nothing but the
				truth when I assure you that I have permission, and have paid largely for it, to
				bring this child away. Our unfortunately attempting to walk was merely accident, and
				occasioned entirely by my foolish impatience to get away from the place before Mr.
				Smith, the miller, who took me there, thought his horse sufficiently rested to
				return."
"Mr. Smith, the miller? Then for certain all's right — for they be known for the
				greatest of friends, Mr. Woodcomb and he — and I dare say my husband, ma'am, would
				be proud to help you when he comes home. It's coming dark fast, and he won't be long
				I dare say."
"But I must go back to this poor child; I have left her with an old lady, who will, I
				fear, be greatly alarmed at being left so long," said Mary.
" Poor child! " repeated her limping guide, who, from the moment they had
				entered, had been reposing herself, by sitting on the floor, and had not spoken till
				now. " Poor child! — think of that! — and she comes from the factory! Think
				of speaking in that way of a factory child!"
"Hold your tongue, Sally, or I'll give you no porridge for supper," said the woman,
				but by no means harshly; and as she spoke, she dropped into the maniac's lap a piece
				of bread that lay in a plate upon the table.
"Had your factory child got this now," said poor Sally, nodding her head with a sort
				of boastful exultation, "she would not be so terrible bad. But there's nobody but me
				as gets this. I am the only old woman in the world; all the rest die young — and
				most of 'em," she added, in a whisper, "before they get away."
"Was this poor creature at the Deep Valley factory when she was young?" demanded Miss
				Brotherton.
"She tells you quite true, ma'am," replied the farmer's wife, resuming her cookery,
				which consisted in chopping up bacon, cabbage, and potatoes, for the frying-pan.
				"She talks nonsense about the moon sometimes, and is very wild when it comes to the
				full, but she never makes any blunder when she tells of her own troubles at the
				factory. She never varies the least bit in the world when she tells about her
				getting away, and being stopped, and taken back again, poor cretur. 'Tis only too
				true, that's the worst of it — and she has never been in her right mind since."
"I would hear her tell it willingly, and should listen to it with great interest,"
				said Miss Brotherton. "But at this moment I can think of nothing but those I have
				left."
"Whereabouts be they, ma'am?" demanded the farmer's wife.
 Mary described the spot very accurately. "Why, dear me! them surely must be the
				trees right against our gate," said the good woman, with great apparent
				satisfaction. "And if so be as I'm right, 'tis hardly more than a stone's throw from
				our back gate. I take it,  ma'am, as you walked by the lane just round
				our farm, and them trees as you speak of, bean't not one quarter of the distance as
				you have come." 
"In that case," replied Miss Brotherton, greatly comforted, "I have no doubt that we
				could get the poor little girl here, and then if you would give us leave to remain
				till your husband has contrived to procure some sort of conveyance for us, all our
				troubles would be over, and most gratefully will I repay you for your
				assistance."
"I will show you the way this moment, ma'am," said the woman, with great alacrity;
				and once more suspending her labours for the good man's supper, she prepared to
				attend the lady by taking off an external apron, and smoothing that which was below
				it.
Though not quite within a stone's throw , the spot to which Miss Brotherton
				was so anxious to return, was reached by a very short cut across the piece of
				meadow-ground on which the back part of the farm-house opened.
The joy of Mrs. Tremlett at seeing her was great indeed; and poor Fanny, refreshed by
				the interval of rest, declared herself quite able to walk "a good piece more."
"Poor little creature!" exclaimed good Mrs. Roberts, the farmer's wife; "she do look
				bad, sure enough! It is seldom or never that we gets a sight of the children at the
				mill, for they sends regular for what they wants, and bean't over fond of having any
				body go near 'em; — but she puts me strongly in mind of old Sally's stories to be
				sure!"
The little party reached the farm without difficulty, and then, indeed, as Mary had
				predicted, all their present troubles seemed over, for nothing could exceed the
				earnest kindness with which Mrs. Roberts administered to all their wants. Mrs.
				Tremlett's appearance and manner appeared to have entirely removed the sort of
				doubtful impression which poor Mary's hurried entrée had produced, and
				having been told that the little girl had been reclaimed by them as a relation, the
				whole adventure appeared to her as one of the deepest interest, and her sympathy and
				good-will were most fully excited.
Old Sally was sitting upon the floor exactly where they had left her. "Poor thing!"
				exclaimed Mary, "she has not moved an inch."
"Not she, poor soul," replied Mrs. Roberts, "I told her to bide still, and when we
				says that to her, she'd keep still, if we was to be away a whole day, I believe. Get
				up, Sally!" she added, good-humouredly. "There's brave woman! Look at that little
				girl, and tell the ladies what she puts you in mind of."
The expression of the poor withered, idiot face, that was turned upon Fanny Fletcher
				when this was uttered, was most touchingly sad and solemn. The gentle, silly look,
				which her countenance usually wore, was exchanged for one full of deep mysterious
				meaning. She drew herself towards the little girl with a sort of stealthy movement,
				as if afraid of being seen to approach her, and when quite close beside her,
				said,
 "You then have done as I did — you have run away? Poor, poor  little
				thing! Can't you guess what will come next? Poor little thing! They will catch you!
				hide where you will, they will catch you." 
"I have not run away," said Fanny, gently.
The maniac shook her head. "Don't you scream as I did, my poor lamb, for it's no
				good; they care no more for screams and groans than for the whirring of the
				spindles. But the screams went into my own ears, and I have never got rid of them
				since. I still hear them, all night long, when it is moon-time. Poor, poor little
				girl!"
"Come, come Sally — let her alone now, she is going to eat something."
And Mrs. Roberts completed the arrangements upon which she had been occupied since
				they entered, by placing chairs at the table on which bread, butter, and cheese,
				were placed.
Not even did the Deep-Valley apprentice feel more disposed to do justice to these
				preparations than did Miss Brotherton and her old servant. They had tasted nothing
				since breakfast, and when a bowl of fresh milk was added to the bread-and-butter,
				Mary gratefully assured her entertainer that she considered it as the most delicious
				supper she had ever eaten.
"Now that's different," said poor Sally, who had perched herself on a low stool close
				to Fanny Fletcher. "I never had any pretty creature like that, all clothed in
				heavenly trappings, giving me milk; but it will make no difference in the
				end — you must be dragged back again, poor little thing!"
"No, no — she won't be dragged back again," said Mrs. Roberts; "and there's a cup of
				milk for you — so now let the ladies eat in peace, Sally. You know it's time for you
				to be crawling home — the master will be here in no time, and maybe he will be after
				asking how many stones you have picked up to-day, so you had better be off."
The docile creature immediately shuffled off her stool, and prepared to depart.
"I should like to hear her describe her own adventures, which you say she does so
				faithfully," said Miss Brotherton. "Do you think you could persuade her to repeat
				her story to us?"
"Yes, yes, ma'am; she will do that quick enough; it is just what she likes best,"
				replied Mrs. Roberts; "except now and then when she is moody. Now, Sally, if you
				will behave yourself like a sensible woman, you may sit down again, and tell the
				ladies how you ran away from the mill, and was caught and brought back again, and
				all the rest of it."
The little cripple's eyes twinkled, and a gleam of intelligence flashed across her
				countenance with a sort of Will-o'-the-wisp brightness, as she took the fragment of
				a hat from her closely-shorn gray head, and reseated herself.
 "'Twas my knees as was the first of it," she began; "I couldn't bear it. The pain
				growed worse and worse, and my legs dipped down, and they strapped me harder and
				harder, and that was the reason that I couldn't bear it. So one day," she continued,
				in a deep  clear whisper, "one day when the 'prentices, and
				overlookers, and manager, and all was off for dinner, I stopped behind 'em, and
				nobody seed me — no, not one of 'em. And while they were at dinner, I slipped into
				the yard where the pigs bide, and then away again, all upon the sly, to the door
				where they takes the dirt out. I thought maybe, I might have the bolts to pull, but
				not a bit of it — there it stood wide open, with a barrow full of rubbish between
				the posts — that was fun!" 
And here the poor creature laughed that dreadful laugh which none but maniacs
				utter.
"But the fun lasted longer than that," she went on, "it lasted while I creeped along
				for a mile or more among the bushes as grows so rank t'other side the mill; and
				there I laid down at last in the midst of 'em, 'cause I heard a noise, and what d'ye
				think it was? What d'ye think the poor cretur heard with her heart galloping just at
				the bottom of her throat, for all the world like the flap — flap — flap of a
				fly-wheel?"
"Perhaps 'twas a dog barking, Sally," said Mrs. Roberts, humouring the maniac as she
				made a pause.
"No! 'twas not a dog barking, nor it wasn't a wolf, nor it wasn't a tiger; but it was
				something ten million of times worser than either — It — was — the —
				'printice-master!" replied Sally, in a slow deep whisper. "It was the divilish
				'printice-master with his eyes of fire, and his breath of flame. Oh-h! I feel him at
				my throat now!" and she clasped her withered neck with her pale thin hands,
				shuddering violently from head to foot.
"Speak soberly, Sally, and like a sensible body, or you must not go on, you know
				that," said Mrs. Roberts, interposing in a warning tone, which poor Sally seemed to
				understand, for though her breast still heaved with a panting movement, like one who
				had run a race, and was out of breath, she assumed an affected air of composure,
				putting her hands before her primly, and shutting her eyes.
"Yes, mississ, I know that," she replied, sedately, "I know that very well, and we
				won't trouble Joe ploughman to help us home this time; but I may go on, if I speak
				sensible, and like a wise woman, as I am?"
The farmer's wife nodded assent, and Sally continued more quietly.
 "It was the 'printice-master, and none but he as dragged me forth, head foremost,
				out of the bushes — very much like the butcher, you know, my dears, when he takes
				the little lamb's head between his two hard hands — I never sees that up at Tom
				Blake's shambles, without thinking of it. So he dragged me back again — and then you
				may guess how the strap went! But think of me! think what a spirit I must have had
				in those days, my dears — will you believe that I made up my mind to start again,
				though I hadn't a bit of unbruised skin upon my body? — I did though. Oh, dear! oh,
				dear! how I used to hear the birds singing in my ears o'nights, when I laid down,
				and made believe to sleep! But I don't fancy it was sleep, not right 
				wholesome sleep ever, as I got then; for I can mind now, yes I can, with all my
				moonshine, I can mind now, how I used to smell the grass, and see the dew shining,
				and hear the pretty sweet cows a mooing, and I all the while shut up in a stone
				prison-house — that was the divil tempting me, wasn't it? But I didn't start again
				for two whole years though, — 'cause why, I never found no chance for it; and by
				that time my legs was shocking bad, and if it was the divil as made me run,
				he ought to have sent me a stick to help me — for, oh, dear! I crawled dreadful slow
				— and then — " 
"Come, come, Sally," interrupted Mrs. Roberts, "I won't have all that at full length,
				or else we shall have you off again; make an end, there's a fine woman. Tell the
				ladies about the shutting up, and then go home and to bed, for 'tis time."
Miss Brotherton ceased to wonder, as she had first done, at the chartered licence
				which the crazy cripple seemed to enjoy, when she observed the perfect docility with
				which she obeyed every word and look of the farmer's wife. She now resumed her
				story, exactly at the word commanded.
"Yes I was shut up, my dears — I shall have soon done now, for I am coming to the
				black gap, as I call it, and I always stops there — but where do you think they shut
				me up? In this room, or that room, or t'other room, perhaps? Not a bit of it. They
				shut me up in a little narrow place, not much bigger than a grave, and it was dark —
				dark — dark, all but one little narrow slip, and there was no light comed through
				that at first; but by and by, after I had been days and days locked in, I heard a
				horrid, horrid lumbering noise, and then I saw a flash of light through the narrow
				slip, for all the world like the light of a candle — and the light of a candle it
				was too, and what do you think it showed me? Crippled as I was, I managed to
				scramble high enough to peep — there was beams, on bricks or something, and what do
				you think I saw?"
The poor creature began shaking again, but on Mrs. Roberts holding up her finger, she
				seemed to make a strong effort to control herself, and once more slipping off her
				stool she drew close to Miss Brotherton, and in a low rapid voice, hurried through
				the remainder of her narrative.
"I saw," said she, "the master's wife laid stone dead upon a truckle-bed, amost as
				close to me as I to you — think of that! Stone dead! Stiffened, stark, and ghastly,
				and blue! There was a candle that flaed full upon her dead face; but they as brought
				her was run away — they couldn't bear it, I'm sure they couldn't bear it, and I was
				left alone to look upon it, and I couldn't run away; but I could not bear it either!
				and then it was that I screamed — hush! I must not scream now, you know!"
Here she stopped, putting her hands before her eyes, and remaining perfectly still
				for a minute, and then added with more composure,
 "After that came the black gap, and I don't know any thing more about it; only that
				I watch the sun go to bed every night, and I have been going on praying for years
				and years, all the time I have been  growing into an old woman, that he
				would please not to wake me in the morning." 
"Here's the master, Sally!" said Mrs. Roberts; "so take yourself off, there's a good
				woman. Here's your mug of porridge; put on your hat steady, and wish the ladies a
				good night."
Again she was most docilely obeyed, and in another moment poor Sally was gone, and
				the hardworking master of the premises occupied her place. The situation and wants
				of his unexpected guests were speedily explained to him, and his best assistance as
				speedly promised. While he devoured a hasty supper, one of his farm-horses was put
				into the shafts of a jockey-cart, and in less than an hour after his return, the
				comforted party set out by the light of a friendly moon, and were safely jolted to
				the King's Head, without having been overtaken by the treacherous miller, who
				probably preferred sharing the jovial supper, in which his good friend Woodcomb
				indulged on this memorable evening, to forsaking it for the purpose of overtaking
				the ladies, from whom it was derived — as there seemed but little chance of drawing
				any thing more from the same source.
Great was the joy of Mrs. Prescot at seeing her guests return; for their long
				absence, together with the nature of the business on which they were engaged had
				caused the good woman to torment herself with many dark forebodings. Nevertheless,
				she was well prepared to receive them, and nothing was wanting that she could
				furnish towards refreshing the adventurers after their fatigue.
But, alas! it was only then; it was only after the anxiety, and the agitation of the
				enterprise were over, that poor Mary fully remembered how abortive that enterprise
				had been; and then she wept, wept bitterly, as she thought of the load of anguish
				she had to carry home to Michael's mother and brother. Yet as she listened to little
				Fanny's tearful narration of all that had passed between them, during the weeks the
				had worked together, she felt that when the first dreadful pang should be over,
				there would be something like consolation for them in listening to it also; and as
				she studied the delicate and expressive features of the pretty creature she had
				rescued, and watched the sort of timid, doubting hope, that by degrees took place of
				the nervous, heart-struck look, that had been so painfully legible in her sweet face
				when first she saw her, it was impossible not to feel that while deploring the loss
				of one object of benevolence, she had to rejoice for having found another.
Luckily for the respectability of their appearance, in setting forth on their
				homeward travels the following morning, the active Mrs. prescot was enabled, by the
				aid of the heiress's magic pocket-book, to procure from a neighbour a suit of decent
				apparel for the little orphan. The same freely-flowing source supplied wherewithal
				to reward all the friendly offices performed by the host and hostess of the Kings's
				Head, and in addition, they were left in possession of a romance which was likely
				enough, from the frequency with which it was repeated, to furnish a legend to the
				little village to the end of time.
 One single adventure occurred to Miss Brotherton on her way home, 
				which though forming a very isolated episode in the history of her journey, shall be
				recounted, because the fact which it brought to her knowledge is one that well
				deserves publicity. 
The heiress varied her road homewards, by driving through a village which, were it
				not infested by the plague-spot of a factory, might be considered as one of the most
				attractive in Derbyshire. At one point the road passes through a rocky defile of
				such wild beauty, that Mary, who was equally unacquainted with fine scenery, and
				capable of enjoying it, called to the postboy to stop, that she might get out and
				walk up the long ascent, in order the more thoroughly to enjoy the widely-spreading
				landscape it commanded. Neither of her companions accompanied her. Mrs. Tremlett
				consenting, nothing loth, to to remain in the post-chaise, upon the steepness of the
				road being pointed to her, while little Fanny, though in her heart longing to spring
				after her benefactress, replied to the observation, that she was not yet strong
				enough to climb, by a look that spoke more of gratitude, than regret.
It was alone, therefore, that Mary Brotherton started forward, her active steps soon
				leaving the carriage behind; when cutting short the spiral ascent by making her way
				through the underwood which clothed the bank, she soon found herself high above the
				road, and on spot of great beauty. After lingering here for a few minutes she
				proceeded. when hearing the ever attractive sound of rushing waters, she again
				stopped, and then, guided by her ear, followed where it led, till she reached an
				opening, not far from the high-road, but apart from it, where, instead of the
				mountain cascade she had expected, a spectacle greeted her that for an instant
				seemed to petrify every nerve, and the bounding elastic movement which had brought
				her within sight of it, was changed to the rigid stillness of Marble. A man, almost
				ferocious in his aspect, from the squalid, unshorn, brutal negligence of decency
				which it betrayed, was supporting in his arms, and on his of of ten or eleven years
				old, whose ghastly countenance showed plainly that death was busy at his heart.
				Before the rock from whence flowed the gushing stream, whose sound had brought Miss
				Brotherton to the spot, stood what looked like the fragment of a rude pillar, and on
				this stone the father had rested the wasted from of his dying child. Before him
				stood a little girl gazing on the boy with a mixture of infant fear a sisterly love,
				as she tended a bowl, filled from the spring, to his lips.
"He is very ill!" said Mary, addressing the father, "can I go any where to get help
				for you?"
The man, who had the fragment of a pipe in his mouth, and who looked rather
				bewildered, and fiercely angry, than oppressed by sorrow, stared at her, but
				answered not a word.
"What is the matter with him?" said Miss Brotherton, addressing the little girl.
 "He be worked down," replied the child, sobbing. "We have been at long hours for
				four weeks, and Dick couldn't stand it — father have carried him to and from mill
				for a week — but he couldn't stand  it. Mother said, when we started,
				that he looked as if he'd never come back alive; but he'd have had to pay double
				fine if so be as father had left him to bide at home, so he carried him to mill; but
				though they strapped him, and strapped him, he couldn't stand to his work. and he
				have been lying in the mill-yard till father comed to take him." 
This horrible statement was uttered amidst tears and sobs, but poor Mary lost not a
				word of it; and as her very soul sickened at the tale, she felt tempted to believe
				that she was doomed to witness every circumstance that could most painfully recall
				the source whence all her greatness flowed.
With clasped hands, and streaming eyes, she stood silently watching the gasping
				breath of this young victim of unnatural labour. The boy's eyes fixed themselves on
				the face of his little sister. He might be listening to her history of his early
				fate — or he might be consciously taking a last look at what he loved. In either
				case the effort demanded more strength than was left him — his eyes closed, a
				shivering movement passed through all his frame, and then he became still. The
				quick, short, unequal heaving of the breast was seen no more, and Mary hid her eyes
				as the mysterious change, which no human being can gaze upon unmoved, come upon the
				stiffening features. It was rather instinct than feeling, which prompted her even at
				that awful moment to proffer what she had learned to know would be felt as
				consolation, did one starving member of a family alone survive amidst the dying and
				the dead of a whole race. Without venturing again to look at the father and his son
				she dropped into the bowl, which the little girl still held, what she hated to think
				would soon turn natural sorrow into unnatural forgetfulness of it: but she had no
				power to serve them more effectually, and hastily turning into the road, she awaited
				the slow arrival of the post-chaise in a state of mind which left no faculty at
				leisure to enjoy and longer the hills and valleys for whose sake she had left
				it.
From this time the journey homeward proceeded without accident or adventure of any
				kind, and Mary would probably have shared the pleasure so energetically expressed by
				Mr. Tremlett at being restored to the luxurious tranquillity of Milford Park, had
				not the heavy news she carried to the poor Armstrongs made her dread the day that
				would follow her reaching it.
But how she got through that painful day, and all that resulted from it — how little
				Fanny Fletcher fared in her new and most strange home, and whether her patroness had
				most reason to bless or deplore the sudden movement which had caused her to hazard
				the blending thus the destiny of one so utterly unknown, with her own must all be
				reserved for future narration, as the adventures of Michael Armstrong, of necessity,
				draw the pen of his historian elsewhere.
