 CHAPTER XXXII. 
MR. AUGUSTUS DOWLING GIVES HIS SISTER MARTHA NOTICE TO QUIT THE PREMISES; WHICH
				OCCASIONS MICHAEL TO APPEAR IN A NEW CHARACTER — A LONG JOURNEY TAKEN BY NOVICES;
				BUT THEY DO NOT LOSE THEIR WAY, AND ARRIVE AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT LAST.

				The circumstances which immediately followed are not of sufficient
				consequence to detain us long. Our old acquaintance, Mr. Augustus, now Major Dowling
				of the — regiment, quartered at the distance of a day's journey, was sent for to get
				through the melancholy business going on in his paternal mansion, as well as he
				could; to give orders respecting the funeral, and to make himself as thoroughly
				acquainted with the real state of his family affairs as circumstances would permit.
				Michael, meanwhile, had taken leave of the weeping Martha without having given her
				the slightest hint as to the means by which Sir Matthew's body had been released.
				Had he not known that the Mr. Augustus, whose kicks and pinches he so well
				remembered, was expected to arrive for the protection of his sister, and of whatever
				property they might still call their own, he would hardly have made up his mind to
				leave her, however conscious he might have been of the doubtful propriety of
				offering such protection as he could give. But it was evident that the poor girl
				thought he had better go, though it was equally so that she parted from him with the
				greatest reluctance.
 "You shall hear from me," she said, "my good Michael, and if it should never be my
				good fortune to see you more, remember me with the same forgiving kindness that you
				have shown through all the dreadful scenes you have witnessed here. You have a good
				and generous heart, Michael, and though I know you suffered much by being  present at them, you will always like to remember how greatly your
				presence helped to support your early friend in her great affliction." 
But it was not destined that these sad scenes should be the last in which Michael and
				his early friend were to be thrown together. In little more than a week after the
				death of Sir Matthew, and while Michael was still anxiously waiting at Fairly for
				such tidings from her as might put him at liberty to set off without further delay
				for Nice, a packet reached him from Dowling Lodge, containing two letters. One was
				from Martha, and contained these words:
"Dear Michael,
"My brother tells me that all of us, who are old enough, must seek our own living,
				for that there is nothing left to support us. Myself especially, he says, must, to
				use his own words, look about me directly, as my behaviour to my family has never
				been such as to justify my looking to any of them for assistance. This amounts to my
				being actually turned out of doors, an exigency which at this moment leaves me no
				other resource than what is afforded by the enclosed letter. Read it, Michael, and
				let me know if you are willing to give me your assistance and protection in reaching
				the amiable writer of it. I could never have accepted, even for a day, the
				hospitality she so generously offer, could I not prove to her, by bringing you with
				me, that the sad subject which interrupted our friendship some seven or eight years
				ago, could never again be a source of pain to either of us.
"My dear father's last act towards me, which was, as I think I told you, the placing
				a few hundred pounds in my hands for the express purpose of my leaving the country,
				will enable me to undertake this long journey without being a burden upon you, The
					green pocket-book , Michael, so well known to Mr. Parsons and Lady
				Clarissa, as the repository of my father's ready money, and so disgracefully
				struggled for during his last moments, will prove of no value to its possessors
				beyond its morocco cover and its silken lining; for the notes which he took from it
				to give to me, were the last he ever placed in it. My messenger has orders to wait
				for your reply. If it will suit you immediately to accompany me to Nice — my first
				stage shall be to the little inn at Fairly, which you mentioned to me. I fear you
				will find me a weak and troublesome traveller; but I think I have been improving in
				health ever since I learnt that I had not your death to answer for.
"Your grateful friend, "Martha Dowling."
The other letter was from Miss Brotherton, and ran thus:
 "Need I tell you, my dearest Martha, with what feelings I received the news of your
				present painful position? Your father's marriage with Lady Clarissa was, for your
				sake, a source of great sorrow to me, for I was certain that your domestic happiness
				would be destroyed by it; and this most unexpected event of your father's bankruptcy
				makes  me feel quite sure that you have no longer a comfortable home in
				England. Come then to me, my dear Martha! The painful estrangement which grew
				between us, just when I was beginning to know and value your excellent qualities,
				has long been a source of very painful regret to me, because I am aware that I
				judged you unfairly, and pronounced that judgment harshly. Be generous, then, and
				prove that you can forgive this, by immediately giving me the pleasure of receiving
				you as my guest. When we are together, we will consult about what will be best for
				the future; but at any rate I have the satisfaction of knowing that the climate to
				which I am inviting you is likely to be beneficial to your health during the
				approaching winter: come to me, then, dear friend, without delay. On the other side
				you will find the route sketched that I recommend you for your journey. My quarters
				are roomy enough to accommodate either man or maid-servant, or both, if it will suit
				you to be so accompanied. 
"Ever, my dear Martha, "Affectionately yours, " Mary
					Brotherton ."
The consequence of this packet was another metamorphosis on the part of Michael, "She
				shall not think," said he, addressing Mr. Bell, "that my respect for her is lessened
				because her fortune has fallen. I will wait upon her with faithful duty and most
				grateful affection: but she was born in a palace, and I in a cabin; and I will not,
				especially just now, obtrude myself upon her as a companion. As her servant I hope I
				may be useful to her, and it is in that capacity that I shall attend her."
 There was so much good feeling shown in this project, that Mr. Bell could not oppose
				it, whatever he might think of its necessity; and Michael, therefore, gave the
				astonished Martha the meeting at the little inn she had named, in the character of a
				very neat and respectable-looking man-servant. Her faithful Betty Parker, who had
				consented to be the companion of her journey, was in the room with her when Michael
				made his appearance at the door, to receive her orders. The cautious manner in which
				he made her comprehend his purpose, and the nature of the office he had assumed,
				suggested to her the propriety of not discussing it in the presence of the
				well-contented Betty, who was exceedingly comforted by discovering that the young
				man whom her mistress had informed her would travel with them, was to do so as her
				fellow-servant, as she by no means felt herself capable of becoming "servant of all
				work" to a young lady travelling through foreign countries, of which she had never
				even heard the names. But having contrived to dismiss her female attendant on an
				errand, Martha began to remonstrate with her faithful squire upon the great mistake
				he had made in fancying that she had ever thought of travelling with him in any
				other capacity than that of a friend. All she said, however, was in vain. Michael,
				though in a manner the most humbly respectful, persisted in his purpose; and the
				almost destitute girl was therefore constrained to set off upon her travels in a
				style which she  felt to be very unfitting to her situation. Her
				conscience, however, could not reproach her for this, for most assuredly she could
				not help it. 
Many were the letters, and various the mementos of affection, intrusted by Mr. and
				Mrs. Bell to the care of Michael for their dearly-beloved Mary Brotherton. Nor was
				there an individual of whose welfare he thought it would please her to hear, whom he
				did not visit to receive their loving blessings for the benefactress who,
				notwithstanding her wide wanderings, had never failed to remember the wants of all
				who had faithfully served her, or in any way become dependent on her bounty.
These duties completed, and a farewell of most grateful affection uttered to the
				amiable clergyman and his excellent wife, Michael set off upon his long journey with
				feelings of hope, joy, confidence, fear, diffidence, and trembling affection, — all
				so strongly mixed together in his bosom that, had his life depended on it, he could
				not himself have told which it was that most frequently preponderated. Yet,
				altogether, his state of mind was very delightful: the novelty and excitement of
				journeying, so pregnant of enjoyment to most of us, was most especially captivating
				to him, whose education had been little more than the unchecked development of
				imagination, and of that keen observation of all surrounding objects which his
				shepherd life had taught him.
The first painful interruption to the state of felicity, arose from his finding
				himself under the necessity of confessing to Martha that he had no more money
				wherewith to pay their way. Aware that in the performance of his self-appointed
				office Michael would have to pay every thing, and keep a regular account of it; and
				aware also that the money he had received from her would enable him to do this,
				without giving him the additional trouble of daily settlements with her, she had
				merely said, a minute or two before they set off, "You will be kind enough to be my
				banker, Michael, during the journey, and we will settle accounts at the end of
				it."
For just one week from the day of their leaving Fairly, he was able to do this; but
				then the little remnant of his treasure failed him, and great as was his repugnance
				to the measure, he was compelled by dire necessity to confess that nearly the whole
				of her generous gift had gone to — "to satisfy the rapacity of Mr. Parsons."
It would be hardly possible for one human being to be more grateful to another than
				poor Martha felt to her young attendant after this disclosure. She remembered the
				agony which he had made to cease; she remembered, too, her state of utter incapacity
				even to comprehend, and still less to avert the horrors that surrounded her; and,
				spite of all Michael's respectful efforts to induce her to perform her allotted
				character properly, she never from the hour of this disclosure treated him otherwise
				than as a dear and valued friend.
 As their journey approached its termination, however (to which period Michael had
				looked with peculiar anxiety, as that most important to the dignity of Martha),
				there was one argument, and one only, by which he was able to coax her into letting
				him make his first appearance before Miss Brotherton in the character of her
				servant;  and this was his very natural wish to ascertain whether
				Edward and Fanny would recognise him. 
It was therefore still in the dress, and with the demeanour of a servant, that the
				poor factory-boy, now become a tall and very handsome young man, armed himself with
				courage to enter the presence of his brother, and once more to draw near to the dear
				and gentle little being whom he had so fondly loved during the miserable period they
				had passed together at the Deep Valley. It had been previously agreed between
				himself and Martha, that when she sent for him, it should be for the purpose of
				giving him some long and particular instructions respecting the luggage he was to
				get from the custom-house, in order to give him time to look, and be looked at,
				before the moment of discovery should arrive.
The young man trembled like an aspen-leaf as he laid his hand upon the lock of the
				door, the opening of which would bring him face to face with his brother. And
				perchance he might have indulged in a longer interval of preparation, had not the
				voice of Martha distinctly pronounced the words "Come in!" Further delay was out of
				the question; he pushed forward the door, and entered.
The first figure that his eyes fell upon was that of a young lady — small, and of
				very delicate proportions — whose head, which was hanging over some employment as
				the door opened, was raised as he entered, displaying to him a very lovely face, and
				a pair of eyes whose dark brilliance almost made the beholder wink. Could that be
				Fanny Fletcher? No. Yet that it should be Miss Brotherton seemed more impossible
				still. Like all young people who have been separated from some one considerably
				older than themselves, ever since the period when this difference made one of them
				appear fully grown, while the other was still a child, Michael fancied that in Miss
				Brotherton he should see an elderly person, no more like a pretty girl, than he was
				himself. But Mary Brotherton had not fully completed her twenty-ninth year; and
				happening, moreover, to be very peculiarly young-looking both in face and figure, it
				was not very wonderful that he should doubt of her identity; for it was in truth
				Mary Brotherton, and no other, whose bright and laughing loveliness made him turn
				his admiring eyes away, in search of something dearer, though not more
				beautiful.
 At the end of the sofa-table, at which Miss Brotherton sat with Martha Dowling
				beside her, was a young female figure which presented only a profile to his gaze —
				But that was enough — the delicate oval face, the sweet regular small features, the
				glossy light brown hair parted Madonna-like upon the ivory brow, and the long
				eyelash that seemed to rest upon her cheek as she read, all proclaimed that he
				looked upon the same gentle lovely creature whose soft voice had whispered
				"patience!" when his spirit, but for her, had died within him. At the sight of this
				sweet vision, that in shadowy and uncertain outline had so often visited his
				reveries, Michael's manhood almost forsook him, and large tears gathered in his
				eyes, which he was fain to hide by turning round again and performing some
				blundering  operation with the lock of the door. Martha played her part
				admirably, appearing to be the most exceedingly particular young lady, about boxes,
				bags, and desks, that ever travelled. 
"Remember, I beg," she said, "that you see yourself to the opening of every package.
				Don't let them touch a single article that you do not watch the whole time; and be
				sure that every thing is locked again — and on no account forget the covers, or
				mismatch them — and remember particularly — " et cætera, et cætera , and so
				she ran on at the imminent risk of being classed by her clever friend Mary as the
				veriest fidget that ever arrived to bore a peaceable household and all in order to
				give her poor companion time to recover himself, and see distinctly what was before
				him.
But Michael could not recover himself, nor could he even find courage to look about
				him. It was a large saloon that Miss Brotherton occupied, and the agitated young man
				rather felt that there was a gentleman occupied with books and papers at a distant
				table, than saw him. Yet to see him he was determined, if his life were to be the
				forfeit; and turning his head with an eye as troubled as that of Hamlet, when
				tremblingly following his father's spirit, he stood at last with clasped hands,
				protruded head, and features almost convulsed with emotion, when he had an
				uninterrupted view of his brother's clam and beautiful countenance.
Edward was very busily employed, and unconsciously submitted himself to this
				examination without raising his eyes, or moving in any way; but Miss Brotherton's
				ear caught something like a sob from the silent object of all Martha's eloquence,
				and suddenly looking up perceived Michael in the attitude described, but stealthily,
				and perhaps unknowingly approaching Edward's table, while the tears he could no
				longer check, rolled down his manly cheek.
There are some individuals of the human family gifted with such quickness of
				perception, and rapidity of inference, that their faculties act with the certainty
				of instinct, and the brilliancy of inspiration. Miss Brotherton was one of those;
				and after looking for a minute or two at Michael, quite as earnestly as Michael
				looked at Edward, she sprung from the sofa, pushed the table that stood before it
				with such violence from her as nearly to overset it, and rushing forward laid her
				hand upon his arm, exclaiming, "For mercy's sake tell me young man, who you are, and
				where you come from?"
On hearing these words in a voice unusually loud and agitated, Edward rose hastily
				from his seat, and approached Miss Brotherton as if to protect her from some
				threatened danger; but turning towards him, she held up her hand as if to prevent
				his hostile approach, and said, "Stay Edward, stay! Look at him! Good Heaven! Look
				at him, dearest Edward, and tell me who he is like!"
 Thus addressed, Edward did look at his brother, and for a moment with a countenance
				that seemed to say Miss Brotherton had lost her wits — but suddenly Michael smiled
				at him as he caught his puzzled eye, and then he started, and almost gasped for
				breath — and his  distracted eyes fixed themselves on the agitated face
				before him as if they would read in it the history of years. 
"Edward! — Teddy!" cried Michael, opening his arms, and making a step in advance.
In the next instant the brothers were locked in each other's arms, and Miss
				Brotherton drew back, and gazed upon them from a distance as if the very ground that
				sustained hearts under the influence of such feelings was holy — while Fanny
				Fletcher, rose and sat down, and rose again, checking the feeling that would have
				sent her to stretch forth a hand of welcome to her old friend, by telling herself
				that no hand, no voice but Edward's could be cared for then. And perhaps she was
				right; for it is certain that for several minutes, neither Edward nor Michael were
				fully conscious where they were, nor who they might be that were near them. Once and
				again each beating heart was strained against the brother heart, and then, their
				right hands clasped, and the left placed, each on the other's shoulder, "They fell
				to such perusal of the face," that now, after eight cruel years of absence, was once
				more beaming with love and sympathy before their eyes, that it must have been a very
				heartless and soulless being who should have come between them.
Though such a history as Michael's might well have occupied more than one long
				summer's day in the telling, to ears so greedy of every circumstance connected with
				it as were those of Edward, yet it is wonderful how very short a time sufficed to
				point out the keystone of the arch, upon which the whole wonderful fabric hung, and
				then it was that Fanny Fletcher's voice was heard exclaiming in a burst of
				uncontrollable emotion,
"Then it was I that caused it all! Oh! Miss Brotherton, it was I who kept him in that
				horrid place for years! Had I not told you he was dead, it would have been he who
				would have been the happy object of your bounty, instead of me! Oh! how can he ever
				forgive me?"
This was uttered with such agitated rapidity, that though there was more than one
				present, who would have been ready enough to contradict the self-accusing statement,
				she gave them no time for it. But it sufficed to draw Michael from the side of his
				brother, and to place him at hers; and though this terrible thought drew a shower of
				tears from Fanny's eyes, notwithstanding the exceeding happiness which was at the
				very same moment throbbing at her heart; it may be that there could not have been
				found a more effectual mode of at once bringing back the long-parted friends to the
				same tone of familiar intercourse in which they had parted, as this sincere
				self-recrimination on one part, and the warm pleading against its injustice, on the
				other. For some minutes this lasted without being interrupted by a word from any
				one; for both Mary and Edward found, sufficient occupation in looking at them both,
				and then exchanging expressive glances of thanksgiving and happiness with each
				other. But at length, upon Fanny's saying with a fresh burst of tears,

"Oh, Michael! Michael! your eloquence is all in vain. You will never, never teach me
				to forget that I have been enjoying the blessed destiny intended for you, and that
				by means of words uttered by myself."
Upon her saying this, the happy Mary Brotherton pushed a low tabouret before the
				reunited friends, and seating herself upon it, took Fanny's hand in hers, and said,
				"If you would not cry about it, my Fanny, I should think it was a mighty pretty
				exhibition of true feeling and false argument that we were witnessing; but if you
				really intend to be unhappy, we shall all range ourselves immediately on Michael's
				side, and laugh you to scorn for your sophistry, and the deplorable confusion you
				are making between cause and effect. I should like to know, little lady, how much it
				would have profited our Michael had you refused to answer when I inquired at the
				Deep Valley factory, if you knew aught about him? had you, while firmly believing he
				was dead, declined to state your belief, lest you might be mistaken, what would it
				have availed him, darling? Could he have crept down before us from his sick bed to
				settle the question? No, dear casuist you know better. Your looks are much more wise
				than your words, Fanny; for even now, though you pretend to shake your head, your
				truth-telling eyes confess that you have not another syllable to say."
"But is it not singular," said Martha, who had been contemplating the scene with
				unspeakable delight, "is it not singular that Michael should twice have been the
				victim of words, uttered by such very friendly lips?"
"Singular, dear Martha?" replied Mary; "is not every event connected with a hero of
				romance, of necessity and by immutable prescription, singular? And whom did Fate and
				Fortune ever fix upon more unmistakably to fill that distinguished position in
				society, than Michael Armstrong? Why are we all here together? Wholly and solely
				because Michael Armstrong saved Lady Clarissa Shrimpton from the terrors inspired by
				a cow — is it not so, dear friends? Can any of you deny that all the exceeding
				happiness that blesses us at this moment, has arisen from that most marvellously
				silly adventure? And shall we any of us quarrel at the steps (though some of them it
				must be confessed were rough enough), which have led from that nousensical
				beginning, to an end that has made us all so very happy? Yes! Michael Armstrong is a
				hero; he is our hero; he is the crowning blessing that is come to make us all thank
				Heaven for having brought us every one from greater and less degrees of misery, to
				very perfect pahpiness, and shall we not welcome him with smiles, instead of tears,
				Fanny?"
Nothing could have been more admirably suited to the effect which the happy heiress
				meant to produce, than these words. How, after this, could Michael shrink, as he had
				expected to do, from the humiliating comparison between Edward and Fanny, with
				himself? Or how could Fanny persist in weeping, when her own heart, as well as those
				of all around her, was so cheeringly called upon to rejoice? Nothing of the sort was
				any longer thought of by either.

Without very well knowing how it came about, Michael, of all the multitude of
				contending feelings which had been lately so cruelly assailing him, being as they
				were, of that most harassing race begotten between fear and hope, was now conscious
				of only one, and that one was happiness unmixed. His frank and generous nature could
				no longer harbour any doubts as to the place he held in the affections of those whom
				he had lately thought of, as almost too high and too happy to remember him. He was
				with them, he was of them. If a thought of the future glanced athwart the delicious
				present, it came accompanied by a buoyant consciousness that there was that within
				him which would enable him to redeem lost time, and that whatever those he loved
				wished him to be, THAT he should have power to become.
Nor was an answering confidence wanting in those who wearied not of gazing at his
				bright, expressive features, and his noble form. Fanny thought that he was exactly
				every thing she would have dreamed he must be, had she ventured to dream that he
				existed at all. Marry thought that she read capacity which promised power to become
				all that Edward could wish him to be — and she was not disposed to wish for more —
				and Edward himself thought and felt that had he power to choose a brother from among
				all the nations of the earth, and the noblest of them, Michael would have been the
				one he would have selected.
"And where is my dear, good Tremlett?" said Miss Brotherton. "In the midst of all
				this rare felicity she must not be left out. She has shared our mourning for your
				loss, dear Michael, and shame it were she should not share our joy at finding
				you."
"Shall I go and call her hither?" cried Fanny, rising."
"No! that you shall not, Fanny," replied Miss Brotherton. "I will not trust you. It
				was I who dragged the dear good soul from post to pillar, in order to find you,
				Michael. — It was I who never let her know rest, night nor day, because you were
				not, and who but I shall bring her the glad tidings of your restoration?"
But truly delighted as was Mary Brothrton at the idea of the pleasure which she well
				knew this unlooked-for arrival would cause her old friend, she would not let her
				taste it without the addition of a little mystification; and accordingly she led her
				into the room which contained the happy party, with no other preparation than
				telling her that there was a young Englishman in the saloon, to whom she must come
				and be introduced, because he was a countryman.
To this the tractable old lady agreed, without testifying any very lively emotion;
				but when she had got into the midst of the group, and witnessed the general
				exaltation of spirits which seemed to possess them all, after looking and listening
				for a little while she could not help whispering to Fanny, "Do you know, my dear,
				who that young man is? I never saw Miss Brotherton — no! nor Mr. Armstrong either —
				seem to be so extraordinarily intimate with any one before, just at first
				sight."
In reply to this Fanny only hid her face, and laughed, for she dared not trust her
				voice to give the information required.

"How very odd," murmured the old lady, drawing her knitting from her bag.
"It is very odd, Mrs. Tremlett, very odd indeed," said Mary, "there is no denying it.
				But the fact is, that Mr. Armstrong has taken such an extraordinary fancy to this
				young man, that I really think I shall be obliged to ask him to live with us. There
				will be plenty of room, you know, in my Rhenish castle."
The old lady said not a word in reply, but she looked puzzled, and vexed, and shook
				her head, as much as to say that it was not like her young mistress to talk such
				nonsense as that. So in her own defence Mary was obliged to explain the mystery, and
				as happy an old woman was nurse Tremlett, as she looked and listened, as ever tasted
				joy from the contemplation of it in others.
