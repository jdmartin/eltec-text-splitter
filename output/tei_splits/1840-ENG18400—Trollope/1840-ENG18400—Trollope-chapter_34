 CHAPTER XXXIII. 
A TÊTE'-À-TÊTE — A SECOND — A THIRD — A MYSTERIOUS RESULT — CONCLUSION.

				Delightful as was this state of mind to all that shared it, it
				could not last. Michael was too much in earnest in his dread of being a burden upon
				Miss Brotherton to permit many days to pass before he begged her to let him converse
				with her for a few moments in private; and Mary, who had already seen quite enough
				to convince her that the affection which Michael and Fanny had conceived for each
				other, amidst the dreary misery of the Deep Valley Mill, was not likely to be
				forgotten in the gay happiness of Nice, fully anticipated an humble confession, on
				the part of Michael, that he could not be happy without her permission to become the
				acknowledge lover of her charming friend and protégée, and very amiable, frank, and
				noble-minded, did she consider it in him, thus openly to avow the truth at once. But
				nothing could be further from the thoughts of Michael than making any such
				confession as this; which, it may be observed, is by no means saying that his heart
				was either innocent or unconscious of the presumptuous passion she attributed to
				it.
Greatly, however, did Miss Brotherton underrate the young man's character when she
				conceived that the gracious favour with which she had received him, could generate
				in his heart a wish to ask for more.
"It is taking a great liberty, madam," began Michael.
 "If you love me, do not call me madam, my dear Michael," she replied. "Do you not
				perceive that Edward and Fanny both call me  Mary? and till I had
				taught them to do so I never could feel that they quite understood the true spirit
				of my attachment towards them, or the mode and manner of existence which I have
				imagined for myself, and which must have fallen to the ground, if I had found them
				incapable of being to me, or letting me be to them, all that I wished and desired.
				You must not, dearest Michael, come and shake this perfect and delightful union,
				introducing forms and ceremonies foreign to our manners, and our feelings. Pray do
				not look so grave, dear friend! Promise to offend thus no more, and I will cease to
				scold you." 
"Dearest Miss Brotherton!" said Michael. But this did not satisfy the
					exigeante lady, who shook her head, and held up her finger in reproof.
				"Dearest Mary! then — " he resumed, colouring brightly, and with a smile that made
				her think she could trace a family likeness to Edward, "the greatest wish I have on
				earth is to become such as you might approve, and if I shrink from the dear and
				precious familiarity which must make Edward and Fanny so happy, think not that I am
				incapable of loving you as perfectly as they do; but remember, dearest lady! that
				however humble their origin, the very circumstance of their having been your
				honoured companions for years, is of itself sufficient to raise them to such a tone
				of thinking and of manners, as may, in some sort, justify their using the privilege
				you so graciously afford. But, alas! You must know too well that the case is far
				different with me. The overflowing joy of our first meeting, naturally broke down,
				as it were, all inequalities, all boundaries, and I certainly felt, and perhaps
				spoke, as if I too were one of the accomplished little circle that might call this
				earthly paradise their home. But reflection will come, most generous Mary! if not
				amidst the happy intoxicating moments of the day, it will make itself a voice in the
				quiet reasoning meditations of the night, and so loudly has this voice been heard by
				me, that I cannot — no, in spite of all the happiness that surrounds me, I cannot
				live on thus, an idle, ignorant dependant on your bounty."
 The heiress was half vexed, but more than half pleased by this trembling address,
				the deep sincerity of which was testified by the working features of a countenance
				more than commonly expressive of all that passed within. She had enjoyed so much
				genuine happiness since that arrival of Michael, and had watched with pleasure so
				exquisite the happiness of Edward and Fanny, that she almost trembled at the idea of
				any change; yet she knew the boy was right; she knew that he ought to apply himself
				immediately and strenuously to such studies as were most necessary for the redeeming
				the time he had lost, and so well aware was she of this, that, notwithstanding her
				unwillingness to part with him, she rejoiced heartily to find that she was wrong as
				to the subject on which she had suspected he wished to speak. Had she been right in
				her conjecture, all she could have done would have been to endow the boy and girl
				with such a portion of her wealth as might have sufficed to make them independent;
				but under such  circumstances, all notion of essential improvement must
				of course be abandoned for ever, and for many reasons this would have been a source
				of lasting regret to her. It was therefore with cordial approbation that after the
				interval of a few moments, she replied, "Michael, you are right. Nature has done so
				much for you, my dear friend, that our wish to keep you constantly with us might
				easily, had you shown less courage, have tempted us to fancy that you wanted nothing
				which you have not got, or which we could not give you. But you are quite right in
				refusing to consent to this. We will immediately return to Germany where you shall
				be placed at the same admirable institution that so rapidly made your brother what
				you now see him. Two yeas of well-directed devotion to study, my dear Michael, will
				perhaps make you feel more at your ease among us, though I doubt, if it can produce
				any change which will make us love you better. 
"Miss Brotherton! dearest Miss Brotherton!" exclaimed Michael — while perhaps the
				brightest beam of hope that ever yet shot from his eyes, met hers as she
				affectionately gazed upon him, "that was not what I — what I dared venture to hope
				and ask for. What you now propose, would be a happiness, the idea of which I think I
				should have turned from, even in my dreams, from shame at its towering ambition. All
				I meant to ask was, your kind aid to place me in some business where I might earn a
				maintenance, that in a year or two might prevent my being a burden to you — and now
				— "
"And now, Michael, I tell you fairly, that I have not the slightest intention of
				doing any such thing. Besides my own particular objection to such a mode of
				proceeding, I have lately heard a little anecdote of you, from your friend Martha,
				which makes it very doubtful whether you deserve that species of independence — for
				she put it in your possession once, you know — and you could not keep it. I shall
				manage better, Michael, depend upon it. One week more of idleness in this sweet spot
				— and then we travel back to Germany. You shall not be left to study in a more
				forsaken condition than was your brother. We shall be within an easy distance of
				you, my dear Michael. One corner of my castle must hold us, while another is
				beautified, and it is likely enough the work will go on all the better for our being
				there."
"And your visit to Rome given up for my sake?" cried Michael. "Oh! no, no, no!"
"No, no, no, most certainly," replied Mary, laughing, "I would not give up that
				journey, Michael, for more than I will say, "All is not lost that is delayed."
				Instead of giving up the plan, I only mean to improve it. Tell me, and tell me
				honestly, dear Michael, do you not think in your heart that we shall, one and all,
				enjoy this journey more if you are with us?"
 "Mary!" exclaimed the boy, wholly overcome, and seizing and kissing her hand with an
				emotion that at once and for ever banished all reserve, "Mary! it is your will to be
				loved, and who can disobey?  But my happiness seems greater than I can
				bear! Where is Edward? Let me walk, and talk with him! He is used to you, Mary, and
				all this may not seem to him so very much like a dream as it does to me. If he tells
				me it is all real, I shall believe it;" and with these words, and his fine face
				glowing with all the best and happiest feelings of our nature, Michael bounded from
				the presence of his benefactress to seek his brother. 
"I might have lived a good while in my fine house, at Milford, and received a
				prodigious number of complimentary visits from my elegant neighbours, before I
				should have enjoyed half an hour as I have done this," thought the happy Mary
				Brotherton, as she strolled out through an open window, that led to a little garden
				of orange-trees. "How delicious is the air this morning!" But where was the climate,
				where, at that moment, she would have felt it to be otherwise?
Michael had no difficulty in finding his brother, who in truth was lingering near, on
				purpose to question him after this interview.
"Come with me, Edward!" cried the agitated boy, seizing his arm; "here are our hats —
				come with me into that little grove yonder — my heart will burst if I do not
				instantly tell you what has passed." And arm-in-arm they crossed the road, and a
				small enclosure opposite, and there found themselves under the shelter of a little
				wood, thick enough to exclude the peering eyes of mortals, as well as that of the
				sun.
Notwithstanding their eagerness for the communication which was to follow, and which
				was pretty equally strong in both, not a word was uttered by either till they
				reached this covert, and then, Michael, throwing himself upon a bank, and casting
				his hat away, clasped his hands, and raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed, "Edward,
				she is an angel!"
Edward had not followed his brother's example, in lying down, but stood before him in
				act to listen. But there was something in these words that seemed to shake him, for
				he turned away without answering.
"Has she ever named to you her plans about me?" resumed Michael.
"Yes!" replied Edward.
"Then you know that it is not her intention to assist me, by enabling me to learn any
				trade in handicraft?"
"No such idea, Michael, ever entered her head," said Edward, gravely.
"But, my dear fellow! you seem to take all this so very coolly. Do you know that it
				is her intention to send me to the same place where your education was completed? —
				Do you know that she gives up — no — that she postpones her journey to Italy, till I
				am ready to go with her? — Edward, do you know all this?"
 "My dear brother," replied Edward, "I only know, that from the moment she learnt you
				were alive, she determined that she would immediately make you perfectly
				independent, as she has done me. All the rest, I think, depended upon your own
				inclination — and had she  not found you disposed for this scheme, she
				would not have insisted upon it." 
"Disposed for it, Edward? Oh! what cold, what chilling words! You could not speak so,
				if you thought there were any hope of my so profiting by it as to become a fit
				companion for you — for her — for Fanny. But it is too late — you feel that it is
				too late — is it not so, Edward?"
"No, Michael, no!" returned Edward, with sudden animation. "With your faculties, your
				eager desire to learn, and the masters you will have to put you in the way of doing
				so, I KNOW hat the result of these two years of study will be all you wish, and all
				your friends can desire."
"Then how can you receive this glorious news, my Edward, so composedly?"
"First, dear Michael, because it is no news to me. And secondly, because I am a
				selfish wretch, and was thinking, perhaps, more of my own interest than of yours.
				Forgive me for it, my own dear Michael! But I would rather have had it decided that
				we should have both marched off, and taken service under the Emperor of Austria. I
				know that commissions would have been obtained for us."
Michael, as his brother uttered these words, looked up into his face with an
				expression of such astonishment and dismay, that the blood rushed to Edward's face,
				and he turned away to conceal his confusion.
"Edward! you are a mystery to me," exclaimed Michael, springing upon his feet, and
				taking his brother by the arm. "Can it be possible that you are weary of the life
				you lead? Oh, heaven! and such a life!"
"Weary? am I weary of it, Michael? weary of rising every day to feel that I am a
				wretch unworthy to breathe the breath of life any where? And oh! how utterly
				unworthy to breathe it here!"
It was now poor Michael's turn to change colour, and he did so pretty violently — for
				first he became very red, and then exceedingly pale. That Edward, such as he had
				ever remembered him, such as he found him now, that he should so very solemnly
				declare himself to be a wretch unworthy of life, was a horror and a misery as
				terrible as it was unexpected. He had no power to utter any soothing in
				contradiction to this appalling statement, for, alas! it might be true — and
				Michael's heart sunk within him as he remembered how totally ignorant he was of
				every thing that might enable him to disbelieve it. Silently the brothers walked on
				for some paces, side by side. They were both of them either unwilling, or unable to
				speak. At length a sort of shuddering emotion that passed through Michael's frame,
				made itself felt by the arm of Edward, which he still held, and then he stopped, and
				without raising his eyes from the ground, said,
"Michael! How is it you understand me? Do you suppose that I have been guilty of some
				criminal act, such as dooms man to the gallows? If not, why do you shudder
				thus?"

"Would you not shudder, Edward, if you heard me say, that I was a wretch unworthy to
				live?"
"Poor Michael! perhaps I might; but still I doubt if I should understand the phrase
				as you do. It is so difficult, so impossible to express temperately and soberly, my
				own reprobation of the feelings that destroy me! And yet, dear Michael," he
				continued more tranquilly, "I could have fancied that there was something working in
				your own heart which might have taught you in some degree to guess the state of mine
				— I have no strength, no courage to enter on the guilty subject fully — but — that
				you may not think me a felon, Michael, I will tell you in one audacious word, I
				LOVE, and that with a fervour, a vehemence of passion, that often makes me tremble
				at myself — for did it ever master me so far as to force a confession of it in the
				presence of its object, I never could look up again, but must and would for ever
				become an alien from all I love, and a friendless wanderer on the face of the
				earth."
Though shocked more deeply than he had any wish or power to express, Michael could
				not resist the belief, which came with terrible strength upon him, that his unhappy
				brother had conceived a passion for some married woman, and that his best chance of
				recovering both his virtue and his tranquillity would be by following the wish he
				had expressed, and by entering on a new and active career, to give himself a chance
				of obliterating from his mind the feelings which had so unhappily taken possession
				of it. Such a destination for Edward must of course destroy some the very brightest
				of his own beautiful day-dreams: but there was a fund of integrity and real goodness
				in the heart of Michael that permitted him not at that moment to think of himself.
				"Edward!" said he solemnly, "if this be so, follow the course that your better
				feelings have suggested — adopt at once the profession of a soldier. It has ever
				been accounted a noble one — though, under happier circumstances — but that matters
				not — if your passions have led you wrong, let your principles bring you back again.
				Confess the truth to your generous benefactress at once."
"Michael!" replied Edward, looking in his face with an expression of suffering that
				almost amounted to agony — "I would rather die first." These words seemed intended
				to close the conversation, or at any rate they did so; for the two brothers silently
				retraced their path to the house, and a fond pressure, expressive of love and pity,
				which Michael gave to the arm of Edward before he parted from it, was all that
				passed between them further at that time.
 The interview of that morning with Miss Brotherton had awakened in the mind of
				Michael, feelings towards her which an hour before he would have thought it must
				have taken years to produce; but being equally sincere, both in his former timidity
				and his present confidence, he speedily made up his mind to open his heart to her,
				and do for his guilty, but suffering brother, what it was evident he had not courage
				to do for himself. In pursuance of this resolution, he again sought the heiress, and
				whispered in her ear, "Mary! — will you let me talk to you a little more?" She
				eagerly complied with the implied invitation,  and passing her arm
				through his, accompanied him to the scene of their former tête-à-tête . 
There was no shyness on the part of Michael. The familiar appellation he had used was
				not assumed for the purpose of proving his obedience, but resulted from a genuine
				feeling of affectionate confidence in every word she had uttered, and which had left
				on his mind the belief that she was not only his generous patroness, but his loving
				friend.
"I little thought when I was talking to you this morning about my poor self," he
				said, "that I should so soon have to take you away again from your drawing, to talk
				about Edward."
"About Edward?" said Mary colouring, "what do you wish to say about him, dear
				Michael?"
"It is something that he declares he would die rather than say to you himself,"
				replied Michael, "but I am certain that you ought to know it, for it is quite clear
				that there is no chance of happiness for him unless you agree to his wishes."
"What wishes?" exclaimed the heiress, terribly agitated, "for goodness sake, Michael,
				do not trifle with me! Did Edward commission you to speak to me?"
"Oh, no! had he felt courage to do that , I should have told him at once,
				that he had better do it himself," replied Michael. "Indeed I fear greatly that he
				will be displeased with me; but I cannot bear to see him so miserable without
				mentioning it to the only person capable of helping him."
"Miserable? — Helping him? — Tell me, Michael, tell me at once what you mean!"
"That is exactly what I wish to do, dear Mary!" replied Michael, looking with
				considerable surprise at her varying colour, and agitated features; "but I fear I am
				doing wrong, and that I have already said something that vexes you."
"No, no!" cried Mary impatiently, "only, go on!"
"In one word, then," resumed Michael, "our dear Edward wishes beyond all things to
				enter the Austrian service."
"And leave us!" returned the heiress, almost gasping. "Does Edward want to leave
				me?"
"Do not suspect him of ingratitude, Mary!" cried Michael, eagerly; "there is a reason
				for it, and without this I am quite sure he would never think of such a thing. —
				Edward has conceived an unfortunate passion for an object from whom he ought to fly
				— and this, of course, will explain every thing to you."
"Let me see him! Let me hear him! From himself, and from himself only I can hear
				this. Let it mean what it may." On uttering these words, which were spoken with a
				very agitated and untranquil air, Mary Brotherton rushed out of the room, much to
				Michael's astonishment; for he could by no means comprehend why she should
				testify such very strong emotion, especially as he had so cautiously and delicately
				avoided hinting any thing about a married woman's being unhappily the object of his
				brother's passion.

In this ignorance of Michael's, the reader, I am very sorry to say, must share. There
				are some fact which no wise historian will ever venture to dilate upon, lest their
				strangeness should provoke incredulity; and great wisdom is shown by such
				forbearance; for it is infinitely better that an elightened public should be driven
				to exclaim, " How very obscure this passage is! " than " How very
					improbable! "
Michael Armstrong is the hero of the book that is now drawing rapidly to its
				conclusion; and every reader has therefore a right to expect that his destiny shall
				be plainly announced to them, whatever mystery may hang over that of others.
				Whatever occurred between the heiress and Edward in the conference which they
				speedily held together, it did not cause any alteration in that lady's purpose of
				immediately returning to her chateau upon the Rhine. A man of worth and great
				ability was engaged to take charge of the richly teeming eager mind of Michael,
				during the two years that it was settled he should remain at a German university,
				and nothing could be more satisfactory than the result of this arrangement. Never,
				perhaps, were two years put to greater profit in the development of mind, than upon
				this occasion; and when they were ended, Michael Armstrong was able to take his
				station upon the beautiful terrace, without feeling that he was out of his place
				there.
 Less than these two years had sufficed to bring to perfection all Mary Brotherton's
				plans for improving and beautifying her spacious residence. It was one of those
				super-terranean quarries which are sometimes seen to spread themselves to such
				miraculous extent in that region, and would have inspired most ladies with a feeling
				of dreary vastness, which, notwithstanding the exceeding beauty of its position,
				would have prevented any hope of rendering it comfortably habitable. But Mary had an
				ample heart, and an ample purse. Circumstances over which (to use a thoroughly
				authorized expression) she had no control, for in truth they had preceded her birth,
				had rendered her own country less dear to her than it is to most others; and she
				therefore not only determined to plant herself elsewhere, but to do so in such a
				manner as would enable her to make her new abode her home, in the best sense of the
				word, and this could only be done by giving. "Ample room, and verge enough," to make
				it the home of others also. Any travellers lucky enough to light upon this
				widely-spreading, but comfortable and thoroughly well kept-up abode, will find that,
				notwithstanding its great extent, it has, by no means, the air of being uninhabited.
				Nobody will be much surprised to hear that Michael Armstrong and Fanny Fletcher
				became man and wife, or that they proved a loving and very happy pair; but, should
				any curious Rhenish tourist obtain an introduction to this Rhingau paradise, they
				will probably observe two very loving and happy pairs, to whom it serves as a common
				yet, in some sort, a separate home, each having its suite of drawing-rooms,
				boudoirs, nurseries, school-rooms, elcætera . But however much a gossiping
				inclination  might lead to a more explicit detail, there is really no
				room left to enter upon it. All that can be said in addition to this is, that when
				Sir Matthew Dowling's affairs came to be wound up, there was discovered to be a
				sufficient surplus to afford a small independence to each of his children, which,
				being divided according to the proportion dictated by the knight's will, gave
				something approaching to a Benjamin's mess portion to his daughter Martha. To claim
				and receive this, as well as occasionally to visit some members of her family,
				Martha made frequent excursions to England: but her happiest hours were those she
				passed with her dear friends in Germany, by whom she is ever received with open
				arms. 
Mrs. Tremlett is still enjoying an old age of perfect comfort, cheered by warm
				affection, and is already the darling of many little hearts.
There is no record to be found in any documents relating to the inhabitants of the
				chateau, showing that Edward Armstrong ever entered the Austrian service. It is,
				therefore, most reasonable to suppose that this wish was never complied with.
THE END.</div></body></text></TEI>
