 CHAPTER V. 
A SEPARATION OF LOVING HEARTS — A SPECIMEN OF FINISHED COMPOSITION — CONDESCENSION
				AND GENEROSITY — SIR MATTHEW CLOTHES LITTLE MICHAEL WITH HIS OWN HANDS.

				While the superintendent, in his serpentine course homeward,
				scattered the tidings of his master's munificence towards the factory-boy, Michael
				Armstrong and his mother indulged themselves in a few parting words and very tender

				once and again to take another kiss, and to repeat, with increased earnestness, the
				questions, "Isn't there nothing more I can do for you, mother, before I go away? —
				and will you be sure to tell Teddy to stop for me, morning and night, at the gate in
				the lane, where it all happened? — will you mother?"
But at length the lingering separation was completed, and Michael set off upon his

				but, retiring to his study, he composed a paragraph for the county newspaper, which,
				after considerable study and repeated corrections, was at length completed, and
				despatched by the post, in a feigned hand, the wax being stamped with the handle of
				the seal instead of his arms, and the postage paid.
The paragraph ran thus:
