  CHAPTER XXXIX.
Captain De Crespigny had heard, with frantic alarm, of the fearful danger from which Marion
     was so wonderfully delivered; and then, for the first time, he discovered the whole depth and
     reality of his love. The gracefulness of every thought which she expressed, and the bright
     beauty of that look with which it was accompanied, had made an indelible impression on his
     heart, so that now, when he saw her so unexpectedly snatched from the jaws of death, no words
     could do justice to his emotion. He hurried that very evening to ascertain the reality of her
     escape, and to say what he could on the occasion; while the tremulousness of his voice, and the
     quivering of his lip, gave a degree of depth and reality to his few incoherent sentences, which
     all his well-turned speeches in former times had failed to convey. Marion thanked him warmly
     for his friendly sympathy, and spoke to him with all the intimacy of relationship and old
     acquaintance; but when she turned to Mr. Granville, Captain De Crespigny then observed the
     flutter of her voice, the deep tone of tenderness, and the look full of confidence and full of
     interest, with which she spoke to him, and to him only; while there was a degree of tact and
     delicacy in her manner of testifying the wide disparity of her feelings, which left him nothing
     of which to complain. Careless of the dry and sarcastic air with which Agnes watched his
     mortification, Captain De Crespigny did not even take the trouble to conceal it; but soon after
     strode out of the room, and walked with hurried and agitated steps up and down in the garden,
     whistling, but not from want of thought. When thus alone and unobserved, a thousand angry and
     indignant feelings made him writhe with mental suffering, to think that he, who had been so
     deeply, so fatally loved by others, who had never sued in vain, and never truly had loved
     before, should endure now the agonies of unrequited affection, should be slighted, avoided, and
     forgotten, for a man he hated, as he had always hated Richard Granville.
"He cannot love her as I do!" thought Captain De Crespigny, vehemently clenching his hands,
     and throwing himself on a seat. "What does he know of that magical feeling! a passionless being
     from boyhood, master of all his own feelings and impulses, incapable of the wild, ungovernable
     ardor, which carries me forward, in the face of all obstacles, to win her! He has indeed acted
     manfully on this occasion, but shall the accident of his success destroy my hopes of happiness!
     No! it must not,—shall not be! Dunbar will never consent to their marriage, and he must prevent
     his sister from thus throwing herself away. She shall yet be mine! The only girl who was ever
     insensible to my preference! I cannot live without her, and if there be means in the wide world
     to thwart Richard Granville, I must find them!"
Sir Patrick received next day, with gratified surprise, the explicit declaration of his
     friend's unbounded, and, at length, undisguised, attachment for Marion, which he had already,
     in some degree, suspected, though so much accustomed to Captain De Crespigny's being in jest,
     that he could scarcely believe now that he was in earnest, while listening to the vehement
     expressions of his attachment, and promising, nevertheless, to enlist himself in the cause,
     with all the zeal and all the interest he could command.
"As her guardian, I have a perfect right to postpone this most absurd engagement, and Sir
     Arthur deserves to be spiflicated, for ever having encouraged such a mere
     penny-wedding affair for that girl, who does not know her own value. Agnes tells me my uncle
     has allowed them to correspond; but this he had no right to do without my consent, and
     therefore I shall take most effectual means to intercept every letter, either to or from her,
     till she is of age, after which my reign ends, though, I hope, long before that, yours shall
     have begun."
Sir Patrick took an early opportunity of expressing to Marion, in no measured terms, his
     utter abhorrence of poor marriages in general, of poor curates especially, and of Richard
     Granville in particular; while she, with downcast eyes, blushed, and re-blushed, deeper, and
     deeper still; though, unwilling to irritate him more than could be helped, she listened in
     silence, till at length, encouraged by meeting with no reply, he added, in a tone of high
     exhilaration—
"But we need not talk of that now! The thing does not bear speaking of! You shall hear news
     to-day that must positively drive all this nonsense out of your head. The best 'catch' in
     Britain has actually lost his heart to a tolerably pretty, and not very disagreeable young
     lady, by name Marion Dunbar! A better fellow does not exist on earth than De Crespigny; and he
     will render you the happiest of women. I never saw any man so anxious to make himself liked by
     any girl as he is!"
Marion felt now that she must no longer be silent, and blushing her brightest red she
     replied, in a low, deep, earnest voice, "Hear me, dear Patrick, and I shall not annoy you by
     saying one word in favor of my indissoluble engagement, that being a subject on which, I fear,
     we shall never agree; but without reference to a previous attachment, had it not even existed,
     my feelings towards Captain De Crespigny would have been the same. I never could confide my
     affection and happiness to one who has found his amusement hitherto in betraying all who
     trusted him, and who feeds his vanity by causing misery to those who are as deserving as
     myself. It would have been more merciful to destroy life, than to destroy the happiness of
     life, as he has done, for many, and for our own sister, I fear, among the number."
"Pshaw, Marion! Do not stand in your own light like a thief in the candle!" exclaimed Sir
     Patrick, impatiently. "De Crespigny is worth a hundred thousand Richard Granvilles!"
"One is all I care for!" replied Marion, timidly. "But, Patrick, as you have begun the
     comparison, let me say, that to have once known Mr. Granville is a talisman against every other
     attachment. There is no pleasure in life worth a thought, without mutual confidence, such as, I
     trust, we have established between us for ever, and such as I never could have felt with
     Captain De Crespigny. My taste has been tuned to a higher pitch than to be satisfied with such
     a transient and capricious attachment as he could ever offer to any one—mere tinsel and
     filigree, compared to the strong and lasting sentiment on which I may now rely."
"Marion! there is not a man living who deserves a more grateful return for his preference
     than De Crespigny; and I still hope the time may come when you shall see his value, and more
     than return his attachment, or it will inflict a very great disappointment, which I should be
     annoyed beyond measure to occasion him!"
"Patrick! how could your friend, with his heart splintered into atoms, ever presume to expect
     a whole one in return? He often reminds me of that German lady, whose picture is drawn
     encouraging three lovers at once. She is giving her hand to the first, stealing a glance at the
     second, and treading on the toe of the third, while each believes himself the favorite. Captain
     De Crespigny will take the disappointment, if it be one, to the next ball, and dance it off in
     a single quadrille. His love is like wax, ready for all impressions, and he has weathered so
     many flirtations already, that you need never be uneasy about him now. I venture to say what I
     think, Patrick, to convince you how vain all future importunity on the subject would be; and I
     cannot but observe, that if there be any blame on this occasion, it is yours, for obliging me
     so often, most unwillingly, to meet Captain De Crespigny. Let us hope, however, that you have
     been misled into over-estimating his intentions and feelings. Caroline Smythe sometimes takes
     off your friend to the very life; and I wish you could see how cleverly she carries on a
     furious flirtation with two ladies at once. There really seemed danger, one day, that uncle
     Arthur would die, like the famous Mr. Hope, of suppressed laughter! I wish all ladies could
     view the case in as ridiculous a light as Caroline does; but Patrick, it is very different in
     respect to Agnes. Her whole thoughts are embittered by Captain De Crespigny's unpardonable
     coquetry—her whole feelings lacerated; and I fear she may, in a paroxysm of angry
     disappointment, consign herself to long years of misery—I may even say, of degradation. You
     know all I mean, Patrick, and you ought, if possible, to soothe her, to advise and persuade her
     into a better line of conduct. As for myself, Patrick,—lastly, and to conclude," added Marion,
     a wandering blush resting its warm tint again on her cheek, "I can say, like Cardinal Wolsey,
     but with more satisfaction, 'Farewell to all my greatness!' Richard is not affluent—probably he
     never may be so; but I am no spendthrift. I would rather have love than money; and whatever
     befall us, it is happiness enough for the rest of my life to know that he thinks me deserving
     of his attachment. We love, and we understand each other perfectly."
Marion rushed through what she had to say with agitated rapidity, and on reaching the
     conclusion she bent down her head, and leaned it on her folded arms, while Sir Patrick hastily
     left the room, uttering a few emphatic exclamations, which were lost in the thundering report
     with which he closed the drawing-room door, till it quivered upon the hinges.
"Very absurd and unaccountable!" exclaimed Sir Patrick, interrupting himself next day, during
     a paroxysm of angry whistling, which he had carried on for some time, standing with his back to
     the fire, in that attitude peculiar to Englishmen, and in which he was said to be the only man
     who ever looked graceful. "Most extraordinary."
"What?" asked Agnes, with a start of eager curiosity. "What is there which astonishes you so
     much?"
"That I am the only one of our family who cannot endure to eat roast mutton!" replied he,
     evidently resolved to balk her inquisitiveness. "This is a teazing and tormenting world, Agnes,
     where we cannot order everything as we like."
"But what has ruffled the surface of your humor to-day, Pat?" asked Agnes, indifferently.
     "You seldom treat me to a stage soliloquy!"
"Then, if you must have it, all I can say is this! Here are my two best friends on earth,
     Wigton and De Crespigny, with a thousand mental, personal, titled, and landed recommendations,
     each making his proposal, and I cannot give either of them the slightest hopes!"
"Patrick, you must be mad! If they wait long enough, I may perhaps marry both, but at all
     events I have no intention to refuse either!" replied Agnes, in her most conceited tone. "Are
     you in jest or in earnest?"
"Why, both! That strange girl, Marion, has given them each a good, round, decided negative. I
     did not think she had it in her nature to be so positive."
"Impossible!" exclaimed Agnes, with angry vehemence, while her eyes seemed literally striking
     fire. "This is some ill-natured jest of yours; but Marion understands Captain De Crespigny too
     well to fall into any such absurd mistake. She knows he is secretly attached to me, though,
     indeed, that has been no secret for ages past, and Marion never hinted to me that he had an
     idea of proposing to her."
"No! Marion is exactly the sort of person never to mention what might hurt the feelings of
     another, especially as you would probably not have believed her; but I had yesterday a
     point-blank, bona fide, serious, and even solemn proposal to make her
     from De Crespigny, which I had to decline with all the usual regret, surprise, gratitude,
     offers of friendship, and so forth. It is a great inconvenience, Agnes, that both your strings
     should break in this way at once; but Marion is a perfect loadstone for attracting the
     attentions, the hearts, and the good opinions of all mankind. I have seen both these affairs
     coming on for some time, and it is really awkward and irritating to be placed in such a
     predicament with all my friends," continued Sir Patrick, in the tone of an ill-used man,
     thinking only of his own grievances, while Agnes, feeling herself extinguished at a blow, gazed
     in his face with a look of pallid amazement. "If Granville could only be sunk to the bottom of
     the sea," added Sir Patrick, impatiently, "I would not beckon with my finger to bring him up
     again!"
When a separation is inevitable, those who depart have generally the advantage, in seeing a
     variety of interesting novelties, to force their attention, and occupy it; but while the
     thoughts of Mr. Granville reverted continually to Harrowgate, Marion's became now more than
     ever engrossed with Sir Arthur, whose nerves had been greatly shattered by his recent
     adventure, and who ardently longed, as soon as his health was in any degree re-established, to
     be again in the quiet sanctuary of his own home.
Amidst scenes where she was hourly reminded of the happy past, Marion delivered herself up to
     the pleasing consciousness of Richard's unalterable attachment. Though circumstances had now
     separated, and might keep them apart for months, she felt a steady assurance that their mutual
     attachment could never be shaken by either time or distance. In the solitude of her own heart,
     Marion hoarded up many cherished remembrances of what he had said, and how he had said it,
     while the most transient of Mr. Granville's remarks seemed indelibly imprinted on her
     recollection. She read the books he liked, practised the music he admired, traced out all his
     favorite walks, and lived with him as the continual companion of her thoughts.
Marion's was an unclouded sunshine of hope, as she confided so entirely in her absent lover,
     that she would quite as soon have distrusted her own heart as his; yet day after day, and week
     after week passed on, without a line ever reaching her from either Clara or Richard, and little
     did she dream, while suffering from the melancholy monotony of their long-continued silence,
     that letter after letter, written from heart to heart, with ardent affection and entire
     confidence, had been consigned to a premature end by the order and contrivance of Sir Patrick;
     but nevertheless, with all the ardor of a young and sanguine mind, she daily expected a
     satisfactory explanation, and still looked back upon the past with unembittered feelings.
Marion's was not a weak, wavering, suspicious, or fanciful nature, but high and generous in
     all things, she had not lightly confided her happiness to one on whom she could not implicitly
     rely. She knew his attachment to be one of principle as well as of inclination, and though
     uneasy lest Mr. Granville might be ill, she entertained no jealous apprehension that he had
     become changed, but perseveringly trusted, believed, and hoped the best. Many a time had
     Marion's heart throbbed, and her color risen with a tumult of hope, as she watched the return
     of Martin from the post-office, and the flutter of expectation faded sadly away in mournful
     disappointment, when she found that another day and night, at the very least, must be added to
     her long and weary disappointment; for no "hope deferr'd" makes the heart more sick, than
     vainly watching for a letter, in which the happiness of a life-time is involved.
"Out of sight out of mind!" said Agnes, sarcastically, one day, when she observed the look of
     surprise and anxiety with which Marion was leaving the room, alter seeing hoards of letters
     brought into the room from every quarter but the right one. "Marion! as Shakspeare says, 'No
     word from Goodman Dull yet?' That is just like men in general!"
"It may be like men in general, Agnes, but it is not like Richard," replied Marion, coloring
     and smiling. "On him I have the most consummate reliance. We can both depend on our perfect
     knowledge of each other, and I shall not break the long chain of our mutual faith by a single
     doubt. I have given him my confidence, and that was all I had to bestow."
"Well! as some sensible poet remarks, and I quite agree with him," said Agnes, with a
     peevish, discontented sigh—

"The maid that loves,
Goes out to sea upon a shattered plank,
And puts her trust in miracles for safety."

"No, Agnes! Those who have loved lightly may change as lightly, but I should little deserve
     the inestimable happiness of having known Mr. Granville so entirely, did I not always believe
     him above the suspicion of caprice. We have read each other's mind and heart, we have been
     willing to trust each other in life and till death; therefore now, unless Richard were to tell
     me with his own lips that he had changed, I would not believe it,—and scarcely even then! This
     alone is affection that deserves the name, not to torment him with distrust, nor to take up the
     first cause of offence, but with unenquiring confidence to judge him as I would myself be
     judged. It would add a pang to the sorrow of separation if we believed ourselves at the mercy
     of every idle suspicion; but I know his heart to be as incapable of deceit or dishonor as my
     own."
In the mean time, Mr. Granville had continued to write from abroad with unceasing assiduity,
     believing that some unexpected obstacle must have occurred to prevent Marion from answering his
     letters, but never suspecting that she did not receive one of the many he had written. In his
     candid and elevated mind, there was no room for jealousy or suspicion, and conscious that the
     transparent nature of Marion's nature admitted of no concealments, he rejected every angry or
     impatient thought. The more he saw of other society, the more dear she became to his memory
     now, while his attachment was of that deep and lasting kind over which the accidents of life
     have no influence.
"Miss Dunbar," said Captain De Crespigny, one evening, placing himself on a sofa beside
     Marion, while Sir Patrick, to whom he had been speaking very earnestly some minutes before,
     anxiously watched her countenance from a distance: "I wish you were now seated in one of
     Merlin's chairs, from which no one can rise till a story be finished. I have something to say,
     so important to myself, and let me hope also to you, that I expect to be heard to the end."
"Of course, if you wish it," replied Marion, in a faltering, agitated voice. "But, Captain De
     Crespigny, allow me to remark how unlikely it is that any subject can very deeply interest us
     both. I trust and hope we fully understand each other."
"It is time, indeed, that we should," replied he with emotion.
"And if I dare say all I wish, it would still be less than I feel. Dunbar assures me you are
     still at liberty to consult only your own inclinations, and let me hope I am not entirely the
     dupe of my own vanity, in believing that I might yet conquer your indifference. Since the hour
     when we first met, I had eyes for no one but yourself. Even when we could not converse I have
     watched you with ceaseless interest, and am forever thinking of you in absence, counting the
     hours of my existence only by those passed in your society. Why, then, do you so obviously
     avoid me? Why am I for ever made the companion of Miss Smythe or Miss Anybody-else? You know
     and see that my whole object in life is, to remain beside yourself. Every look, word, and
     action tells you as plainly as language can speak, that I love you to distraction, that my
     attachment has not been hastily formed, to be as hastily laid aside, and now my only
     apprehension is, that by too openly disclosing my feelings the confession may separate us for
     ever, yet it can no longer be delayed, for I must know at once now, whether I am to be happy or
     miserable for life?"
"Patrick has done very wrong," faltered Marion, while tears sprang into her eyes, "I told him
     long ago to let you know all. It is most unfortunate that your preference should be given to
     one of the very few who never can return it. You ask for a heart which is not mine to give. My
     engagement to Mr. Granville cannot be soon fulfilled, but while we both live, we shall live
     only for each other."
"That, Dunbar assures me, can never take place," replied Captain De Crespigny, while a dark
     red flush passed over his countenance; "and till it does, I cannot cease to hope. Nothing is
     more annoying, I know, than the perseverance of an unrequited attachment, but I must cling to
     the faint and haggard hope which remains. A mere taper is extinguished by being blown upon, but
     a fire burns only the brighter. The greatest felicity of life would not be good enough for you,
     nor so much as I wish you, provided only we share it together; but with another, I cannot wish
     you happiness. No! the words would choke me. May you never find any till you find it with me.
     If you can ever feel one relenting thought in my favor,—if, dissatisfied with another, you
     think with even momentary regret of me, then, were I at the extremity of the earth, let me but
     know it, and you shall find that I have been true as the dial to the sun, even though not
     brightened by its light."
Captain De Crespigny continued with vehemence of tone and manner which nothing could
     interrupt, while Marion's countenance became more and more expressive of grief and
     confusion.
"If I have been to others the reckless, inconstant, and unprincipled being you think, all who
     ever suffered a pang on my account are now revenged. I never really loved any one but you! All
     else was fancy—vanity—any thing but love. Were others like you, there could be no
     changeableness or caprice, but never have I seen before, and never shall I see again, so much
     to attract affection and to secure constancy. Hereafter a solitary recollection of the hours
     spent with you will be my only remaining happiness. Happiness!! there is no such word for me,
     now! You, who delight in making all others happy, would condemn me to misery! The thought of my
     defeated hopes will forever ring upon my heart. The remembrance, that when I asked that of you,
     which I never asked before, you coldly and indifferently rejected me."
"Not indifferently, but with heartfelt gratitude for your disinterested preference," answered
     Marion, in a low, agitated voice. "If already married to another, I could not be more decided
     in saying, that you must never renew the subject again, for I owe it to you, as much as to
     myself and Richard, to say that my answer is final,—that we never can be more to each other
     than friends, but that I sincerely hope the time may come, when we shall meet as we did
     formerly, without emotion, but with kind and cousinly regard."
"Never! oh never! The very thought shows you have never loved as I do! I could not be in the
     same room with you,—no! not in the same kingdom. You may pity, if you cannot love me," replied
     Captain De Crespigny, with a deep gasp of acute disappointment; and seizing his hat, he rushed
     out of the house, nearly suffocated by contending emotions; but as he ran, rather than walked,
     towards his lodgings, the first and foremost of his thoughts was, under all circumstances, and
     at all hazards, to persevere with unalterable pertinacity, and only with his dying breath, to
     resign the hope of success.
