CHAPTER XVIII.
INTERCALARY.
The Tamworths did not altogether live at Burleigh Singleton—it was far too petty a place for
     them; dullness all the year round (however pleasant for a month or so, as a holiday from
     toilsome pleasures) would never have done for Lady Tamworth and her daughters: but they
     regularly took Prospect House for six weeks in the summer season, when tired of Portland Place,
     and Huntover, their fine estate in Cheshire: and so, from constant annual immigration, came as
     much to be regarded Burleighites, as swifts and swallows to be ranked as British birds. I only
     hint at this piece of information, for fear any should think it unlikely, that grandees of Sir
     Abraham's condition could exist for ever in a place where the day-before-yesterday's
     'Times' is first intelligence.
Moreover, as another interjectional touch, it is only due to my life-likenesses to record,
     that Mrs. Green's, although a terrace-house, and ranked as humble number seven, was,
     nevertheless, a tolerably spacious mansion, well suited for the dignity of a butler to repose
     in: for Mrs. Green had added an entire dwelling on the inland side, as, like most maritime
     inhabitants, she was thoroughly sick of the sea, and never cared to look at it, though living
     there still, from mere disinclination to stir: so, then, it was quite a double house, both
     spacious and convenient. As for the inglorious incident of Julian's latch-key, I should not
     wonder if many wide street-doors to many marble halls are conscious of similar convenient
     fastenings, if gentlemen of Julian's nocturnal tastes happen to be therein dwelling. Another
     little matter is worth one word. The house had been Mrs. Green's, a freehold, and was,
     therefore, now her heir's; but the general, as an executor, remained there still, until his
     business was finished; in fact, he took his year's liberty.
He had returned from India rolling in gold; for some great princess or other—I think they
     called her a Begum or a Glumdrum, or other such like Gulliverian appellative—had been
     singularly fond of him, and had loaded him in early life with favours—not only kisses, and so
     forth, but jewellery and gold pagodas. And lately, as we know, Puttymuddyfudgepoor, with its
     radiating rajahs and nabobs, had proved a mine of wealth: for a crore is ten lacs, and a lac of
     rupees is any thing but a
     lack of money—although rupees be money, and the "middle is distributed;" in spite
     of logic, then, a lack means about twelve thousand pounds: and four of them, according to
     Cocker, some fifty thousand. It would appear then, that with the produce of the Begum's
     diamonds, converted into money long ago, and some of them as big as linnet's eggs—and not to
     take account of Mrs. Green's trifling pinch of the five Exchequer bills, all handed over at
     once to Emily—the General's present fortune was exactly one hundred and twenty-three thousand
     pounds.
Of course, he wasn't going to bury himself at Burleigh Singleton much longer; and
     yet, for all that stout intention of houses and lands, and carriages and horses, in almost any
     other county or country, it is as true as any thing in this book, that he was a resident still,
     a lease-holder of Aunt Green's house, long after the dénouement of this story; in many
     things an altered man, but still identical in one; the unchangeable resolve (though never to be
     executed) of leaving Burleigh at farthest by next Michaelmas. Most folks who talk much, do
     little; and taciturn as the general now is, and has been ever throughout life, it will surprise
     nobody who has learned from hard experience how silly and harmful a thing is secresy
     (exceptionables excepted), to find that he grew to be a garrulous old man, gossipping for ever
     of past, present, future, and, not least, about his deeds at Puttymuddyfudgepoor.
General Tracy is by this time awake again; if ever indeed he slept on that uncomfortable
     shakedown; and, after Mr. Saunders and the razor-strop, has greeted brightly-beaming Emily with
     more than usual tenderness. Her account of the transaction made his very blood boil; especially
     as her pretty pouting lips were lacerated cruelly inside: that rude blow on the mouth had
     almost driven the teeth through them. How confidingly she told her artless tale; how gently did
     her fond protector kiss that poor pale cheek; and how sternly did he vow full vengeance on the
     caitiff! Not even Emily's intercession could avail to turn his wrath aside. He could hardly
     help flying off at once to do something dreadful; but common courtesy to all the Tamworth
     family obliged him to defer for an hour all the terrible things he meant to do. So he began to
     bolt his breakfast fiercely as a cannibal, and saluted Lady Tamworth and her daughters with
     such savage looks, that the captain considerately suggested:
"Here, general," (handing him a most formidable carving-knife,) "charge that boar's head,
     grinning defiance at us on the side-board; it will do you good to hew his brawny neck. My
     mother, I am sure, for
     one, will thank you to do the honours there instead of me. Isn't it a comfort now,
     to know that I broke the handle of my hunting-whip across the fellow's back, and wore all the
     whip-cord into skeins. Come, I say, general, don't eat us all round; and pray have mercy on
     that poor, flogged, miserable sinner."
This banter did him good, especially as he saw Emily smiling; so he relaxed his knit brow,
     condescended to look less like Giant Blunderbore, soon became marvellous chatty, and ate up two
     French rolls, an egg, some anchovies, a round of toast, and a mighty slice of brawn; these,
     washed down with a couple of cups of tea, soothed him into something like complacency.
