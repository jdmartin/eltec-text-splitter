CHAPTER V.
The Tamworth Manifesto of 1834 was an attempt to construct a party without
       principles; its basis therefore was necessarily Latitudinarianism; and its inevitable
       consequence has been Political Infidelity.
At an epoch of political perplexity and social alarm, the confederation was convenient, and
       was calculated by aggregation to encourage the timid and confused. But when the perturbation
       was a little subsided, and men began to inquire why they were banded together, the difficulty
       of defining their purpose proved that the league, however respectable, was not a party. The
       leaders indeed might profit by their eminent
        position to obtain power for their individual gratification, but it was
       impossible to secure their followers that which, after all, must be the great recompense of a
       political party, the putting in practice of their opinions; for they had none.
There was indeed a considerable shouting about what they called Conservative principles;
       but the awkward question naturally arose, what will you conserve? The prerogatives of the
       Crown, provided they are not exercised; the independence of the House of Lords, provided it
       is not asserted; the Ecclesiastical estate, provided it is regulated by a commission of
       laymen. Everything in short that is established, as long as it is\a phrase and not a
       fact.
In the meantime, while forms and phrases are religiously cherished in order to make the
       semblance of a creed, the rule of practice is to bend to the passion or combination of the
       hour. Conservativism assumes in theory that everything established should be maintained; but
       adopts in practice that everything that is established is indefensible. To reconcile this
       theory and this practice, they produce what they call "the
        best bargain;" some arrangement which has no principle and no purpose; except
       to obtain a temporary pause of agitation, until the mind of the Conservatives without a guide
       and without an aim, distracted, tempted, and bewildered, is prepared for another arrangement,
       equally statesmanlike with the preceding one.
Conservativism was an attempt to carry on affairs by substituting the fulfillment of the
       duties of office for the performance of the functions of government; and to maintain this
       negative system by the mere influence of property, reputable private conduct, and what are
       called good connexions. Conservativism discards Prescription, shrinks from Principle,
       disavows Progress; having rejected all respect for Antiquity, it offers no redress for the
       Present, and makes no preparation for the Future. It is obvious that for a time, under
       favourable circumstances, such a confederation might succeed; but it is equally clear, that
       on the arrival of one of those critical conjunctures that will periodically occur in all
       states, and which such an unimpassioned system is even calculated ultimately
        to create, all power of resistance will be wanting; the barren curse of
       political infidelity will paralyze all action; and the Conservative Constitution will be
       discovered to be a Caput Mortuum.
