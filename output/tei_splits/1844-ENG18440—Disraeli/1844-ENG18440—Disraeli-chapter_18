CHAPTER VII.
Amid the contentions of party, the fierce struggles of ambition, and the
       intricacies of political intrigue, let us not forget our Eton friends. During the period
       which elapsed from the failure of the Duke of Wellington to form a government in 1832, to the
       failure of Sir Robert Peel to carry on a government in 1835, the boys had entered, and
       advanced in youth. The ties of friendship which then united several of them had only been
       confirmed by continued companionship. Coningsby and Henry Sydney, and Buckhurst and Vere were
       still bound together by entire sympathy, and by the affection
        of which sympathy is the only sure spring. But their intimacies had been
       increased by another familiar friend. There had risen up between Coningsby and Millbank
       mutual sentiments of deep, and even ardent, regard. Acquaintance had developed the superior
       qualities of Millbank. His thoughtful and inquiring mind, his inflexible integrity, his stern
       independence, and yet the engaging union of extreme tenderness of heart with all this
       strength of character, had won the good will, and often excited the admiration, of Coningsby.
       Our hero too was gratified by the affectionate deference that was often shown to him by one
       who condescended to no other individual; he was proud of having saved the life of a member of
       their community whom masters and boys alike considered; and he ended by loving the being on
       whom he had conferred a great obligation.
The friends of Coningsby, the sweet tempered and intelligent Henry Sydney, the fiery and
       generous Buckhurst, and the calm and sagacious Vere, had ever been favourably inclined to
       Millbank, and
        had they not been, the example of Coningsby would soon have influenced them. He
       had obtained over his intimates the ascendant power, which is the destiny of genius. Nor was
       the submission of such spirits to be held cheap. Although they were willing to take the
       colour of their minds from him, they were in intellect and attainments, in personal
       accomplishments and general character, the leaders of the school; an authority not to be won
       from five hundred high-spirited boys without the possession of great virtues and great
       talents.
As for the dominion of Coningsby himself, it was not limited to the immediate circle of his
       friends. He had become the hero of Eton; the being of whose existence every body was proud,
       and in whose career every boy took an interest. They talked of him, they quoted him, they
       imitated him. Fame and power are the objects of all men. Even their partial fruition is
       gained by very few; and that too at the expense of social pleasure, health, conscience, life.
       Yet what power of manhood in passionate intenseness, appealing at the same time to the
        subject and the votary, can rival that which is exercised by the idolized
       chieftain of a great public school? What fame of after days equals the rapture of celebrity,
       that thrills the youthful medallist, as in tones of rare emotion he recites his triumphant
       verses amid the devoted plaudits of the flower of England? That's fame, that's power; real,
       unquestioned, undoubted, catholic. Alas! the schoolboy when he becomes a man, finds that
       power, even fame, like everything else, is an affair of party.
Coningsby liked very much to talk politics with Millbank. He heard things from Millbank
       which were new to him. Himself, as he supposed, a high Tory, which he was according to the
       revelation of the Rigbys, he was also sufficiently familiar with the hereditary tenets of his
       Whig friend, Lord Vere. Politics had as yet appeared to him a struggle whether the country
       was to be governed by Whig nobles, or Tory nobles; and he thought it very unfortunate that he
       should probably have to enter life with his friends out of power, and his family boroughs
       destroyed. But in conversing with Millbank,
        he heard for the first time of influential classes in the country, who were not
       noble, and were yet determined to acquire power. And although Millbank's views, which were of
       course merely caught up from his father, without the intervention of his own intelligence,
       were doubtless crude enough, and were often very acutely canvassed and satisfactorily
       demolished by the clever prejudices of another school, which Coningsby had at command, still
       they were unconsciously to the recipient materials for thought, and insensibly provoked in
       his mind a spirit of inquiry into political questions, for which he had a predisposition.
It may be said indeed that generally among the upper boys, there might be observed at this
       time at Eton a reigning inclination for political discussion. The school truly had at all
       times been proud of its statesmen and its parliamentary heroes, but this was comparatively a
       superficial feeling compared with the sentiment which now first became prevalent. The great
       public questions that were the consequence of the Reform of the House of Commons, had
        also agitated their young hearts. And especially the controversies that were
       now rife respecting the nature and character of ecclesiastical establishments, wonderfully
       addressed themselves to their excited intelligence. They read their newspapers with a keen
       relish, canvassed debates and criticised speeches; and although in their debating society
       which had been instituted more than a quarter of a century, discussion on topics of the day
       was prohibited, still by fixing on periods of our history when affairs were analogous to the
       present, many a youthful orator contrived very effectively to reply to Lord John, or to
       refute the fallacies of his rival.
As the political opinions predominant in the school were what in ordinary parlance are
       styled Tory, and indeed were far better entitled to that glorious epithet than the flimsy
       shifts which their fathers were professing in Parliament and the country; the formation and
       the fall of Sir Robert Peel's government had been watched by Etonians with great interest,
       and even excitement. The memorable efforts which the Minister himself made, supported
        only by the silent votes of his numerous adherents, and contending alone
       against the multiplied assaults of his able and determined foes with a spirit equal to the
       great occasion, and with resources of parliamentary contest which seemed to increase with
       every exigency; these great and unsupported struggles alone were calculated to gain the
       sympathy of youthful and generous spirits. The assault on the revenues of the Church; the
       subsequent crusade against the House of Lords; the display of intellect and courage exhibited
       by Lord Lyndhurst in that assembly, when all seemed cowed and faint-hearted; all these were
       incidents or personal traits apt to stir the passions, and create in breasts not yet schooled
       to repress emotion, a sentiment even of enthusiasm. It is the personal that interests
       mankind; that fires their imagination, and wins their hearts. A cause is a great abstraction,
       and fit only for students; embodied in a party, it stirs men to action; but place at the head
       of that party a leader who can inspire enthusiasm, he commands the world. Divine faculty!
       Rare and incomparable
        privilege! A parliamentary leader who possesses it, doubles his majority; and
       he who has it not, may shroud himself in artificial reserve, and study with undignified
       arrogance an awkward haughtiness, but he will be nevertheless as far from controlling the
       spirit as from captivating the hearts of his sullen followers.
Notwithstanding however this very general feeling at Eton in 1835 in favour of
       "Conservative principles," and which was, in fact, nothing more than a confused and mingled
       sympathy with some great political truths, which were at the bottom of every boy's heart, but
       nowhere else, and with the personal achievements and distinction of the chieftains of the
       party; when all this hubbub had subsided, and retrospection, in the course of a year, had
       exercised its moralising influence over the more thoughtful part of the nation, inquiries, at
       first very faint and unpretending, and confined indeed for a long period to very limited,
       though inquisitive, circles, began gently to circulateâ€”what Conservative principles were?
These inquiries, urged indeed with a sort of
        hesitating scepticism, early reached Eton. They came no doubt from the
       Universities. They were of a character however far too subtile and refined to exercise any
       immediate influence over the minds of youth. To pursue them required much previous knowledge
       and habitual thought. They were not yet publicly prosecuted by any school of politicans, or
       any section of the public press. They had not a local habitation or a name. They were
       whispered in conversation by a few. A tutor would speak of them in an esoteric vein to a
       favourite pupil, in whose abilities he had confidence, and whose future position in life
       would afford him the opportunity of influencing opinion. Among others, they fell upon the ear
       of Coningsby. They were addressed to a mind who was prepared for such researches.
There is a library at Eton formed by the boys and governed by the boys; one of those free
       institutions which are the just pride of that noble school; which shews the capacity of the
       boys for self-government; and which has sprung from that large freedom that has been wisely
        conceded them, and the prudence of which confidence has been proved by their
       rarely abusing it. This library has been formed by subscriptions of the present and still
       more by the gifts of old Etonians. Among the honored names of these donors may be remarked
       those of the Grenvilles and Lord Wellesley; nor should we forget George IV. who enriched the
       collection with a magnificent copy of the Delphin Classics. The Institution is governed by
       six directors; the three first Collegers and the three first Oppidans for the time being. And
       the subscribers are limited to the one hundred senior members of the school.
It is only to be regretted that the collection is not as extensive as it is interesting and
       choice. Perhaps its existence is not as generally known as it deserves to be. One would think
       that every Eton man would be as proud of his name being registered as a donor in the
       Catalogue of this Library, as a Venetian of his name being inscribed in the Golden Book.
       Indeed an old Etonian, who still remembers with tenderness the sacred scene of youth, could
       scarcely
        do better than build a Gothic apartment for the reception of the collection. It
       cannot. be doubted that the Provost and fellows would be gratified in granting a piece of
       ground for the purpose.
Great were the obligations of Coningsby to this Eton Library. It introduced him to that
       historic lore, that accumulation of facts and incidents illustrative of political conduct,
       for which he had imbibed an early relish. Especially his study was directed to the annals of
       his own country, in which youth, and not only youth, is frequently so deficient. This
       collection could afford him Clarendon and Burnet, and the authentic volumes of Coxe: these
       were rich materials to one anxious to be versed in the great parliamentary story of his
       country. During the last year of his stay at Eton, when he had completed his eighteenth year,
       Coningsby led a more retired life than previously; he read much, and pondered with all the
       pride of acquisition over his increasing knowledge.
And now the hour has come when this youth is to be launched into a world more vast than
        that in which he has hitherto sojourned; yet for which this microcosm has been
       no ill preparation. He will become more wise; will he remain as generous? His ambition may be
       as great; will it be as noble? What indeed is to be the future of this existence that is now
       to be sent forth into the great aggregate of entities? Is it an ordinary organization that
       will jostle among the crowd, and be jostled? Is it a finer temperament susceptible of
       receiving the impressions and imbibing the inspirations of superior, yet sympathizing,
       spirits? Or is it a primordial and creative mind; one that will say to his fellows, "Behold,
       God has given me thought; I have discovered truth; and you shall believe!"
The night before Coningsby left Eton, alone in his room, before he retired to rest, he
       opened the lattice and looked for the last time upon the landscape before him; the stately
       keep of Windsor, the bowery meads of Eton, soft in the summer moon and still in the summer
       night. He gazed upon them; his countenance had none of the exultation, that under such
       circumstances
        might have distinguished a more careless glance, eager for fancied emancipation
       and passionate for a novel existence. Its expression was serious, even sad; and he covered
       his brow with his hand.
