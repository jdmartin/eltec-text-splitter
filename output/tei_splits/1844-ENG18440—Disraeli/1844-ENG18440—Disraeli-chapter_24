CHAPTER I.
A great city, whose image dwells in the memory of man, is the type of some great
       idea. Rome represents Conquest; Faith hovers over the towers of Jerusalem; and Athens
       embodies the pre-eminent quality of the antique worldâ€” Art.
In modern ages, Commerce has created London; while Manners, in the most comprehensive sense
       of the word, have long found a
        supreme capital in the airy and bright-minded city of the Seine.
What Art was to the ancient world, Science is to the modern: the distinctive faculty. In
       the minds of men the useful has succeeded to the beautiful. Instead of the city of the Violet
       Crown, a Lancashire village has expanded into a mighty region of factories and warehouses.
       Yet rightly understood, Manchester is as great a human exploit as Athens.
The inhabitants indeed are not as impressed with their idiosyncrasy as the countrymen of
       Pericles and Phidias. They do not fully comprehend the position which they occupy. It is the
       philosopher alone who can comprehend the inconceivable grandeur of Manchester, and the
       immensity of its future. There are yet great truths to tell, if we had either the courage to
       announce or the temper to receive them.
