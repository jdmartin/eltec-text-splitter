CHAPTER IV.
The village clock struck five as Mr. Millbank and his guest entered the gardens of
       his mansion. Coningsby lingered a moment to admire the beauty and gay profusion of the
       flowers.
"Your situation," said Coningsby, looking up the green and silent valley, "is absolutely
       poetic."
"I try sometimes to fancy," said Mr. Millbank, with a rather fierce smile, "that I am in
       the New World."
They entered the house; a capacious and classic hall, at the end a staircase in the Italian
       fashion. As they approached it, the sweetest and the clearest voice exclaimed from above:
        "Papa! papa!" and instantly a young girl came bounding down the stairs, but
       suddenly seeing a stranger with her father she stopped upon the landing place and was
       evidently on the point of as rapidly retreating as she had advanced, when Mr. Millbank waved
       his hand to her and begged her to descend. She came down slowly: as she approached them her
       father said: "A friend you have often heard of Edith: this is Mr. Coningsby."
She started; blushed very much; and then, with a trembling and uncertain gait, advanced,
       put forth her hand with a wild unstudied grace, and said in a tone of sensibility: "How often
       have we all wished to see and to thank you!"
This daughter of his host was of tender years; apparently she could scarcely have counted
       sixteen summers. She was delicate and fragile, but as she raised her still blushing visage to
       her father's guest, Coningsby felt that he had never beheld a countenance of such striking
       and such peculiar beauty.
"My only daughter, Mr. Coningsby; Edith; a Saxon name, for she is the daughter of a
       Saxon."

But the beauty of the countenance was not the beauty of the Saxons. It was a radiant face,
       one of those that seem as if touched in their cradle by a sunbeam, and to have retained all
       its brilliancy and suffused and mantling lustre. One marks sometimes such faces, diaphanous
       with delicate splendour, in the southern regions of France. Her eye too was the rare eye of
       Acquitaine; soft and long, with lashes drooping over the cheek, dark as her clustering
       ringlets.
They entered the drawing-room.
"Mr. Coningsby," said Millbank to his daughter, "is in this part of the world only for a
       few hours, or I am sure he would become our guest. He has, however, promised to stay with us
       now and dine."
"If Miss Millbank will pardon this dress," said Coningsby, bowing an apology for his
       inevitable frock and boots; the maiden raised her eyes and bent her head.
The hour of dinner was at hand. Millbank offered to show Coningsby to his dressing-room. He
       was absent but a few minutes. When he returned he found Miss Millbank alone. He
        came somewhat suddenly into the room. She was playing with her dog, but ceased
       the moment she observed Coningsby.
Coningsby, who since his practice with Lady Everingham, flattered himself that he had
       advanced in small talk, and was not sorry that he had now an opportunity of proving his
       prowess, made some lively observations about pets and the breeds of lap-dogs, but he was not
       fortunate in extracting a response or exciting a repartee. He began then on the beauty of
       Millbank, which he would on no account have avoided seeing, and inquired when she had last
       heard of her brother. The young lady, apparently much distressed, was murmuring something
       about Antwerp, when the entrance of her father relieved her from her embarrassment.
Dinner being announced, Coningsby offered his arm to his fair companion, who took it with
       her eyes fixed on the ground.
"You are very fond, I see, of flowers," said Coningsby, as they moved along; and the young
       lady said, "Yes."
The dinner was plain, but perfect of its kind.
        The young hostess seemed to perform her office with a certain degree of
       desperate determination. She looked at a chicken and then at Coningsby, and murmured
       something which he understood. Sometimes she informed herself of his tasted or necessities in
       more detail, by the medium of her father, whom she treated as a sort of dragoman; in this
       way: "Would not Mr. Coningsby, papa, take this or that, or do so and so?" Coningsby always
       was careful to reply in a direct manner without the agency of the interpreter; but he did not
       advance. Even a petition for the great honour of taking a glass of sherry with her only
       induced the beautiful face to bow. And yet when she had first seen him, she had addressed him
       even with emotion. What could it be? He felt less confidence in his increased power of
       conversation. Why Theresa Sydney was scarcely a year older than Miss Millbank, and though she
       did not certainly originate like Lady Everingham, he got on with her perfectly well.
Mr. Millbank did not seem to be conscious of his daughter's silence: at any rate, he
       attempted to compensate for it. He talked
        fluently and well; on all subjects his opinions seemed to be decided, and his
       language was precise. He was really interested in what Coningsby had seen, and what he had
       felt; and this sympathy divested his manner of the disagreeable effect that accompanies a
       tone inclined to be dictatorial. More than once Coningsby observed the silent daughter
       listening with extreme attention to the conversation of himself and her father.
The dessert was remarkable. Millbank was very proud of his fruit. A bland expression of
       self-complacency spread over his features as he surveyed his grapes, his peaches, his
       figs.
"Those grapes have gained a medal," he told Coningsby. "Those two are prize peaches. I have
       not yet been so successful with my figs. These however promise, and perhaps this year I may
       be more fortunate."
"What would your brother and myself have given for such a dessert at Eton!" said Coningsby
       to Miss Millbank, wishing to say something, and something too that might interest her.

She seemed infinitely distressed, and yet this time would speak:
"Let me give you some." He caught by chance her glance immediately withdrawn; yet it was a
       glance not only of beauty, but of feeling and thought. She added, in a hushed and hurried
       tone, dividing very nervously some grapes: "I hardly know whether Oswald will be most pleased
       or grieved when he hears that you have been here."
"And why grieved?" said Coningsby.
"That he should not have been here to welcome you, and that your stay is for so brief a
       time. It seems so strange that after having talked of you for years, we should see you only
       for hours."
"I hope I may return," said Coningsby, "and that Millbank may be here to welcome me; but I
       hope I may be permitted to return even if he be not."
But there was no reply; and soon after Mr. Millbank talking of the American market, and
       Coningsby helping himself to a glass of claret, the daughter of the Saxon, looking at her
       father,
        rose and left the room, so suddenly and so quickly that Coningsby could scarcely
       gain the door.
"Yes," said Millbank filling his glass, and pursuing some previous observations, "all that
       we want in this country is to be masters of our own industry; but Saxon industry and Norman
       manners never will agree; and some day, Mr. Coningsby, you will find that out."
"But what do you mean by Norman manners?" inquired Coningsby.
"Did you ever hear of the Forest of Rossendale?" said Millbank. "If you were staying here,
       you should visit the district. It is an area of twenty-four square miles. It was disforested
       in the early part of the sixteenth century, possessing at that time eighty inhabitants. Its
       rental in James I's time was £120. When the woollen manufacture was introduced in the north,
       the shuttle competed with the plough in Rossendale, and about forty years ago, we sent them
       the Jenny. The eighty souls are now increased to upwards of eighty thousand, and the rental
       of the forest, by the last county
        assessment, amounts to more than £50,000. 41,000 per cent. On the value in the
       reign of James I. Now I call that an instance of Saxon industry competing successfully with
       Norman manners."
"Exactly," said Coningsby, "but those manners are gone."
"From Rossendale," said Millbank, with a grim smile; "but not from England."
"Where do you meet them?"
"Meet them! In every place, at every hour; and feel them too in every transaction of
       life."
"I know, sir, from your son," said Coningsby, inquiringly, "that you are opposed to an
       aristocracy."
"No, I am not. I am for an aristocracy; but a real one, a natural one."
"But, sir, is not the aristocracy of England," said Coningsby, "a real one? You do not
       confound our peerage for example with the degraded patricians of the continent."
"Hum!" said Millbank. "I do not understand how an aristocracy can exist, unless it be
       distinguished by some quality which no other
        class of the community possesses. Distinction is the basis of aristocracy. If
       you permit only one class of the population, for example, to bear arms, they are an
       aristocracy; not one much to my taste; but still a great fact. That, however, is not the
       characteristic of the English peerage. I have yet to learn they are richer than we are,
       better informed, wiser, or more distinguished for public or private virtue. Is it not
       monstrous then that a small number of men, several of whom take the titles of Duke and Earl
       from towns in this very neighbourhood, towns which they never saw, which never heard of them,
       which they did not form, or build, or establish, I say is it not monstrous, that individuals
       so circumstanced should be invested with the highest of conceivable privileges—the privilege
       of making laws? Dukes and Earls indeed! I say there is nothing in a masquerade more
       ridiculous."
"But do you not argue from an exception, sir," said Coningsby. "The question is, whether a
       preponderance of the aristocratic principle in a political constitution be, as I believe,
       conducive
        to the stability and permanent power of a state, and whether the peerage, as
       established in England, generally tends to that end. We must not forget in such an estimate
       the influence which, in this country, is exercised over opinion by ancient lineage."
"Ancient lineage!" said Mr. Millbank; "I never heard of a peer with an ancient lineage. The
       real old families of this country are to be found among the peasantry; the gentry, too, may
       lay some claim to old blood. I can point you out Saxon families in this county who can trace
       their pedigrees beyond the Conquest; I know of some Norman gentlemen whose fathers
       undoubtedly came over with the Conqueror. But a peer with an ancient lineage is to me quite a
       novelty. No, no; the thirty years of the wars of the Roses freed us from those gentlemen. I
       take it after the Battle of Tewkesbury, a Norman baron was almost as rare a being in England
       as a wolf is now."
"I have always understood," said Coningsby, "that our peerage was the finest in
       Europe."
"From themselves," said Millbank, "and
        the heralds they pay to paint their carriages. But I go to facts. When Henry
       VII. called his first parliament, there were only twenty-nine temporal peers to be found, and
       even some of them took their seats illegally, for they had been attainted. Of those
       twenty-nine not five remain, and they, as the Howards for instance, are not Norman nobility.
       We owe the English peerage to three sources: the spoliation of the church; the open and
       flagrant sale of its honours by the elder Stuarts; and the boroughmongering of our own times.
       Those are the three main sources of the existing peerage of England, and in my opinion
       disgraceful ones. But I must apologize for my frankness in thus speaking to an
       aristocrat."
"Oh! by no means, sir; I like discussion. your son and myself at Eton have had some
       encounters of this kind before. But if your view of the case be correct," added Coningsby,
       smiling, "you cannot at any rate accuse our present peers of Norman manners."
"Yes I do. They adopted Norman manners while they usurped Norman titles. They have
        neither the right of the Normans, nor do they fulfil the duty of the Normans:
       they did not conquer the land, and they do not defend it."
"And where will you find your natural aristocracy?" asked Coningsby.
"Among those men whom a nation recognizes as the most eminent for virtue, talents, and
       property, and if you please, birth and standing in the land. They guide opinion; and
       therefore they govern. I am no leveller; I look upon an artificial equality as equally
       pernicious with a factitious aristocracy; both depressing the energies, and checking the
       enterprise of a nation. I like man to be free; really free; free in his industry as well as
       his body. What is the use of Habeas Corpus, if a man may not use his hands when he is out of
       prison?"
"But it appears to me you have, in a great measure, this natural aristocracy in
       England."
"Ah! to be sure! If we had not, where should we be? It is the counteracting power that
       saves us: the disturbing cause in the calculations of short sighted selfishness. I say it
       now, and I have said it a hundred times, the
        House of Commons is a more aristocratic body than the House of Lords. The fact
       is, a great peer would be a greater man now in the House of Commons than in the House of
       Lords. Nobody wants a second chamber, except a few disreputable individuals. It is a valuable
       institution for any member of it who has no distinction; neither character, talents, nor
       estate. But a peer who possesses all or any of these great qualifications, would find himself
       an immeasurably more important personage in what, by way of jest, they call the Lower
       House."
"Is not the revising wisdom of a senate a salutary check on the precipitation of a popular
       assembly?"
"Why should a popular assembly elected by the flower of a nation, be precipitate? If
       precipitate, what senate could stay an assembly so chosen? No, no, no; the thing has been
       tried over and over again; the idea of restraining the powerful by the weak is an absurdity;
       the question is settled. If we wanted a fresh illustration, we need only look to the present
        state of our own House of Lords. It originates nothing; it has, in fact,
       announced itself as a mere Court of Registration of the decrees of your House of Commons; and
       if by any chance it ventures to alter some miserable detail in a clause of a bill that
       excites public interest, what a clatter through the country, at conservative banquets, got up
       by the rural attorneys, about the power, authority, and independence of the House of Lords;
       nine times nine, and one cheer more! No, sir, you may make aristocracies by laws; you can
       only maintain them by manners. The manners of England preserve it from its laws. And they
       have substituted for our formal aristocracy an essential aristocracy; the government of those
       who are distinguished by their fellow-citizens."
"But then it would appear," said Coningsby, "that the remedial action of our manners has
       removed all the political and social evils of which you complain?"
"They have created a power that may remove them; a power that has the capacity to remove
       them. But in a very great measure they
        still exist; and must exist yet, I fear, for a very long time. The growth of our
       civilization has ever been as slow as our oaks; but this tardy development is preferable to
       the temporary expansion of the gourd."
"The future seems to me sometimes a dark cloud."
"Not to me," said Mr. Millbank. "I am sanguine; I am the Disciple of Progress. But I have
       cause for my faith. I have witnessed advance. My father has often told me that in his early
       days, the displeasure of a peer of England was like a sentence of death to a man. Why it was
       esteemed a great concession to public opinion, so late as the reign of George II, that Lord
       Ferrers should be executed for murder. The King of a new dynasty who wished to be popular
       with the people insisted on it, and even then he was hanged with a silken cord. At any rate
       we may defend ourselves now," continued Mr. Millbank, "and perhaps do something more. I defy
       any peer to crush me, though there is one who would be very glad to do it. No more of that; I
       am very happy
        to see you at Millbank; very happy to make your acquaintance," he continued with
       some emotion, "and not merely because you are my son's friend and more than friend."
The walls of the dining-room were covered with pictures of great merit; all of the modern
       English school. Mr. Millbank understood no other, he was wont to say, and he found that many
       of his friends who did, bought a great many pleasing pictures that were copies, and many
       originals that were very displeasing. He loved a fine free landscape by Lee, that gave him
       the broad plains, the green lanes, and running streams of his own land; a group of animals by
       Landseer as full of speech and sentiment as if they were designed by Æsop; above all he
       delighted in the household humour and homely pathos of Wilkie. And if a higher tone of
       imagination pleased him, he could gratify it without difficulty among his favourite masters.
       He possessed some specimens of Etty worthy of Venice when it was alive; he could muse amid
       the twilight ruins of ancient cities raised by the magic pencil of Danby, or accompany a
        group of fair Neapolitans to a festival by the genial aid of Uwins.
Opposite Coningsby was a portrait, which had greatly attracted his attention during the
       whole dinner. It represented a woman extremely young and of a rare beauty. The costume was of
       that classical character prevalent in this country before the general peace; a blue ribband
       bound together as a fillet her clustering chestnut curls. The face was looking out of the
       canvass, and Coningsby never raised his eyes without catching its glance of blended vivacity
       and tenderness.
There are moments when our sensibility is affected by circumstances of a very trivial
       character. It seems a fantastic emotion, but the gaze of this picture disturbed the serenity
       of Coningsby. He endeavoured sometimes to avoid looking at it, but it irresistibly attracted
       him. More than once during the dinner he longed to inquire whom it represented; but it is a
       delicate subject to ask questions about portraits, and he refrained. Still when he was rising
       to leave the room, the impulse was irresistible. He said to Mr. Millbank, "By whom is that
       portrait, sir?"

The countenance of millbank became disturbed; it was not an expression of tender
       reminiscence that fell upon his features. On the contrary, the expression was agitated,
       almost angry.
"Oh! that is by a country artist," he said, "of whom you never heard," and moved away.
They found Miss Millbank in the drawing-room. She was sitting at a round table covered with
       working materials, apparently dressing a doll.
"Nay," thought Coningsby, "she must be too old for that!"
He addressed her and seated himself by her side. There were several dolls on the table, but
       he discovered, on examination, that they were pincushions; and elicited with some difficulty,
       that they were making for a fancy fair about to be held in aid of that excellent Institution,
       the Manchester Athenæum. Then the father came up and said:
"My child, let us have some tea," and she rose, and seated herself at the tea-table.
       Coningsby also quitted his seat, and surveyed the apartment.

There were several musical instruments; among others he observed a guitar; not such an
       instrument as one buys in a music-shop, but such an one as tinkles at Seville; a genuine
       Spanish guitar. Coningsby repaired to the tea-table.
"I am glad that you are fond of music, Miss Millbank?"
A blush and a bow.
"I hope after tea you will be so kind as to touch the guitar."
Signals of great distress.
"Were you ever at Birmingham?"
"Yes!" a sigh.
"What a splendid music hall! They should build one at Manchester."
"They ought," in a whisper.
The tea-tray was removed; Coningsby was conversing with Mr. Millbank, who was asking him
       questions about his son; what he thought of Oxford; what he thought of Oriel; should himself
       have preferred Cambridge; but had consulted a friend, an Oriel man, who had a great opinion
       of Oriel; and Oswald's name had
        been entered some years back. He rather regretted it now; but the thing was
       done. Coningsby, remembering the promise of the guitar, turned round to claim its fulfilment,
       but the singer had made her escape. Time elapsed, and no Miss Millbank re-appeared. Coningsby
       looked at his watch; he had to go three miles to the train, which started, as his friend of
       the previous night would phrase it, at 9-45.
"I should be happy if you remained with us," said Mr. Millbank; "but as you say it is out
       of your power, in this age of punctual travelling, a host is bound to speed the parting
       guest. The carriage is ready for you."
"Farewell then, sir. You must make my adieux to Miss Millbank, and accept my thanks for
       your great kindness."
"Farewell, Mr. Coningsby," said his host, taking his hand, which he retained for a moment
       as if he would say more. Then leaving it, he repeated with a somewhat wandering air, and in a
       voice of emotion, "Farewell—farewell, Mr. Coningsby."
