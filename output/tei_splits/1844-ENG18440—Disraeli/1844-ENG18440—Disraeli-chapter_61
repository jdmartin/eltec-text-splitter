CHAPTER VI.
It was past the dinner hour when Edith and Coningsby reached the Hall; an
       embarrassing circumstance, but mitigated by the conviction, that they had not to encounter a
       very critical inspection. What then were their feelings, when the first servant that they met
       informed them, that Mr. Millbank had arrived! Edith never could have believed, that the
       return of her beloved father to his home could ever have been to her other than a cause of
       delight. And yet now she trembled when she heard the announcement. The mysteries of love were
       fast involving her existence. But this was not the
        season of meditation. Her heart was still agitated by the tremulous admission
       that she responded to that fervent and adoring love whose eloquent music still sounded in her
       ear, and the pictures of whose fanciful devotion flitted over her agitated vision.
       Unconsciously she pressed the arm of Coningsby as the servant spoke, and then without looking
       into his face, whispering him to be quick, she sprang away.
As for Coningsby, notwithstanding the elation of his heart, and the ethereal joy which
       flowed in all his veins, the name of Mr. Millbank sounded something like a knell. However
       this was not the time to reflect. He obeyed the hint of Edith; made the most rapid toilette
       that ever was consummated by a happy lover, and in a few minutes entered the drawing-room of
       Hellingsley; to encounter the gentleman whom he hoped by some means or other, quite
       inconceivable, might some day be transformed into his father-in-law, and the fulfilment of
       his consequent duties towards whom he had commenced by keeping him waiting for dinner.
"How do you do, sir?" said Mr. Millbank,
        extending his hand to Coningsby. "You seem to have taken a long walk."
Coningsby looked round to the kind Lady Wallinger, and half addressed his murmured answer
       to her, explaining how they had lost her, and their way, and were caught in a storm or a
       shower, which as it terminated about three hours back, and the fishing cottage was little
       more than a mile from the Hall, very satisfactorily accounted for their not being in time for
       dinner.
Lady Wallinger then said something about the lowering clouds having frightened her from the
       terrace, and Sir Joseph and Oswald talked a little of their sport, and of their having seen
       an otter; but there was or at least there seemed to Coningsby a tone of general embarrassment
       which distressed him. The fact is keeping people for dinner under any circumstances is
       distressing. They are obliged to talk at the very moment when they wish to use their powers
       of expression for a very different purpose. They are faint, and conversation makes them more
       exhausted. A gentleman too, fond of his family,
        who in turn are devoted to him, making a great and inconvenient effort to reach
       them by dinner time; to please and surprise them; and finding them all dispersed, dinner so
       late, that he might have reached home in good time without any great inconvenient effort, his
       daughter whom he has wished a thousand times to embrace, taking a singularly long ramble with
       no other companion than a young gentleman, whom he did not exactly expect to see; all these
       are circumstances individually perhaps slight, and yet encountered collectively, it may be
       doubted whether they would not a little ruffle even the sweetest temper.
Mr. Millbank too had not the sweetest temper, though not a bad one; a little quick and
       fiery. But then he had a kind heart. And when Edith, who had providentially sent down a
       message to order dinner, entered and embraced him at the very moment that dinner was
       announced, her father forgot everything in his joy in seeing her, and his pleasure in being
       surrounded by his friends. He gave his hand to Lady Wallinger; and Sir Joseph led away
        his niece. Coningsby put his arm round the astonished neck of Oswald as if they
       were once more in the playing fields of Eton.
"By Jove! my dear fellow," he exclaimed, "I am so sorry we kept your father for
       dinner."
As Edith headed her father's table, according to his rigid rule, Coningsby was on one side
       of her. They never spoke so little; Coningsby would have never unclosed his lips, had he
       followed his humour. He was in a stupor of happiness; the dining-room took the appearance of
       the fishing cottage; and he saw nothing but the flowing river. Lady Wallinger was however
       next to him, and that was a relief; for he felt always she was his friend. Sir Joseph a
       good-hearted man, and on subjects with which he was acquainted full of sound sense, was
       invaluable to-day, for he entirely kept up the conversation, speaking of things which greatly
       interested Mr. Millbank. And so their host soon recovered his good temper; he addressed
       several times his observations to Coningsby, and was careful to take wine with
        him. On the whole, affairs went on flowingly enough. The gentlemen indeed
       stayed much longer over their wine than on the preceding days, and Coningsby did not venture
       on the liberty of quitting the room before his host. It was as well. Edith required repose.
       She tried to seek it on the bosom of her aunt, as she breathed to her the delicious secret of
       her life. When the gentlemen returned to the drawing-room, the ladies were not there.
This rather disturbed Mr. Millbank again; he had not seen enough of his daughter; he wished
       to hear her sing. But Edith managed to reappear; and even to sing. Then Coningsby went up to
       her and asked her to sing the song of the Girls of Granada. She said in a low voice, and with
       a fond yet serious look,
"I am not in the mood for such a song, but if you wish meâ€”"
She sang it and with inexpressible grace, and with an arch vivacity, that to a fine
       observer would have singularly contrasted with the almost
        solemn and even troubled expression of her countenance a moment afterwards.
The day was about to die; the day the most important, the most precious, in the lives of
       Harry Coningsby and Edith Millbank. Words had been spoken, vows breathed, which were to
       influence their careers for ever. For them hereafter there was to be but one life, one
       destiny, one world. Each of them was still in such a state of tremulous excitement, that
       neither had found time or occasion to ponder over the mighty result. They both required
       solitude; they both longed to be alone. Coningsby rose to depart. He pressed the soft hand of
       Edith, and his glance spoke his soul.
"We shall see you at breakfast to-morrow, Coningsby!" said Oswald, very loud, knowing that
       the presence of his father would make Coningsby hesitate about coming. Edith's heart
       fluttered; but she said nothing. It was with delight she heard her father, after a moment's
       pause, say,
"Oh! I beg we may have that pleasure."
"Not quite at so early an hour," said Coningsby,
        "but if you will permit me, I hope to have the pleasure of hearing from you
       to-morrow, sir, that your journey has not fatigued you."
