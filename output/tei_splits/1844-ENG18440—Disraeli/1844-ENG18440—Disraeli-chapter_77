CHAPTER VII.
The marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn. It was
       solemnized at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at Hellingsley, which place was in
       future to be the residence of the member for Darlford. The estate was to devolve to Coningsby
       after the death of Mr. Millbank who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted the
       newlymarried couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its occupants. All these
       settlements, as Mr. Millbank assured Coningsby, were effected not only with the sanction, but
       at the express instance, of his son.

An event however occurred not very long after the marriage of Coningsby which rendered this
       generous conduct of his father-in-law no longer necessary to his fortunes, though he never
       forgot its exercise. The gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with
       which her spirit had never greatly sympathized. Perhaps she might have lingered in life for
       yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal inheritance which disturbed her peace and
       embittered her days, haunting her heart with the recollection that she had been the
       unconscious instrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing and
       encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her nature. The marriage of
       Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from that day she seemed gradually to decline. She
       died towards the end of the autumn, and subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she
       bequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith. Gratifying as it was to him to
       present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not without a pang that he received the
       intelligence of the death of Flora. Edith sympathized in his affectionate feelings,
        and they raised a monument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.
Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful and gifted wife by
       his side and surrounded by the friends of his heart and his youth.
They stand now on the threshold of public life. They are in the leash, but in a moment they
       will be slipped. What will be their fate? Will they maintain in august assemblies and high
       places the great truths which in study and in solitude they have embraced? Or will their
       courage exhaust itself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted
       ridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the tawdry temptations
       of a low ambition? Will their skilled intelligence subside into being the adroit tool of a
       corrupt party? Will Vanity confound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies? Or
       will they remain brave, single and true; refuse to bow before shadows and worship phrases;
       sensible of the greatness of their position recognise the greatness of their duties; denounce
       to a perplexed and disheartened world the frigid theories of
        a generalizing age that have destroyed the individuality of man; and restore
       the happiness of their country by believing in their own energies, and daring to be
       great!
THE END.
