CHAPTER IX.
 Morley paused as he recognised Egremont; then advancing to Gerard, followed by his
       companion, he said, “This is Mr Hatton of whom we were speaking last night, and who claims to
       be an ancient acquaintance of yours.”
 “Perhaps I should rather say of your poor dear father,” said Hatton, scanning Gerard with
       his clear blue eye, and then he added, “He was of great service to me in my youth, and one is
       not apt to forget such things.”
 “One ought not,” said Gerard: “but it is a sort of memory, as I have understood, that is
       rather rare. For my part I remember you very well, Baptist Hatton,” said Gerard, examining
        his guest with almost as complete a scrutiny as he had himself experienced.
       “This world has gone well with you, I am glad to hear and see.”
 “Qui laborat, orat,” said Hatton in a silvery voice, “is the gracious maxim of our Holy
       Church; and I venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted, for I have
       laboured in my time,” and as he was speaking these words, he turned and addressed them to
       Sybil.
 She beheld him with no little interest; this mysterious name that had sounded so often in
       her young ears, and was associated with so many strange and high hopes, and some dark
       blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts. Hatton in his appearance realised
       little of the fancies in which Sybil had sometime indulged with regard to him. That
       appearance was prepossessing: a frank and even benevolent expression played upon his
       intelligent and handsome countenance: his once rich brown hair, still long though very thin,
       was so arranged as naturally to conceal his baldness; he was dressed with great
       simplicity, but with remarkable taste and care: nor did the repose and suavity of his manner
       and the hushed tone of his voice detract from the favourable effect that he always at once
       produced.
 “Qui laborat, orat,” said Sybil with a smile, “is the privilege of the people.”
 “Of whom I am one,” said Hatton bowing, well recollecting that he was addressing the
       daughter of a chartist delegate.
 “But is your labour, their labour,” said Sybil. “Is yours that life of uncomplaining toil
       wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness, that by the fine maxim of our Church, it
       is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer?”
 “I am sure that I should complain of no toil that would benefit you,” said Hatton; and
       then addressing himself again to Gerard, he led him to a distant part of the room where they
       were soon engaged in earnest converse. Morley at the same moment approached Sybil, and spoke
       to her in a subdued tone. Egremont feeling embarrassed advanced, and bade her
       farewell. She rose and returned his salute with some ceremony; then hesitating while a soft
       expression came over her countenance, she held forth her hand, which he retained for a
       moment, and withdrew.
 “I was with him more than an hour,” continued Morley. “At first he recollected nothing:
       even the name of Gerard, though he received it as familiar to him, seemed to produce little
       impression; he recollected nothing of any papers; was clear that they must have been quite
       insignificant; whatever they were, he doubtless had them now, as he never destroyed papers:
       would order a search to be made for them, and so on. I was about to withdraw, when he asked
       me carelessly a question about your father; what he was doing, and whether he were married
       and had children. This led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take
       great interest. At first he talked of writing to see your father, and I offered that Gerard
       should call upon him. He took down your direction in order that he might write
       to your father and give him an appointment; when observing that it was Westminster, he said
       that his carriage was ordered to go to the House of Lords in a quarter of an hour, and that
       if not inconvenient to me, he would propose that I should at once accompany him. I thought,
       whatever might be the result, it must be a satisfaction to Gerard at last to see this man of
       whom he has talked and thought so much—and so we are here.”
 “You did well, good Stephen, as you always do,” said Sybil with a musing and abstracted
       air; “no one has so much forethought and so much energy as you.”
 He threw a glance at her: and immediately withdrew it. Their eyes had met: hers were kind
       and calm.
 “And this Egremont,” said Morley rather hurriedly and abruptly, and looking on the ground,
       “how came he here? When we discovered him yesterday your father and myself agreed that we
       should not mention to you the—the mystification of which we had been dupes.”
 “And you did wrong,” said Sybil. “There is no wisdom like frankness. Had you told me, he
       would not have been here today. He met and addressed me, and I only recognised an
       acquaintance who had once contributed so much to the pleasantness of our life. Had he not
       accompanied me to this door and met my father, which precipitated an explanation on his part
       which he found had not been given by others, I might have remained in an ignorance which
       hereafter might have produced inconvenience.”
 “You are right,” said Morley, looking at her rather keenly. “We have all of us opened
       ourselves too unreservedly before this aristocrat.”
 “I should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten,” said
       Sybil. “He chose to wear a disguise, and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we
       spoke of his order or his family. And for the rest, he has not been injured from learning
       something of the feelings of the people by living among them.”

 “And yet if anything were to happen to-morrow,” said Morley, “rest assured this man has
       his eye on us. He can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale, for
       though one of the pseudo-opposition, the moment the people move, the factions become
       united.”
 Sybil turned and looked at him, and then said, “And what could happen to-morrow, that we
       should care for the government being acquainted with it or us? Do not they know everything?
       Do not you meet in their very sight? You pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means—do you
       not? What then is there to fear? And why should anything happen that should make us
       apprehensive?”
 “All is very well at this moment,” said Morley, “and all may continue well; but popular
       assemblies breed turbulent spirits, Sybil. Your father takes a leading part; he is a great
       orator, and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life. It does not much suit me; I
       am a man of the closet. This Convention, as you well know, was never much to my
       taste. Their Charter is a coarse specific for our social evils. The spirit that would cure
       our ills must be of a deeper and finer mood.”
 “Then why are you here?” said Sybil.
 Morley shrugged his shoulders, and then said “An easy question. Questions are always easy.
       The fact is, in active life one cannot afford to refine. I could have wished the movement to
       have taken a different shape and to have worked for a different end; but it has not done
       this. But it is still a movement and a great one, and I must work it for my end and try to
       shape it to my form. If I had refused to be a leader, I should not have prevented the
       movement; I should only have secured my own insignificance.”
 “But my father has not these fears; he is full of hope and exultation,” said Sybil. “And
       surely it is a great thing that the people should have their Parliament lawfully meeting in
       open day, and their delegates from the whole realm declaring their grievances in language
       which would not disgrace the conquering race which has in vain endeavoured to
       degrade them. When I heard my father speak the other night, my heart glowed with emotion; my
       eyes were suffused with tears; I was proud to be his daughter; and I gloried in a race of
       forefathers who belonged to the oppressed and not to the oppressors.”
 Morley watched the deep splendour of her eye and the mantling of her radiant cheek, as she
       spoke these latter words with not merely animation but fervour. Her bright hair, that hung on
       either side her face in long tresses of luxuriant richness, was drawn off a forehead that was
       the very throne of thought and majesty, while her rich lip still quivered with the
       sensibility which expressed its impassioned truth.
 “But your father, Sybil, stands alone,” at length Morley replied; “surrounded by votaries
       who have nothing but enthusiasm to recommend them; and by emulous and intriguing rivals, who
       watch every word and action, in order that they may discredit his conduct, and ultimately
       secure his downfall.”
 “My father’s downfall!” said Sybil. “Is he not one of themselves! And is it possible, that
       among the delegates of the People there can be other than one and the same object?”
 “A thousand,” said Morley; “we have already as many parties as in St Stephen’s
       itself.”
 “You terrify me,” said Sybil. “I knew we had fearful odds to combat against. My visit to
       this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies. But I believed that we had on our
       side God and Truth.”
 “They know neither of them in the National Convention,” said Morley. “Our career will be a
       vulgar caricature of the bad passions and the low intrigues, the factions and the failures,
       of our oppressors.”
 At this moment Gerard and Hatton who were sitting in the remote part of the room rose
       together and advanced forward; and this movement interrupted the conversation of Sybil and
       Morley. Before however her father and his new friend could reach them, Hatton as
       if some point on which he had not been sufficiently explicit, had occurred to him, stopped
       and placing his hand on Gerard’s arm, withdrew him again, saying in a voice which could only
       be heard by the individual whom he addressed. “You understand—I have not the slightest doubt
       myself of your moral right: I believe on every principle of justice, that Mowbray Castle is
       as much yours as the house that is built by the tenant on the lord’s land: but can we prove
       it? We never had the legal evidence. You are in error in supposing that these papers were of
       any vital consequence; mere memoranda; very useful no doubt: I hope I shall find them; but of
       no validity. If money were the only difficulty, trust me, it should not be wanting; I owe
       much to the memory of your father, my good Gerard; I would fain serve you—and your daughter.
       I’ll not tell you what I would do for you, my good Gerard. You would think me foolish; but I
       am alone in the world, and seeing you again, and talking of old times—I really am scarcely
       fit for business. Go, however, I must; I have an appointment at the House of
       Lords. Good bye. I must say farewell to the Lady Sybil.”
