CHAPTER X.
 About noon of this day there was a great stir in Mowbray. It was generally whispered about
       that the Liberator at the head of the Hell-cats and all others who chose to accompany them
       was going to pay a visit to Mr Trafford’s settlement, in order to avenge an insult which his
       envoys had experienced early in the morning when, accompanied by a rabble of two or three
       hundred persons, they had repaired to the Mowedale works in order to signify the commands of
       the Liberator that labour should stop, and if necessary to enforce those commands. The
       injunctions were disregarded, and when the mob in pursuance of their further
       instructions began to force the great gates of the premises, in order that they might enter
       the building, drive the plugs out of the steam-boilers, and free the slaves enclosed, a
       masqued battery of powerful engines was suddenly opened upon them, and the whole band of
       patriots were deluged. It was impossible to resist a power which seemed inexhaustible, and
       wet to the skins and amid the laughter of their adversaries they fled. This ridiculous
       catastrophe had terribly excited the ire of the Liberator. He vowed vengeance, and as, like
       all great revolutionary characters and military leaders, the only foundation of his power was
       constant employment for his troops and constant excitement for the populace, he determined to
       place himself at the head of the chastising force, and make a great example which should
       establish his awful reputation and spread the terror of his name throughout the district.
 Field the Chartist had soon discovered who were the rising spirits of Mowbray, and
       Devilsdust and Dandy Mick were both sworn on Monday morning of the council of the Liberator,
        and took their seats at the board accordingly. Devilsdust, used to public
       business and to the fulfilment of responsible duties, was calm and grave, but equally ready
       and determined. Mick’s head on the contrary was quite turned by the importance of his novel
       position. He was greatly excited, could devise nothing and would do anything, always followed
       Devilsdust in council, but when he executed their joint decrees and showed himself about the
       town, he strutted like a peacock, swore at the men and winked at the girls, and was the idol
       and admiration of every gaping or huzzaing younker.
 There was a large crowd assembled in the Market Place, in which were the Liberator’s
       lodgings, many of them armed in their rude fashion, and all anxious to march. Devilsdust was
       with the great man and Field; Mick below was marshalling the men, and swearing like a trooper
       at all who disobeyed or who misunderstood.
 “Come stupid,” said he addressing Tummas, “what are you staring about? Get your men in
       order or I’ll be among you.”

 “Stupid!” said Tummas, staring at Mick with immense astonishment. “And who are you who
       says ‘Stupid?’ A white-livered Handloom as I dare say, or a son of a gun of a factory slave.
       Stupid indeed! What next, when a Hell-cat is to be called stupid by such a thing as you?”
 “I’ll give you a piece of advice young man,” said Master Nixon taking his pipe out of his
       mouth and blowing an immense puff; “just you go down the shaft for a couple of months, and
       then you’ll learn a little of life, which is wery useful.”
 The lively temperament of the Dandy would here probably have involved him in an
       inconvenient embroilment had not some one at this moment touched him on the shoulder, and
       looking round he recognised Mr Morley. Notwithstanding the difference of their political
       schools Mick had a profound respect for Morley, though why he could not perhaps precisely
       express. But he had heard Devilsdust for years declare that Stephen Morley was the deepest
       head in Mowbray, and though he regretted the unfortunate weakness in favour of
       that imaginary abstraction called Moral Force for which the editor of the Phalanx was
       distinguished, still Devilsdust used to say that if ever the great revolution were to occur
       by which the rights of labour were to be recognised, though bolder spirits and brawnier arms
       might consummate the change, there was only one head among them that would be capable when
       they had gained their power to guide it for the public weal, and as Devilsdust used to add,
       “carry out the thing,” and that was Morley.
 It was a fine summer day, and Mowedale was as resplendent as when Egremont amid its
       beauties first began to muse over the beautiful. There was the same bloom over the sky, the
       same shadowy lustre on the trees, the same sparkling brilliancy on the waters. A herdsman
       following some kine was crossing the stone bridge, and except their lowing as they stopped
       and sniffed the current of fresh air in its centre, there was not a sound.
 Suddenly the tramp and hum of a multitude broke upon the sunshiny silence. A vast crowd with some assumption of an ill-disciplined order approached from the
       direction of Mowbray. At their head rode a man on a white mule. Many of his followers were
       armed with bludgeons and other rude weapons, and moved in files. Behind them spread a more
       miscellaneous throng, in which women were not wanting and even children. They moved rapidly;
       they swept by the former cottage of Gerard; they were in sight of the settlement of
       Trafford.
 “All the waters of the river shall not dout the blaze that I will light up to-day,” said
       the Liberator.
 “He is a most inveterate Capitalist,” said Field, “and would divert the minds of the
       people from the Five Points by allotting them gardens and giving them baths.”
 “We will have no more gardens in England; everything shall be open,” said the Liberator,
       “and baths shall only be used to drown the enemies of the People. I was always against
       washing; it takes the marrow out of a man.”
 “Here we are,” said Field, as the roofs and bowers of the village, the spire
       and the spreading factory, broke upon them. “Every door and every window closed! The
       settlement is deserted. Some one has been before us and apprised them of our arrival.”
 “Will they pour water on me?” said the Bishop. “It must be a stream indeed that shall put
       out the blaze that I am going to light. What shall we do first? Halt there, you men,” said
       the Liberator looking back with that scowl which his apprentices never could forget. “Will
       you halt or won’t you? or must I be among you?”
 There was a tremulous shuffling and then a comparative silence.
 The women and children of the village had been gathered into the factory yard, of which
       the great gates were closed.
 “What shall we burn first?” asked the Bishop.
 “We may as well parley with them a little,” said Field; “perhaps we may contrive to gain
       admission and then we can sack the whole affair, and let the people burn the machinery. It
       will be a great moral lesson.”

 “As long as there is burning,” said the Bishop, “I don’t care what lessons you teach them.
       I leave them to you; but I will have fire to put out that water.”
 “I’ll advance,” said Field, and so saying he went forward and rang at the gate; the
       Bishop, on his mule, with a dozen Hell-cats accompanying him; the great body of the people
       about twenty yards withdrawn.
 “Who rings?” asked a loud voice.
 “One who by the order of the Liberator wishes to enter and see whether his commands for a
       complete cessation of labour have been complied with in this establishment.”
 “Very good,” said the Bishop.
 “There is no hand at work here,” said the voice; “and you may take my word for it.”
 “Your word be hanged,” said the Bishop. “I want to know—”
 “Hush, hush!” said Field, and then in a louder voice he said, “It may be so, but as our
       messengers this morning were not permitted to enter and were treated with great
       indignity—”
 “That’s it,” said the Bishop.
 “With great indignity,” continued Field, “we must have ocular experience of the state of
       affairs, and I beg and recommend you therefore at once to let the Liberator enter.”
 “None shall enter here,” replied the unseen guardian of the gate.
 “That’s enough,” cried the Bishop.
 “Beware!” said Field.
 “Whether you let us in or not, ‘tis all the same,” said the Bishop; “I will have fire for
       your water, and I have come for that. Now lads!”
 “Stop,” said the voice of the unseen. “I will speak to you.”
 “He is going to let us in,” whispered Field to the Bishop.
 And suddenly there appeared on the flat roof of the lodge that was on one side of the
       gates—Gerard. His air, his figure, his position were alike commanding, and at the sight of
       him a loud and spontaneous cheer burst from the assembled thousands. It was the sight of one
       who was after all the most popular leader of the people that had ever figured in
       these parts, whose eloquence charmed and commanded, whose disinterestedness was acknowledged,
       whose sufferings had created sympathy, whose courage, manly bearing, and famous feats of
       strength were a source to them of pride. There was not a Mowbray man whose heart did not
       throb with emotion, and whose memory did not recall the orations from the Druid’s altar and
       the famous meetings on the moor. “Gerard for ever” was the universal shout.
 The Bishop who liked no one to be cheered except himself, like many great men, was much
       disgusted, a little perplexed. “What does all this mean?” he whispered to Field. “I came here
       to burn down the place.”
 “Wait awhile,” said Field, “we must humour the Mowbray men a bit. This is their favourite
       leader, at least was in old days. I know him well; he is a bold and honest man.”
 “Is this the man who ducked my people?” asked the Bishop fiercely.
 “Hush!” said Field; “he is going to speak.”
 “My friends,” said Gerard, “for if we are not friends who should be? (loud cheers and
       cries of “Very true”), if you come hear to learn whether the Mowedale works are stopped, I
       give you my word there is not a machine or man that stirs here at this moment (great
       cheering). I believe you’ll take my word (cheers, and cries of “We will”). I believe I’m
       known at Mowbray (“Gerard for ever!”), and on Mowbray Moor too (tumultous cheering). We have
       met together before this (“That we have”), and shall meet again yet (great cheering). The
       people haven’t so many friends that they should quarrel with well-wishers. The master here
       has done his best to soften your lots. He is not one of those who deny that Labour has rights
       (loud cheers). I say that Mr Trafford has always acknowledged the rights of Labour (prolonged
       cheers and cries of “So he has”). Well, is he the man that we should injure? (“No, no”). What
       if he did give a cold reception to some visitors this morning—(groans)—perhaps they wore
       faces he was not used to (loud cheers and laughter from the Mowbray people). I dare say they
       mean as well as we do—no doubt of that—but still a neighbour’s a neighbour (immense
       cheering). Now, my lads, three cheers for the National Holiday,” and Gerard gave the time,
       and his voice was echoed by the thousands present. “The master here has no wish to interfere
       with the National Holiday; all he wants to secure is that all mills and works should alike
       stop (cries of “Very just”). And I say so too,” continued Gerard. “It is just; just and manly
       and like a true-born Englishman as he is, who loves the people and whose fathers before him
       loved the people (great cheering). Three cheers for Mr Trafford I say;” and they were given;
       “and three cheers for Mrs Trafford too, the friend of the poor!” Here the mob became not only
       enthusiastic but maudlin; all vowing to each other that Trafford was a true-born Englishman
       and his wife a very angel upon earth. This popular feeling is so contagious that even the
       Hell-cats shared it—cheering, shaking hands with each other, and almost shedding tears—though
       it must be confessed that they had some vague idea that it was all to end in something to
       drink.
 Their great leader however remained unmoved, and nothing but his brutal stupidity could
       have prevented him from endeavouring to arrest the tide of public feeling, but he was quite
       bewildered by the diversion, and for the first time failed in finding a prompter in Field.
       The Chartist was cowed by Gerard; his old companion in scenes that the memory lingered over,
       and whose superior genius had often controlled and often led him. Gerard too had recognized
       him and had made some personal allusion and appeal to him, which alike touched his conscience
       and flattered his vanity. The ranks were broken, the spirit of the expedition had dissolved,
       the great body were talking of returning, some of the stragglers indeed were on their way
       back, the Bishop silent and confused kept knocking the mane of his mule with his hammer.
 “Now,” said Morley who during this scene had stood apart accompanied by
       Devilsdust and Dandy Mick. “Now,” said Morley to the latter, “now is your time.”
 “Gentlemen!” sang out Mick.
 “A speech, a speech!” cried out several.
 “Listen to Mick Radley,” whispered Devilsdust moving swiftly among the mob and addressing
       every one he met of influence. “Listen to Mick Radley, he has something important.”
 “Radley for ever! Listen to Mick Radley! Go it Dandy! Pitch it into them! Silence for
       Dandy Mick! Jump up on that ere bank,” and on the bank Mick mounted accordingly.
 “Gentlemen,” said Mick.
 “Well you have said that before.”
 “I like to hear him say ‘Gentlemen;’ it’s respectful.”
 “Gentlemen,” said the Dandy, “the National Holiday has begun—”
 “Three cheers for it!”
 “Silence; hear the Dandy!”
 “The National Holiday has begun,” continued Mick, “and it seems to me the best thing for the people to do is to take a walk in Lord de Mowbray’s park.”
 This proposition was received with one of those wild shouts of approbation which indicate
       the orator has exactly hit his audience between wind and water. The fact is the public mind
       at this instant wanted to be led, and in Dandy Mick a leader appeared. A leader to be
       successful should embody in his system the necessities of his followers; express what every
       one feels, but no one has had the ability or the courage to pronounce.
 The courage and adroitness, the influence of Gerard, had reconciled the people to the
       relinquishment of the great end for which they had congregated; but neither man nor multitude
       like to make preparations without obtaining a result. Every one wanted to achieve some object
       by the movement; and at this critical juncture an object was proposed, and one which promised
       novelty, amusement, excitement. The Bishop whose consent must be obtained, but who
       relinquished an idea with the same difficulty with which he had imbibed it,
       alone murmured, and kept saying to Field, “I thought we came to burn down the mill! A
       bloody-minded Capitalist, a man that makes gardens and forces the people to wash themselves:
       What is all this?”
 Field said what he could, while Devilsdust leaning over the mule’s shoulder, cajoled the
       other ear of the Bishop, who at last gave his consent with almost as much reluctance as
       George the Fourth did to the emancipation of the Roman Catholics; but he made his terms, and
       said in a sulky voice he must have a glass of ale.
 “Drink a glass of ale with Lord de Mowbray,” said Devilsdust.
