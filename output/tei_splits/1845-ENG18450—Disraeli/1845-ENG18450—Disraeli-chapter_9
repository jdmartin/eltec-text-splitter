CHAPTER III.
 The situation of the rural town of Marney was one of the most delightful easily to be
      imagined. In a spreading dale, contiguous to the margin of a clear and lively stream,
      surrounded by meadows and gardens, and backed by lofty hills, undulating and richly wooded,
      the traveller on the opposite heights of the dale would often stop to admire the merry
      prospect, that recalled to him the traditional epithet of his country.
 Beautiful illusion! For behind that laughing landscape, penury and disease fed upon the
      vitals of a miserable population!
 The contrast between the interior of the town and its external aspect, was as
      striking as it was full of pain. With the exception of the dull high street, which had the
      usual characteristics of a small agricultural market town, some sombre mansions, a dingy inn,
      and a petty bourse, Marney mainly consisted of a variety of narrow and crowded lanes formed by
      cottages built of rubble, or unhewn stones without cement, and from age, or badness of the
      material, looking as if they could scarcely hold together. The gaping chinks admitted every
      blast; the leaning chimneys had lost half their original height; the rotten rafters were
      evidently misplaced; while in many instances the thatch, yawning in some parts to admit the
      wind and wet, and in all utterly unfit for its original purpose of giving protection from the
      weather, looked more like the top of a dunghill than a cottage. Before the doors of these
      dwellings, and often surrounding them, ran open drains full of animal and vegetable refuse,
      decomposing into disease, or sometimes in their imperfect course filling foul pits or
      spreading into stagnant pools, while a concentrated solution of every species of
      dissolving filth was allowed to soak through and thoroughly impregnate the walls and ground
      adjoining.
 These wretched tenements seldom consisted of more than two rooms, in one of which the whole
      family, however numerous, were obliged to sleep, without distinction of age, or sex, or
      suffering. With the water streaming down the walls, the light distinguished through the roof,
      with no hearth even in winter, the virtuous mother in the sacred pangs of childbirth, gives
      forth another victim to our thoughtless civilization; surrounded by three generations whose
      inevitable presence is more painful than her sufferings in that hour of travail; while the
      father of her coming child, in another corner of the sordid chamber, lies stricken by that
      typhus which his contaminating dwelling has breathed into his veins, and for whose next prey
      is perhaps destined, his new-born child. These swarming walls had neither windows nor doors
      sufficient to keep out the weather, or admit the sun or supply the means of ventilation; the
      humid and putrid roof of thatch exhaling malaria like all other decaying
      vegetable matter. The dwelling rooms were neither boarded nor paved; and whether it were that
      some were situate in low and damp places, occasionally flooded by the river, and usually much
      below the level of the road; or that the springs, as was often the case, would burst through
      the mud floor; the ground was at no time better than so much clay, while sometimes you might
      see little channels cut from the centre under the doorways to carry off the water, the door
      itself removed from its hinges: a resting place for infancy in its deluged home. These hovels
      were in many instances not provided with the commonest conveniences of the rudest police;
      contiguous to every door might be observed the dung-heap on which every kind of filth was
      accumulated, for the purpose of being disposed of for manure, so that, when the poor man
      opened his narrow habitation in the hope of refreshing it with the breeze of summer, he was
      met with a mixture of gases from reeking dunghills.

 This town of Marney was a metropolis of agricultural labour, for the proprietors of the
      neighbourhood having for the last half century acted on the system of destroying the cottages
      on their estates, in order to become exempted from the maintenance of the population, the
      expelled people had flocked to Marney, where, during the war, a manufactory had afforded them
      some relief, though its wheels had long ceased to disturb the waters of the Mar.
 Deprived of this resource, they had again gradually spread themselves over that land which
      had as it were rejected them; and obtained from its churlish breast a niggardly subsistence.
      Their re-entrance into the surrounding parishes was viewed with great suspicion; their renewed
      settlement opposed by every ingenious contrivance; those who availed themselves of their
      labour were careful that they should not become dwellers on the soil; and though, from the
      excessive competition, there were few districts in the kingdom where the rate of wages was
      more depressed, those who were fortunate enough to obtain the scant remuneration,
      had, in addition to their toil, to endure each morn and even a weary journey before they could
      reach the scene of their labour, or return to the squalid hovel which profaned the name of
      home. To that home, over which Malaria hovered, and round whose shivering hearth were
      clustered other guests besides the exhausted family of toil—Fever, in every form, pale
      Consumption, exhausting Synochus, and trembling Ague,—returned after cultivating the broad
      fields of merry England the bold British peasant, returned to encounter the worst of diseases
      with a frame the least qualified to oppose them; a frame that subdued by toil was never
      sustained by animal food; drenched by the tempest could not change its dripping rags; and was
      indebted for its scanty fuel to the windfalls of the woods.
 The eyes of this unhappy race might have been raised to the solitary spire that sprang up
      in the midst of them, the bearer of present consolation, the harbinger of future equality; but
      Holy Church at Marney had forgotten her sacred mission. We have introduced the reader to the vicar, an orderly man who deemed he did his duty if he preached each week two
      sermons, and enforced humility on his congregation and gratitude for the blessings of this
      life. The high Street and some neighbouring gentry were the staple of his hearers. Lord and
      Lady Marney came, attended by Captain Grouse, every Sunday morning with commendable
      regularity, and were ushered into the invisible interior of a vast pew, that occupied half of
      the gallery, was lined with crimson damask, and furnished with easy chairs, and, for those who
      chose them, well-padded stools of prayer. The people of Marney took refuge in conventicles,
      which abounded; little plain buildings of pale brick with the names painted on them, of Sion,
      Bethel, Bethesda: names of a distant land, and the language of a persecuted and ancient race:
      yet, such is the mysterious power of their divine quality, breathing consolation in the
      nineteenth century to the harassed forms and the harrowed souls of a Saxon peasantry.
 But however devoted to his flock might have been the Vicar of Marney, his exertions for
      their well being, under any circumstances, must have been mainly limited to spiritual
      consolation. Married and a father he received for his labours the small tithes of the parish,
      which secured to him an income by no means equal to that of a superior banker’s clerk, or the
      cook of a great loanmonger. The great tithes of Marney, which might be counted by thousands,
      swelled the vast rental which was drawn from this district by the fortunate earls that bore
      its name.
 The morning after the arrival of Egremont at the Abbey, an unusual stir might have been
      observed in the high Street of the town. Round the portico of the Green Dragon hotel and
      commercial inn, a knot of principal personages, the chief lawyer, the brewer, the vicar
      himself, and several of those easy quidnuncs who abound in country towns, and who rank under
      the designation of retired gentlemen, were in close and very earnest converse. In a short time
      a servant on horseback in the Abbey livery galloped up to the portico, and delivered a letter
      to the vicar. The excitement apparently had now greatly increased. On the
      opposite side of the way to the important group, a knot, larger in numbers but very deficient
      in quality, had formed themselves, and remained transfixed with gaping mouths and a Curious
      not to say alarmed air. The head constable walked up to the door of the Green Dragon, and
      though he did not presume to join the principal group, was evidently in attendance, if
      required. The clock struck eleven; a cart had stopped to watch events, and a gentleman’s
      coachman riding home with a led horse.
 “Here they are!” said the brewer.
 “Lord Marney himself,” said the lawyer.
 “And Sir Vavasour Firebrace, I declare. I wonder how he came here,” said a retired
      gentleman, who had been a tallow-chandler on Holborn Hill.
 The vicar took off his hat, and all uncovered. Lord Marney and his brother magistrate rode
      briskly up to the inn and rapidly dismounted.
 “Well, Snigford,” said his lordship, in a peremptory tone, “this is a pretty business; I’ll
      have this stopped directly.”

 Fortunate man if he succeed in doing so! The torch of the incendiary had for the first time
      been introduced into the parish of Marney; and last night the primest stacks of the Abbey farm
      had blazed a beacon to the agitated neighbourhood.
