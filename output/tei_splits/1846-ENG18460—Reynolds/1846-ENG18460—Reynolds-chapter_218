CHAPTER CCXVII.   THE PRISONER IN THE SUBTERRANEAN.
It was on the same morning when Adeline came to London in the manner just described, that
      Anthony Tidkins emerged from his dwelling, hastened up the dark alley, and entered the
      ground-floor of the building.
He was not, however, alone:—Mr. Banks, who had been breakfasting with him, followed close
      behind.
"Light the darkey, old fellow," said the Resurrection Man, when they were both in the back
      room; "while I raise the trap. We must bring matters to an end somehow or another this
      morning."
"I hope so," returned Banks. "It isn't wery probable that the poor old weasel will have
      pluck enow to hold out much longer. Why—it must be near upon ten days that she's been
      here."
"I dare say it is," observed the Resurrection Man, coolly: "but she'll never stir out till
      she gives us the information we want. It would be worth a pretty penny to us. The young girl
      was evidently dying to know about her parents, that night she met the old woman; and she can
      get money from her friends—she said so."
"Well," returned Banks, "let us hope that the old woman has thought better on it by this
      time and will make a clean buzzim of it. It would be a great pity and a wery useless crime if
      we was obleeged to knock the sinful old weasel on the head arter all: her corpse would fetch
      nothing at the surgeon's."
"Don't be afraid," said Tidkins: "it won't come to that. She was half inclined to tell every
      thing last night when I visited her as usual. But come along, and let's see how she is
      disposed this morning."
The Resurrection Man descended the stone staircase, followed by Banks, who carried the
      light.
In a few moments they entered the vault where their prisoner was confined.
And that prisoner was the vile hag of Golden Lane!
A lamp burned feebly upon the table in the subterranean; and the old woman was already up
      and dressed when the two men made their appearance.
She was sitting in a chair, dolefully rocking herself to and fro, and uttering low moans as
      she pondered upon her condition and the terms on which she might obtain her release.
When the Resurrection Man and Banks entered the subterranean, she turned a hasty glance
      towards them, and then continued to rock and moan as before.
The two men seated themselves on the side of the bed.
"Well," said the Resurrection Man, "have you made up your mind, old woman? Because me and my
      friend Banks are pretty tired of this delay; and if the solitary system won't do—why, we must
      try what good can be effected by starvation."
"Alack! I have always thought myself bad enough," said the old hag; "but you are a very
      devil."
"Ah! and you shall find this place hell too, if you go on humbugging me much
      longer," returned the Resurrection Man, savagely. "You have only got yourself to thank for all
      this trouble that you're in. If you had behaved in a straightforward manner, all would have
      gone on right enough. My friend Banks here can tell you the same. But you tried to get the
      upper hand of me throughout the business."
"No—no," murmured the hag, still rocking herself.
"But I say yes—yes," answered the Resurrection Man. "In the first place you would tell me
      nothing about Catherine Wilmot's parentage: you kept it all close to yourself. I suspected
      you—I even told you so. I declared that 'if I caught you out in any of your tricks, I
       would hang you up to your own bedpost, as readily as I would wring the neck of your old
       cat.' And I will keep my word yet, if you refuse to give me the information I
      require."
"What will become of me? what will become of me!" moaned the old hag. "Alack! alack!"
"You'll very soon find out," answered Tidkins. "But I just want to prove to you that I am
      right in all I am doing with regard to you. In the first place you would speak to Katherine
      alone: that didn't look well. You said I might be a witness at a distance—or when the money
      was paid; but I knew that to be all humbug. However, I let you have your way at the
      beginning—if it was only to see how the young girl would receive you. Well, friend Banks
      drives us to Hounslow: we set off to the farm—we meet Katherine and another young lady—and
      this Miss Monroe throws cold water on the whole business. Still you won't speak before
      witnesses. We go back to the inn at Hounslow: we concoct the note to Kate; and friend Banks
      undertakes to deliver it, as it seemed he knew something of her. He managed to give it to her;
      and you, old woman, go off to meet her at seven. Now did you think I was so precious green as
      not to take advantage of the opportunity? Not I! I went after you—I crept round behind the
      fences near where you and Katherine met each other—and I heard every word that passed between
      you."
"Alack! alack!" moaned the old woman.
"Yes—I heard every thing," continued the Resurrection Man;—"enough to prove to me that the
      young girl would give half her fortune to learn the truth concerning her father and mother. I
      also understood pretty well that there is the name of Markham in the case; and I was
      struck by the manner in which you urged her to purchase your secret, when she informed you
      that Richard Markham—the
      Markham whom I know and hate—had been made a great lord. All you said in respect
      to the conditions on which your secret was to be sold didn't astonish me at all. It only
      confirmed me in the conviction that you had intended throughout to gammon me. You meant to
      make use of me as a tool to find out Katherine's address, and then to reserve for your own
      particular plucking the pigeon whose hiding-place I had detected. 'The man who was with me
       this morning, is a bad one,' said you: 'he is avaricious, and desires to turn my
       knowledge of this secret to a good account.'—And so I did, you old harridan; and so I
      mean to do now.—'He is a desperate man, and I dare not offend him,' you went on to
      say.—Egad! you've found out that you spoke pretty truly.—'He wants money; and money he
       must have.'—True again: and money I will have too. The girl tells you she is rich and
      anxious to purchase the secret; and when she asks you how much will satisfy me, you coolly
      tell her, 'A hundred pounds!'—A hundred devils! And then, in your gammoning,
      snivelling way, you demand of her the 'wherewith to make your few remaining days
       happy!'"
"Alas! I am a poor old soul—a poor old soul!" murmured the horrible crone, shaking her head.
      "Do with me what you will—kill me at once!"
"And what the devil good would your carcass be to us?" exclaimed the Resurrection Man.
"A workus coffin would be thrown away on it," added Mr. Banks.
"So it would, Ned," returned Tidkins. "But I'll just finish what I have to say to the old
      woman; and we'll then go to the point. I was so disgusted, and in such an infernal rage, when
      I heard you going on in such a rascally manner,—selling me, and taking care of yourself,—that
      I determined at one time to come down from behind the palings, and force you to tell Katherine
      Wilmot on the spot all you knew about her parents, and then trust to her generosity. And as
      the night had turned dark, I had moved away from the spot, and was coming towards you along
      the path, when you heard the rustling of my cloak. At that instant another idea struck me: I
      resolved to bring you here, and get the secret out of you. I therefore crept softly
      back behind the fence. Then you went on with a deal more nonsense—all of which I heard as well
      as the rest. I was now determined to punish you: so I got back to the inn before you—arranged
      it all with Banks—and we had you up to London, and safely lodged here in this pleasant little
      place, that very night. Now, tell me the truth, old woman—don't you deserve it all?"
"Lack-a-day!" crooned the harridan.
"She does indeed deserve it, Tony," said Banks, shaking his head with that solemnity which
      he had affected so long as at length to use it mechanically: "she's as gammoning an old wessel
      as ever stood a chance of making a ugly carkiss to be burnt in the bone-house by my friend
      Jones the grave-digger."
"Now, by Satan!" suddenly ejaculated the Resurrection Man, starting up, and laying his iron
      hand on the hag's shoulder so as to prevent her from rocking to and fro any longer; "if you
      don't give up this infernal croaking and moaning, I'll invent some damnable torture to make
      you tractable. Speak, old wretch!" he shouted in her ears, as he shook her violently: "will
      you tell us the secret about Katherine Wilmot—or will you not?"
"Not now—not now!" cried the hag: "another time!"
"I will not wait another hour!" ejaculated the Resurrection Man; "but, by God! I'll put you
      to some torture. What shall we do to her, Banks?"
"Screw her cussed carkiss down in one of my coffins for an hour or so," answered the
      undertaker.
"No—that won't do," said the Resurrection Man.
"I always punishes my children in that way," observed Banks; "and I find it a wery sallitary
      example."
"I know what we'll do," exclaimed Tidkins: "they say that Dick Turpin used to put old women
      on the fire to make them tell where their money was. Suppose we serve this wretched hag out in
      the same way?"
"I'm quite agreeable," returned Banks, with as much complacency as if a party of pleasure
      had been proposed to him. "I b'lieve you've got a brazier."
"Yes—up in the front room, ground-floor, where all the resurrection-tools are kept,"
      answered Tidkins. "You go and fetch it—bring plenty of coal and wood, and the bellows—and
      we'll precious soon make the old woman speak out."
The undertaker departed to execute this commission; and Tidkins again reasoned with the
      hag.
But all he could get out of her was a moaning exclamation; and as soon as he withdrew his
      hand from her shoulder, she began rocking backwards and forwards as before.
It suddenly struck the Resurrection Man that she was actually losing her senses through the
      rigours of confinement; and he became alarmed—not on her account, but for the secret which he
      wished to extort from her.
As this idea flashed to his mind, he cast a rapid glance towards the old woman; and
      surprised her as she herself was scrutinising his countenance with the most intense interest,
      while she was all the time pretending to be listlessly rocking her self.
"Another gag—by hell!" ejaculated Tidkins "What do you take me for? You think that
      I am such a miserable fool as to be deluded by your tricks? Not I, indeed! Ah! you would
      affect madness—idiotcy—would you? Why, if you really went mad through captivity in this place,
      I would knock you on the head at once—for fear that if you were let loose you might preach in
      your ravings about my designs concerning Kate Wilmot. But if you tell me, in your sober
      senses, all I want to know, I'll give you your freedom in twelve hours; because I am very well
      aware that you would not, when in possession of your reason, attract attention to your own
      ways of life by betraying mine."
"And if I tell you all I know," said the hag, seeing that her new design was detected and
      that it was useless to persist in it,—"if I tell you all I know, why will you not allow me to
      go home at once?"
"Because you came here in the night—and you shall go away in the night: because you arrived
      blindfolded—and you shall depart blindfolded," replied the Resurrection Man, sternly. "Do you
      think that I would let an old treacherous hag like you discover the whereabouts of this house?
      Why—you have no more idea at present whether you're in Saint Giles's or the Mint—Clerkenwell
      or Shoreditch—Bond Street or Rosemary Lane;—and I
      don't intend you ever to be any wiser. But here comes Banks, with the
      brazier."
The undertaker made his appearance, laden with the articles for which he had been sent.
The Resurrection Man laid the wood and coals in the brazier, and applied a match. In a few
      moments there was a bright blaze, which he fanned by means of the bellows.
"It'll be a good fire in a minute or two," said Tidkins, coolly.
"Almost as good as Jones makes in the bone-house where he burns the blessed carkisses of
      wenerable defuncts," returned Mr. Banks.
"Don't blow any more, Mr. Tidkins—save yourself the trouble," said the hag, now really
      alarmed. "I will make terms with you."
"Terms, indeed!" growled the Resurrection Man. "Well—what have you to say?"
"If I tell you every thing, you can get what money you choose out of Katherine," continued
      the old woman; "and I shall not receive a penny."
"Serve you right for having tried to gammon me."
"That will be very hard—very hard indeed," added the hag. "And after all, when you go to
      Katherine Wilmot and reveal to her the secrets I communicate to you, she will ask you for
       proofs—proofs," repeated the old woman, with a cunning leer; "and you will have no
      proofs to give her."
"Then you shall write out the whole history, and sign it," said Tidkins; "and my friend
      Banks will witness it."
"Yes," observed the undertaker, smoothing his limp cravat-ends: "Edward Banks, of Globe
      Lane, Globe Town—Furnisher of Funerals on New and Economic Principles—Good Deal Coffin, Eight
      Shillings and——"
"Hold your nonsense, Ned," cried Tidkins: then addressing himself again to the old woman, he
      said, "Well—don't you think that scheme would answer the purpose?"
"Very likely—very likely," exclaimed the hag. "But proofs—written proofs—would not
      be bad companions to the statement that you wish me to draw up."
"And have you such written proofs?" demanded Tidkins, eagerly.
"I have—I have," was the reply.
"Where are they?"
"Where you cannot discover them—concealed at my own abode. No one could find them, even if
      they pulled the house down, except myself."
And again the hag leered cunningly.
"This only makes the matter more important," mused the Resurrection Man, now hesitating
      between his avarice and his desire to possess such important testimony. "Well," he continued,
      after a pause,—"to use your own words, we will make terms. I tell you what I'll
      do:—write out your history of the whole business in full—in full, mind; and I will give you
      ten guineas down. At night me and Banks will take you home—to your own place; where you shall
      give me up the written proofs you talk of—and I will give you another ten guineas. Now is that
      a bargain?"
"Alack! it must be—it must be!" said the hag. "But why not let me go home to write out the
      history?"
"I am not quite such a fool," returned Tidkins. "And mind you do not attempt to deceive me
      with any inventions for I shall deuced soon be able to tell whether your history tallies with
      all I overheard you and Katherine say together on the subject. Besides, the written proofs
      must be forthcoming—and they, too, must fully corroborate all you state. Fail in any one of
      these conditions—and, by Satan! I'll cut your throat from ear to ear. Do you agree?"
"I do," answered the hag. "Give me paper and pens."
Tidkins departed to fetch writing materials, food, some strong liquor, and oil for the old
      woman's lamp.
In five minutes he returned; and, placing those articles upon the table, said, "When will
      your task be completed?"
"It will take me some hours," returned the hag: "for I have much to think of—much to
      write!"
And she heaved a deep sigh.
"This evening I will visit you again," said the Resurrection Man.
He and Banks then fastened the huge door upon the old woman, and left the subterranean.
When they reached the street, the undertaker departed in the direction of his own house; and
      the Resurrection Man ascended to his apartment on the first floor.
