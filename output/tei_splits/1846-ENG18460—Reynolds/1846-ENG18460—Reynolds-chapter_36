CHAPTER XXXVI. THE EXECUTION.
FROM the moment that Bill Bolter had been removed to the condemned cell, after his trial at
      the Old Bailey for the murder of his wife, he preserved a sullen and moody silence.
Two turnkeys sat up with him constantly, according to the rules of the prison; but he never
      made the slightest advances towards entering into conversation with them. The Chaplain was
      frequent in his attendance upon the convict; but no regard was paid to the religious
      consolations and exhortations of the reverend gentleman.
The murderer ate his meals heartily, and enjoyed sound physical health: he was hale and
      strong, and might, in the common course of nature, have lived until a good old age.
By day he sate, with folded arms, meditating upon his condition. He scarcely repented of the
      numerous evil deeds of which he had been guilty: but he trembled at the idea of a future
      state!
One night he had a horrid dream. He thought that the moment had arrived for his execution,
      and that he was standing upon the drop. Suddenly the board gave way beneath his feet—and he
      fell. An agonising feeling of the blood rushing with the fury of a torrent and with a heat of
      molten lead up into his brain, seized upon him: his eyes shot sparks of fire; and in his ears
      there was a loud droning sound, like the moan of the ocean on a winter's night. This
      sensation, he fancied, lasted about two minutes—a short and insignificant space to those who
      feel not pain, but an age when passed in the endurance of agony the most intense. Then he
      died: and he thought that his spirit left his body with the last pulsation of the lungs, and
      was suddenly whirled downwards, with fearful rapidity, upon the wings of a hurricane. He felt
      himself in total darkness; and yet he had an idea that he was plunging precipitately into a
      fearful gulf, around the sides of which hideous monsters, immense serpents, formidable bats,
      and all kinds of slimy reptiles were climbing. At length he reached the bottom of the gulf;
      and then the faculty of sight was suddenly restored to him. At the same moment he felt fires
      encircling him all around; and a horrible snake coiled itself about him. He was in the midst
      of a boundless lake of flame; and far as his eyes could reach, he beheld myriads of spirits
      all undergoing the same punishment—writhing in quenchless fire and girt by hideous serpents.
      And he thought that neither himself nor those spirits which he beheld around, wore any shape
      which he could define; and yet he saw them
       plainly—palpably. They had no heads—no limbs; and yet they were something more
      than shapeless trunks,—all naked and flesh-coloured, and unconsumed and indestructible amidst
      that burning lake, which had no end. In a few moments this dread scene changed, and all was
      again dark. The murderer fancied that he was now groping about in convulsive agonies upon the
      bank of a river, the stream of which was tepid and thick like blood. The bank was slimy and
      moist, and overgrown with huge osiers and dark weeds, amidst which loathsome reptiles and
      enormous alligators were crowded together. And it was in this frightful place that the
      murderer was now spiritually groping his way, in total and coal-black darkness. At length he
      slipped down the slimy bank—and his feet touched the river, which he now knew to be of blood.
      He grasped convulsively at the osiers to save himself from falling into that horrible stream:
      a huge serpent sprung from the thicket, and coiled itself about his arms and neck;—and at the
      same moment an enormous alligator rose from the river of blood, and seized him in the middle
      between its tremendous jaws. He uttered a fearful cry—and awoke.
This dream made a deep impression upon him. He believed that he had experienced a foretaste
      of Hell—of that hell, with all its horrors, in which he would be doomed for ever and
      ever—without hope, without end.
And yet, by a strange idiosyncrasy of conduct, he did not court the consolation of the
      clergyman: he breathed no prayer, gave no outward and visible sign of repentance: but
      continued in the same sullen state of reserve before noticed.
Still, after that dream, he dreaded to seek his bed at night. He was afraid of sleep; for
      when he closed his eyes in slumber, visions of hell, varied in a thousand horrible ways,
      presented themselves to his mind.
He never thought of his children: and once when the clergyman asked him if he would like to
      see them, he shook his head impatiently.
Death! he shuddered at the idea—and yet he never sought to escape from its presence by
      conversation or books. He sate moodily brooding upon death and what would probably occur
      hereafter, until he conjured up to his imagination all the phantasmagorical displays of
      demons, spectres, and posthumous horrors ever conceived by human mind.
On another occasion—the Friday before the Monday on which he was executed—he dreamt of
      heaven. He thought that the moment the drop had fallen from beneath his feet, a brilliant
      light, such as he had never seen on earth, shone all around him:—the entire atmosphere was
      illuminated as with gold-dust in the rays of a powerful sun. And the sun and moon and stars
      all appeared of amazing size—immense orbs of lustrous and shining metal. He fancied that he
      winged his way upwards with a slow and steady motion, a genial warmth prevailing all around,
      and sweet odours delighting his senses. In this manner he soared on high—until at length he
      passed sun, moon, and stars, and beheld them all shining far, far beneath his feet. Presently
      the sounds of the most ravishing sacred music, accompanied by choral voices hymning to the
      praise of the Highest, fell upon his ear. His soul was enchanted by these notes of promise, of
      hope, and of love; and, raising his eyes, he beheld the shining palaces of heaven towering
      above vast and awe-inspiring piles of clouds. He reached a luminous avenue amidst these
      clouds, which led to the gates of paradise. He was about to enter upon that glorious and
      radiant path, when a sudden change came over the entire spirit of his dream; and in a moment
      he found himself dashing precipitately downwards, amidst darkness increasing in intensity, but
      through which the sun, moon, and planets might be seen, at immense distances, of a lurid and
      ominous red. Down—down he continued falling, until he was pitched with violence upon the moist
      and slimy bank of that river of tepid blood, whose margin was crowded with hideous reptiles,
      and whose depths swarmed with wide-mouthed alligators.
Thus passed the murderer's time—dread meditations by day, and appalling dreams by night.
Once he thought of committing suicide, and thus avoiding the ignominy of the scaffold. He
      had no shame; but he dreaded hanging on account of the pain—whereof he had experienced the
      dread sensations in his dreams. Besides, death is not quite so terrible when inflicted by
      one's own hand, as it is when dealt by another. He was, however, closely watched; and the only
      way in which he could have killed himself was by dashing the back of his head violently
      against the stone-wall. Then he reflected that he might not do this effectually;—and so he
      abandoned the idea of self-destruction.
On the last Sunday of his life he attended the Chapel. A condemned sermon was preached
      according to custom. The sacred fane was filled with elegantly dressed ladies—the wives,
      daughters, and friends of the City authorities. The Clergyman enjoined the prisoner to
      repentance, and concluded by assuring him that it was not even then too late to
       acknowledge his errors and save his soul. God would still forgive him!
If God could thus forgive him,—why could not Man? Oh! wherefore did that preacher confine
      his observations to the mercy of the Almighty? why did he not address a terrible lecture to
      blood-thirsty and avenging mortals? Of what use was the death of that sinner? Surely there is
      no moral example in a public execution? "There is," says the Legislature. We will see
      presently.
Oh! why could not the life of that man—stained with crime and red with blood though it
      were—have been spared, and he himself allowed to live to see the horror of his ways, and learn
      to admire virtue? He might have been locked up for the remainder of his existence: bars and
      bolts in English gaols are very strong; there was enough air for him to be allowed to breathe
      it; and there was enough bread to have spared him a morsel at the expense of the state!
We cannot give life: we have no right to take it away.
On the Sunday afternoon, the murderer's children were taken to see him in the condemned
      cell. He had not asked for them: but the authorities considered it proper that they
      should take leave of him.
The poor little innocents were dressed in the workhouse garb. The boy understood that his
      father was to be hanged on the following morning; and his grief was heart-rending. The little
      girl could not understand why her parent was in that gloomy place, nor what horrible fate
      awaited him:—but she had an undefined and vague sense of peril and misfortune; and she cried
      also.
The murderer kissed them, and told them to be good children;—but he only thus conducted
      himself because he was ashamed to appear so unfeeling and brutal as he knew himself
      to be, in the presence
       of the Ordinary, the Governor, the Sheriffs, and the ladies who were admitted to
      have a glimpse of him in his dungeon.
*   *  *  *  *
The morning of the second Monday after the Sessions dawned.
This was the one fixed by the Sheriffs for the execution of William Bolter, the
      murderer.
At four o'clock on that fatal morning the huge black stage containing the drop, was wheeled
      out of a shed in the Press Yard, and stationed opposite the debtors' door of Newgate. A
      carpenter and his assistant then hastily fitted up the two perpendicular spars, and the one
      horizontal beam, which formed the gibbet.
There were already several hundreds of persons collected to witness these preliminary
      arrangements; and from that hour until eight o'clock multitudes continued pouring from every
      direction towards that spot—the focus of an all-absorbing interest.
Man—that social, domestic, and intelligent animal—will leave his child crying in the cradle,
      his wife tossing upon a bed of pain and sickness, and his blind old parents to grope their way
      about in the dark, in order to be present at an exhibition of a fellow creature's disgrace,
      agony, or death. And the law encourages this morbid taste in all countries termed
      civilised,—whether it be opposite the debtors' door of Newgate, or around the guillotine
      erected at the Barriere Saint Jacques of Paris,—whether it be in the midst of ranks of
      soldiers, drawn up to witness the abominable infliction of the lash in the barracks of Charing
      Cross, or the buttons cut off a deserter's coat in the Place Vendome,—whether it be to see a
      malefactor broken on the wheel in the dominions of the tyrant who is called "Europe's
      Protestant Sovereign," or to behold the military execution of a great general at
      Madrid,—whether it be to hear an English Judge in the nineteenth century, unblushingly condemn
      a man to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, and his dissected corpse disposed of according to
      the will of our Sovereign Lady the Queen; or to witness some miserable peasant expire beneath
      the knout in the territories of the Czar.
But the Law is vindictive, cowardly, mean, and ignorant. It is vindictive because
      its punishments are more severe than the offences, and because its officers descend to any
      dirtiness in order to obtain a conviction. It is cowardly, because it cuts off from
      the world, with a rope or an axe, those men whose dispositions it fears to undertake to curb.
      It is mean, because it is all in favour of the wealthy, and reserves its thunders for
      the poor and obscure who have no powerful interest to protect them; and because itself
      originates nearly half the crimes which it punishes. And it is ignorant, because it
      erects the gibbet where it should rear the cross,—because it makes no allowance for the cool
      calculating individual who commits a crime, but takes into its consideration the case of the
      passionate man who assassinates his neighbour in a momentary and uncontrollable burst of
      rage,—thus forgetting that the former is the more likely one to be led by reflection to
      virtue, and that the latter is a demon subject to impulses which he can never subdue.
From an early hour a glittering light was seen through the small grated window above the
      debtors' door; for the room to which that door belongs, is now the kitchen.
There was something sinister and ominous in that oscillating glare, breaking through the
      mists of the cold December morning, and playing upon the black spars of the gibbet which stood
      high above the already dense but still increasing multitudes.
Towards eight o'clock the crowd had congregated to such an extent, that it moved and
      undulated like the stormy ocean. And, oh! what characters were collected around that gibbet.
      Every hideous den, every revolting hole—every abode of vice, squalor, and low debauchery, had
      vomited forth their horrible population. Women, with young children in their arms,—pickpockets
      of all ages,—swell-mobsmen,—prostitutes, thieves, and villains of all degrees and
      descriptions, were gathered there on that fatal morning.
And amidst that multitude prevailed mirth, and laughter, and gaiety. Ribald language,
      obscene jokes, and filthy expressions, were heard around, even to the very foot of the
      gallows; and even at that early hour intoxication was depicted upon the countenances of
      several whom the Law had invited thither to derive an example from the tragedy about to be
      enacted!
Example, indeed! Listen to those shouts of laughter: they emanate from a group collected
      round a pickpocket only twelve years old, who is giving an account of how he robbed an elderly
      lady on the preceding evening. But, ah! what are those moans, accompanied with horrible oaths
      and imprecations? Two women fighting: they are tearing each other to pieces—and their husbands
      are backing them. In another direction, a simple-looking countryman suddenly discovers that
      his handkerchief and purse are gone. In a moment his hat is knocked over his eyes; and he
      himself is cuffed, and kicked, and pushed about in a most brutal manner.
Near the scaffold the following conversation takes place:—
"I wonder what the man who is going to be hanged is doing at this moment."
"It is now half-past seven. He is about now receiving the sacrament."
"Well—if I was he, I'd send the old parson to the devil, and pitch into the sheriffs."
"Yes—so would I. For my part, I should like to live such a life as Jack Sheppard or Dick
      Turpin did, even if I did get hanged at last."
"There is something noble and exciting in the existence of a highwayman: and then—at
      last—what admiration on the part of the crowd—what applause when he appears upon the
      drop!"
"Yes. If this fellow Bolter had contented himself with being a burglar, or had only murdered
      those who resisted him, I should have cheered him heartily;—but to kill his wife—there's
      something cowardly in that; and so I shall hiss him."
"And so shall I."
"A quarter to eight! The poor devil's minutes are pretty well numbered."
"I wonder what he is about now."
"The pinioning will begin directly, I dare say."
"That must be the worst part."
"Oh! no—not a bit of it. You may depend upon it that he is not half so miserable as we are
      inclined to think him. A man makes up his mind to die as well as to anything else. But what
      the devil noise is that?"
"Oh! only some fool of a fellow singing a patter song about a man hanging, and imitating all
      the convulsions of the poor wretch. My eyes! how the people do laugh!"
"Five minutes to eight! They won't be long now."
At this moment the bell of Saint Sepulchre's
       church began to toll the funeral knell—that same bell whose ominous sound had
      fallen upon the ears of the wretched murderer, when he lay concealed in the vault of the Old
      House.
The laughing—the joking—the singing—and the fighting now suddenly subsided; and every eye
      was turned towards the scaffold. The most breathless curiosity prevailed.
Suddenly the entrance of the debtor's door was darkened by a human form: the executioner
      hastily ascended the steps, and appeared upon the scaffold.
He was followed by the Ordinary in his black gown, walking with slow and measured pace
      along, and reading the funeral service—while the bell of Saint Sepulchre continued its deep,
      solemn, and foreboding death-note.
The criminal came next.
His elbows were bound to his sides, and his wrists fastened together, with thin cord. He had
      on a decent suit of clothes, supplied by the generosity of Tom the Cracksman; and on his head
      was a white night-cap.
The moment he appeared upon the scaffold, a tremendous shout arose from the thousands and
      thousands of spectators assembled to witness his punishment.
He cast a hurried and anxious glance around him.
The large open space opposite the northern wing of Newgate seemed literally paved with human
      faces, which were continued down the Old Bailey and Giltspur Street, as far as he could see.
      The houses facing the prison were crammed with life—roof and window.
It seemed as if he were posted upon a rock in the midst of an ocean of people.
Ten thousand pairs of eyes were concentrated in him. All was animation and interest, as if
      some grand national spectacle were about to take place.
"Hats off!" was the universal cry: the multitudes were determined to lose nothing! The
      cheapness of an amusement augments the pleasure derived from it. We wonder that the government
      has never attempted to realise funds by charging a penny a-piece for admission to behold the
      executions at Newgate. In such a country as England, where even religion is made a compulsory
      matter of taxation, the dues collected at executions would form a fund calculated to thrive
      bravely.
While the executioner was occupied in fixing the halter round the convict's neck, the
      Ordinary commenced that portion of the Burial Service, which begins thus:—
"Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He
       cometh up, and is cut down like a flower: he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth
       in one stay."
The executioner having attached the rope, and drawn the nightcap over the criminal's face,
      disappeared from the scaffold, and went beneath the platform to draw the bolt that sustained
      the drop.
"In the midst of life we are in death; of whom may we seek for succour, but of thee, O
       Lord, who—"
Here the drop fell.
A dreadful convulsion appeared to pass through the murderer's frame; and for nearly a minute
      his hands moved nervously up and down. Perhaps during those fifty seconds, the horrors of his
      dream were realised, and he felt the blood rushing with the fury of a torrent and with a
       heat of molten lead up into his brain; perhaps his eyes shot sparks of fire; and in his ears
       was a loud droning sound, like the moan of the ocean on a winter's night!
But the convulsive movement of the hands soon ceased, and the murderer hung a lifeless
      corpse.
The crowd retained its post till nine o'clock, when the body was cut down: then did that
      vast assemblage of persons, of both sexes and all ages, begin to disperse.
The public-houses in the Old Bailey and the immediate neighbourhood drove a roaring trade
      throughout that day.
