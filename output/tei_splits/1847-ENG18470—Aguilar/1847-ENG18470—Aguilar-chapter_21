CHAPTER II.
A LETTER, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
It was the seventh of June, and one of those glorious mornings, when Nature looks lovelier
      than ever. The windows of the breakfast-room were thrown widely open, and never did the superb
      trees of Oakwood Park look richer or display a greater variety of green. The flower-garden, on
      part of which the breakfast-room opened, was actually dazzling with its profusion of brilliant
      flowers, on which the sun looked down so gloriously; a smooth lawn whose green was a perfect
      emerald, stretched down from the parterre, till it was lost in woody openings, which disclosed
      the winding river, that, lying as a lake on one side, appeared to sweep round some exquisite
      scenery on the opposite side, and form another lake, about a mile further. It was Emmeline's
      favorite view, and she always declared, that it so varied its aspects of loveliness, she was
      sure it never looked two mornings exactly alike, and so long would she stand and admire, that
      her mother often threatened to send her her breakfast in her own room, where the view, though
      picturesque, would not so completely turn her attention from the dull realities of life. There
      were some letters on the table this morning, so she had a longer time to drink in poetry than
      usual.
"Who can offer Ellen a more precious birthday-gift than mine?" exclaimed Mrs. Hamilton,
      playfully holding up a letter, as her niece entered. "I wonder if Edward remembered how near
      his sister was to fifteen, and so wrote on the chance of your receiving it on the day
      itself!"
"Why, Ellen, what a queer effect pleasure has on you! I always notice you turn quite pale
      whenever Edward's letters are given to you," interposed Emmeline, looking at her cousin, and
      laughing. "I am sure, the very hurry I am in to open Percy's and Herbert's, must give me a
      color, and you are as deliberate as if you did not care about it. I do wish you would not be
      so cold and quiet."
"One giddy brain is quite enough in a house," rejoined her father, in the same mirthful
      tone, and looking up from his letter he called Ellen to him, and kissed her. "I forgot the day
      of the month, my little girl, but I am not too late, I hope, to say, God bless you, and wish
      that every year may pass more happily, more usefully, and more prepared for eternity than the
      last!"
"I do not think you have forgotten it, my dear uncle," replied Ellen, gratefully (she had
      not yet opened her brother's letter); "for my aunt says, I am to thank you as well as her for
      this beautiful birthday gift," and she displayed an elegant little gold watch; "indeed, I do
      not know how to thank you for all your kindness!" she added, so earnestly that tears came to
      her eyes.
"I will say, as I have heard your aunt often say—by trying to be a little more lively, and
      unreserved, my dear Ellen; that would prove our kindness and affection made you happy, better
      than any thing; but I am not going to lecture you on your birthday, and with a letter from
      Edward in your hand," he continued, smiling. "Open it, my dear, I want to know its date; I
      rather think my friend Manly's must be written later."
"Nothing in it for me, Ellen?" asked her aunt. "What a lazy boy he has grown!"
"An inclosure for you, Ellen; why, that is as queer as your paleness!" said Emmeline.
"Do let your cousin's paleness alone," interposed Mrs. Hamilton, gayly. "I really can not
      perceive she has any less color than usual, and as for the inclosure, Edward often has
      something to add at the last moment, and no room to insert it, and so there is nothing
      remarkable in his using another half sheet."
"Emmeline always creates wonders out of shadows," said Caroline, dryly.
"And you never see any thing but dull, coarse, heavy realities," laughed her sister in
      reply. "Come, Ellen, tell us something of this idle brother of yours, who promised to write to
      me every packet, and never does."
Ellen read nearly the whole letter aloud, and it was unusually entertaining, for the ship
      had been cruising about the last month and Edward described the various scenes and new places
      he had visited more lengthily than usual. He anticipated with great glee an engagement with
      some desperate pirates, whose track they were pursuing.
"Does he mention an engagement?" inquired Mr. Hamilton.
"No, uncle; he concludes quite abruptly, saying they have just piped all hands, and he must
      be off. The direction does not seem his writing."
"Nor is it; Sir Edward sealed, directed, and put it up for him in his own to me. They had
      piped all hands, as he calls it, because the pirate ship was in sight, and an engagement did
      take place."
"And Edward—oh, uncle, is he hurt? I am sure, he is, by your face," exclaimed Ellen;
      trembling and all the little circle looked alarmed.
"Then my face is a deceiver," replied Mr. Hamilton, quite cheerfully. "He only received a
      slight flesh wound in his right arm, which prevented his using it to complete his letter, and
      I rather think, he would have willingly been hurt still more, to receive such praises as Sir
      Edward lavishes on him. Listen to what he says—'Not a boy or man on board distinguished
      himself more than your nephew: in fact, I am only astonished he escaped as he did, for those
      pirates are desperate fighters, and when we boarded them, Fortescue was in the midst of them,
      fighting like a young lion. Courage and gallantry are such dazzling qualities in a young lad,
      that we think more of them perhaps than we ought, but I can not say too much for your nephew;
      I have not a lad more devoted to his duty. I was glad to show him my approbation by giving him
      some days' liberty, when we were off New York; but I have since told him, the air of land
      certainly did not agree with him, for he has looked paler and thinner ever since. He is
      growing very fast; and altogether, if I have occasion to send another prize schooner home, I
      think it not improbable I shall nominate him as one of the officers, that he may have the
      benefit of the healthful breezes of Old England, to bring back his full strength.' There
      Ellen, I think that is a still better birthday-present than even Edward's own letter. I am as
      proud of my nephew as Sir Edward is."
"And do you think he really will come?" asked Ellen, trying to conquer her emotion.
"We will hope it, dearest," replied her aunt, kindly. "But do not think too much about it,
      even if Sir Edward be not able to do as he says. His own ship will be coming home in a year or
      two, and you owned to me yourself this morning, it did not seem as long as it really is, since
      our dear sailor left us; so the remaining time will soon pass. Finish your breakfast, and go,
      love, and enjoy his letter again to yourself."
And Ellen gladly obeyed; for it was from no imaginary cause that the receipt of Edward's
      letters so often paled her cheek, and parched her lip with terror. She knew that concerning
      him which none else but Harding did; and even when those letters imparted nothing but that
      which she could read to her family, the dread was quite enough to banish any thing like the
      elastic happiness, natural to her age, and called for by the kindness of those she loved. His
      letter this time, however, had not a word to call for that sickness of the heart, with which
      she had received it, and she read it again and again; with a thankfulness, too intense for
      words.
"You dropped this, Ellen dear," said the voice of her cousin Emmeline at her door, ten
      minutes after she left the breakfast-room. "It was under the table, and I do not think you
      have read it; it is the inclosure I was so amused at."
"I dare say it is a letter written for some other opportunity, and forgotten to be sent; it
      is only a few words," replied Ellen as she looked at its length, not at its meaning, for the
      fearful lesson of quiet unconcern when the heart is bursting had been too early learned.
"Then I will leave you in peace: by-the-by, cousin mine, papa told me to tell you, that as
      the Prince William is soon going to cruise again, your answer to Edward must be ready this day
      week, the latest, and mamma says, if you like to write part of it now that all Edward's little
      love-speeches are fresh in your mind, you can do so; it is your birthday, and you may spend it
      as you like. How I shall enjoy making a lion of my cousin, when he comes!"—and away tripped
      the happy girl, singing some wild snatch of an old ballad about sailors.
Ellen shut the door, secured it, and with a lip and cheek colorless as her robe, an eye
      strained and bloodshot, read the following words—few indeed!
"Ellen! I am again in that villain's power, and for a sum so trifling, that it maddens me to
      think I can not discharge it without again appealing to you. I had resolved never to play
      again—and again some demon lured me to those Hells! If I do not pay him by my next receipts
      from home, he will expose me, and what then—disgrace, expulsion, death! for I will
      not survive it; there are easy means of self-destruction to a sailor, and who shall know but
      that he is accidentally drowned? You promised me to save part of every allowance, in case I
      needed it. If you would indeed save me, send me five-and-thirty pounds! Ellen! by some means,
      I must have it; but breathe it to my uncle or aunt—for if she knows it,
      he will—and you will never see me more!"
For one long hour Ellen never moved. Her brain felt scorched, her limbs utterly powerless.
      Every word seemed to write itself in letters of fire on her heart and brain, till she could
      almost have screamed, from the dread agony; and then came the heavy weight, so often felt
      before, but never crushing every thought and energy as now, the seeming utter impossibility to
      comply with that fearfully urged demand. He called it a sum so trifling, and
      she felt a hundred, ay, a thousand pounds were not more difficult to obtain. She had
      saved, indeed, denying herself every little indulgence, every personal gratification, spending
      only what she was obliged, and yet compelled to let her aunt believe she had properly expended
      all, that she might have the means of sending him money when he demanded it, without exposing
      herself to doubt and displeasure as before; but in the eight months since his last call, she
      had only been enabled to put by fifteen pounds, not half the sum he needed. How was she to get
      the rest? and she had so buoyed herself with the fond hope, that even if he did write for help
      again, she could send it to him so easily—and now—her mind seemed actually to reel beneath the
      intense agony of these desperate words. She was too young, too believing, and too
      terror-stricken to doubt for a moment the alternative he placed before her, with a vividness,
      a desperation, of which he was unconscious himself. Those words spoken, would have been
      terrible, almost awful in one so young—though a brief interval would have sufficiently calmed
      both the hearer and the speaker, to satisfy that they were but words, and that
      self-destruction is never breathed, if really intended: but written, the writer at a
      distance, imagination at liberty, to heighten every terror, every reality; their reader a
      young loving girl, utterly ignorant of the world's ways and temptations, and the many errors
      to which youth is subject, but from which manhood may spring up unsullied; and so believing,
      almost crushed by the belief, that her brother, the only one, her own—respected, beloved, as
      he was said to be—had yet committed such faults, as would hurl him from his present position
      to the lowest depth of degradation, for what else could tempt him, to swear not to survive it?
      Was it marvel, that poor Ellen was only conscious that she must save him?—Again did her dying
      mother stand before her—again did her well-remembered voice beseech her to save him her
      darling, beautiful Edward, from disgrace and punishment—reiterate that her word was pledged,
      and she must do it, and if she suffered—had she not done so from infancy—and what was
      her happiness to his? Define why it should be of less moment, indeed, she could not. It was
      the fatal influences of her childhood working alone.
How that day passed, Ellen never knew. She had been too long accustomed to control, to
      betray her internal suffering (terror for Edward seemed to endow her with additional self
      command), except by a deadly paleness, which even her aunt at length remarked. It was quite
      evening, and the party were all scattered, when Mrs. Hamilton discovered Ellen sitting in one
      of the deep recesses of the windows: her work in her lap, her hands clasped tightly together,
      and her eyes fixed on the beautiful scenery of the park, but not seeing a single object.
"My dear Ellen, I am going to scold you, so prepare," was her aunt's lively address, as she
      approached and stood by her. "You need not start so guiltily and look so very terrified, but
      confess that you are thinking about Edward, and worrying yourself that he is not quite so
      strong as he was, and magnifying his wound, till you fancy it something very dreadful, when, I
      dare say, if the truth were told, he himself is quite proud of it; come confess, and I will
      only give you a very little lecture, for your excessive silliness."
Ellen looked up in her face; that kind voice, that affectionate smile, that caressing,
      constantly-forgiving love, would they again all be forfeited, again give way to coldness, loss
      of confidence, heightened displeasure? How indeed she was to act, she knew not; she only knew
      there must be concealment, the very anticipation of which, seemed too terrible to bear, and
      she burst into an agony of tears.
"Why, Ellen—my dear child—you can not be well, to let either the accounts of your brother,
      or my threatened scolding, so affect you, and on your birthday, too! Why, all the old women
      would say it was such a bad omen, that you would be unhappy all the year round. Come, this
      will never do, I must lecture, in earnest, if you do not try to conquer this unusual weakness.
      We have much more to be thankful for, in Sir Edward's account of our dear sailor, than to cry
      about; he might have been seriously wounded or maimed, and what would you have felt then? I
      wonder if he will find as much change in you as we shall in him. If you are not quite strong
      and quite well, and quite happy to greet him when he comes, I shall consider my care insulted,
      and punish you accordingly. Still no smile. What is the matter, dearest? Are you really not
      well again?"
Ellen made a desperate effort, conquered her tears, and tried to converse cheerfully. It was
      absolute agony to hear Edward's name, but she nerved herself to do so, to acknowledge she was
      thinking of him; and that it was very silly to worry about such a slight wound: and
      when Mrs. Hamilton proposed that they should walk over to Greville Manor, and tell the good
      news to Mrs. Greville and Mary, acquiesced with apparent pleasure.
"Ah, do, mamma: you have not asked me, but I shall go notwithstanding," exclaimed Emmeline,
      springing through the open window, with her usual airy step.
"Why, Emmeline, I thought you were going to the village with your sister!"
"No; she and Miss Harcourt were talking much too soberly to suit me this evening. Then I
      went to tease papa but he let me do just what I pleased, being too engrossed with some
      disagreeable farmers, to notice me, so in despair I came here. Why, Ellen, you look as if this
      were any day but what it is; unless you cry because you are getting old, which I am very often
      inclined to do; only think, I am sixteen next December—how dreadful! I do wish my birthday
      were in June."
"And what difference would that make?"
"A great deal, mamma; only look how lovely every thing is now; nature is quite juvenile, and
      has dressed herself in so many colors, and seems to promise so many more beauties, that,
      whether we will or no, we must feel gay and young; but in December, though it is very
      delightful in the house, it is so drear and withered, without, that if born in such a season,
      one must feel withered too."
"When do you intend to speak in prose, Emmeline?"
"Never, if I can help it mamma; but I must learn the lesson before I go to London, I
      suppose; that horrid London! that is one reason why I regret the years going so fast; I know I
      shall leave all my happiness here."
"You will be more ungrateful, than I believe you, if you do," replied her mother. "So pray
      banish such foolish fancies as fast as you can; for if you encourage them, I shall certainly
      suppose that it is only Oakwood you love; and that neither your father nor myself, nor any
      member of your family, has any part in your affections, for we shall be with you, wherever you
      are."
"Dear mamma, I spoke at random, forgive me," replied Emmeline, instantly self-reproached. "I
      am indeed the giddy brain papa calls me; but you can not tell how I love this dear old
      home."
"Indeed I think I can, my dear child, loving it as I do myself; but come, we shall have no
      time for our visit, if we do not go at once."
Days passed, and were each followed by such sleepless feverish nights, that Ellen felt it
      almost a miracle, that she could so seem, so act, as to excite no notice. The image of her
      dying mother never left her, night or day, mingled with the horrid scene of her father's
      death, and Edward disgraced, expelled, and seeking death by his own hand. There was only one
      plan that seemed in the least feasible, and that was to send to him, or sell herself the watch
      she had received on her birthday, and if that was not enough, some few trinkets, which had
      been her mother's, and which the last six months her aunt had given into her own care. She
      ventured casually to inquire if there were any opportunity of sending a parcel to Edward, but
      the answer was in the negative, and increased her difficulty. The only person she dared even
      to think of so far intrusting with her deep distress and anxiety for money, but not its cause,
      was widow Langford, the mother of Robert (the young gentlemen's attendant, whom we have had
      occasion more than once to mention, and the former nurse of all Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton's
      children). She occupied a cottage on the outskirts of the park, and was not only a favorite
      with all the young party, Ellen included (for she generally came to nurse her in her many
      illnesses), but was regarded with the greatest confidence and affection by Mr. and Mrs.
      Hamilton themselves. They had endeavored to return her unwavering fidelity and active service,
      by taking her only child Robert into their family, when only seven; placing him under the
      immediate charge of Morris, the steward, and of course living in the same house, of his mother
      also; and when fifteen, making him personal attendant to Percy and Herbert, who were then
      about ten and eleven years old. An older and more experienced domestic had, however,
      accompanied the young men to college, and Robert remained employed in many little confidential
      services for his master at Oakwood.
To widow Langford, Ellen tried to resolve that she would apply, but her fearful state of
      mental agony had not marked the lapse of time, or had caused her to forget that her letter
      must be ready in a week. The party were all going a delightful excursion, and to drink tea at
      Greville Manor, so that they would not be home till quite late; but in the morning, Ellen,
      though she had dressed for going out, appeared to have every symptom of such a violent
      headache, that her aunt advised her remaining quietly at home, and she assented with
      eagerness, refusing every offer of companionship, saying if the pain went off, she could quite
      amuse herself, and if it continued, quietness and Ellis's nursing were the best things for
      her.
"But give me your letter before we go out, Ellen, I am only waiting for it, to close mine to
      Sir Edward. Why, my dear, have you forgotten I told you it must be ready by to-day?" her uncle
      added, surprised at her exclamation that she had not finished it. "It must be done and sent to
      T—, before four to-day, so I do hope your head will allow you to write, for Edward will be
      woefully disappointed if there be not a line from you, especially as, from his ship cruising
      about, it may be several weeks before he can hear again. I must leave my letter with you, to
      inclose Edward's and seal up, and pray see that it goes in time."
Ellen tried to promise that it should, but her tongue actually clove to the roof of her
      mouth; but all the party dispersing at the moment, her silence was unnoticed. Mr. Hamilton
      gave her his letter, and in half an hour afterward she was alone. She sat for nearly an hour
      in her own room, with her desk before her, her face buried in her hands, and her whole frame
      shaking as with an ague.
"It must be," she said at length, and unlocking a drawer, took thence a small cross, and one
      or two other trinkets, put them up, and taking off her watch, looked at it with such an
      expression of suffering, that it seemed as if she could not go on, carefully folded it up with
      the other trinkets, and murmuring, "If nurse Langford will but take these, and lend me the
      twenty pounds till she can dispose of them, I may save him yet—and if she betray me—if she
      tell my aunt afterward, at least only I shall suffer; they will not suspect him. But oh—to
      lose—to be doubted, hated, which I must be at last. Oh, mother! mother! Why may I not tell my
      aunt? she would not disgrace him." And again she crouched down, cowed by that fearful struggle
      to the very earth. After a few minutes, it passed, and deliberately putting on her bonnet and
      shawl, she took up her trinkets, and set off to the widow's cottage, her limbs so trembling,
      that she knew not how she should accomplish even that short walk.
The wind was unusually high, although the day was otherwise lovely, and she was scarcely
      able to stand against the strong breeze, especially as every breath seemed to increase the
      pain in her temples; but she persisted. The nearest path lay through a thick shrubbery, almost
      a wood, which the family never used, and, in fact, the younger members were prohibited from
      taking, but secrecy and haste were all which at that moment entered Ellen's mind. She felt so
      exhausted by the wind blowing the branches and leaves noisily and confusedly around, that on
      reaching a sort of grassy glade, more open than her previous path, she sat down a minute on a
      mossy stone. The wind blew some withered sticks and leaves toward her, and, among them, two or
      three soiled pieces of thin paper, stained with damp, one of which she raised mechanically,
      and started up with a wild cry, and seized the others almost unconsciously. She pressed her
      hands over her eyes, and her lips moved in the utterance of thanksgiving. "Saved!—Edward and
      myself, too!—some guardian angel must have sent them!" if not actually spoken, were so
      distinctly uttered in her heart, that she thought she heard them; and she retraced her steps,
      so swiftly—so gladly, the very pain and exhaustion were unfelt. She wrote for half an hour
      intently—eagerly; though that which she wrote she knew not herself, and never could recall.
      She took from the secret drawer of her desk (that secret drawer which, when Percy had so
      laughingly showed her the secret of its spring, telling her nobody but himself knew it, she
      little thought she should have occasion so to use), some bank notes, of two, three, and five
      pounds each, making the fifteen she had so carefully hoarded, and placed with them the two she
      had found. As she did so, she discovered that two had clung so closely together that the sum
      was five pounds more than she wanted. Still, as acting under the influence of some spell, she
      carelessly put one aside, sealed up the packet to Edward, inclosed it in her uncle's to Sir
      Edward Manly, and dispatched it full four hours before the hour Mr. Hamilton had named. It was
      gone; and she sat down to breathe. Some impulse, never experienced before, urged her, instead
      of destroying Edward's desperate letter, as she had done similar appeals, to retain it in a
      blank envelop in that same secret drawer. As she tried to rouse herself from a sort of stupor
      which was strangely creeping over her, her eye caught the five pound note which she had not
      had occasion to use, and a thought of such overwhelming wretchedness rushed upon her, as
      effectually, for the moment, to disperse that stupor, and prostrate her in an agony of
      supplication before her God.
"What have I done?"—if her almost maddening thoughts could have found words, such they would
      have been—"How dared I appropriate that money, without one question—one thought—as to whom it
      could belong? Sent me? No, no! Who could have sent it? Great God of Mercy! Oh, if Thy wrath
      must fall on a guilty one, pour it on me, but spare, spare my brother! I have sinned, but I
      meant it not—thought not of it—knew not what I did! Thou knowest, Thou alone canst know, the
      only thought of that moment—the agony of this. No suffering, no wrath, can be too great for
      me; but, oh! spare him!"
How long that withering agony lasted, Ellen knew not, nor whether her tears fell, or lay
      scorching her eyes and heart. The note lay before her like some hideous specter, from which
      she vainly tried to turn. What could she do with it? Take it back to the spot where the others
      had been blown to her? She tried to rise to do so; but, to her own terror, she found she was
      so powerless, that she actually could not walk. With desperate calmness she placed it in the
      little secret drawer, put up the remainder of her papers, closed and locked her desk, and laid
      down upon her bed, for she could sit up no longer. Ellis came to her with an inquiry after her
      head, and if she could take her dinner. Ellen asked for a cup of coffee, and to be left quite
      quiet instead, as writing had not decreased the pain; and the housekeeper, accustomed to such
      casual attacks, did as she was requested, and came frequently to see her in the course of the
      afternoon and evening; still without perceiving any thing unusual, and, therefore, not
      tormenting her with any expression of surprise or anxiety.
Thought after thought congregated in the poor girl's mind, as she thus lay; so fraught with
      agony that the physical suffering, which was far more than usual, was unfelt, save in its
      paralyzing effect on every limb. Her impulse was to confess exactly what she had done to her
      aunt, the moment she should see her, and conjure her to sentence her to some heavy
      chastisement, that must deaden her present agony; but this was impossible without betraying
      Edward, and nullifying for him the relief she had sent. How could she confess the sin, without
      the full confession of the use to which that money had been applied? Whose were the notes?
      They were stained with damp, as if they must have lain among those withered leaves some time;
      and yet she had heard no inquiry made about them, as the loss of so large a sum would surely
      have demanded. The only plan she could think of, as bringing the least hope of returning
      peace, was still to beseech Mrs. Langford to dispose of her watch and trinkets, and the very
      first mention she heard made of the loss to return the full sum to the real possessor, if
      possible, so secretly as for it not to be traced to herself. She thought, too, that if she
      gave her trinkets, one by one, not all together, to Mrs. Langford, it would be less
      suspicious, and, perhaps, more easily prevail on her to grant her secrecy and assistance; and
      if she positively refused, unless Ellen revealed the reason of her desiring their disposal,
      and would solemnly promise secrecy, she would tell her so much of her intense misery, as might
      perhaps induce her to give her aid. If she did not demand the reason and betrayed her, she
      must endure the doubt and serious displeasure such a course of acting on her part would
      inevitably produce; but two things alone stood clear before her: she must replace
      that money—she must keep Edward's secret. She would have gone that very day to Mrs.
      Langford, but she could not move, and Ellis, at seven o'clock, prevailed on her to undress and
      go to bed.
"Not better, my Ellen? I hoped to-day's perfect quietness would have removed your headache,
      and am quite disappointed," was Mrs. Hamilton's affectionate address, as she softly entered
      her niece's room, on the return of the happy party at eleven at night, and placing the lamp so
      that the bed remained in shade she could not see any expression in Ellen's face, except that
      of suffering, which she naturally attributed to physical pain. "How hot your hands and face
      are, love; I wish you had not left Edward's letter to write to-day. I am afraid we shall be
      obliged to see Mr. Maitland's face again to-morrow; if he were not as kind a friend as he is a
      skillful doctor, I am sure you would get quite tired of him, Ellen. Shall I stay with you? I
      can not bear leaving you in pain and alone!" But Ellen would not hear of it; the pain was not
      more than she was often accustomed to, she said, and, indeed, she did not mind being
      alone—though the unusual, almost passionate, warmth with which she returned Mrs. Hamilton's
      fond kiss betrayed it was no indifference to the affectionate offer which dictated her
      refusal. It was well Mrs. Hamilton, though anxious enough to feel the inclination to do so,
      did not visit her niece again, or the convulsive agony she would have witnessed, the choking
      sobs which burst forth, a few minutes after she disappeared from Ellen's sight, would have
      bewildered and terrified her yet more.
