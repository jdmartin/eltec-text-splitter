CHAPTER XXIII.
THE SUB-PŒNA.

"And must it then depend on this poor eye
 And this unsteady hand, whether the bark,
 That bears my all of treasured hope and love,
 Shall find a passage through these frowning rocks
To some fair port where peace and safety smile,—
 Or whether it shall blindly dash against them,
 And miserably sink? Heaven be my help;
 And clear my eye, and nerve my trembling hand!"
"The Constant Woman."
Her heart beating, her head full of ideas, which required time and solitude to be reduced
     into order, Mary hurried home. She was like one who finds a jewel of which he cannot all at
     once ascertain the value, but who hides his treasure until some quiet hour when he may ponder
     over the capabilities its possession unfolds. She was like one who discovers the silken clue
     which guides to some bower of bliss, and secure of the power within his grasp, has to wait for
     a time before he may tread the labyrinth.
But no jewel, no bower of bliss was ever so precious to miser or lover as was the belief
     which now pervaded Mary's mind, that Jem's innocence might be proved, without involving any
     suspicion of that other—that dear one, so dear, although so criminal—on whose part in this
     cruel business she dared not dwell even in thought. For if she did, there arose the awful
     question,—if all went against Jem the innocent, if judge and jury gave the verdict forth which
     had the looming gallows in the rear, what ought she to do, possessed of her terrible knowledge?
     Surely not to inculpate her father—and yet—and yet—she almost prayed for the blessed
     unconsciousness of death or madness, rather than that awful question should have to be answered
     by her.
But now a way seemed opening, opening yet more clear. She was thankful she had thought of the
      alibi, and yet more thankful to have so easily obtained the clue to Jem's whereabouts
     that miserable night. The bright light that her new hope threw over all seemed also to make her
     thankful for the early time appointed for the trial. It would be easy to catch Will Wilson on
     his return from the Isle of Man, which he had planned should be on the Monday; and on the
     Tuesday all would be made clear—all that she dared to wish to be made clear.
She had still to collect her thoughts and freshen her memory enough to arrange how to meet
     with Will—for to the chances of a letter she would not trust; to find out his lodgings when in
     Liverpool; to try and remember the name of the ship in which he was to sail: and the more she
     considered these points the more difficulty she found there would be in ascertaining these
     minor but important facts. For you are aware that Alice, whose memory was clear and strong on
     all points in which her heart was interested, was lying in a manner senseless: that Jane Wilson
     was (to use her own word, so expressive to a Lancashire ear) "dazed," that is to say,
     bewildered, lost in the confusion of terrifying and distressing thoughts; incapable of
     concentrating her mind; and at the best of times Will's proceedings were a matter of little
     importance to her (or so she pretended), she was so jealous of aught which distracted attention
     from her pearl of price, her only son Jem. So Mary felt hopeless of obtaining any intelligence
     of the sailor's arrangements from her.
Then, should she apply to Jem himself? No! she knew him too well. She felt how thoroughly he
     must ere now have had it in his power to exculpate himself at another's expense. And his tacit
     refusal so to do had assured her of what she had never doubted, that the murderer was safe from
     any impeachment of his. But then neither would he consent, she feared, to any steps which might
     tend to prove himself innocent. At any rate, she could not consult him. He was removed to
     Kirkdale, and time pressed. Already it was Saturday at noon. And even if she could have gone to
     him, I believe she would not. She longed to do all herself; to be his liberator, his deliverer;
     to win him life, though she might never regain his lost love, by her own exertions. And oh! how
     could she see him to discuss a subject in which both knew who was the blood-stained man; and
     yet whose name might not be breathed by either, so dearly with all his faults, his sins, was he
     loved by both.
All at once, when she had ceased to try and remember, the name of Will's ship flashed across
     her mind.
The John Cropper.
He had named it, she had been sure, all along. He had named it in his conversation with her
     that last, that fatal Thursday evening. She repeated it over and over again, through a nervous
     dread of again forgetting it. The John Cropper.
And then, as if she were rousing herself out of some strange stupor, she bethought her of
     Margaret. Who so likely as Margaret to treasure every little particular respecting Will, now
     Alice was dead to all the stirring purposes of life?
She had gone thus far in her process of thought, when a neighbour stepped in; she with whom
     they had usually deposited the house-key, when both Mary and her father were absent from home,
     and who consequently took upon herself to answer all inquiries, and receive all messages which
     any friends might make, or leave, on finding the house shut up.
"Here's somewhat for you, Mary! A policeman left it."
A bit of parchment.
Many people have a dread of those mysterious pieces of parchment. I am one. Mary was another.
     Her heart misgave her as she took it, and looked at the unusual appearance of the writing,
     which, though legible enough, conveyed no idea to her, or rather her mind shut itself up
     against receiving any idea, which after all was rather a proof she had some suspicion of the
     meaning that awaited her.
"What is it?" asked she, in a voice from which all the pith and marrow of strength seemed
     extracted.
"Nay! how should I know? Policeman said he'd call again towards evening, and see if you'd
     getten it. He were loth to leave it, though I telled him who I was, and all about my keeping
     th' key, and taking messages."
"What is it about?" asked Mary again, in the same hoarse, feeble voice, and turning it over
     in her fingers, as if she dreaded to inform herself of its meaning.
"Well! yo can read word of writing and I cannot, so it's queer I should have to tell you. But
     my master says it's a summons for yo to bear witness again Jem Wilson, at th' trial at
     Liverpool Assize."
"God pity me!" said Mary, faintly, as white as a sheet.
"Nay, wench, never take on so. What yo can say will go little way either to help or to
     hinder, for folk say he's certain to be hung; and sure enough it was t'other one as was your
     sweetheart."
But Mary was beyond any pang this speech would have given at another time. Her thoughts were
     all busy picturing to herself the terrible occasion of their next meeting—not as lovers meet
     should they meet!
"Well!" said the neighbour, seeing no use in remaining with one who noticed her words or her
     presence so little; "thou'lt tell policeman thou'st getten his precious bit of paper. He seemed
     to think I should be keeping it for mysel; he's th' first as has ever misdoubted me about
     giving messages, or notes. Good day."
She left the house, but Mary did not know it. She sat still with the parchment in her
     hand.
All at once she started up. She would take it to Job Legh and ask him to tell her the true
     meaning, for it could not be that.
So she went, and choked out her words of inquiry.
"It's a sub-pœna," he replied, turning the parchment over with the air of a connoisseur; for
     Job loved hard words, and lawyer-like forms, and even esteemed himself slightly qualified for a
     lawyer, from the smattering of knowledge he had picked up from an odd volume of Blackstone that
     he had once purchased at a book-stall.
"A sub-pœna—what is that?" gasped Mary, still in suspense.
Job was struck with her voice, her changed, miserable voice, and peered at her countenance
     from over his spectacles.
"A sub-pœna is neither more nor less than this, my dear. It's a summonsing you to attend, and
     answer such questions as may be asked of you regarding the trial of James Wilson, for the
     murder of Henry Carson; that's the long and short of it, only more elegantly put, for the
     benefit of them who knows how to value the gift of language. I've been a witness before-time
     myself; there's nothing much to be afeared on; if they are impudent, why, just you be impudent,
     and give 'em tit for tat."
"Nothing much to be afeared on!" echoed Mary, but in such a different tone.
"Ay, poor wench, I see how it is. It'll go hard with thee a bit, I dare say; but keep up thy
     heart. Yo cannot have much to tell 'em, that can go either one way or th' other. Nay! may be
     thou may do him a bit o' good, for when they set eyes on thee, they'll see fast enough how he
     came to be so led away by jealousy; for thou'rt a pretty creature, Mary, and one look at thy
     face will let 'em into th' secret of a young man's madness, and make 'em more ready to pass it
     over."
"Oh! Job, and won't you ever believe me when I tell you he's innocent? Indeed, and indeed I
     can prove it; he was with Will all that night; he was, indeed, Job!"
"My wench! whose word hast thou for that?" said Job, pityingly.
"Why! his mother told me, and I'll get Will to bear witness to it. But, oh! Job" (bursting
     into tears), "it is hard if you won't believe me. How shall I clear him to strangers, when
     those who know him, and ought to love him, are so set against his being innocent?"
"God knows, I'm not against his being innocent," said Job, solemnly. "I'd give half my
     remaining days on earth,—I'd give them all, Mary (and but for the love I bear to my poor blind
     girl, they'd be no great gift), if I could save him. You've thought me hard, Mary, but I'm not
     hard at bottom, and I'll help you if I can; that I will, right or wrong," he added; but in a
     low voice, and coughed the uncertain words away the moment afterwards.
"Oh, Job! if you will help me," exclaimed Mary, brightening up (though it was but a wintry
     gleam after all), "tell me what to say, when they question me; I shall be so gloppened, [46] I shan't know what to answer."
"Thou canst do nought better than tell the truth. Truth's best at all times, they say; and
     for sure it is when folk have to do with lawyers; for they're 'cute and cunning enough to get
     it out sooner or later, and it makes folk look like Tom Noddies, when truth follows falsehood,
     against their will."
"But I don't know the truth; I mean—I can't say rightly what I mean; but I'm sure, if I were
     pent up, and stared at by hundreds of folk, and asked ever so simple a question, I should be
     for answering it wrong; if they asked me if I had seen you on a Saturday, or a Tuesday, or any
     day, I should have clean forgotten all about it, and say the very thing I should not."
"Well, well, don't go for to get such notions into your head; they're what they call
     'narvous,' and talking on 'em does no good. Here's Margaret! bless the wench! Look, Mary, how
     well she guides hersel."
Job fell to watching his grand-daughter, as with balancing, measured steps, timed almost as
     if to music, she made her way across the street.
Mary shrank as if from a cold blast—shrank from Margaret! The blind girl, with her reserve,
     her silence, seemed to be a severe judge; she, listening, would be such a check to the trusting
     earnestness of confidence, which was beginning to unlock the sympathy of Job. Mary knew herself
     to blame; felt her errors in every fibre of her heart; but yet she would rather have had them
     spoken about, even in terms of severest censure, than have been treated in the icy manner in
     which Margaret had received her that morning.
"Here's Mary," said Job, almost as if he wished to propitiate his grand-daughter, "come to
     take a bit of dinner with us, for I'll warrant she's never thought of cooking any for herself
     to-day; and she looks as wan and pale as a ghost."
It was calling out the feeling of hospitality, so strong and warm in most of those who have
     little to offer, but whose heart goes eagerly and kindly with that little. Margaret came
     towards Mary with a welcoming gesture, and a kinder manner by far than she had used in the
     morning.
"Nay, Mary, thou know'st thou'st getten nought at home," urged Job.
And Mary, faint and weary, and with a heart too aching-full of other matters to be
     pertinacious in this, withdrew her refusal.
They ate their dinner quietly; for to all it was an effort to speak, and after one or two
     attempts they had subsided into silence.
When the meal was ended Job began again on the subject they all had at heart.
"Yon poor lad at Kirkdale will want a lawyer to see they don't put on him, but do him
     justice. Hast thought of that?"
Mary had not, and felt sure his mother had not.
Margaret confirmed this last supposition.
"I've but just been there, and poor Jane is like one dateless; so many griefs come on her at
     once. One time she seems to make sure he'll be hung; and if I took her in that way, she flew
     out (poor body!) and said, that in spite of what folk said, there were them as could, and would
     prove him guiltless. So I never knew where to have her. The only thing she was constant in, was
     declaring him innocent."
"Mother-like!" said Job.
"She meant Will, when she spoke of them that could prove him innocent. He was with Will on
     Thursday night, walking a part of the way with him to Liverpool; now the thing is to lay hold
     on Will and get him to prove this." So spoke Mary, calm, from the earnestness of her
     purpose.
"Don't build too much on it, my dear," said Job.
"I do build on it," replied Mary, "because I know it's the truth, and I mean to try and prove
     it, come what may. Nothing you can say will daunt me, Job, so don't you go and try. You may
     help, but you cannot hinder me doing what I'm resolved on."
They respected her firmness of determination, and Job almost gave in to her belief, when he
     saw how steadfastly she was acting upon it. Oh! surest way of conversion to our faith, whatever
     it may be,—regarding either small things, or great,—when it is beheld as the actuating
     principle, from which we never swerve! When it is seen that, instead of over-much profession,
     it is worked into the life, and moves every action!
Mary gained courage as she instinctively felt she had made way with one at least of her
     companions.
"Now I'm clear about this much," she continued, "he was with Will when the—shot was fired
     (she could not bring herself to say, when the murder was committed, when she remembered
      who it was that, she had every reason to believe, was the taker-away of life). Will
     can prove this. I must find Will. He wasn't to sail till Tuesday. There's time enough. He was
     to come back from his uncle's, in the Isle of Man, on Monday. I must meet him in Liverpool, on
     that day, and tell him what has happened, and how poor Jem is in trouble, and that he must
     prove an alibi, come Tuesday. All this I can and will do, though perhaps I don't
     clearly know how, just at present. But surely God will help me. When I know I'm doing right, I
     will have no fear, but put my trust in Him; for I'm acting for the innocent and good, and not
     for my own self, who have done so wrong. I have no fear when I think of Jem, who is so
     good."
She stopped, oppressed with the fulness of her heart. Margaret began to love her again; to
     see in her the same sweet, faulty, impulsive, lovable creature she had known in the former Mary
     Barton, but with more of dignity, self-reliance, and purpose.
Mary spoke again.
"Now I know the name of Will's vessel—the John Cropper; and I know that she is bound
     to America. That is something to know. But I forget, if I ever heard, where he lodges in
     Liverpool. He spoke of his landlady, as a good, trustworthy woman; but if he named her name, it
     has slipped my memory. Can you help me, Margaret?"
She appealed to her friend calmly and openly, as if perfectly aware of, and recognising the
     unspoken tie which bound her and Will together; she asked her in the same manner in which she
     would have asked a wife where her husband dwelt. And Margaret replied in the like calm tone,
     two spots of crimson on her cheeks alone bearing witness to any internal agitation.
"He lodges at a Mrs. Jones's, Milk-House Yard, out of Nicholas Street. He has lodged there
     ever since he began to go to sea; she is a very decent kind of woman, I believe."
"Well, Mary! I'll give you my prayers," said Job. "It's not often I pray regular, though I
     often speak a word to God, when I'm either very happy or very sorry; I've catched myself
     thanking Him at odd hours when I've found a rare insect, or had a fine day for an out; but I
     cannot help it, no more than I can talking to a friend. But this time I'll pray regular for
     Jem, and for you. And so will Margaret, I'll be bound. Still, wench! what think yo of a lawyer?
     I know one, Mr. Cheshire, who's rather given to th' insect line—and a good kind o' chap. He and
     I have swopped specimens many's the time, when either of us had a duplicate. He'll do me a kind
     turn, I'm sure. I'll just take my hat, and pay him a visit."
No sooner said, than done.
Margaret and Mary were left alone. And this seemed to bring back the feeling of awkwardness,
     not to say estrangement.
But Mary, excited to an unusual pitch of courage, was the first to break silence.
"Oh, Margaret!" said she, "I see—I feel how wrong you think I have acted; you cannot think me
     worse than I think myself, now my eyes are opened." Here her sobs came choking up her
     voice.
"Nay," Margaret began, "I have no right to—"
"Yes, Margaret, you have a right to judge; you cannot help it; only in your judgment remember
     mercy, as the Bible says. You, who have been always good, cannot tell how easy it is at first
     to go a little wrong, and then how hard it is to go back. Oh! I little thought when I was first
     pleased with Mr. Carson's speeches, how it would all end; perhaps in the death of him I love
     better than life."
She burst into a passion of tears. The feelings pent up through the day would have vent. But
     checking herself with a strong effort, and looking up at Margaret as piteously as if those
     calm, stony eyes could see her imploring face, she added,
"I must not cry; I must not give way; there will be time enough for that hereafter, if—I only
     wanted you to speak kindly to me, Margaret, for I am very, very wretched; more wretched than
     any one can ever know; more wretched, I sometimes fancy, than I have deserved,—but that's
     wrong, isn't it, Margaret? Oh! I have done wrong, and I am punished; you cannot tell how
     much."
Who could resist her voice, her tones of misery, of humility? Who would refuse the kindness
     for which she begged so penitently? Not Margaret. The old friendly manner came back. With it,
     may be, more of tenderness.
"Oh! Margaret, do you think he can be saved; do you think they can find him guilty if Will
     comes forward as a witness? Won't that be a good alibi?"
Margaret did not answer for a moment.
"Oh, speak! Margaret," said Mary, with anxious impatience.
"I know nought about law, or alibis," replied Margaret, meekly; "but, Mary, as
     grandfather says, aren't you building too much on what Jane Wilson has told you about his going
     with Will? Poor soul, she's gone dateless, I think, with care, and watching, and over-much
     trouble; and who can wonder? Or Jem may have told her he was going, by way of a blind."
"You don't know Jem," said Mary, starting from her seat in a hurried manner, "or you would
     not say so."
"I hope I may be wrong; but think, Mary, how much there is against him. The shot was fired
     with his gun; he it was as threatened Mr. Carson not many days before; he was absent from home
     at that very time, as we know, and, as I'm much afeared, some one will be called on to prove;
     and there's no one else to share suspicion with him."
Mary heaved a deep sigh.
"But, Margaret, he did not do it," Mary again asserted.
Margaret looked unconvinced.
"I can do no good, I see, by saying so, for none on you believe me, and I won't say so again
     till I can prove it. Monday morning I'll go to Liverpool. I shall be at hand for the trial. Oh
     dear! dear! And I will find Will; and then, Margaret, I think you'll be sorry for being so
     stubborn about Jem."
"Don't fly off, dear Mary; I'd give a deal to be wrong. And now I'm going to be plain spoken.
     You'll want money. Them lawyers is no better than a spunge for sucking up money; let alone your
     hunting out Will, and your keep in Liverpool, and what not. You must take some of the mint I've
     got laid by in the old tea-pot. You have no right to refuse, for I offer it to Jem, not to you;
     it's for his purposes you're to use it."
"I know—I see. Thank you, Margaret; you're a kind one, at any rate. I take it for Jem; and
     I'll do my very best with it for him. Not all, though; don't think I'll take all. They'll pay
     me for my keep. I'll take this," accepting a sovereign from the hoard which Margaret produced
     out of its accustomed place in the cupboard. "Your grandfather will pay the lawyer. I'll have
     nought to do with him," shuddering as she remembered Job's words, about lawyers' skill in
     always discovering the truth, sooner or later; and knowing what was the secret she had to
     hide.
"Bless you! don't make such ado about it," said Margaret, cutting short Mary's thanks. "I
     sometimes think there's two sides to the commandment; and that we may say, 'Let others do unto
     you, as you would do unto them,' for pride often prevents our giving others a great deal of
     pleasure, in not letting them be kind, when their hearts are longing to help; and when we
     ourselves should wish to do just the same, if we were in their place. Oh! how often I've been
     hurt, by being coldly told by persons not to trouble myself about their care, or sorrow, when I
     saw them in great grief, and wanted to be of comfort. Our Lord Jesus was not above letting folk
     minister to Him, for He knew how happy it makes one to do aught for another. It's the happiest
     work on earth."
Mary had been too much engrossed by watching what was passing in the street to attend very
     closely to that which Margaret was saying. From her seat she could see out of the window pretty
     plainly, and she caught sight of a gentleman walking alongside of Job, evidently in earnest
     conversation with him, and looking keen and penetrating enough to be a lawyer. Job was laying
     down something to be attended to she could see, by his up-lifted fore-finger, and his whole
     gesture; then he pointed and nodded across the street to his own house, as if inducing his
     companion to come in. Mary dreaded lest he should, and she be subjected to a closer
     cross-examination than she had hitherto undergone, as to why she was so certain that Jem was
     innocent. She feared he was coming; he stepped a little towards the spot. No! it was only to
     make way for a child, tottering along, whom Mary had overlooked. Now Job took him by the
     button, so earnestly familiar had he grown. The gentleman looked "fidging fain" to be gone, but
     submitted in a manner that made Mary like him in spite of his profession. Then came a volley of
     last words, answered by briefest nods, and monosyllables; and then the stranger went off with
     redoubled quickness of pace, and Job crossed the street with a little satisfied air of
     importance on his kindly face.
"Well! Mary," said he on entering, "I've seen the lawyer, not Mr. Cheshire though; trials for
     murder, it seems, are not his line o' business. But he gived me a note to another 'torney; a
     fine fellow enough, only too much of a talker; I could hardly get a word in, he cut me so
     short. However, I've just been going over the principal points again to him; may be you saw us?
     I wanted him just to come over and speak to you himsel, Mary, but he was pressed for time; and
     he said your evidence would not be much either here or there. He's going to the 'sizes first
     train on Monday morning, and will see Jem, and hear the ins and outs from him, and he's gived
     me his address, Mary, and you and Will are to call on him (Will 'special) on Monday at two
     o'clock. Thou'rt taking it in, Mary; thou'rt to call on him in Liverpool at two, Monday
     afternoon?"
Job had reason to doubt if she fully understood him; for all this minuteness of detail, these
     satisfactory arrangements, as he considered them, only seemed to bring the circumstances in
     which she was placed more vividly home to Mary. They convinced her that it was real, and not
     all a dream, as she had sunk into fancying it for a few minutes, while sitting in the old
     accustomed place, her body enjoying the rest, and her frame sustained by food, and listening to
     Margaret's calm voice. The gentleman she had just beheld would see and question Jem in a few
     hours, and what would be the result?
Monday: that was the day after to-morrow, and on Tuesday, life and death would be tremendous
     realities to her lover; or else death would be an awful certainty to her father.
No wonder Job went over his main points again:—
"Monday; at two o'clock, mind; and here's his card. 'Mr. Bridgenorth, 41, Renshaw Street,
     Liverpool.' He'll be lodging there."
Job ceased talking, and the silence roused Mary up to thank him.
"You're very kind, Job; very. You and Margaret won't desert me, come what will."
"Pooh! pooh! wench; don't lose heart, just as I'm beginning to get it. He seems to think a
     deal on Will's evidence. You're sure, girls, you're under no mistake about Will?"
"I'm sure," said Mary, "he went straight from here, purposing to go see his uncle at the Isle
     of Man, and be back Sunday night, ready for the ship sailing on Tuesday."
"So am I," said Margaret. "And the ship's name was the John Cropper, and he lodged
     where I told Mary before. Have you got it down, Mary?" Mary wrote it on the back of Mr.
     Bridgenorth's card.
"He was not over-willing to go," said she, as she wrote, "for he knew little about his uncle,
     and said he didn't care if he never knowed more. But he said kinsfolk was kinsfolk, and
     promises was promises, so he'd go for a day or so, and then it would be over."
Margaret had to go and practise some singing in town; so, though loth to depart and be alone,
     Mary bade her friends good-bye.
