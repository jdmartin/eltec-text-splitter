Chapter 3
Irresolution
On returning to the cabinet, where his fatal compact with Rougemont had been signed, Auriol
     perceived the pocket-book lying on the floor near the table, and, taking it up, he was about to
     deposit it in the writing-desk, when an irresistible impulse prompted him once more to examine
     its contents. Unfolding the roll of notes, he counted them, and found they amounted to more
     than a hundred thousand pounds. The sight of so much wealth, and the thought of the pleasure
     and the power it would procure him, gradually dispelled his fears, and arising in a transport
     of delight, he exclaimed—“Yes, yes—all obstacles are now removed! When Mr. Talbot finds I am
     become thus wealthy, he will no longer refuse me his daughter. But I am mad,” he added,
     suddenly checking himself—“worse than mad, to indulge such hopes. If it be indeed the Fiend to
     whom I have sold myself, I have no help from perdition! If it be man, I am scarcely less
     terribly fettered. In either case, I will not remain here longer; nor will I avail myself of
     this accursed money, which has tempted me to my undoing.”
And, hurling the pocket-book to the farther end of the room, he was about to pass through the
     door, when a mocking laugh arrested him. He looked round with astonishment and dread, but could
     see no one. After a while, he again moved forward, but a voice, which he recognised as that of
     Rougemont, called upon him to stay.
“It will be in vain to fly,” said the unseen speaker. “You cannot escape me. Whether you
     remain here or not—whether you use the wealth I have given you, or leave it behind you—you
     cannot annul your bargain. With this knowledge, you are at liberty to go. But remember, on the
     seventh night from this I shall require Edith Talbot from you!”
“Where are you, fiend?” demanded Auriol, gazing around furiously. “Show yourself, that I may
     confront you.”
A mocking laugh was the only response deigned to this injunction.
“Give me back the compact,” cried Auriol imploringly. “It was signed in ignorance. I knew not
     the price I was to pay for your assistance. Wealth is of no value to me without Edith.”
“Without wealth you could not obtain her,” replied the voice. “You are only, therefore, where
     you were. But you will think better of the bargain to-morrow. Meanwhile, I counsel you to place
     the money you have so unwisely cast from you safely under lock and key, and to seek repose. You
     will awaken with very different thoughts in the morning.”
“How am I to account for my sudden accession of wealth?” inquired Auriol, after a pause.
“You a gambler, and ask that question!” returned the unseen stranger, with a bitter laugh.
     “But I will make your mind easy on that score. As regards the house, you will find a regular
     conveyance of it within that writing-desk, while the note lying on the table, which bears your
     address, comes from me, and announces the payment of a hundred and twenty thousand pounds to
     you, as a debt of honour. You see I have provided against every difficulty. And now,
     farewell!”
The voice was then hushed; and though Auriol addressed several other questions to the unseen
     speaker, no answer was returned him.
After some moments of irresolution, Auriol once more took up the pocket-book, and deposited
     it in the writing-desk, in which he found, as he had been led to expect, a deed conveying the
     house to him. He then opened the note lying upon the table, and found its contents accorded
     with what had just been told him. Placing it with the pocket-book, he locked the writing-desk,
     exclaiming, “It is useless to struggle further—I must yield to fate!”
This done, he went into the adjoining room, and, casting his eyes about, remarked the antique
     bottle and flagon. The latter was filled to the brim—how or with what, Auriol paused not to
     examine; but seizing the cup with desperation, he placed it to his lips, and emptied it at a
     draught.
A species of intoxication, but pleasing as that produced by opium, presently succeeded. All
     his fears left him, and in their place the gentlest and most delicious fancies arose.
     Surrendering himself delightedly to their influence, he sank upon a couch, and for some time
     was wrapped in a dreamy elysium, imagining himself wandering with Edith Talbot in a lovely
     garden, redolent of sweets, and vocal with the melody of birds. Their path led through a grove,
     in the midst of which was a fountain; and they were hastening towards its marble brink, when
     all at once Edith uttered a scream, and, starting back, pointed to a large black snake lying
     before her, and upon which she would have trodden the next moment. Auriol sprang forward and
     tried to crush the reptile with his heel; but, avoiding the blow, it coiled around his leg, and
     plunged its venom teeth into his flesh. The anguish occasioned by the imaginary wound roused
     him from his slumber, and looking up, he perceived that a servant was in attendance.
Bowing obsequiously, the man inquired whether he had occasion for anything.
“Show me to my bedroom—that is all I require,” replied Auriol, scarcely able to shake off the
     effect of the vision.
And, getting up, he followed the man, almost mechanically, out of the room.
