Chapter 2
The Dog-fancier
The Rookery! Who that has passed Saint Giles’s, on the way to the city, or coming from it,
     but has caught a glimpse, through some narrow opening, of its squalid habitations, and wretched
     and ruffianly occupants! Who but must have been struck with amazement, that such a huge
     receptacle of vice and crime should be allowed to exist in the very heart of the metropolis,
     like an ulcerated spot, capable of tainting the whole system! Of late, the progress of
     improvement has caused its removal; but whether any less cogent motive would have abated the
     nuisance may be questioned. For years the evil was felt and complained of, but no effort was
     made to remedy it, or to cleanse these worse than Augean stables. As the place is now
     partially, if not altogether, swept away, and a wide and airy street passes through the midst
     of its foul recesses, a slight sketch may be given of its former appearance.
Entering a narrow street, guarded by posts and cross-bars, a few steps from the crowded
     thoroughfare brought you into a frightful region, the refuge, it was easy to perceive, of half
     the lawless characters infesting the metropolis. The coarsest ribaldry assailed your ears, and
     noisome odours afflicted your sense of smell. As you advanced, picking your way through kennels
     flowing with filth, or over putrescent heaps of rubbish and oyster-shells, all the repulsive
     and hideous features of the place were displayed before you. There was something savagely
     picturesque in the aspect of the place, but its features were too loathsome to be regarded with
     any other feeling than disgust. The houses looked as sordid, and as thickly crusted with the
     leprosy of vice, as their tenants. Horrible habitations they were, in truth. Many of them were
     without windows, and where the frames were left, brown paper or tin supplied the place of
     glass; some even wanted doors, and no effort was made to conceal the squalor within. On the
     contrary, it seemed to be intruded on observation. Miserable rooms, almost destitute of
     furniture; floors and walls caked with dirt, or decked with coarse flaring prints; shameless
     and abandoned-looking women; children without shoes and stockings, and with scarcely a rag to
     their backs: these were the chief objects that met the view. Of men, few were visible—the
     majority being out on business, it is to be presumed; but where a solitary straggler was seen,
     his sinister looks and mean attire were in perfect keeping with the spot. So thickly inhabited
     were these wretched dwellings, that every chamber, from garret to cellar, swarmed with inmates.
     As to the cellars, they looked like dismal caverns, which a wild beast would shun.
     Clothes-lines were hung from house to house, festooned with every kind of garment. Out of the
     main street branched several alleys and passages, all displaying the same degree of misery, or,
     if possible, worse, and teeming with occupants. Personal security, however, forbade any attempt
     to track these labyrinths; but imagination, after the specimen afforded, could easily picture
     them. It was impossible to move a step without insult or annoyance. Every human being seemed
     brutalised and degraded; and the women appeared utterly lost to decency, and made the street
     ring with their cries, their quarrels, and their imprecations. It was a positive relief to
     escape from this hotbed of crime to the world without, and breathe a purer atmosphere.
Such being the aspect of the Rookery in the daytime, what must it have been when crowded with
     its denizens at night! Yet at such an hour it will now be necessary to enter its
     penetralia.
After escaping from the ruined house in the Vauxhall Road, the two ruffians shaped their
     course towards Saint Giles’s, running the greater part of the way, and reaching the Broadway
     just as the church clock struck two. Darting into a narrow alley, and heedless of any
     obstructions they encountered in their path, they entered a somewhat wider cross-street, which
     they pursued for a short distance, and then struck into an entry, at the bottom of which was a
     swing-door that admitted them into a small court, where they found a dwarfish person wrapped in
     a tattered watchman’s greatcoat, seated on a stool with a horn lantern in his hand and a cutty
     in his mouth, the glow of which lighted up his hard, withered features. This was the
     deputy-porter of the lodging-house they were about to enter. Addressing him by the name of Old
     Parr, the ruffians passed on, and lifting the latch of another door, entered a sort of kitchen,
     at the farther end of which blazed a cheerful fire, with a large copper kettle boiling upon it.
     On one side of the room was a deal table, round which several men of sinister aspect and sordid
     attire were collected, playing, at cards. A smaller table of the same material stood near the
     fire, and opposite it was a staircase leading to the upper rooms. The place was dingy and dirty
     in the extreme, the floors could not have been scoured for years, and the walls were begrimed
     with filth. In one corner, with his head resting on a heap of coals and coke, lay a boy almost
     as black as a chimney-sweep, fast asleep. He was the waiter. The principal light was afforded
     by a candle stuck against the wall, with a tin reflector behind it. Before the fire, with his
     back turned towards it, stood a noticeable individual, clad in a velveteen jacket with ivory
     buttons, a striped waistcoat, drab knees, a faded black silk neckcloth tied in a great bow, and
     a pair of ancient Wellingtons ascending half-way up his legs, which looked disproportionately
     thin when compared with the upper part of his square, robustious, and somewhat pursy frame. His
     face was broad, jolly, and good-humoured, with a bottle-shaped nose, fleshy lips, and light
     grey eyes, glistening with cunning and roguery. His hair, which dangled in long flakes over his
     ears and neck, was of a dunnish red, as were also his whiskers and beard. A superannuated white
     castor, with a black hat-band round it, was cocked knowingly on one side of his head, and gave
     him a flashy and sporting look. His particular vocation was made manifest by the number of dogs
     he had about him. A beautiful black-and-tan spaniel, of Charles the Second’s breed, popped its
     short snubby nose and long silken ears out of each coat-pocket. A pug was thrust into his
     breast, and he carried an exquisite Blenheim under either arm. At his feet reposed an Isle of
     Skye terrier, and a partly cropped French poodle, of snowy whiteness, with a red worsted riband
     round his throat. This person, it need scarcely be said, was a dog-fancier, or, in other words,
     a dealer in, and a stealer of, dogs, as well as a practiser of all the tricks connected with
     that nefarious trade. His self-satisfied air made it evident he thought himself a smart, clever
     fellow,—and adroit and knavish he was, no doubt,—while his droll, plausible, and rather winning
     manners helped him materially to impose upon his customers. His real name was Taylor, but he
     was known among his companions by the appellation of Ginger. On the entrance of the Sandman and
     the Tinker, he nodded familiarly to them, and with a sly look inquired—“Vell, my ‘arties—wot
     luck?”
“Oh, pretty middlin’,” replied the Sandman gruffly.
And seating himself at the table, near the fire, he kicked up the lad, who was lying fast
     asleep on the coals, and bade him fetch a pot of half-and-half. The Tinker took a place beside
     him, and they waited in silence the arrival of the liquor, which, when it came, was disposed of
     at a couple of pulls; while Mr. Ginger, seeing they were engaged, sauntered towards the
     card-table, attended by his four-footed companions.
“And now,” said the Sandman, unable to control his curiosity longer, and taking out his
     pocket-book, “we’ll see what fortun’ has given us.”

So saying, he unclasped the pocket-book, while the Tinker bent over him in eager curiosity.
     But their search for money was fruitless. Not a single bank-note was forthcoming. There were
     several memoranda and slips of paper, a few cards, and an almanac for the year—that was all. It
     was a great disappointment.
“So we’ve had all this trouble for nuffin’, and nearly got shot into the bargain,” cried the
     Sandman, slapping down the book on the table with an oath. “I vish I’d never undertaken the
     job.”
“Don’t let’s give it up in sich an ‘urry,” replied the Tinker; “summat may be made on it yet.
     Let’s look over them papers.”
“Look ’em over yourself,” rejoined the Sandman, pushing the book towards him. “I’ve done wi’
     ’em. Here, lazy-bones, bring two glasses o’ rum-and-water—stiff, d’ye hear?”
While the sleepy youth bestirred himself to obey these injunctions, the Tinker read over
     every memorandum in the pocket-book, and then proceeded carefully to examine the different
     scraps of paper with which it was filled. Not content with one perusal, he looked them all over
     again, and then began to rub his hands with great glee.
“Wot’s the matter?” cried the Sandman, who had lighted a cutty, and was quietly smoking it.
     “Wot’s the row, eh?”
“Vy, this is it,” replied the Tinker, unable to contain his satisfaction; “there’s secrets
     contained in this here pocket-book as’ll be worth a hundred pound and better to us. We ha’n’t
     had our trouble for nuffin’.”
“Glad to hear it!” said the Sandman, looking hard at him. “Wot kind o’ secrets are they?”
“Vy, hangin’ secrets,” replied the Tinker, with mysterious emphasis. “He seems to be
     a terrible chap, and to have committed murder wholesale.”
“Wholesale!” echoed the Sandman, removing the pipe from his lips. “That sounds awful. But
     what a precious donkey he must be to register his crimes i’ that way.”
“He didn’t expect the pocket-book to fall into our hands,” said the Tinker.
“Werry likely not,” replied the Sandman; “but somebody else might see it. I repeat, he must
     be a fool. S’pose we wos to make a entry of everythin’ we does. Wot a nice balance there’d be
     agin us ven our accounts comed to be wound up!”
“Ourn is a different bus’ness altogether,” replied the Tinker. “This seems a werry mysterious
     sort o’ person. Wot age should you take him to be?”
“Vy, five-an’-twenty at the outside,” replied the Sandman.
“Five-an’-sixty ‘ud be nearer the mark,” replied the Tinker. “There’s dates as far back as
     that.”
“Five-an’-sixty devils!” cried the Sandman; “there must be some mistake i’ the reckonin’
     there.”
“No, it’s all clear an’ reg’lar,” rejoined the other; “and that doesn’t seem to be the end of
     it neither. I looked over the papers twice, and one, dated 1780, refers to some other
     dokiments.”
“They must relate to his granddad, then,” said the Sandman; “it’s impossible they can refer
     to him.”
“But I tell ‘ee they do refer to him,” said the Tinker, somewhat angrily, at having
     his assertion denied; “at least, if his own word’s to be taken. Anyhow, these papers is
     waluable to us. If no one else believes in ’em, it’s clear he believes in ’em hisself, and will
     be glad to buy ’em from us.”
“That’s a view o’ the case worthy of an Old Bailey lawyer,” replied the Sandman. “Wot’s the
     gemman’s name?”
“The name on the card is Auriol Darcy,” replied the Tinker.
“Any address?” asked the Sandman.
The Tinker shook his head.
“That’s unlucky agin,” said the Sandman. “Ain’t there no sort o’ clue?”
“None votiver, as I can perceive,” said the Tinker.
“Vy, zounds, then, ve’re jist vere ve started from,” cried the Sandman. “But it don’t matter.
     There’s not much chance o’ makin’ a bargin vith him. The crack o’ the skull I gave him has done
     his bus’ness.”
“Nuffin’ o’ the kind,” replied the Tinker. “He alvays recovers from every kind of
     accident.”
“Alvays recovers!” exclaimed the Sandman, in amazement. “Wot a constitootion he must
     have!”
“Surprisin’!” replied the Tinker; “he never suffers from injuries—at least, not much; never
     grows old; and never expects to die; for he mentions wot he intends doin’ a hundred years
     hence.”
“Oh, he’s a lu-nattic!” exclaimed the Sandman, “a downright lu-nattic; and that accounts for
     his wisitin’ that ’ere ruined house, and a-fancyin’ he heerd some one talk to him. He’s mad,
     depend upon it. That is, if I ain’t cured him.”
“I’m of a different opinion,” said the Tinker.
“And so am I,” said Mr. Ginger, who had approached unobserved, and overheard the greater part
     of their discourse.
“Vy, vot can you know about it, Ginger?” said the Sandman, looking up, evidently rather
     annoyed.
“I only know this,” replied Ginger, “that you’ve got a good case, and if you’ll let me into
     it, I’ll engage to make summat of it.”
“Vell, I’m agreeable,” said the Sandman.
“And so am I,” added the Tinker.
“Not that I pays much regard to wot you’ve bin a readin’ in his papers,” purused Ginger; “the
     gemman’s evidently half-cracked, if he ain’t cracked altogether—but he’s jist the person to
     work upon. He fancies hisself immortal—eh?”
“Exactly so,” replied the Tinker.
“And he also fancies he’s committed a lot o’ murders?” perused Ginger.
“A desperate lot,” replied the Tinker.
“Then he’ll be glad to buy those papers at any price,” said Ginger. “Ve’ll deal vith him in
     regard to the pocket-book, as I deals vith regard to a dog—ask a price for its
     restitootion.”
“We must find him out first,” said the Sandman.
“There’s no difficulty in that,” rejoined Ginger. “You must be constantly on the look-out.
     You’re sure to meet him some time or other.”
“That’s true,” replied the Sandman; “and there’s no fear of his knowin’ us, for the werry
     moment he looked round I knocked him on the head.”
“Arter all,” said the Tinker, “there’s no branch o’ the perfession so safe as yours, Ginger.
     The law is favourable to you, and the beaks is afeerd to touch you. I think I shall turn
     dog-fancier myself.”
“It’s a good business,” replied Ginger, “but it requires a hedication. As I wos sayin’, we
     gets a high price sometimes for restorin’ a favourite, especially ven ve’ve a soft-hearted lady
     to deal vith. There’s some vimen as fond o’ dogs as o’ their own childer, and ven ve gets one
     o’ their precious pets, ve makes ’em ransom it as the brigands you see at the Adelphi or the
     Surrey sarves their prisoners, threatenin’ to send first an ear, and then a paw, or a tail, and
     so on. I’ll tell you wot happened t’other day. There wos a lady—a Miss Vite—as was desperate
     fond of her dog. It wos a ugly warmint, but no matter for that—the creater had gained her
     heart. Vell, she lost it; and, somehow or other, I found it. She vos in great trouble, and a
     friend o’ mine calls to say she can have the dog agin, but she must pay eight pound for it. She
     thinks this dear, and a friend o’ her own adwises her to wait, sayin’ better terms will be
     offered; so I sends vord by my friend that if she don’t come down at once the poor animal’s
     throat vill be cut that werry night.”
“Ha!—ha!—ha!” laughed the others.
“Vell, she sent four pound, and I put up with it,” pursued Ginger; “but about a month
     arterwards she loses her favourite agin, and, strange to say, I finds it. The same game is
     played over agin, and she comes down with another four pound. But she takes care this time that
     I shan’t repeat the trick; for no sooner does she obtain persession of her favourite than she
     embarks in the steamer for France, in the hope of keeping her dog safe there.”
“Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortinate Miss Bailey!—Fol-de-riddle-tol-ol-lol—unfortinate Miss Bailey!”
     sang the Tinker.
“But there’s dog-fanciers in France, ain’t there?” asked the Sandman.
“Lor’ bless ‘ee, yes,” replied Ginger; “there’s as many fanciers i’ France as here. Vy, ve
     drives a smartish trade wi’ them through them foreign steamers. There’s scarcely a steamer as
     leaves the port o’ London but takes out a cargo o’ dogs. Ve sells ’em to the stewards, stokers,
     and sailors—cheap—and no questins asked. They goes to Ostend, Antverp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and
     sometimes to Havre. There’s a Mounseer Coqquilu as comes over to buy dogs, and ve takes ’em to
     him at a house near Billinsgit market.”
“Then you’re alvays sure o’ a ready market somehow,” observed the Sandman.
“Sartin,” replied Ginger, “cos the law’s so kind to us. Vy, bless you, a perliceman can’t
     detain us, even if he knows ve’ve a stolen dog in our persession, and ve svears it’s our own;
     and yet he’d stop you in a minnit if he seed you with a suspicious-lookin’ bundle under your
     arm. Now, jist to show you the difference atwixt the two perfessions:—I steals a dog—walue,
     maybe, fifty pound, or p’raps more. Even if I’m catched i’ the fact I may get fined twenty
     pound, or have six months’ imprisonment; vile, if you steals an old fogle, walue three fardens,
     you’ll get seven years abroad, to a dead certainty.”
“That seems hard on us,” observed the Sandman reflectively.
“It’s the law!” exclaimed Ginger triumphantly. “Now, ve generally escapes by payin’
     the fine, ‘cos our pals goes and steals more dogs to raise the money. Ve alvays stands by each
     other. There’s a reg’lar horganisation among us; so ve can alvays bring vitnesses to svear vot
     ve likes, and ve so puzzles the beaks, that the case gets dismissed, and the constable says,
     ‘Vich party shall I give the dog to, your vorship?’ Upon vich, the beak replies, a-shakin’ of
     his vise noddle, ‘Give it to the person in whose persession it was found. I have nuffin’ more
     to do vith it.’ In course the dog is delivered up to us.”
“The law seems made for dog-fanciers,” remarked the Tinker.
“Wot d’ye think o’ this?” pursued Ginger. “I wos a-standin’ at the corner o’ Gray’s Inn Lane
     vith some o’ my pals near a coach-stand, ven a lady passes by vith this here dog—an’ a beauty
     it is, a real long-eared Charley—a follerin’ of her. Vell, the moment I spies it, I unties my
     apron, whips up the dog, and covers it up in a trice. Vell, the lady sees me, an’ gives me in
     charge to a perliceman. But that si’nifies nuffin’. I brings six vitnesses to svear the dog vos
     mine, and I actually had it since it vos a blind little puppy; and, wot’s more, I brings its
      mother, and that settles the pint. So in course I’m discharged; the dog is given up
     to me; and the lady goes avay lamentin’. I then plays the amiable, an’ offers to sell it her
     for twenty guineas, seein’ as how she had taken a fancy to it; but she von’t bite. So if I
     don’t sell it next week, I shall send it to Mounseer Coqquilu. The only vay you can go wrong is
     to steal a dog wi’ a collar on, for if you do, you may get seven years’ transportation for a
     bit o’ leather and a brass plate vorth a shillin’, vile the animal, though vorth a hundred
     pound, can’t hurt you. There’s law again—ha, ha!”
“Dog-fancier’s law!” laughed the Sandman.
“Some of the Fancy is given to cruelty,” pursued Ginger, “and crops a dog’s ears, or pulls
     out his teeth to disguise him; but I’m too fond o’ the animal for that. I may frighten old
     ladies sometimes, as I told you afore, but I never seriously hurts their pets. Nor did I ever
     kill a dog for his skin, as some on ’em does.”
“And you’re always sure o’ gettin’ a dog, if you vants it, I s’pose?” inquired the
     Tinker.
“Alvays,” replied Ginger. “No man’s dog is safe. I don’t care how he’s kept, ve’re sure to
     have him at last. Ve feels our vay with the sarvents, and finds out from them the walley the
     master or missis sets on the dog, and soon after that the animal’s gone. Vith a bit o’ liver,
     prepared in my partic’lar vay, I can tame the fiercest dog as ever barked, take him off his
     chain, an’ bring him arter me at a gallop.”
“And do respectable parties ever buy dogs knowin’ they’re stolen?” inquired the Tinker.
“Ay, to be sure,” replied Ginger; “sometimes first-rate nobs. They put us up to it
     themselves; they’ll say, ‘I’ve jist left my Lord So-and-So’s, and there I seed a couple o’ the
     finest pointers I ever clapped eyes on. I vant you to get me jist sich another
     couple.’ Vell, ve understands in a minnit, an’ in doo time the identicle dogs finds their
     vay to our customer.”
“Oh! that’s how it’s done?” remarked the Sandman.
“Yes, that’s the vay,” replied Ginger. “Sometimes a party’ll vant a couple o’ dogs for the
     shootin’ season; and then ve asks, ‘Vich vay are you a-goin’—into Surrey or Kent?’ And
     accordin’ as the answer is given ve arranges our plans.”
“Vell, yourn appears a profitable and safe employment, I must say,” remarked the Sandman.
“Perfectly so,” replied Ginger. “Nothin’ can touch us till dogs is declared by statute to be
     property, and stealin’ ’em a misdemeanour. And that won’t occur in my time.”
“Let’s hope not,” rejoined the other two.
“To come back to the pint from vich we started,” said the Tinker; “our gemman’s case is not
     so surprisin’ as it at first appears. There are some persons as believe they never will die—and
     I myself am of the same opinion. There’s our old deputy here—him as ve calls Old Parr—vy, he
     declares he lived in Queen Bess’s time, recollects King Charles bein’ beheaded perfectly vell,
     and remembers the Great Fire o’ London, as if it only occurred yesterday.”
“Walker!” exclaimed Ginger, putting his finger to his nose.
“You may larf, but it’s true,” replied the Tinker. “I recollect an old man tellin’ me that he
     knew the deputy sixty years ago, and he looked jist the same then as now,—neither older nor
     younger.”
“Humph!” exclaimed Ginger. “He don’t look so old now.”
“That’s the cur’ousest part of it,” said the Tinker. “He don’t like to talk of his age unless
     you can get him i’ the humour; but he once told me he didn’t know why he lived so long, unless
     it were owin’ to a potion he’d swallowed, vich his master, who was a great conjurer in Queen
     Bess’s days, had brew’d.”
“Pshaw!” exclaimed Ginger. “I thought you too knowin’ a cove, Tinker, to be gulled by such an
     old vife’s story as that.”
“Let’s have the old fellow in and talk to him,” replied the Tinker. “Here, lazy-bones,” he
     added, rousing the sleeping youth, “go an’ tell Old Parr ve vants his company over a glass o’
     rum-an’-vater.”
