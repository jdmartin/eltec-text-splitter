CHAP. V. DR. GRANTLY VISITS THE HOSPITAL.
Though doubt and hesitation disturbed the rest of our
                                        poor warden, no such weakness perplexed the nobler breast of
                                        his son-in-law. As the indomitable cock preparing for the
                                        combat sharpens his spurs, shakes his feathers, and erects
                                        his comb, so did the archdeacon arrange his weapons for the
                                        coming war, without misgiving and without fear. That he was
                                        fully confident of the justice of his cause let no one
                                        doubt. Many a man can fight his battle with good courage,
                                        but with a doubting conscience; such was not the case with
                                        Dr. Grantly. He did not believe in the Gospel with more
                                        assurance than he did in the sacred justice of all
                                        ecclesiastical revenues. When he put his shoulder to the
                                        wheel to defend the income of the present and future
                                        precentors of Barchester, he was animated by as strong a
                                        sense of a holy cause, as that which gives courage to a
                                        missionary in Africa, or enables a sister of mercy to give
                                        up the pleasures of the world for the wards of 
                                        a hospital. He was about to defend the holy of holies from
                                        the touch of the profane; to guard the citadel of his church
                                        from the most rampant of its enemies; to put on his good
                                        armour in the best of fights; and secure, if possible, the
                                        comforts of his creed for coming generations of
                                        ecclesiastical dignitaries. Such a work required no ordinary
                                        vigour; and the archdeacon was, therefore, extraordinarily
                                        vigorous: it demanded a buoyant courage, and a heart happy
                                        in its toil; and the archdeacon's heart was happy, and his
                                        courage was buoyant.
He knew that he would not be able to animate his father-in-law
                                        with feelings like his own, but this did not much disturb
                                        him. He preferred to bear the brunt of the battle alone, and
                                        did not doubt that the warden would resign himself into his
                                        hands with passive submission.
"Well, Mr. Chadwick," he said, walking into the steward's office
                                        a day or two after the signing of the petition as
                                        commemorated in the last chapter; "anything from Cox and
                                        Cummins this morning?" Mr. Chadwick handed him a letter,
                                        which he read, stroking the tight-gaitered calf of his right
                                        leg as he did so. Messrs. Cox and Cummins merely said that
                                        they had as yet received no notice from their adversaries;
                                        that they could recommend no preliminary  steps;
                                        but that should any proceeding really be taken by the
                                        bedesmen, it would be expedient to consult that very eminent
                                        Queen's Counsel, Sir Abraham Haphazard.
"I quite agree with them," said Dr. Grantly, refolding the
                                        letter. "I perfectly agree with them. Haphazard is no doubt
                                        the best man; a thorough churchman, a sound conservative,
                                        and in every respect the best man we could getâ€”he's in the
                                        house, too, which is a great thing."
Mr. Chadwick quite agreed.
"You remember how completely he put down that scoundrel Horseman
                                        about the Bishop of Beverly's income; how completely he set
                                        them all adrift in the earl's case." Since the question of
                                        St. Cross had been mooted by the public, one noble lord had
                                        become " the earl ," par excellence , in
                                        the doctor's estimation. "How he silenced that fellow at
                                        Rochester. Of course we must have Haphazard; and I'll tell
                                        you what, Mr. Chadwick, we must take care to be in time, or
                                        the other party will forestall us."
With all his admiration for Sir Abraham, the doctor seemed to
                                        think it not impossible that that great man might be induced
                                        to lend his gigantic powers to the side of the church's
                                        enemies.

Having settled this point to his satisfaction, the doctor stepped
                                        down to the hospital, to learn how matters were going on
                                        there; and as he walked across the hallowed close, and
                                        looked up at the ravens who cawed with a peculiar reverence
                                        as he wended his way, he thought with increased acerbity of
                                        those whose impiety would venture to disturb the goodly
                                        grace of cathedral institutions.
And who has not felt the same? We believe that Mr. Horseman
                                        himself would relent, and the spirit of Sir Benjamin Hall
                                        give way, were those great reformers to allow themselves to
                                        stroll by moonlight round the towers of some of our ancient
                                        churches. Who would not feel charity for a prebendary, when
                                        walking the quiet length of that long aisle at Winchester,
                                        looking at those decent houses, that trim grassplat, and
                                        feeling, as one must, the solemn, orderly comfort of the
                                        spot? Who could be hard upon a dean while wandering round
                                        the sweet close of Hereford, and owning that in that
                                        precinct, tone and colour, design and form, solemn tower and
                                        storied window, are all in unison, and all perfect? Who
                                        could lie basking in the cloisters of Salisbury, and gaze on
                                        Jewel's library, and that unequalled spire, without feeling
                                        that bishops should sometimes be rich?

The tone of our archdeacon's mind must not astonish us; it has
                                        been the growth of centuries of church ascendancy; and
                                        though some fungi now disfigure the tree, though there be
                                        much dead wood, for how much good fruit have not we to be
                                        thankful? Who, without remorse, can batter down the dead
                                        branches of an old oak, now useless, but, ah! still so
                                        beautiful, or drag out the fragments of the ancient forest,
                                        without feeling that they sheltered the younger plants, to
                                        which they are now summoned to give way in a tone so
                                        peremptory and so harsh?
The archdeacon, with all his virtues, was not a man of delicate
                                        feeling; and after having made his morning salutations in
                                        the warden's drawing-room, he did not scruple to commence an
                                        attack on 'pestilent' John Bold in the presence of Miss
                                        Harding, though he rightly guessed that that lady was not
                                        indifferent to the name of his enemy.
"Nelly, my dear, fetch me my spectacles from the back room," said
                                        her father, anxious to save both her blushes and her
                                        feelings.
Eleanor brought the spectacles, while her father was trying, in
                                        ambiguous phrases, to explain to her too-practical
                                        brother-in-law that it might be as well not to say anything
                                        about Bold before her, and then retreated. Nothing had been
                                        explained to her about  Bold and the hospital;
                                        but, with a woman's instinct, she knew that things were
                                        going wrong.
"We must soon be doing something," commenced the archdeacon,
                                        wiping his brows with a large, bright-coloured handkerchief;
                                        for he had felt busy, and had walked quick, and it was a
                                        broiling summer's day. "Of course you have heard of the
                                        petition?"
Mr. Harding owned, somewhat unwillingly, that he had heard of
                                        it.
"Well,"â€”the archdeacon looked for some expression of opinion, but
                                        none coming, he continued,â€” "We must be doing something, you
                                        know; we must n't allow these people to cut the ground from
                                        under us while we sit looking on." The archdeacon, who was a
                                        practical man, allowed himself the use of every-day
                                        expressive modes of speech when among his closest intimates,
                                        though no one could soar into a more intricate labyrinth of
                                        refined phraseology when the church was the subject, and his
                                        lower brethren were his auditors.
The warden still looked mutely in his face, making the slightest
                                        possible passes with an imaginary fiddle bow, and stopping,
                                        as he did so, sundry imaginary strings with the fingers of
                                        his other hand. 'T was his constant consolation in
                                        conversational troubles. While these vexed him sorely, the
                                        passes  would be short and slow, and the upper
                                        hand would not be seen to work; nay the strings on which it
                                        operated would sometimes lie concealed in the musician's
                                        pocket, and the instrument on which he played would be
                                        beneath his chair; but as his spirit warmed to the
                                        subject,â€”as his trusting heart, looking to the bottom of
                                        that which vexed him, would see its clear way out,â€”he would
                                        rise to a higher melody, sweep the unseen strings with a
                                        bolder hand, and swiftly fingering the cords from his neck,
                                        down along his waistcoat, and up again to his very ear,
                                        create an ecstatic strain of perfect music, audible to
                                        himself and to St. Cecilia, and not without effect.
"I quite agree with Cox and Cummings," continued the archdeacon:
                                        "they say we must secure Sir Abraham Haphazard. I shall not
                                        have the slightest fear in leaving the case in Sir Abraham's
                                        hands."
The warden played the slowest and saddest of tunes: it was but a
                                        dirge on one string.
"I think Sir Abraham will not be long in letting Master Bold know
                                        what he's about. I fancy I hear Sir Abraham
                                        cross-questioning him at the Common Pleas."
The warden thought of his income being thus 
                                        discussed, his modest life, his daily habits, and his easy
                                        work; and nothing issued from that single cord, but a low
                                        wail of sorrow. "I suppose they've sent this petition up to
                                        my father." The warden did n't know; he imagined they would
                                        do so this very day.
"What I can't understand is, how you let them do it, with such a
                                        command as you have in the place, or should have with such a
                                        man as Bunce; I cannot understand why you let them do
                                        it."
"Do what?" asked the warden.
"Why, listen to this fellow Bold, and that other low pettifogger,
                                        Finneyâ€”and get up this petition too: why did n't you tell
                                        Bunce to destroy the petition?"
"That would have been hardly wise," said the warden.
"Wiseâ€”yes, it would have been very wise if they'd done it among
                                        themselves. I must go up to the palace and answer it now, I
                                        suppose; it's a very short answer they'll get, I can tell
                                        you."
"But why should n't they petition, doctor?"
"Why should n't they!" responded the archdeacon, in a loud brazen
                                        voice, as though all the men in the hospital were expected
                                        to hear him through the walls; "why should n't they. I'll
                                        let them know why they  should n't: by-the-by,
                                        warden, I'd like to say a few words to them all
                                        together."
The warden's mind misgave him, and even for a moment he forgot to
                                        play. He by no means wished to delegate to his son-in-law
                                        his place and authority of warden; he had expressly
                                        determined not to interfere in any step which the men might
                                        wish to take in the matter under dispute; he was most
                                        anxious neither to accuse them nor to defend himself. All
                                        these things he was aware the archdeacon would do in his
                                        behalf, and that not in the mildest manner; and yet he knew
                                        not how to refuse the permission requested.
"I'd so much sooner remain quiet in the matter," said he, in an
                                        apologetic voice.
"Quiet!" said the archdeacon, still speaking with his brazen
                                        trumpet; "do you wish to be ruined in quiet?"
"Why, if I am to be ruined, certainly."
"Nonsense, warden; I tell you something must be doneâ€”we must act;
                                        just let me ring the bell, and send the men word that I'll
                                        speak to them in the quad."
Mr. Harding knew not how to resist, and the disagreeable order
                                        was given. The quad, as it was familiarly called, was a
                                        small quadrangle, open on  one side to the
                                        river, and surrounded on the others by the high wall of Mr.
                                        Harding's garden, by one gable end of Mr. Harding's house,
                                        and by the end of the row of buildings which formed the
                                        residences of the bedesmen. It was flagged all round, and
                                        the centre was stoned; small stone gutters ran from the four
                                        corners of the square to a grating in the centre; and
                                        attached to the end of Mr. Harding's house was a conduit
                                        with four cocks covered over from the weather, at which the
                                        old men got their water, and very generally performed their
                                        morning toilet. It was a quiet, sombre place, shaded over by
                                        the trees of the warden's garden. On the side towards the
                                        river, there stood a row of stone seats, on which the old
                                        men would sit and gaze at the little fish, as they flitted
                                        by in the running stream. On the other side of the river was
                                        a rich, green meadow, running up to and joining the deanery,
                                        and as little open to the public, as the garden of the dean
                                        itself. Nothing, therefore, could be more private than the
                                        quad of the hospital; and it was there that the archdeacon
                                        determined to convey to them his sense of their refractory
                                        proceedings.
The servant soon brought in word that the men were assembled in
                                        the quad, and the archdeacon, big with his purpose, rose to
                                        address them.

"Well, warden, of course you're coming," said he, seeing that Mr.
                                        Harding did not prepare to follow him.
"I wish you'd excuse me," said Mr. Harding.
"For heaven's sake, don't let us have division in the camp,"
                                        replied the archdeacon: "let us have a long pull and a
                                        strong pull, but above all a pull altogether; come, warden,
                                        come; don't be afraid of your duty."
Mr. Harding was afraid; he was afraid that he was being led to do
                                        that which was not his duty: he was not, however, strong
                                        enough to resist, so he got up and followed his
                                        son-in-law.
The old men were assembled in groups in the quadrangleâ€”eleven of
                                        them at least, for poor old Johnny Bell was bed-ridden, and
                                        could n't come; he had, however, put his mark to the
                                        petition, as one of Handy's earliest followers. 'T is true
                                        he could not move from the bed where he lay; 't is true he
                                        had no friend on earth, but those whom the hospital
                                        contained; and of those the warden and his daughter were the
                                        most constant and most appreciated; 't is true that every
                                        thing was administered to him which his failing body could
                                        require, or which his faint appetite could enjoy; but still
                                        his dull eye had glistened for a moment at the idea of
                                        possessing a  hundred pounds a year 'to his own
                                        cheek,' as Abel Handy had eloquently expressed it; and poor
                                        old Johnny Bell had greedily put his mark to the
                                        petition.
When the two clergymen appeared, they all uncovered their heads.
                                        Handy was slow to do it, and hesitated; but the black coat
                                        and waistcoat, of which he had spoken so irreverently in
                                        Skulpit's room, had its effect even on him, and he too
                                        doffed his hat. Bunce, advancing before the others, bowed
                                        lowly to the archdeacon, and with affectionate reverence
                                        expressed his wish, that the warden and Miss Eleanor were
                                        quite well; "and the doctor's lady," he added, turning to
                                        the archdeacon, "and the children at Plumstead, and my
                                        lord;" and having made his speech, he also retired among the
                                        others, and took his place with the rest upon the stone
                                        benches.
As the archdeacon stood up to make his speech, erect in the
                                        middle of that little square, he looked like an
                                        ecclesiastical statue placed there, as a fitting
                                        impersonation of the church militant here on earth; his
                                        shovel hat, large, new, and well-pronounced, a churchman's
                                        hat in every inch, declared the profession as plainly as
                                        does the Quaker's broad brim; his heavy eyebrow, large open
                                        eyes, and full mouth and chin expressed the solidity of his
                                        order; the broad chest, amply covered with fine cloth, told
                                        how  well to do was its estate; one hand
                                        ensconced within his pocket, evinced the practical hold
                                        which our mother church keeps on her temporal possessions;
                                        and the other, loose for action, was ready to fight if need
                                        be in her defence; and below these the decorous breeches,
                                        and neat black gaiters showing so admirably that well-turned
                                        leg, betokened the decency, the outward beauty, and grace of
                                        our church establishment.
"Now my men," he began, when he had settled himself well in his
                                        position; "I want to say a few words to you. Your good
                                        friend, the warden here, and myself, and my lord the bishop,
                                        on whose behalf I wish to speak to you, would all be very
                                        sorry, very sorry indeed, that you should have any just
                                        ground of complaint. Any just ground of complaint on your
                                        part would be removed at once by the warden, or by his
                                        lordship, or by me on his behalf, without the necessity of
                                        any petition on your part." Here the orator stopped for a
                                        moment, expecting that some little murmurs of applause would
                                        show that the weakest of the men were beginning to give way;
                                        but no such murmurs came. Bunce, himself, even sat with
                                        closed lips, mute and unsatisfactory. "Without the necessity
                                        of any petition at all," he repeated. "I'm told you have
                                        addressed a petition to my lord." He paused for a reply from
                                        the men, and after a  while, Handy plucked up
                                        courage, and said, "Yes, we has."
"You have addressed a petition to my lord, in which, as I am
                                        informed, you express an opinion that you do not receive
                                        from Hiram's estate all that is your due." Here most of the
                                        men expressed their assent. "Now what is it you ask for?
                                        what is it you want that you hav'n't got here? what is
                                        itâ€”"
"A hundred a year," muttered old Moody, with a voice as if it
                                        came out of the ground.
"A hundred a year!" ejaculated the archdeacon militant, defying
                                        the impudence of these claimants with one hand stretched out
                                        and closed, while with the other he tightly grasped, and
                                        secured within his breeches pocket, that symbol of the
                                        church's wealth which his own loose half-crowns not unaptly
                                        represented. "A hundred a year! Why, my men, you must be
                                        mad; and you talk about John Hiram's will! When John Hiram
                                        built a hospital for worn-out old men, worn-out old
                                        labouring men, infirm old men past their work, cripples,
                                        blind, bed-ridden, and such like, do you think he meant to
                                        make gentlemen of them? Do you think John Hiram intended to
                                        give a hundred a year to old single men, who earned perhaps
                                        two shillings or half-a-crown a day for themselves and
                                        families in the best of their time?  No, my men,
                                        I'll tell you what John Hiram meant; he meant that twelve
                                        poor old worn-out labourers, men who could no longer support
                                        themselves, who had no friends to support them, who must
                                        starve and perish miserably if not protected by the hand of
                                        charity; he meant that twelve such men as these should come
                                        in here in their poverty and wretchedness, and find within
                                        these walls shelter and food before their death, and a
                                        little leisure to make their peace with God. That was what
                                        John Hiram meant: you have not read John Hiram's will, and I
                                        doubt whether those wicked men who are advising you have
                                        done so. I have; I know what his will was; and I tell you
                                        that that was his will, and that that was his
                                        intention."
Not a sound came from the eleven bedesmen, as they sat listening
                                        to what, according to the archdeacon, was their intended
                                        estate. They grimly stared upon his burly figure, but did
                                        not then express, by word or sign, the anger and disgust to
                                        which such language was sure to give rise.
"Now let me ask you," he continued, "do you think you are worse
                                        off than John Hiram intended to make you? Have you not
                                        shelter, and food, and leisure? Have you not much more? Have
                                        you not every indulgence which you are capable of enjoying?
                                                 Have you not twice better food, twice a
                                        better bed, ten times more money in your pocket than you
                                        were ever able to earn for yourselves before you were lucky
                                        enough to get into this place? And now you send a petition
                                        to the bishop, asking for a hundred pounds a year! I tell
                                        you what, my friends; you are deluded, and made fools of by
                                        wicked men who are acting for their own ends. You will never
                                        get a hundred pence a year more than what you have now: it
                                        is very possible that you may get less; it is very possible
                                        that my lord the bishop, and your warden may make
                                        changesâ€”"
"No, no, no," interrupted Mr. Harding, who had been listening
                                        with indescribable misery to the tirade of his son-in-law;
                                        "no, my friends. I want no changes,â€”at least no changes that
                                        shall make you worse off than you now are, as long as you
                                        and I live together."
"God bless you, Mr. Harding," said Bunce; and "God bless you, Mr.
                                        Harding, God bless you sir, we know you was always our
                                        friend," was exclaimed by enough of the men to make it
                                        appear that the sentiment was general.
The archdeacon had been interrupted in his speech before he had
                                        quite finished it; but he felt that he could not recommence
                                        with dignity after this little  ebullition, and
                                        he led the way back into the garden, followed by his
                                        father-in-law.
"Well," said he, as soon as he found himself within the cool
                                        retreat of the warden's garden; "I think I spoke to them
                                        plainly." And he wiped the perspiration from his brow; for
                                        making a speech under a broiling mid-day sun in summer, in a
                                        full suit of thick black cloth, is warm work.
"Yes, you were plain enough," replied the warden, in a tone which
                                        did not express approbation.
"And that's everything," said the other, who was clearly well
                                        satisfied with himself; "that's everything: with those sort
                                        of people one must be plain, or one will not be understood.
                                        Now, I think they did understand meâ€”I think they knew what I
                                        meant."
The warden agreed. He certainly thought they had understood to
                                        the full what had been said to them.
"They know pretty well what they have to expect from us; they
                                        know how we shall meet any refractory spirit on their part;
                                        they know that we are not afraid of them. And now I'll just
                                        step into Chadwick's, and tell him what I've done; and then
                                        I'll go up to the palace, and answer this petition of
                                        theirs."
The warden's mind was very fullâ€”full nearly to 
                                        overcharging itself; and had it done soâ€”had he allowed
                                        himself to speak the thoughts which were working within him,
                                        he would indeed have astonished the archdeacon by the
                                        reprobation he would have expressed as to the proceeding of
                                        which he had been so unwilling a witness. But different
                                        feelings kept him silent; he was as yet afraid of differing
                                        from his son-in-lawâ€”he was anxious beyond measure to avoid
                                        even a semblance of rupture with any of his order, and was
                                        painfully fearful of having to come to an open quarrel with
                                        any person on any subject. His life had hitherto been so
                                        quiet, so free from strife; his little early troubles had
                                        required nothing but passive fortitude; his subsequent
                                        prosperity had never forced upon him any active caresâ€”had
                                        never brought him into disagreeable contact with any one. He
                                        felt that he would give almost anythingâ€”much more than he
                                        knew he ought to doâ€”to relieve himself from the storm which
                                        he feared was coming. It was so hard that the pleasant
                                        waters of his little stream should be disturbed and muddied
                                        by rough hands; that his quiet paths should be made a
                                        battle-field; that the unobtrusive corner of the world which
                                        had been allotted to him, as though by Providence, should be
                                        invaded and desecrated, and all within it made miserable and
                                        unsound.

Money he had none to give; the knack of putting guineas together
                                        had never belonged to him; but how willingly, with what a
                                        foolish easiness, with what happy alacrity, would he have
                                        abandoned the half of his income for all time to come, could
                                        he by so doing have quietly dispelled the clouds that were
                                        gathering over himâ€”could he have thus compromised the matter
                                        between the reformer and the conservative, between his
                                        possible son-in-law, Bold, and his positive son-in-law, the
                                        archdeacon.
And this compromise would not have been made from any prudential
                                        motive of saving what would yet remain, for Mr. Harding
                                        still felt little doubt but he should be left for life in
                                        quiet possession of the good things he had, if he chose to
                                        retain them. No; he would have done so from the sheer love
                                        of quiet, and from a horror of being made the subject of
                                        public talk. He had very often been moved to pityâ€”to that
                                        inward weeping of the heart for others' woes; but none had
                                        he ever pitied more than that old lord, whose almost
                                        fabulous wealth, drawn from his church preferments, had
                                        become the subject of so much opprobrium, of such public
                                        scorn; that wretched clerical octogenarian Croesus, whom men
                                        would not allow to die in peaceâ€”whom all the world united to
                                        decry and to abhor.

Was he to suffer such a fate? Was his humble name to be bandied
                                        in men's mouths, as the gormandizer of the resources of the
                                        poor, as of one who had filched from the charity of other
                                        ages wealth which had been intended to relieve the old and
                                        the infirm? Was he to be gibbeted in the press, to become a
                                        byword for oppression, to be named as an example of the
                                        greed of the English church? Should it ever be said that he
                                        had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly
                                        loved in his heart of hearts? As he slowly paced, hour after
                                        hour, under those noble lime-trees, turning these sad
                                        thoughts within him, he became all but fixed in his resolve
                                        that some great step must be taken to relieve him from the
                                        risk of so terrible a fate.
In the meanwhile, the archdeacon, with contented mind and
                                        unruffled spirit, went about his business. He said a word or
                                        two to Mr. Chadwick, and then finding, as he expected, the
                                        petition lying in his father's library, he wrote a short
                                        answer to the men, in which he told them that they had no
                                        evils to redress, but rather great mercies for which to be
                                        thankful; and having seen the bishop sign it, he got into
                                        his brougham and returned home to Mrs. Grantly, and
                                        Plumstead Episcopi.
