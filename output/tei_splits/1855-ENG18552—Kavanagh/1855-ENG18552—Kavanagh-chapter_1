CHAPTER I.
In one of the many little suburbs which cling to the outskirts of London, there is a silent
     and grass-grown street, of aspect both quiet and quaint. The houses are crazy, old, and brown,
     of every height and every size; many are untenanted. Some years ago one was internally
     destroyed by fire. It was not thought worth rebuilding. There it still stands, gaunt and grim,
     looking for all the world, with its broken or dust-stained windows, like a town deserted after
     a sacking.
This street is surrounded by populous courts and alleys, by stirring thoroughfares, by roads
     full of activity and commerce; yet somehow or other, all the noise of life, all its tumult and
     agitation, here seem to die away to silence and repose. Few people, even amongst the poor, and
     the neighbourhood is a poor one, care to reside in it, while they can be lodged as cheaply
     close by, and more to their taste. Some think that the old square at the end, with its ancient,
     nodding trees, is close and gloomy; others have heard strange noises in the house that has
     suffered from fire, and are sure it is haunted; and some again do not like the silent, deserted
     look of the place, and cannot get over the fancy that, if no one will live in it, it must be
     because it is unlucky. And thus it daily decays more and more, and daily seems to grow more
     silent.
The appearance of the few houses that are inhabited, says little in favour of this
     unfortunate street. In one, a tailor has taken up his abode. He is a pale, serious man, who
     stitches at his board in the window the whole day long, cheered by the occasional song of a
     thrush, hopping in its osier cage. This tailor, Samuel Hopkins yclept, lives by repairing
     damaged vestments. He once made a coat, and boasts—with how much truth is known to his own
     heart—that he likewise cut out, fashioned, and fitted, a pair of blue nether garments. Further
     on, at the corner of the square, stands the house of Mrs. Adams, an aged widow, who keeps a
     small school, which, on her brass board, she emphatically denominates her "Establishment for
     Young Ladies." This house has an unmistakeable air of literary dirt and neglect; the area and
     kitchen windows are encumbered with the accumulated mud and dust of years; from the attic
     casement, a little red-haired servant-girl is ever gaping; and on hot summer afternoons, when
     the parlour windows are left open, there is a glimpse within of a dingy school-mistress, and
     still more dingy school-room, with a few pupils who sit straggling on half-a-dozen benches,
     conning their lessons with a murmuring hum.
With one exception, there is no other sign of commerce, trade, or profession in the whole
     street. For all an outward glance can reveal to the contrary, the people who live there are so
     very rich that they do not need to work at all, or so very genteel in their decay, that if they
     do work, they must do it in a hidden, skulking, invisible sort of fashion, or else be
     irretrievably disgraced.
The solitary exception to which we have alluded, exists, or rather existed, for though we
     speak in the present, we write in the past by some years, in one of the smallest houses in the
     street. A little six-roomed house it was, exactly facing the dreary haunted mansion, and
     exposed to all the noises aforesaid. It was, also, to say the truth, an abode of poor and mean
     aspect. In the window hung a dress-maker's board, on which was modestly inscribed, with a list
     of prices, the name of— "RACHEL GRAY."
It was accompanied with patterns of yellow paper sleeves, trimmed in every colour, an old
     book of fashions, and beautiful and bright, as if reared in wood or meadow, a pot of yellow
     crocuses in bloom. They were closing now, for evening was drawing in, and they knew the
     hour.
They had opened to light in the dingy parlour within, and which we will now enter. It was but
     a little room, and the soft gloom of a spring twilight half-filled it. The furniture though
     poor and old-fashioned, was scrupulously clean; and it shone again in the flickering
     fire-light. A few discoloured prints in black frames hung against the walls; two or three
     broken china ornaments adorned the wooden mantel-shelf, which was, moreover, decorated with a
     little dark-looking mirror in a rim of tarnished gold.
By the fire an elderly woman of grave and stern aspect, but who had once been handsome, sat
     reading the newspaper. Near the window, two apprentices sewed, under the superintendence of
     Rachel Gray.
A mild ray of light fell on her pale face, and bending figure. She sewed on, serious and
     still, and the calm gravity of her aspect harmonized with the silence of the little parlour
     which nothing disturbed, save the ticking of an old clock behind the door, the occasional
     rustling of Mrs. Gray's newspaper, and the continuous and monotonous sound of stitching.
Rachel Gray looked upwards of thirty, yet she was younger by some years. She was a tall,
     thin, and awkward woman, sallow and faded before her time. She was not, and had never been
     handsome, yet there was a patient seriousness in the lines of her face, which, when it caught
     the eye, arrested it at once, and kept it long. Her brow, too, was broad and intellectual; her
     eyes were very fine, though their look was dreamy and abstracted; and her smile, when she did
     smile, which was not often, for she was slightly deaf and spoke little, was pleasant and very
     sweet.
She sewed on, as we have said, abstracted and serious, when gradually, for even in
     observation she was slow, the yellow crocuses attracted her attention. She looked at them
     meditatively, and watched them closing, with the decline of day. And, at length, as if she had
     not understood, until then, what was going on before her, she smiled and admiringly
     exclaimed:
"Now do look at the creatures, mother!"
Mrs. Gray glanced up from her newspaper, and snuffed rather disdainfully.
"Lawk, Rachel!" she said, "you don't mean to call crocuses creatures—do you? I'll tell you
     what though," she added, with a doleful shake of the head, "I don't know what Her Majesty
     thinks; but I say the country can't stand it much longer."
Mrs. Gray had been cook in a Prime Minister's household, and this had naturally given her a
     political turn.
"The Lord has taught you," murmured Rachel, bending over the flowers with something like awe,
     and a glow spread over her sallow cheek, and there came a light to her large brown eyes.
Of the two apprentices—one a sickly, fretful girl of sixteen, heard her not; she went on
     sewing, and the very way in which she drew her needle and thread was peevish. The other
     apprentice did hear Rachel, and she looked, or rather stared at the dress-maker, with grim
     wonder. Indeed, there was something particularly grim about this young maiden—a drear stolidity
     that defies describing. A pure Saxon she was—no infusion of Celtic, or Danish, or Norman blood
     had lightened the native weight of her nature. She was young, yet she already went through life
     settling everything, and living in a moral tower of most uninviting aspect. But though Jane
     settled everything, she did not profess to understand everything; and when, as happened every
     now and then, Rachel Gray came out with such remarks as that above recorded, Jane felt
     confounded. "She couldn't make out Miss Gray—that she couldn't."
"I'm so tired!" peevishly said Mary, the fretful apprentice.
At once Rachel kindly observed: "Put by your work, dear."
Again Mrs. Gray snuffed, and came out with: "Lawk! she's always grummy!"
Mary tossed away her work, folded her arms, and looked sullen. Jane, the grim apprentice,
     drew her needle and thread twice as fast as before. "Thank Heaven!" she piously thought, "I am
     not lazy, nor sickly, and I can't see much difference between the two—that I can't."
Rachel's work lay in her lap; she sat looking at the crocuses until she fell in a dream far
     in the past.
For the past is our realm, free to all, high or low, who wish to dwell in it. There we may
     set aside the bitterness and the sorrow; there we may choose none but the pleasing visions, the
     bright, sunny spots where it is sweet to linger. The Future, fair as Hope may make it, is a
     dream, we claim it in vain. The Present, harsh or delightful, must be endured, yet it flies
     from us before we can say "it is gone." But the Past is ours to call up at our will. It is
     vivid and distinct as truth. In good and in evil, it is irrevocable; the divine seal has been
     set upon it for evermore.
In that Book—a pure and holy one was hers—though not without a few dark and sad pages—Rachel
     Gray often read. And now, the sight of the yellow flower of spring took her back, to a happy
     day of her childhood. She saw herself a little girl again, with her younger sister Jane, and
     the whole school to which they belonged, out on a holiday treat in a green forest. Near that
     forest there was a breezy field; and there it was that Rachel first saw the yellow crocuses
     bloom. She remembered her joy, her delight at the wonderful beauty of the wild field
     flowers—how she and Jane heaped their laps with them, and sat down at the task; and how, when
     tired with the pleasant labour, they rested, as many yellow crocuses as before seemed to blow
     and play in the breeze around them. And she remembered, too, how, even then, there passed
     across her childish mind, a silent wonder at their multitude, an undefined awe for the power of
     the Almighty Hand who made the little flower, and bade it bloom in the green fields, beneath
     the misty azure of a soft spring sky.
And then swiftly followed other thoughts. Where was little, blue-eyed Jane, her younger
     sister, her little companion and friend? Sleeping in a London grave, far from the pleasant and
     sunny spots where God's wild flowers bloom. And she—why she was pursuing her path in life,
     doing the will of God Almighty.
"And what more," thought Rachel, "can I hope or wish for?"
"Now, Rachel, what are you moping about?" tartly asked her mother, who, though half blind,
     had a quick eye for her daughter's meditative fits.
Abruptly fled the dream. The childish memories, the holy remembrance of the dead, sank back
     once more to their quiet resting-place in Rachel's heart. Wakening up with a half-lightened
     start, she hastily resumed her work.
"I don't think there ever was such a moper as that girl," grumbled Mrs. Gray to herself.
Rachel smiled cheerfully in her mother's face. But as to telling her that she had been
     thinking of the yellow crocuses, and of the spots they grew in, and of the power and greatness
     and glory of Him who made them, Rachel did not dream of it.
"There's Mrs. Brown," said Mrs. Gray, as a dark figure passed by the window. "Go, and open
     the door, Mary."
Mary did not stir, upon which Jane officiously rose and said, "I'll go." She went, and in
     came, or rather bounced, Mrs. Brown—a short, stout, vulgar-looking woman of fifty or so, who at
     once filled the room with noise.
"La, Mrs. Gray!" she began breathlessly, "What do you think? There's a new one. I have
     brought you the paper; third column, second page, first article, 'The Church in a Mess.' I
     thought you'd like to see it. Well, Rachel, and how are you getting on? Mrs. James's dress
     don't fit her a bit, and she says she'll not give you another stitch of work: but la! you don't
     care—do you? Why, Mary, how yellow you look to day. I declare you're as yellow as the crocuses
     in the pot. Ain't she now, Jane? And so you're not married yet—are you, my girl?" she added,
     giving the grim apprentice a slap on the back.
Jane eyed her quietly.
"You'd better not do that again, Mrs. Brown," she said, with some sternness, "and as to
     getting married: why, s'pose you mind your own business!"
Mrs. Brown threw herself back in her chair, and laughed until the tears ran down her face.
     When she recovered, it was to address Mrs. Gray.
"La, Mrs. Gray! can't you find it?" she said. "Why, I told you, third column, second page,
     'The Church in a Mess.' You can't miss. I have put a pin in it."
Spite of this kind attention, Mrs. Gray had not found "The Church in a Mess."
"Lawk, Mrs. Brown!" she said, impatiently, "where's the use of always raking up them sort of
     things! The badness of others don't make us good— does it? It's the taxes I think of, Mrs.
     Brown; it's the taxes! Now, Rachel, where are you going?"
"I am going to take home this work, mother."
Unable to find fault with this, Mrs. Gray muttered to herself. She was not ill-natured, but
     fault-finding was with her an inveterate habit.
"La! what a muff that girl of yours is, Mrs. Gray!" charitably observed Mrs. Brown, as Rachel
     left the room. For Mrs. Brown being Mrs. Gray's cousin, landlady, and neighbour, took the right
     to say everything she pleased.
"She ain't particlerly bright," confessed Mrs. Gray, poking the fire, "but you see, Mrs.
     Brown—"
Rachel closed the door, and heard no more. Whilst Mrs. Brown was talking, she had been tying
     up her parcel. She now put on her bonnet and cloak, and went out.
It is sweet, after the toil of a day, to breathe fresh air, London air even though it should
     be. It is sweet, after the long closeness of the work-room, to walk out and feel the sense of
     life and liberty. A new being seemed poured into Rachel as she went on.
"I wonder people do not like this street," she thought, pausing at the corner to look back on
     the grey, quiet line she was leaving behind. "They call it dull, and to me it is so calm and
     sweet." And she sighed to enter the noisy and populous world before her. She hastily crossed
     it, and only slackened her pace when she reached the wide streets, the mansions with gardens to
     them, the broad and silent squares of the west end. She stopped before a handsome house, the
     abode of a rich lady who occasionally employed her, because she worked cheaper than a
     fashionable dress-maker, and as well.
Mrs. Moxton was engaged—visitors were with her—Rachel had to wait— she sat in the hall. A
     stylish footman, who quickly detected that she was shy and nervous, entertained himself and his
     companions, by making her ten times more so. His speech was rude—his jests were insolent.
     Rachel was meek and humble; but she could feel insult; and that pride, from which few of God's
     creatures are free, rose within her, and flushed her pale cheek with involuntary
     displeasure.
At length, the infliction ceased. Mrs. Moxton's visitors left; Rachel was called in. Her
     first impulse had been to complain of the footman to his mistress; but mercy checked the
     temptation; it might make him lose his place. Poor Rachel! she little knew that this footman
     could have been insolent to his mistress herself, had he so chosen. He was six foot three, and,
     in his livery of brown and gold, looked splendid. In short, he was invaluable, and not to be
     parted with on any account.
Mrs. Moxton was habitually a well-bred, good-natured woman; but every rule has its
     exceptions. Rachel found her very much out of temper. To say the truth, one of her recent
     visitors was in the Mrs. Brown style; Mrs. Moxton had been provoked and irritated; and Rachel
     paid for it.
"Now, Miss Gray," she said, with solemn indignation, "what do you mean by bringing back work
     in this style? That flounce is at least an inch too high! I thought you an intelligent young
     person—but really, really!"
"It's very easily altered, ma'am," said Rachel, submissively.
"You need, not trouble," gravely replied Mrs. Moxton. "I owe you something; you may call with
     your bill to-morrow."
"I shall not be able to call to-morrow, ma'am; and if it were convenient now—"
"It is not convenient now!" said Mrs. Morton, rather haughtily. She thought Rachel the most
     impertinent creature she had ever met with—that is to say, next to that irritating Mrs.
     Maberly, who had repeated that provoking thing about Mr. So-and-So. Rachel sighed and left the
     house like all shy persons, she was easily depressed. It was night when she stood once more in
     the street. Above the pale outline of the houses spread a sky of dark azure. A star shone in
     it, a little star; but it burned with as brilliant a light as any great planet. Rachel gazed at
     it earnestly, and the shadow passed away. "What matter!" she thought, "even though a man in
     livery made a jest of me—even though a lady in silk was scornful. What matter! God made that
     star for me as well as for her! Besides," she added, checking a thought which might, she
     feared, be too proud, "besides, who, and what am I, that I should repine?"
