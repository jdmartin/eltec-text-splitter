CHAPTER XIII.
Mary was gone; Jane, had come in but to go up to her room. Rachel sat alone in the little
     parlour, reading by candle-light.
And did she read, indeed! Alas no! Her will fixed her eyes on the page, but her mind received
     not the impressions it conveyed. The sentences were vague and broken as images in a dream; the
     words had no meaning. Outwardly, calm as ever did Rachel seem, but there was a strange sorrow—
     a strange tumult in her heart.
That day the hope of years had been wrecked, that day she had offered herself, and been
     finally rejected. In vain she said to herself: "I must submit—it is the will of God, I must
     submit." A voice within her ever seemed to say: "Father, Father why hast thou forsaken me!"
     until, at length, Rachel felt as if she could bear no more.
Sorrows endured in silence are ever doubly felt. The nature of Rachel Gray was silent; she
     had never asked for sympathy; she had early been taught to expect and accept in its stead, its
     bitter step-sister Ridicule. Derided, laughed at, she had learned to dread that the look of a
     human being should catch a glimpse of her sorrows. If her little troubles were thus treated—how
     would her heavier griefs fare?
And now no more than ever did Rachel trouble any with her burden. Why should she? Who, what
     was she that others should care whether or not her father loved her! That he did not
     sufficiently, condemned her to solitude. The pitying eye of God might, indeed, look down upon
     her with tenderness and love, but from her brethren Rachel expected nothing.
And thus it was that, on this night, after consoling the idle sorrows of an indulged child,
     Rachel, sitting in solitude, found the weight of her own grief almost intolerable. Like all shy
     and nervous persons, she was deeply excitable. Anger she knew not; but emotions as vehement,
     though more pure, could trouble her heart. And now she was moved, and deeply moved, by a sense
     of injustice and of wrong. Her father wronged her— perhaps he knew it not; but he wronged her.
     "God Almighty had not given him a child, she felt, to treat it thus, with mingled dislike and
     contempt Were there none to receive his slights and his scorn, but his own daughter?"
She rose, and walked up and down the room with some agitation. Then came calmer and gentler
     thoughts, moving her heart until her tears flowed freely. Had she not failed that day—had she
     not been too cold in her entreaties, too easily daunted by the first rejection? Had she but
     allowed her father to see the love, deep and fervent, which burned in his daughter's heart—he
     would not, he could not so coldly have repelled and cast her from him.
"And why not try again?" murmured an inner voice; "the kingdom of Heaven is taken by
     storm—and what is the kingdom of Heaven, but the realm of love?"
At first, this seemed a thought so wild, that Rachel drew back from it in alarm, as from an
     abyss yawning at her feet. But even as our looks soon become familiar with images of the
     wildest danger, so the thought returned; and she shrank not back from it. Besides, what had she
     to lose? Nothing! With a sort of despair, she resolved to go and seek Thomas Gray, and attempt
     once more to move him. "If he rejects me now," she added, inwardly, "I shall submit, and
     trouble him no more."
The hour was not late; besides, in her present mood, the timid Rachel felt above fear. She
     was soon dressed—soon on her road. This time neither annoyance nor evil befell her. She passed
     like a shadow through crowds, and like a shadow was unheeded. The night was dark and dreary; a
     keen wind whistled along the streets—but for either cold or darkness Rachel cared not. Her
     thoughts flowed full and free in her brain; for once, she felt that she could speak; and a
     joyful presentiment in her heart told her that she would, and should be heard—and not in
     vain.
Absorbed in those thoughts, Rachel scarcely knew what speed she had made, until, with the
     mechanical impulse of habit, she found herself stopping before the second hand ironmonger's
     shop. Wakening as from a dream, and smiling at herself, she went on. Rachel had expected to
     find the shop of Thomas Gray closed, and himself absent; but the light that burned from his
     dwelling, and shed its glow on the opposite houses, made her heart beat with joy and hope.
     Timidly, she looked in through the glass panes; the shop was vacant; her father was, no doubt,
     in the back parlour. Rachel entered; the door-bell rang. She paused on the threshold, expecting
     to see him appear from within, nerving herself to bear his cold look, and severe aspect; but he
     came not He was either up-stairs, or in some other part of the house, or next door with a
     neighbour.
There was a chair in the shop; Rachel took it, sat down, and waited—how long, she herself
     never knew; for seconds seemed hours, and all true consciousness of time had left her. At
     length, she wondered; then she feared—why was her father's house so silent and so deserted? She
     went to the door, and looked down the street. It was still and lonely; every house was shot up;
     and even from the neighbouring thoroughfare, all sounds of motion and life seemed gone.
Suddenly Rachel remembered the little public-house to which her father had once sent her. She
     had often seen him going to it in the evening; perhaps he was there now. In the shadow of the
     houses, she glided up to the tavern door—it stood half open—she cautiously looked in; and
     standing, as she did in the gloom of the street, she could do so unseen. The landlord sat
     dozing in the bar—not a soul was with him. Rachel glanced at the clock above his head; it
     marked a quarter to twelve. Dismayed and alarmed, she returned to her father's house. It so
     chanced, that as she walked on the opposite side of the narrow street, a circumstance that had
     before escaped her notice, now struck her. In the room above the shop of Thomas Gray, there
     burned a light. She stopped short, and looked at it with a beating heart. She felt sure her
     father was there.
Rachel re-entered the shop, and again sat down, resolved to be patient; but her nervous
     restlessness soon became intolerable. Seized with an indefinite fear, she rose, took the light,
     and entered the parlour: it was vacant. Passing under a low door which she found ajar, she went
     up a dark staircase. It ended with a narrow landing, and a solitary door; she knocked, and got
     no reply; she tried it, it yielded to her hand, and opened; but Rachel did not cross the
     threshold; she paused upon it, awe-struck at the sight she saw. The room was a small one,
     poorly famished, with a low and narrow bed, a table and a few chairs. On the mantle-shelf
     burned a tallow light, dim and lurid for want of snuffing; its dull glow fell on the motionless
     figure of Thomas Gray. He sat straight and stiff in a wooden chair, with a hand resting on each
     arm. His face was ghastly pale, and rigid as death; his eyes stared on the blank wall before
     him, and seemed void of sight.
"My father is dead," thought Rachel. She entered the room and went up to him. But when she
     laid her hand on his arm, a slight convulsive motion showed her that he still lived. Ay, he
     lived, of that living death, which is worse than the true. Paralysis had fallen upon him
     without warning. Like a thief in the night it had come; and in a few brief seconds it had laid
     low the proud man's strength. Of that strength he had boasted in the morning; twelve hours had
     not gone round—where was it now?
Rachel did not lose her presence of mind. How she went out, found a doctor, and brought him
     back, she never exactly knew; but she did it.
The medical man looked at Thomas Gray, then at Rachel.
"You are his daughter," he said, kindly.
"Yes, sir, I am."
"Well, then, my poor girl, I am very sorry for you—very sorry. Your father may live years but
     I can hold out no prospect of recovery."
"None, sir?" faltered Rachel, looking wistfully in his face.
"Not the least. Better I should tell you so at once, than deceive you."
But Rachel would not—could not believe him. The sentence was too hard, too pitiless to be
     true.
"Father, father! do you know me?" she cried.
He stared vacantly in her face. Did he know her? Perhaps he did. Who can tell how far the
     spirit lived in that dead body? But if know her he did, gone was the time when he could hold
     intercourse with that long slighted, and now bitterly avenged daughter.
In vain she clung weeping around his neck, in vain she called on him to reply. He merely
     looked at her in the same vacant way, and said childishly, "Never mind."
"But you know me—you know me, father!" said Rachel.
Again, he looked at her vacantly, and still the only words he uttered were, "Never mind."
"His mind is gone for ever," said the doctor.
Rachel did not answer. She clasped her hands, and looked with wistful sadness on the old
     man's blank face. With a pang she felt and saw that now, indeed, her dream was over—that never,
     never upon earth, should she win that long hoped-for treasure—her father's love.
