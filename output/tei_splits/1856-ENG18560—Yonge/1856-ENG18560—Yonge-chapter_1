CHAPTER I.

'Si douce est la Marguerite'—Chaucer.
'Miss Winter , are you busy? Do you want this afternoon? Can you take a good long
      walk?'
'Ethel, my dear, how often have I told you of your impetuosity— you have forgotten.'
'Very well'—with an impatient twist—'I beg your pardon. Good morning, Miss Winter,' said a
      thin, lank, angular, sallow girl, just fifteen, trembling from head to foot with restrained
      eagerness, as she tried to curb her tone into the requisite civility.
'Good morning, Ethel, good morning, Flora,' said the prim, middle-aged, daily governess,
      taking off her bonnet, and arranging the stiff little rolls of curl at the long, narrow
      looking-glass, the border of which distorted the countenance.
'Good morning,' properly responded Flora, a pretty, fair girl, nearly two years older than
      her sister.
'Will you—' began to burst from Etheldred's lips again, but was stifled by Miss Winter's
      inquiry, 'Is your mamma pretty well to-day?'
'Oh! very well,' said both at once; 'she is coming to the reading.' And Flora added, 'Papa
      is going to drive her out to-day.'
'I am very glad. And the baby?'
'I do believe she does it on purpose!' whispered Ethel to herself, wriggling fearfully on
      the wide window-seat on which she had precipitated herself, and kicking at the bar of the
      table, by which manifestation she of course succeeded in deferring her hopes, by a reproof
      which caused her to draw herself into a rigid, melancholy attitude, a sort of penance of
      decorum, but a rapid motion of the
       eyelids, a tendency to crack the joints of the fingers, and an unquietness at the ends
      of her shoes, betraying the restlessness of the digits therein contained.
It was such a room as is often to be found in old country town houses, the two large windows
      looking out on a broad old-fashioned street, through heavy framework, and panes of glass
      scratched with various names and initials. The walls were painted blue, the skirting almost a
      third of the height, and so wide at the top as to form a narrow shelf. The fire-place,
      constructed in the days when fires were made to give as little heat as possible, was
      ornamented with blue and white Dutch tiles bearing marvellous representations of Scripture
      history, and was protected by a very tall green guard; the chairs were much of the same date,
      solid and heavy, the seats in faded carpet-work, but there was a sprinkling of lesser ones and
      of stools; a piano; a globe; a large table in the middle of the room, with three desks on it;
      a small one, and a light cane chair by each window; and loaded book-cases. Flora began, 'If
      you don't want this afternoon to yourself—'
Ethel was on her feet, and open-mouthed. 'O, Miss Winter! if you would be so kind as to walk
      to Cocksmoor with us.'
'To Cocksmoor, my dear!' exclaimed the governess in dismay.
'Yes, yes, but hear,' cried Ethel. 'It is not for nothing. Yesterday—'
'No, the day before,' interposed Flora.
'There was a poor man brought into the hospital. He had been terribly hurt in the quarry,
      and papa says he'll die. He was in great distress, for his wife has just got twins, and there
      were lots of children before. They want everything—food and clothes— and we want to walk and
      take it.'
'We had a collection of clothes ready, luckily,' said Flora; 'and we have a blanket, and
      some tea and some arrowroot, and a bit of bacon, and mamma says she does not think it too far
      for us to walk, if you will be so kind as to go with us.'
Miss Winter looked perplexed. 'How could you carry the blanket, my dear?'
'O, we have settled that,' said Ethel, 'we mean to make the donkey a sumpter-mule, so, if
      you are tired, you may ride home on her.'
'But, my dear, has your mamma considered? They are such a set of wild people at Cocksmoor; I
      don't think we could walk there alone.'
'It is Saturday,' said Ethel, 'we can get the boys.'
'If you would reflect a little! They would be no protection. Harry would be getting into
      scrapes, and you and Mary running wild.'

'I wish Richard was at home!' said Flora.
'I know!' cried Ethel. 'Mr. Ernescliffe will come. I am sure he can walk so far now. I'll
      ask him.'
Ethel had clapped after her the heavy door with its shining brass lock, before Miss Winter
      well knew what she was about, and the governess seemed annoyed. 'Ethel does not consider,'
      said she. 'I don't think your mamma will be pleased.'
'Why not?' said Flora.
'My dear—a gentleman walking with you, especially if Margaret is going.'
'I don't think he is strong enough,' said Flora; but I can't think why there should be any
      harm. Papa took us all out walking with him yesterday—little Aubrey and all, and Mr.
      Ernescliffe went.'
'But, my dear—'
She was interrupted by the entrance of a fine tall blooming girl of eighteen, holding in her
      hand a pretty little maid of five. 'Good morning, Miss Winter. I suppose Flora has told you
      the request we have to make to you?'
'Yes, my dear Margaret, but did your mamma consider what a lawless place Cocksmoor is?'
'That was the doubt,' said Margaret, but papa said he would answer for it nothing would
      happen to us, and mamma said if you would be so kind.'
'It is unlucky,' began the governess, but stopped at the incursion of some new comers,
      nearly tumbling over each other, Ethel at the head of them. 'Oh! Harry!' as the gathers of her
      frock gave way in the rude grasp of a twelve-years-old boy. 'Miss Winter, 'tis all right—Mr.
      Ernescliffe says he is quite up to the walk, and will like it very much, and he will undertake
      to defend you from the quarrymen.'
'Is Miss Winter afraid of the quarrymen?' hallooed Harry. 'Shall I take a club?'
'I'll take my gun and shoot them,' valiantly exclaimed. Tom; and while threats were passing
      among the boys, Margaret asked, in a low voice, 'Did you ask him to come with us?'
'Yes, he said he should like it of all things. Papa was there, and said it was not too far
      for him—besides, there's the donkey. Papa says it, so we must go, Miss Winter.'
Miss Winter glanced unutterable things at Margaret, and Ethel began to perceive she had done
      something wrong. Flora was going to speak, when Margaret, trying to appear unconscious of a
      certain deepening colour in her own cheeks, pressed a hand on her shoulder, and whispering,
      'I'll see about it. Don't say any more, please,' glided out of the room.

'What's in the wind?' said Harry. 'Are many of your reefs out there, Ethel?'
'Harry can talk nothing but sailors' language,' said Flora, 'and I am sure he did not learn
      that of Mr. Ernescliffe. You never hear slang from him.'
'But aren't we going to Cocksmoor?' asked Mary, a blunt downright right girl of ten.
'We shall know soon,' said Ethel. 'I suppose I had better wait till after the reading to
      mend that horrid frock?'
'I think so, since we are so nearly collected,' said Miss Winter; and Ethel, seating herself
      on the corner of the window-seat, with one leg doubled under her, took up a Shakespeare,
      holding it close to her eyes, and her brother Norman, who, in age, came between her and Flora,
      kneeling on one knee on the window-seat, and supporting himself with one arm against the
      shutter, leant over her, reading it too, disregarding a tumultuous skirmish going on in that
      division of the family collectively termed 'the boys,' namely, Harry, Mary, and Tom, until Tom
      was suddenly pushed down, and tumbled over into Ethel's lap, thereby upsetting her and Norman
      together, and there was a general downfall, and a loud scream, 'The sphynx!'
'You've crushed it,' cried Harry, dealing out thumps indiscriminately.
'No, here 'tis,' said Mary, rushing among them, and bringing out a green sphynx caterpillar,
      on her finger—'tis not hurt.'
'Pax! Pax! ' cried Norman, over all, with the voice of an authority, as he leapt
      up lightly and set Tom on his legs again. 'Harry! you had better do that again,' he added,
      warningly. 'Be off, out of this window, and let Ethel and me read in peace.'
'Here's the place,' said Ethel—'Crispin, Crispian's day. How I do like Henry V.'
'It is no use to try to keep those boys in order!' sighed Miss Winter.
'Saturnalia, as papa calls Saturday,' replied Flora.
'Is not your eldest brother coming home to-day?' said Miss Winter, in a low voice to Flora,
      who shook her head, and said, confidentially, 'He is not coming till he has passed that
      examination. He thinks it better not.'
Here entered, with a baby in her arms, a lady with a beautiful countenance of calm
      sweetness, looking almost too young to be the mother of the tall Margaret, who followed her.
      There was a general hush as she greeted Miss Winter, the girls crowding round to look at their
      little sister, not quite six weeks old.
'Now, Margaret, will you take her up to the nursery?' said the mother, while the impatient
      speech was repeated, 'Mamma, can we go to Cocksmoor?'

'You don't think it will be too far for you?' said the mother to Miss Winter, as Margaret
      departed.
'O no, not at all, thank you, that was not—But Margaret has explained.'
'Yes, poor Margaret,' said Mrs. May, smiling. 'She has settled it by choosing to stay at
      home with me. It is no matter for the others, and he is going on Monday, so that it will not
      happen again.'
'Margaret has behaved very well,' said Miss Winter.
'She has indeed,' said her mother, smiling. 'Well, Harry, how is the caterpillar?'
'They've just capsized it, mamma,' answered Harry, 'and Mary is making all taut.'
Mrs. May laughed, and proceeded to advise Ethel and Norman to put away Henry V., and find
      the places in their Bibles, 'or you will have the things mixed together in your heads,' said
      she.
In the meantime Margaret, with the little babe, to-morrow to be her godchild, lying gently
      in her arms, came out into the matted hall, and began to mount the broad shallow-stepped
      stair-case, protected by low stout balusters, with a very thick flat and solid mahogany
      hand-rail, polished by the boys' constant riding up and down upon it. She was only on the
      first step, when the dining-room door opened, and there came out a young man, slight, and
      delicate-looking, with bright blue eyes, and thickly-curling light hair. 'Acting nurse?' he
      said, smiling. 'What an odd little face it is! I didn't think little white babies were so
      pretty! Well, I shall always consider myself as the real godfather—the other is all a
      sham.
'I think so,' said Margaret, 'but I must not stand with her in a draught,' and on she went,
      while he called after her. 'So we are to have an expedition to-day.'
She did not gainsay it, but there was a little sigh of disappointment, and when she was out
      of hearing, she whispered, 'Oh! lucky baby, to have so many years to come before you are
      plagued with troublesome propriety!'
Then depositing her little charge with the nurse, and trying to cheer up a solemn-looking
      boy of three, who evidently considered his deposition from babyhood as a great injury, she
      tripped lightly down again, to take part in the Saturday's reading and catechising.
It was pleasant to see that large family in the hush and reverence of such teaching, the
      mother's gentle power preventing the outbreaks of restlessness to which even at such times the
      wild young spirits were liable. Margaret and Miss Winter especially rejoiced in it on this
      occasion, the first since the birth of the baby, that she had been able to preside. Under her,
      though seemingly without her taking any trouble, there was none of the smothered laughing at
      the little
       ones' mistakes, the fidgetting of the boys, or Harry's audacious impertinence to Miss
      Winter; and no less glad was Harry to have his mother there, and be guarded from himself.
The Catechism was repeated, and a comment on the Sunday Services read aloud. The Gospel was
      that on the taking the lowest place, and when they had finished, Ethel said, 'I like the verse
      which explains that: "They who now sit lowest here, When their Master shall appear, He shall
      bid them higher rise, And be highest in the skies." 
'I did not think of that being the meaning of "when He that bade thee cometh,"' said Norman,
      thoughtfully.
'It seemed to be only our worldly advantage that was meant before,' said Ethel.
'Well, it means that too,' said Flora.
'I suppose it does,' said Mrs. May; 'but the higher sense is the one chiefly to be dwelt on.
      It is a lesson how those least known and regarded here, and humblest in their own eyes, shall
      be the highest hereafter.'
And Margaret looked earnestly at her mother, but did not speak.
'May we go, mamma?' said Mary.
'Yes, you three—all of you, indeed, unless you wish to say any more.'
The 'boys' availed themselves of the permission. Norman tarried to put his books into a neat
      leather case, and Ethel stood thinking. 'It means altogether—it is a lesson against ambition,'
      said she.
'True,' said her mother, 'the love of eminence for its own sake.'
'And in so many different ways!' said Margaret.
'Aye, worldly greatness, riches, rank, beauty,' said Flora.
'All sorts of false flash and nonsense, and liking to be higher than one ought to be,' said
      Norman. 'I am sure there is nothing lower, or more mean and shabby, than getting places and
      praise a fellow does not deserve.'
'Oh! yes!' cried Ethel, 'but no one fit to speak to would do that!'
'Plenty of people do, I can tell you,' said Norman,
'Then I hope I shall never know who they are!' exclaimed Ethel. 'But I'll tell you what I
      was thinking of, mamma. Caring to be clever, and get on, only for the sake of beating
      people.'
'I think that might be better expressed.'
'I know,' said Ethel, bending her brow, with the fulness of her thought—'I mean caring to do
      a thing only because nobody else can do it—wanting to be first more than wanting to do one's
      best.'
'You are quite right, my dear Ethel,' said her mother; 'and I am glad you have found in the
      Gospel a practical lesson, that should be
       useful to you both. I had rather you did so than that you read it in Greek, though that
      is very nice too,' she added, smiling, as she put her hand on a little Greek Testament, in
      which Ethel had been reading it, within her English Bible. 'Now, go and mend that deplorable
      frock, and if you don't dream over it, you won't waste too much of your holiday.'
'I'll get it done in no time!' cried Ethel, rushing head-long upstairs, twice tripping in
      it, before she reached the attic, where she slept, as well as Flora and Mary—a large room in
      the roof, the windows gay with bird-cages and flowers, a canary singing loud enough to deafen
      any one but girls to whom headaches were unknown, plenty of books and treasures, and a very
      fine view, from the dormer-window, of the town sloping downwards, and the river winding away,
      with some heathy hills in the distance. Poking and peering about with her short-sighted eyes,
      Ethel lighted on a work-basket in rare disorder, pulled off her frock, threw on a shawl, and
      sat down cross-legged on her bed, stitching vigorously, while meantime she spouted with great
      emphasis an ode of Horace, which Norman having learnt, by heart, she had followed his example;
      it being her great desire to be even with him in all his studies, and though eleven months
      younger, she had never yet fallen behind him. On Saturday, he showed her what were his tasks
      for the week, and as soon as her rent was repaired, she swung herself down-stairs in search of
      him for this purpose. She found him in the drawing-room, a pretty pleasant room—its only fault
      that it was rather too low. It had windows opening down to the lawn, and was full of pretty
      things, works and knicknacks. Ethel found the state of affairs unfavourable to her. Norman was
      intent on a book on the sofa, and at the table sat Mr. Ernescliffe, hard at work with
      calculations and mathematical instruments. Ethel would not, for the world, that any one should
      guess at her classical studies—she scarcely liked to believe that even her father knew of
      them, and to mention them before Mr. Ernescliffe would have been dreadful. So she only shoved
      Norman, and asked him to come.
'Presently,' he said.
'What have you there?' said she, poking her head into the book. 'Oh! no wonder you can't
      leave off. I've been wanting you to read it all the week.'
She read over him a few minutes, then recoiled: 'I forgot, mamma told me not to read those
      stories in the morning. Only five minutes, Norman.'
'Wait a bit, I'll come.'
She fidgetted, till Mr. Ernescliffe asked Norman if there was a table of logarithms in the
      house.

'O yes,' she answered; 'don't you know, Norman? In a brown book on the upper shelf in the
      dining-room. Don't you remember papa's telling us the meaning of them, when we had the grand
      book-dusting.'
He was conscious of nothing but his book; however, she found the logarithms, and brought
      them to Mr. Ernescliffe, staying to look at his drawing, and asking what he was making out. He
      replied, smiling at the impossibility of her understanding, but she wrinkled her brown
      forehead, hooked her long nose, and spent the next hour in amateur navigation.
Market Stoneborough was a fine old town. The Minster, grand with the architecture of the
      time of Henry III., stood beside a broad river, and round it were the buildings of a Convent,
      made by a certain good Bishop Whichcote, the nucleus of a grammar school, which had survived
      the Reformation, and trained up many good scholars; among them, one of England's princely
      merchants, Nicholas Randall, whose effigy knelt in a niche in the Chancel wall,
      scarlet-cloaked, white-ruffed, and black doubletted, a desk bearing an open Bible before him,
      and a twisted pillar of Derbyshire spar on each side. He was the founder of thirteen
      almshouses, and had endowed two scholarships at Oxford, the object of ambition of the
      Stoneborough boys, every eighteen months.
There were about sixty or seventy boarders, and the town boys slept at home, and spent their
      weekly holiday there on Saturday—the happiest day in the week to the May family, when alone,
      they had the company at dinner of Norman and Harry, otherwise known by their school names of
      June and July, given them because their elder brother had begun the series of months as
      May.
Some two hundred years back, a Dr. Thomas May had been head master, but ever since that time
      there had always been an M.D., not a D.D., in the family, owning a comfortable demense of
      spacious garden, and field enough for two cows, still green and intact, among modern buildings
      and improvements.
The present Dr. May stood very high in his profession, and might soon have made a large
      fortune in London, had he not held fast to his home attachments. He was extremely skilful and
      clever, with a boyish character that seemed as if it could never grow older; ardent,
      sensitive, and heedless, with a quickness of sympathy and tenderness of heart that was
      increased, rather than blunted, by exercise in scenes of suffering.
At the end of the previous summer holidays, Dr. May had been called one morning to attend a
      gentleman who had been taken very ill, at the Swan Inn.
He was received by a little boy of ten years old, in much grief,
       explaining that his brother had come two days ago from London, to bring him to school
      here; he had seemed unwell ever since they met, and last night had become much worse. And
      extremely ill the Doctor found him; a youth of two or three-and-twenty, suffering under a
      severe attack of fever, oppressed, and scarcely conscious, so as quite to justify his little
      brother's apprehensions. He advised the boy to write to his family, but was answered by a look
      that went to his heart—'Alan' was all he had in the world—father and mother were dead, and
      their relations lived in Scotland, and were hardly known to them.
'Where have you been living, then?'
'Alan sent me to school at Miss Lawler's, when my mother died, and there I have been ever
      since, while he has been these three years and a half on the African station.'
'What, is he in the navy?'
'Yes,' said the boy, proudly, 'Lieutenant Ernescliffe. He got his promotion last week. My
      father was in the battle of Trafalgar; and Alan has been three years in the West Indies, and
      then he was in the Mediterranean, and now on the coast of Africa, in the Atalantis. You must
      have heard about him, for it was in the newspaper, how, when he was mate, he had the command
      of the Santa Isabel, the slaver they captured.'
The boy would have gone on for ever, if Dr. May had not recalled him to his brother's
      present condition, and proceeded to take every measure for the welfare and comfort of the
      forlorn pair.
He learnt from other sources that the Ernescliffes were well connected. The father had been
      a distinguished officer, but had been ill able to provide for his sons; indeed, he died,
      without ever having seen little Hector, who was born during his absence on a voyage— his last,
      and Alan's first. Alan, the elder by thirteen years, had been like a father to the little boy,
      showing judgment and selfdenial that marked him of a high cast of character. He had
      distinguished himself in encounters with slave ships, and in command of a prize that he had
      had to conduct to Sierra Leone, he had shown great coolness and seamanship, in several
      perilous conjunctures, such as a sudden storm, and an encounter with another slaver, when his
      Portuguese prisoners became mutinous, and nothing but his steadiness and intrepidity had saved
      the lives of himself and his few English companions. He was, in fact, as Dr. May reported,
      pretty much of a hero. He had not, at the time, felt the effects of the climate, but, owing to
      sickness and death among the other officers, he had suffered much fatigue, and pressure of
      mind and body. Immediately on his return, had followed his examination, and though he had
      passed with great credit, and it had been at once followed by
       well-earned promotion, his nervous excitable frame had been over-tasked, and the
      consequence was a long and severe illness.
The Swan inn was not forty yards from Dr. May's back gate, and, at every spare moment, he
      was doing the part of nurse as well as doctor, professionally obliged to Alan Ernescliffe for
      bringing him a curious exotic specimen of fever, and requiting him by the utmost care and
      attention, while, for their own sakes, he delighted in the two boys with all the enthusiasm of
      his warm heart. Before the first week was at an end, they had learnt to look on the Doctor as
      one of the kindest friends it had been their lot to meet with, and Alan knew that if he died,
      he should leave his little brother in the hands of one who would comfort him as a father.
No sooner was young Ernescliffe able to sit up, than Dr. May insisted on conveying him to
      his own house, as his recovery was likely to be tedious, in solitude at the Swan. It was not
      till he had been drawn in a chair along the sloping garden, and placed on the sofa to rest,
      that he discovered that the time the good Doctor had chosen for bringing a helpless
      convalescent to his house, was two days after an eleventh child had been added to his
      family.
Mrs. May was too sorry for the solitary youth, and too sympathizing with her husband, to
      make any objection, though she was not fond of strangers, and had some anxieties. She had the
      utmost dependence on Margaret's discretion, but there was a chance of awkward situations,
      which papa was not likely to see or guard against. However, all seemed to do very well, and no
      one ever came into her room without some degree of rapture about Mr. Ernescliffe. The Doctor
      reiterated praises of his excellence, his principle, his ability and talent, his amusing talk;
      the girls were always bringing reports of his perfections; Norman retracted his grumbling at
      having his evenings spoilt; and 'the boys' were bursting with the secret that he was teaching
      them to rig a little ship that was to astonish mamma on her first coming down stairs, and to
      be named after the baby; while Blanche did all the coquetry with him, from which Margaret
      abstained. The universal desire was for mamma to see him, and when the time came, she owned
      that papa's swan had not turned out a goose.
There were now no grounds for prolonging his stay; but it was very hard to go, and he was
      glad to avail himself of the excuse of remaining for the Christening, when he was to represent
      the absent godfather. After that, he must go; he had written to his Scottish cousins to offer
      a visit, and he had a promise that he should soon be afloat again. No place would ever seem to
      him to like home as Market Stoneborough. He was quite like one of themselves, and took a full
      share in the discussions on the baby's name, which, as
       all the old family appellations had been used up, was an open question. The
      Doctor protested against Alice and Edith, which he said were the universal names in the
      present day. The boys hissed every attempt of their sisters at a romantic name, and then Harry
      wanted it to be Atalantis! At last Dr. May announced that he should have her named Dowsabel if
      they did not agree, and Mrs. May advised all the parties concerned, to write their choice on a
      slip of paper, and little Aubrey should draw two out of her bag, trusting that Atalantis
      Dowsabel would not come out, as Harry confidently predicted.
However, it was even worse, Aubrey's two lots were Gertrude and Margaret. Ethel and Mary
      made a vehement uproar to discover who could have written Margaret, and at last traced it home
      to Mr. Ernescliffe, who replied that Flora, without saying why, had desired him to set down
      his favourite name. He was much disconcerted, and did not materially mend the matter by saying
      it was the first name that came into his head.
