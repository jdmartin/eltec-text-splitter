CHAPTER XXVII.
'Èuna delle facoltà singolari ed incommunicabili della religione Cristiana questa, di poter
      dare indirizzo e quiete a chiunoque, in qualsivoglia congiuntura, a qualsivoglia termine,
      ricorra ad essa. Se al passato v'è rimedio, essa lo prescrive, lo somministra, presta lume e
      vigore per metterlo in opera a qualunque costo; se non v'è, essa dà il, modo di fare realmento
      e in effeto, ciò che l' uom dice in proverbio, della necessita virtù. Insegna a continuare con
      sapienza ciò che è stato intrapreso per leggerezza, piega l'animo ad abbracciare con
      propensione ciò che è stato imposto dalla prepotenza, e dà ad un elezione che fu temeraria, ma
      che e irrevocabile, tutta la santità, tutto il consiglio, diciamolo pur francamenta, tutte le
      gioje della vocazione.'
Manzoni.
The wedding day was fixed for the 20th of January, since it was less risk to Flora
      as an absolute invalid, than as convalescent enough to take any share in the doings.
Meta managed her correspondance with her own relatives, and obtained her uncle's kind
      approval, since he saw there could be nothing else; while her aunt treated her as an
      infatuated victim, but wished, for her mother's sake, to meet her in London before she
      sailed.
The worst stroke of all was to Bellairs, who had never chosen to believe that her mistress
      could move without her, and though mortally afraid in crossing to the Isle of Wight, and
      utterly abhorring all "natives," went into hysterics on finding that her young lady would take
      out no maid but a little hardworking village girl; and though transferred in the most
      flattering manner to Mrs. Rivers's service, shed a tear for every stitch she set in the
      trousseau, and assured her betrothed butler, that, if Miss Rivers would only have heard
      reason, she would have followed her to the world's end, rather than that her beautiful hair
      should never look like anything again.
So the wedding-day came, and grass and trees wore a fitting suit of crisp hoariness. Nothing
      could be quieter. Meta was arrayed by the sobbing Bellairs in her simple bridal white, wrapped
      herself in a large shawl, took her brother's arm, and walked down the frosty path with him and
      Mrs. Arnott, as if going merely to the daily service.
The time had not been made known, and there was hardly an
       addition to the ordinary congregation, except the May family and Dr. Spencer;
      but the Christmas evergreens still adorned aisle and chancel, and over the Altar stood the
      motto that Meta herself had woven of holly, on that Christmas eve of grief and anxiety,
      without knowing how it would speak to her.
'Fear not, for behold I bring unto you glad tidings of great joy, that shall be unto you and
      to all people.'
Fear not, for length of voyage, for distance from kindred, for hardship, privation,
      misunderstanding, disappointment. The glad tidings are to all people, even to the
      utmost parts of the earth. Ye have your portion in the great joy—ye have freely cast in your
      lot with those, whose feet are beautiful on the mountains, who bear the good tidings. Fear
      not, for He is with you, who will never forsake.
Thus Dr. May read the words with swelling heart, as he looked at his son's clear, grave,
      manful look, even as it had been when he made his Confirmation vow—his natural nervous
      excitability quelled by a spirit not his own, and chastened into strong purpose; and the
      bride, her young face the more lovely for the depth of enthusiasm restrained by awe and
      humility, as she stood without trembling or faltering, the strength of innocence expressed in
      the whole bearing of her slight figure in her white drapery. Around were the four sisterly
      bridesmaids, their black dresses shewing that these were still the twilight days of mourning,
      and that none would forget her, whose prayers might still bless their labour of love.
When Margaret Agatha May, on her husband's arm turned for a last look at the Altar of her
      own Church, "Fear not," in evergreen letters, was the greeting she bore away.
Ethel was left at the Grange for the ensuing fortnight—a time of unusual leisure both to her
      and to Flora, which they both prized highly, for it taught them to know each other as they had
      never done before. Flora's confidence to her Aunt had been a good thing for her, though so
      partial; it opened the way for further unreserve to one who knew the circumstances better,
      and, as to dread of Ethel, that could seldom prevail in her presence, partly from long habit,
      partly from her deficiency of manner, and still more from her true humility and affection.
      Gradually she arrived at the perception of the history of her sister's mind; understood what
      gloom had once overshadowed it; and how, since light had once shone upon her, she shrank not
      merely from the tasks that had become wearisome to her, but from the dread of losing among
      them her present peace.
'They are your duty,' argued Ethel. 'Duty brings peace.'
'They were not,' said Flora.

'They are now,' said Ethel.
'Dinners and parties, empty talk and vain show,' said Flora, languidly. 'Are you come to
      their defence, Ethel? If you could guess how sick one gets of them, and how much worse it is
      for them not to be hateful! And to think of bringing my poor little girl up to the like, if
      she is spared!'
'If they are not duties, I would not do them,' said Ethel.
'Ethel,' cried her sister, raising herself from her couch, eagerly, 'I will say it to you!
      What should you think of George resigning his seat, and living in peace here?'
'Would he?' said Ethel.
'If I wished it.'
'But what would he do with himself?' said Ethel, not in too complimentary a strain.
'Yachtting, farming, Cochin-chinese—or something,' said Flora. 'Anything not so wearing as
      this!'
'That abominable candidate of Tomkins's would come in!' exclaimed Ethel. 'Oh! Flora, that
      would be horrid!'
'That might be guarded against,' said Flora. 'Perhaps Sir Henry—but, oh, let us leave
      politics in peace while we can. I thought we should do some great good, but it is all a maze
      of confusion. It is so hard to know principles from parties, and everything goes wrong! It is
      of no use to contend with it!'
'It is never vain to contend with evil,' said Ethel.
'We are not genralizing,' said Flora. 'There is evil nearer home than the state of parties,
      and I can't see that George's being in Parliament—being what he is—is anything like the
      benefit to things in general—that it is temptation and plague to me, besides the risk of
      London life for the baby, now and hereafter.'
'I can't say that I think it is,' said Ethel. 'How nice it would be to have you here! I am
      so glad you are willing to give it up.'
'It would have been better to have given it up untasted—like Norman,' sighed Flora. 'I will
      talk to George.'
'But, Flora,' said Ethel, a little startled. 'You ought not to do such a thing without
      advice.'
'There will be worry enough before it is done!' sighed Flora. 'No fear of that!'
'Stop a minute,' said Ethel, as if poor Flora could have done anything but lie still on her
      sofa. 'I think you ought to consider well before you set it going.'
'Have not I longed for it day and night? It is an escape from peril for ourselves and our
      child.'
'I can't be sure!' said Ethel. 'It may be more wrong to make George desert the post
      which—'

'Which I thrust him into,' said Flora. 'My father told me as much.'
'I did not mean you to say that! But it is a puzzle. It seems as if it were right to give up
      such things; yet, when I recollect the difficulty of carrying an election right at
      Stoneborough, I think papa would be very sorry. I don't think his interest would bring in any
      sound man but his son-in-law; and George himself seems to like his parliamentary life better
      than anything else.'
'Yes,' said Flora, hesitatingly; for she knew it was true—he liked to think himself
      important, and it gave him something to think of, and regular occupation—not too active or
      onerous; but she could not tell Ethel what she herself felt; that all she could do for him
      could not prevent him from being held cheap by the men among whom she had placed him.
'Then,' said Ethel, as she heard her affirmative, 'I don't think it for his dignity, for you
      to put him into parliament to please you, and then take him out to please you.'
'I'll take care of his dignity,' said Flora, shortly.
'I know you would do it well—'
'I am sick of doing things well!' said poor Flora. 'You little know how I dread reading up
      all I must read presently! I shall lose all I have scarcely gained. I cannot find peace any
      way, but by throwing down the load I gave my peace for.'
'Whether this is truth or fancy,' said Ethel, thoughtfully. 'If you would ask some one
      competent.'
'Don't you know there are some things one cannot ask,' said Flora. 'I don't know why I spoke
      to you! Ah! come in! Why, George, that is a finer egg than ever,' as he entered with a
      Shanghae egg in each hand, for her to mark with the date when it had been laid. Poultry was a
      new hobby, and Ethel had been hearing, in her tête à tête dinners with George, a
      great deal about the perfections of the hideous monsters that had obtained fabulous prices.
      They had been the best resource for conversation; but she watched, with something between
      vexation and softness, how Flora roused herself to give her full attention and interest to his
      prosing about his pets, really pleased as it seemed; and, at last, encouraging him actually to
      fetch his favourite cock to shew her; when she went through the points of perfection of the
      ungainly mass of feathers, and did not at all allow Ethel to laugh at the unerthly sounds of
      disapproval which handling elicited.
'And this is our senator!' thought Ethel. 'I wonder whether Honorious's hen was a Shanghae!
      Poor Flora is right—it is poor work to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear! but, putting him
      into the place is one thing, taking him out another. I wish she would
       take advice; but I never knew her do that, except as a civil way of
      communicating her intentions. However, she is not quite what she was! Poor dear! Aunt Flora
      will never believe what a beautiful creature she used to be! It seems wrong to think of her
      going back to that horrid London; but I can't judge. For my part, I'd rather do work, than no
      work for George, and he is a good, kind-hearted fellow after all! I won't be a crab!'
So Ethel did her best, and said the cock had a bright eye—all she could say for him—and
      George instructed her to admire the awkward legs, and invited her to a poultry show, at
      Whitford, in two days' time—and they sent him away to continue his consultations with the
      poultry woman, which pullets should be preferred as candidates for a prize.
'Meta set him upon this,' said Flora. 'I hope you will go, Ethel. You see he can be very
      happy here.'
'Still,' said Ethel, 'the more I think, the more sure I am that you ought to ask
      advice.'
'I have asked yours,' said Flora, as if it were a great effort. 'You don't know what to
      say—I shall do what I see to be the only way to rest.'
'I do know what to say,' said Ethel; 'and that is, do as the Prayer-book tells you, in any
      perplexity.'
'I am not perplexed,' said Flora.
'Don't say so. This is either the station to which God has called you, or it is not.'
'He never called me to it.'
'But you don't know whether you ought to leave it. If you ought not, you would be ten times
      more miserable. Go to Richard, Flora—he belongs to you as much as I—he has authority
      besides.'
'Richard!'
'He is the clearest of us all in practical matters,' said Ethel, preventing what she feared
      would be disparaging. 'I don't mean only that you should ask him about this parliament matter
      alone; but I am sure you would be happier and more settled, if you talked things over with him
      before—before you go to Church.'
'You don't know what you propose.'
'I do,' said Ethel, growing bolder. 'You have been going all this time by feeling. You have
      never cleared up, and got to the bottom of, your troubles.'
'I could not talk to anyone.'
'Not to anyone but a Clergyman. Now, to enter on such a thing is most averse to your nature;
      and I do believe that, for that very reason, it would be what would do you most good. You say
      you have recovered sense of—Oh! Flora, I can't talk of what you have
       gone through; but if you have only a vague feeling that seems as if lying still
      would be the only way to keep it, I don't think it can be altogether sound, or the 'quiet
      conscience' that is meant.'
'Oh! Ethel! Ethel! I have never told you what I have undergone, since I knew my former
      quietness of conscience was but sleep! I have gone on in agony, with the sense of hypocrisy
      and despair, because I was afraid, for George's sake, to do otherwise.'
Ethel felt herself utterly powerless to advise; and, after a kind sound of sympathy, sat
      shocked, pondering on what none could answer; whether this were, indeed, what poor Flora
      imagined, or whether it had been a holding-fast to the thread through the darkness. The proud
      reserve was the true evil, and Ethel prayed and trusted it might give way.
She went very amiably to Whitford with George, and gained great credit with him, for
      admiring the prettiest speckled Hamburgh present; indeed, George was becoming very fond of
      "poor Ethel," as he still called her, and sometimes predicted that she would turn out a fine
      figure of a woman after all.
Ethel heard, on her return, that Richard had been there; and three days' after, when Flora
      was making arrangements for going to Church, a moment of confidence came over her, and she
      said, 'I did it, Ethel! I have spoken to Richard.'
'I am so glad!'
'You were right. He is as clear as he is kind,' said Flora; 'he shewed me that, for George's
      sake, I must bear with my present life, and do the best I can with it, unless some leading
      comes for an escape; and that the glare, and weariness, and being spoken well of, must be
      taken as punishment for having sought after these things.'
'I was afraid he would say so,' said Ethel. 'But you will find happiness again, Flora
      dear.'
'Scarcely—before I come to Margaret and to my child,' sighed Flora. 'I suppose it was Mercy
      that would not let me follow when I wished it. I must work till the time of rest comes!'
'And your own little Margaret will cheer you!' said Ethel, more hopefully, as she saw Flora
      bend over her baby, with a face that might one day be bright.
She trusted that patient continuance in well-doing, would one day win peace and joy, even in
      the dreary weird that poor Flora had chosen.
For her own part, Ethel found Flora's practical good sense and sympathy very useful, in her
      present need of the counsel she had always had from Margaret.
The visit to Flora lasted a fortnight, and Ethel was much benefitted
       by the leisure for reading and the repose after the long nursing; though, before
      the end, her refreshed energies began to pine for Daisy and her hymns, for Aubrey and his
      Virgil, for Cherry and her scholars, and, above all, for her father; for, come as often as he
      would, it was not papa at home.
On the other hand, Mary was at a loss for Ethel every hour; Richard was putting off his
      affairs till Ethel should come home; Miss Bracy and Blanche longed for her to relieve the
      school-room from the children; Aubrey could not perform a lesson in comfort with anyone
      else—never ended a sum without groaning for Ethel, and sometimes rode to Abbotstoke for the
      mere purpose of appealing to her; in short, no one could get on without her, and the Doctor
      least of all.
Dr. Spencer, and Mr. Wilmot, and all his sons and daughters, had done their best for him;
      but, in spite of his satisfaction at seeing the two sisters so happy together, he could not
      help missing Ethel every minute, as the very light of his home; and when, at last, Flora
      brought her back, she was received with uproarious joy by Aubrey and Daisy, while the rest of
      the household felt a revival and refreshment of spirits—the first drawing aside of the cloud
      that had hung over the winter. The pearl of their home might be missed every hour, but they
      could thankfully rest in the trust that she was a jewel stored up in safety and peace, to
      shine as a star for evermore.
A few weeks more, and there were other partings, sad indeed, yet cheery. Dr. May told Mrs.
      Arnott that, though he grieved that so much of sorrow had come to dim her visit, he could not
      but own that it was the very time when her coming could be most comforting; and this, as she
      truly said, was satisfaction enough for her, besides that she could not rejoice enough that
      her arrival had been in time to see their dear Margaret. She should carry away most precious
      recollections; and she further told Dr. Spencer that she was far more comfortable about her
      brother-in-law, than if she had only known him in his youthful character, which had seemed so
      little calculated to bear sorrow or care. She looked at him now only to wonder at, and
      reverence the change that had been gradually wrought by the affections placed above.
Norman and his wife went with her—the one grave but hopeful, the other trying to wile away
      the pain of parting, by her tearful mirth—making all sorts of odd promises and touching
      requests, between jest and earnest, and clinging to the last to her dear father-in-law, as if
      the separation from him were the hardest of all.
'Well, humming-birds must be let fly?' said he, at last. 'Ah! ha! Meta, are they of no
      use?'

'Stay till you hear!' said Meta, archly—then turning back once more. 'Oh! how I have thanked
      you, Ethel, for those first hints you gave me how to make my life real . If I had
      only sat still and wished, instead of trying what could be done as I was, how unhappy I should
      have been!'
'Come, take your sprite away, Norman, if you don't want me to keep her for good! God bless
      you, my dear children! Good-bye! Who knows but when Doctor Tom sets up in my place, Ethel and
      I may come out and pay you a visit?'
It had all been over for some weeks, and the home-party had settled down again into what was
      likely to be their usual course, excepting in the holidays, to which the Doctor looked forward
      with redoubled interest, as Tom was fast becoming a very agreeable and sensible companion; for
      his moodiness had been charmed away by Meta, and principle was teaching him true command of
      temper. He seemed to take his father as a special charge, bequeathed to him by Norman, and had
      already acquired that value and importance at home which comes of the laying aside of all
      self-importance.
It was a clear evening in March, full of promise of spring, and Ethel was standing in the
      Church porch at Cocksmoor, after making some visits in the parish, waiting for Richard, while
      the bell was ringing for the Wednesday evening service, and the pearly tints of a cloudless
      sunset were fading into the western sky.
Ethel began to wonder where Norman might be looking at the sun dipping into the Western sea,
      and thence arose before her the visions of her girlhood, when she had first dreamt of a Church
      on Cocksmoor, and of Richard ministering before a willing congregation. So strange did the
      accomplishment seem, that she even touched the stone to assure herself of the reality; and
      therewith came intense thanksgiving that the work had been taken out of her hands, to be the
      more fully blessed and accomplished—that is, as far as the building went; as to the people,
      there was far more labour in store, and the same Hand must be looked to for the increase.
For herself, Ethel looked back and looked on. Norman Ogilvie's marriage seemed to her to
      have fixed her lot in life, and what was that lot? Home and Cocksmoor had been her choice, and
      they were before her. Home! but her eyes had been opened to see that earthly homes may not
      endure, nor fill the heart. Her dear father might, indeed, claim her full-hearted devotion,
      but, to him, she was only one of many. Norman was no longer solely hers; and she had begun to
      understand that the unmarried woman must not seek undivided return of affection, and must not
      set her love, with exclusive eagerness, on aught below, but must be ready to cease in turn to
      be first with any. Ethel was truly a mother to the younger
       ones; but she faced the probability that they would find others to whom she
      would have the second place. To love each heartily, to do her utmost for each in turn, and to
      be grateful for their fondness was her call; but never to count on their affection as her sole
      right and inalienable possession. She felt that this was the probable course, and that she
      might look to becoming comparatively solitary in the course of years—then tried to realize
      what her lonely life might be, but broke off smiling at herself, 'What is that to me? What
      will it be when it is over? My course and aim are straight on, and He will direct my paths. I
      don't know that I shall be alone, and I shall have the memory—the Communion with them, if not
      their presence. Someone there must be to be loved and helped, and the poor for certain. Only I
      must have my treasure above, and when I think what is there, and of—Oh! that bliss of being
      perfectly able to praise—with no bad old self to mar the full joy of giving thanks, and
      blessing, and honour, and power! Need I dread a few short years?—and they have not begun
      yet—perhaps they won't—Oh! here is actually papa coming home this way! how delightful! Papa,
      are you coming to Church here?'
'Aye! Ethel. That weathercock of Spencer's is a magnet, I believe! It draws me from all
      parts of the country to hear Richard in St. Andrew's Church.'
