CHAPTER I.
A LONG gallery opening on each side to small rooms gave the inhabitants of St.
     Cécile’s Monastery access both to them and to the larger apartment which was inhabited by the
     Reverend Mother herself. This latter room was of an oblong shape, very bare of furniture, and
     of all kinds of decoration. The windows were without curtains; there was but one table, and on
     it stood a crucifix. Two benches by the wall were all the accommodation for sitting down. The
     one figure which occupied the chamber required not even so
      much, for she was kneeling in the middle of the floor, with
     support of no kind, and quite upright, except her head, which was bowed under the thick cloth
     or veil hanging over it, and which concealed even her hands.
“She is praying,” said a nun, looking into the room, “you had better wait;” and these words
     she addressed to a young girl who accompanied her, in the ordinary tone of conversation, such
     as befitted the occupations of the place.
The young girl advanced into the room, and herself went down on her knees at a little
     distance from the Superior, running over her beads while she waited till she might speak. She
     was very simply dressed in white, with parted hair, like a child, but abundant and beautiful,
     falling low on low shoulders and delicately rounded waist. Her face was fair, with very little
     colour, and the eyes, which she raised often, while she slid her beads through her fingers, had
     a simplicity of religious expression, such as fades even in those happy enough once to possess
     it, when the habits of a pious child‐
      hood come to be contradicted by those of the general
     world.
When the Superior rose from her knees, so did Elinor, and advanced towards the elder lady,
     who kissed her on the forehead, and gave a blessing. The conversation was in French, though the
     girl was English, for it was in a Convent of Brittany that the scene took place. It did not
     begin in the tone supposed to be exclusively that of Lady Abbesses.
“Has Louisa finished the marking of all your shifts, my dear? Are they ready?”
“Yes, dear Mother, and packed up,” said Elinor.
“And have you heard whether Madame Néotte is come.”
“Yes, that is what I came here to tell you, as you desired.”
“Then to‐morrow you leave us,” said the Superior, in a melancholy voice.
“It is you who have determined it,” said Elinor.
“Ah, my child! your guardian believes it best; it is his doing.”

“And I shall come back,” said the girl.
“No, dear, you will never do that. I know your feelings better than you do. It will be a hard
     parting with us all, but when you are away you will be glad. You will enjoy the world, you will
     choose it, and you will be welcome in it. No; you will never wish to come back here. I have
     known many gentle girls like you, who could not find what they wanted here. They require to be
     carried along—not to walk alone, as in a convent.”
“Am I one of those,” said Elinor, catching hold of the Abbess’s hand and passionately kissing
     it; “I who have been so happy?”
“And have made us all happy—but you must go. Sit down a little while, let us talk for the
     last time. The world is full of snares, my dear.”
“What are they?” said Elinor. “What will they tempt me to do?”
“Vanity, the pride of life, the lusts of the devil,” answered the Superior. “You must be
     prepared for all. Some will pretend that you have beauty; some will praise your
      voice, as if you were a musician; some will talk to you of the
     world—and all, all for their own bad ends.”
“What are those ends?” asked Elinor, again.
The Abbess, was a little puzzled. “Man,” said she, solemnly, “is a creature going about to
     devour. Listen not to him, go not near him, keep him far from you. He will hurt you, he will
     destroy you; you have already learned this; now is your time to practise. Keep your eyes from
     his face, keep your speech from his commerce. One day it may come to pass that your guardian
     may select one who is to be your husband. Then submit yourself to the will of your superiors,
     and adopt the state of life which shall be allotted you; but till such a fate is brought to
     your door, remember that a maiden must keep her finger on her lips and her heart full of
     thoughts holy and virtuous, avoiding the very shadow of sin.”
Elinor was set thinking what these sins could be; but she resolved, at all events, to do
     right, and to keep the precepts of her early friend in her memory.

She continued talking with the Reverend Mother as long as convent duties permitted; then, for
     the last time, partook the Evening Service and assisted to make the vesper beautiful by her
     exquisite voice, against the world’s estimation of which the Superior thought she had
     successfully warned her.
She rose that night for Vigils; and next morning was up at Matins—the last time of doing
     these duties making them seem to her as if she would fain never cease to do them; and when the
     hour for her journey arrived, the wrench of the first roots she had ever struck in hearts and
     places, overwhelmed her with a girlish sorrow, which, fortunately, was not put to such proof as
     an offer to remove it would have been; for there is no saying how her wish to remain in the
     Convent would have been modified, if the chaise into which she so sobbingly stepped had been
     ordered back into its old remise.
