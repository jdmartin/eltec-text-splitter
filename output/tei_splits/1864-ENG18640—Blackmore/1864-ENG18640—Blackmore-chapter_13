CHAPTER XIII.
So impulsive, kind-hearted, and honest was Mrs. Huxtable, that we could
                            always tell what was the next thing she was going to say or do. Even at
                            her meals she contrived to be in a bustle, except on Sundays; but she
                            got through a great deal of work. On Sundays she put on, with her best
                            gown, an air of calm dignity which made her unhappy until it was off,
                            which it was directly after the evening service. She seemed a very
                            sensible woman, and whatever the merits of the case she sided always
                            with the weakest. The next morning we asked how it was she appeared not
                            to expect us, as I had written and posted the letter myself on the
                            previous Saturday.
"For sure now," she replied, "and the papper scrawl coom'd on Monday; but
                            us bain't girt scholards, and Varmer said most like 'twas the Queen's
                            taxes, for there was her head upon it; so us put un in the big mortar
                            till Beany Dawe should come over, or us should go to church next Zunday,
                            and passon would discoorse it for us. But"—and off she ran—"But her
                            belongs to you now, Miss Clerer, seeing as how you've coom after
                            un."
So they had only a general idea that we were coming, and knew not when it
                            would be. The following day, Thomas Henwood arrived, bringing our boxes
                            in a vehicle called a "butt," which is a short and rudely made cart,
                            used chiefly for carrying lime.
After unpacking our few embellishments, we set up a clumsy but
                            comfortable sofa for my mother, and tried to divert her sadness a little
                            by many a shift and device to garnish our narrow realm. We removed the
                            horrible print of "Death and the Lady," which was hung above the
                            chimneypiece, and sundry daubs of our Lord and the Apostles, and a woman
                            of Samaria with a French parasol, and Eli falling from a turnpike gate
                            over the Great Western steamer. But these alterations were not made
                            without some wistful glances from poor Mrs. Huxtable. At last, when I
                            began to nail up a simple sketch of the church at Vaughan St. Mary
                            instead of a noble representation of the Prodigal Son, wearing a white
                            hat with a pipe stuck under the riband, and weeping into a handkerchief
                            with some horse upon it, the good dame could no longer repress her
                            feelings.
"Whai, Miss Clerer, Miss, dear art alaive, cheel, what be 'bout? Them's
                            the smartest picters anywhere this saide of Coorn. Varmer gied a pan of
                            hogs' puddens for they, and a Chainey taypot and a Zunday pair of
                            corderahoys. Why them'll shaine with the zun on 'um, laike a vield of
                            poppies and charlock. But thic smarl pokey papper of yourn ha'ant no
                            more colour nor the track of a marly scrarly. A massy on us if I
                            couldn't walk a better picter than thic, with my pattens on in the zider
                            squash."
To argue with such a connoisseur would have been worse than useless; so I
                            pacified her by hanging the rejected gems in her own little summer room
                            by the dairy. Our parlour began before long to look neat and even
                            comfortable. Of course the furniture was rough, but I care not much for
                            upholstery, and am quite rude of French polish. My only fear was lest
                            the damp from the lime-ash floor should strike to my dear mother's feet,
                            through the scanty drugget which covered it. The fire-place was bright
                            and quaint, lined with old Dutch tiles, and the grey-washed walls were
                            less offensive to the eye than would have been a paper chosen by good
                            Mrs. Huxtable. The pretty lattice window, budding even now with
                            woodbine, and impudent to the winds with myrtle, would have made amends
                            for the meanest room in England. Before it lay a simple garden with
                            sparry walks and bright-thatched hives, and down a dingle rich with
                            trees and a crystal stream, it caught a glimpse of the Bristol
                            Channel.
