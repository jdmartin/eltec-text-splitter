CHAPTER XIV.
When our things were nearly settled, and I was sitting by myself, with
                            dirty hands and covered with dust, there came a little timid tap at the
                            door, followed by a shuffling outside, as if some one contemplated
                            flight, yet feared to fly. Opening the door, I was surprised to find the
                            child whom I expected a massive figure, some six feet and a quarter
                            high, and I know not how many feet in width, but wide enough to fill the
                            entire passage. He made a doubtful step in advance, till his great
                            open-hearted face hung sheepishly above my head.
"Have I the pleasure of seeing Mr. Huxtable?" I asked.
"Ees 'um," he stammered, blushing like a beet-root, "leastways Miss, I
                            ort to zay, no plasure 'um to the laikes of thee, but a honour to ai.
                            Varmer Uxtable they karls me round about these 'ere parts, and some on
                            'em Varmer Jan, and Beany Dawe, he karl me 'Varmer Brak-plew-harnish, as
                            tosses arl they Garnish,' and a dale he think of his potry as it please
                            God to give 'un: but Maister, may be, is the riglar thing, leastways you
                            knows best, Miss." "Danged if I can coom to discourse with girt folks
                            nohow, no more nor a sto-un." This was an "aside," but audible a long
                            way off, as they always are on the stage.
"But I am a very small folk, Mr. Huxtable, compared at least with
                            you."
"I humbly ax your parding, Miss, but ai didn't goo for to be zuch a beg,
                            nockety, sprarling zort of a chap. I didn't goo for to do it nohow.
                            Reckon 'twar my moother's valt, her were always draining of hayricks."
                            This also was an "aside."
"Come in," I said, "I am very glad to see you, and so will my mother
                            be."
"Noo! Be e now? Be e though undade, my dear?" he asked with the truest
                            and finest smile I ever saw: and I felt ashamed in front of the strong
                            simplicity which took my conventional words for heart's truth.
"Them's the best words," he continued "as ai 've 'eered this many a dai;
                            for ai'll be danged if ever a loi could coom from unner such eyes as
                            yourn."
And thereupon he took my puny weak hand in his rough iron palm, like an
                            almond in the nut-crackers, and examined it with pitying wonder.
"Wull, wull! some hands be made for mulking coos, and some be made of the
                            crame itself. Now there couldn't be such a purty thing as this ere,
                            unless it wor to snow war'rm. But her bain't no kaind of gude for
                            rarstling? and ai be aveared thee'll have to rarstle a rare bout wi the
                            world, my dearie: one down, tother coom on, that be the wai of 'un."
"Oh, I am not afraid, Mr. Huxtable."
He took some time to meditate upon this, and shook his head when he had
                            finished.
"Noo, thee bain't aveard yet I'll warr'ne. Gude art alaive, if e bain't a
                            spurrity maid. But if ere a chap zays the black word on e—and thiccy's
                            the taime when a maid can't help herzell, then ony you karl Jan Uxtable
                            that's arl my dear, and if so be it's in the dead hoor of the naight,
                            and thee beest to tother zaide of Hexymoor, ai'll be by the zaide of
                            thee zooner nor ai could thraw a vorehip."
Before I could thank him for his honest championship my mother entered
                            the room, and all his bashfulness (lost for the moment in the pride of
                            strength) came over him again like an extinguisher. Although he did not
                            tremble—his nerves were too firm for that—he stood fumbling with his
                            hat, and reddening, and looking vaguely about, at a loss where to put
                            his eyes or anything else.
My mother, quite worn out with her morning's walk, surprised at her
                            uncouth visitor, and frightened perhaps at his bulk, sank on our
                            new-fangled sofa, in a stupor of weakness. Then it was strange and fine
                            to see the strong man's sense of her feeble state. All his embarrassment
                            vanished at once; he saw there was something to do; and a look of deep
                            interest quickened his great blue eyes. Poising his heavy frame with the
                            lightness of a bird, he stepped to her side as if the floor had been
                            holy, and, scarcely touching her, contrived to arrange the rude
                            cushions, and to lay her delicate head in an easy position, as a nurse
                            composes a child. All the while, his looks and manner expressed so much
                            feeling and gentleness, that he must have known what it was to lose a
                            daughter or mother.
"Poor dear leddy," he whispered to me, "her be used to zummut more plum
                            nor thiccy, I reckon. Her zimth crule weist and low laike. Hath her been
                            long in that there wai?"
"Yes, she has long been weak and poorly; but I fear that her health has
                            been growing worse for the last few months." I couldn't help crying a
                            little; and I couldn't help his seeing it.
"Dang thee, Jan Uxtable, for a doilish girt zinny. Now doon e tak on so,
                            Miss; doon e, that's a dear. Avore her's been here a wake, her'll be as
                            peart as a gladdy. There bain't in arl they furren parts no place the
                            laike of this ere to make a body ston upraight. The braze cooms off o
                            Hexymoor as frash as a young coolt, and up from the zay as swate as the
                            breath of a coo on the clover, and he'll zit on your chake the zame as a
                            dove on her nestie; and ye'll be so hearty the both on ye, that ye'll

                            Ee's fai ye wull." With this homely comfort he departed, after a
                            cheering glance at my mother.
Before I proceed, the Homeric epithet "Break-plough-harness," applied by
                            the poet to Mr. Huxtable, needs some explanation. It appears that the
                            farmer, in some convivial hour (for at other times he detested
                            vaunting), had laid a wager that he and Timothy Badcock, his
                            farm-labourer, would plough half an acre of land, "wiout no beastessy in
                            the falde." Now, it happened that the Parracombe blacksmith had lately
                            been at Barnstaple, and there had seen a man who had heard of ploughing
                            by steam. So when the farmer's undertaking got noised abroad and
                            magnified, all Exmoor assembled to witness the exploit, wondering,
                            trembling, and wrathful. Benches and tables were set in the "higher
                            Barton," a nice piece of mealy land, just at the back of the house,
                            while Suke and Mrs. Huxtable plied the cider-barrel for the yeomen of
                            the neighbourhood. The farmer himself was not visible—no plough or
                            ploughing tackle of any description appeared, and a rumour began to
                            spread that the whole affair was a hoax, and the contriver afraid to
                            show himself. But as people began to talk of "sending for the constable"
                            (who, of course was there all the time), and as cart-whips and
                            knob-sticks began to vibrate ominously, Mrs. Huxtable made a signal to
                            Mr. Dawe, who led off the grumbling throng to the further end of the
                            field, where an old rick-cloth lay along against the hedge. While the
                            tilting was moved aside, the bold sons of Exmoor shrunk back, expecting
                            some horrible monster, whose smoke was already puffing. All they saw was
                            a one-horse plough with the farmer, in full harness, sitting upon it and
                            smoking his pipe, and Timothy Badcock patiently standing at the
                            plough-tail. Amid a loud hurrah from his friends, Mr. Huxtable leaped to
                            the fore, and cast his pipe over the hedge; then settled the breast-band
                            across the wrestling-pads on his chest, and drew tight both the
                            chain-traces. "Gee wugg now, if e wull," cried stout Tim Badcock
                            cheerily, and off sailed the good ship of husbandly, cleaving a deep
                            bright furrow. But when they reached the corner, the farmer turned too
                            sharply, and snapped the off-side trace. That accident impressed the
                            multitude with a deeper sense of his prowess than even the striking
                            success which attended his primitive method of speeding the plough.
To return to my mother. As spring came on, and the beautiful country
                            around us freshened and took green life from the balmy air, I even
                            ventured to hope that the good yeoman's words would be true. He had
                            become, by this time, a great friend of ours, doing his utmost that we
                            might not feel the loss of our faithful Thomas Henwood.
Poor Thomas had been very loth to depart; but I found, as we got settled,
                            that my mother ceased to want him, and it would have been wrong as well
                            as foolish to keep him any longer. He invested his savings in a
                            public-house at Gloucester, which he called the "Vaughan Arms," and soon
                            afterwards married Jane Hiatt, a daughter of our head game-keeper; or I
                            ought to say, Mr. Vaughan's.
Ann Maples remained with us still. We lived, as may be supposed, in the
                            most retired manner. My time was chiefly occupied in attendance upon
                            dear mother, and in attempts to create for her some of those countless
                            comforts, whose value we know not until they are lost. After breakfast,
                            my mother would read for an hour her favourite parts of Scripture, and
                            vainly endeavour to lead me into the paths of peace. Her soul discarded
                            more and more the travel garb and wayfaring troubles of this lower
                            existence, as, day by day, it won a nearer view of the golden gate, and
                            the glories beyond; with which I have seen her eyes suffused, like the
                            lucid heaven with sunrise. It has been said, and I believe, that there
                            is nothing, in all our material world, so lovely as a fair woman looking
                            on high for the angels she knows to be waiting for her.
Even I, though looking in an opposite direction, and for an opposite
                            being, could not but admire that gentle meekness, whose absence formed
                            the main fault of my character. Not that I was hard-hearted, or cross,
                            (unless self-love deceives me), but restless yearning and hatred were
                            ever at work within me; and these repel things of a milder nature, as a
                            bullet cries tush to the zephyr.
