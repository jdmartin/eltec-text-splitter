CHAPTER II.
Although I find a sad pleasure in lingering over these times, with such a
                            history still impending, I cannot afford the indulgence.
Dear mother's simple funeral took me once more to my native place. Even
                            without Mr. Huxtable's generous and noble assistance, I should have laid
                            her to rest by the side of the husband she loved so well. But
                            difficulties, sore to encounter at such a time, would have met me on
                            every side. Moreover the kind act cheered and led me through
                            despondency, like the hand and face of God.
Caring little what people might say or think, I could not stay at a
                            distance. Nature told me that it was my duty to go, and duty or not, I
                            could not stay away.
And now for the last time I look on the face and form of my mother. That
                            which I have played, and talked, and laughed with, though lately not
                            much of laughter, that which has fed and cared for me, till it needed my
                            care in turn; that which I have toddled beside, or proudly run in front
                            of; whose arms have been round me whenever I wept, and whose bosom the
                            haven of childhood's storms; first to greet me with smiles in the
                            morning, and last to bless me with tears at night; ever loving, and
                            never complaining—in one word for a thousand, my mother. So far away
                            now, so hopelessly far away! There it lies indeed, I can touch it, kiss
                            it, and embrace it; but oh how small a part of mother! and even that
                            part is not mine. So holy and calm it lies, such loving kindness still
                            upon its features, so near me, but in mystery so hopelessly far away! I
                            can see it, but it never will know me again; I may die beside it, and it
                            cannot weep. The last last look of all on earth—they must have carried
                            me away.
I remember tottering down the hill, supported by a stalwart arm. The
                            approach to the house prevented—or something. Two children ran before
                            me, stopping now and then to wonder, and straggling to pick
                            hedge-flowers. One of them brought me a bunch, then stared, and was
                            afraid to offer them. "Nancy, I'll be the death of thee," whispered a
                            woman's voice. The little girl shrunk to me for shelter, with timid
                            tears in her great blue eyes. So I took her hand, and led her on, and
                            somehow it did me good.
At intervals, the funeral hymn, which they sing on the road to the grave,
                            fell solemnly on our ears. Some one from time to time gave out the words
                            of a verse and then it was sung to a simple impressive tune. That
                            ancient hymn, which has drowned so many sobs, I did not hear, but felt
                            it.
We arrived at Vaughan St. Mary late in the afternoon of the second day.
                            The whole of the journey was to me a long and tearful dream. Mr.
                            Huxtable came with us. He had never before been further from home than
                            Exeter; and his single visit to that city had formed the landmark of his
                            life. He never tried to comfort me as the others did. The ignorant man
                            knew better.
Alone I sat by my father's grave, with my mother's ready before my feet.
                            They had cast the mould on the other side, so as not to move my father's
                            coverlet. The poor old pensioner had been true to her promise, and man's
                            last garden was blooming like his first flower-bed.
My mind (if any I had) seemed to have undergone some change. Defiance,
                            and pride, and savage delight in misery, were entirely gone; and
                            depression had taken the place of dejection. Death now seemed to me the
                            usual and proper condition of things, and I felt it an impertinence that
                            I should still be alive. So I waited, with heavy composure, till she
                            should be brought, who so often had walked there with me. At length she
                            was coming for good and all, and a space was left for me. But I must not
                            repose there yet; I had still my task before me.
The bell was tolling faster, and the shadows growing longer, and the
                            children who had been playing at hide-and-seek, where soon themselves
                            shall be sought in vain, had flitted away from sight, perhaps scared at
                            my presence, perhaps gone home to tea, to enjoy the funeral afterwards.
                            The evening wind had ceased from troubling the yews, and the short-lived
                            songs of the birds were done. The place was as sad as I could wish. The
                            smell of new earth inspired, as it always does, some unsearchable
                            everlasting sympathy between the material and the creature.
The sun was setting behind me: suddenly a shadow eclipsed my own upon the
                            red loam across the open grave. Without a start, and dreamily (as I did
                            all things now), I turned to see whence it came. Within a yard of me
                            stood Mr. Edgar Vaughan. In a moment the old feeling was at my heart,
                            and my wits were all awake.
I observed that he was paler than when I had seen him last, and the rigid
                            look was wavering on his face, like steel reflected by water. He lifted
                            his hat to me. I neither rose nor spoke, but turned and watched him.
"Clara," he said in a low, earnest voice, "I see you are still the same.
                            Will no depth of grief, no length of time, no visitation from Him who is
                            over us all, ever bend your adamant and implacable will?"
I heard, with some surprise, his allusion to the Great Being, whom he was
                            not wont to recognise; but I made him no reply.
"Very well," he resumed, with the ancient chill hardening over his
                            features; "so then let it be. I am not come to offer you condolence,
                            which you would despise; nor do I mean to be present when you would
                            account the sight of me an insult. And yet I loved your mother, Clara; I
                            loved her very truly."
This he said with such emotion, that a new thought broke upon me.
Quick as the thought, he asked, "Would you know who killed your
                            father?"
"And my mother, too," I answered, "whose coffin I see coming."
The funeral turned the corner of the lane, and the dust rose from the
                            bearers' feet. He took his hat off, and the perspiration stood upon his
                            forehead. Betwixt suspense and terror, and the wildness of grief, I was
                            obliged to lean on the headstone for support, and a giddiness came over
                            me. When I raised my eyes again, there was no one near me. In vain I
                            wiped them hurriedly and looked again. Mr. Vaughan was gone; but on the
                            grass at my feet lay a folded letter. I seized it quickly, and broke the
                            seal. That moment a white figure appeared between the yew-trees by the
                            porch. It was the aged minister leading my mother the last path of all.
                            The book was in his hand, and his form was tall and stately, and his
                            step so slow, that the white hair fell unruffled, while the grand words
                            on his lips called majesty into his gaze. Thrusting aside the letter, I
                            followed into the Church, and stood behind the old font where I had been
                            baptized; a dark and gloomy nook, fit for such an entrance. She who had
                            carried me there was carried past it now, and the pall waved in the damp
                            cold air, and all the world seemed stone and mould.
But afterwards, on the fair hill-side, while the faint moon gathered
                            power from the deepening sky, and glancing on that hoary brow sealed the
                            immortal promises and smoothed the edges of the grave, around which bent
                            the uncovered heads of many who had mourned before, and after a few
                            bounds of mirth should bend again in mourning, until in earth's fair
                            turn and turn, others should bend and they lie down—beholding this, and
                            feeling something higher than "dust to dust," I grew content to bide my
                            time with the other children of men, and remembered that no wave can
                            break until it reach the shore.
