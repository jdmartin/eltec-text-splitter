CHAPTER III.
When a long and heavy sleep (my first sleep since dear mother's death)
                            had brought me down to the dull plain of life, I read for the first time
                            the letter so strangely delivered. Even then it seemed unkind to my
                            mother that I should think about it. Mr. Vaughan had placed it in a new
                            envelope, which he had sealed with his own ring, the original cover (if
                            any there were) having been removed. The few words, of which it
                            consisted, were written in a clear round hand, upon a sheet of thin
                            tough paper, such as we use for foreign postage, and folded in a
                            peculiar manner. There was nothing remarkable in the writing, except
                            this, that the words as well as the letters were joined. It was as
                            follows:
"The one who slain your brother is at 19 Grove Street London. You will
                            come in danger of it why you know."
No date, no signature, no stops, except as shown above. In short, it was
                            so dark and vague, that I returned to Devonshire, with a resolution to
                            disregard it wholly. When we reached the foot of the hill, at the corner
                            of the narrow lane which leads to Tossil's Barton, and where the white
                            gate stands of which the neighbourhood is so proud, a sudden scream was
                            heard, and a rush made upon us from behind the furze-bush. The farmer
                            received the full brunt of a most vigorous onset, and the number and
                            courage of the enemy making up for their want of size, his strong
                            bastions were almost carried by storm. To the cry of "Daddy! Daddy's
                            come home!" half a dozen urchins and more, without distinction of sex,
                            jumped and tugged and flung and clung around him, with no respect
                            whatever for his Sunday coat, or brass-buttoned gaiters. Taking
                            advantage of his laughing, they pulled his legs this way and that, as if
                            he were skating for the first time, and little Sally (his favourite)
                            swarming up, made a base foot-rope of the great ancestral silver
                            watch-chain whose mysterious awe sometimes sufficed to keep her eyes
                            half open in church. Betwixt delight and shame, the poor father was so
                            dreadfully taken aback, that he could not tell what to do, till fatherly
                            love suggested the only escape. He lifted them one by one to his lips,
                            and after some hearty smacks sent all (except the baby) sliding down his
                            back.
While all this was going forward, the good dame, with a clean apron on,
                            kept herself in the background, curtseying and trying to look sad at me,
                            but too much carried away to succeed. Her plump cheeks left but little
                            room for tears, yet I thought one tried to find a road from either eye.
                            When the burst was nearly done, she felt (like a true woman) for me so
                            lonely in all this love, though I could not help enjoying it; and so she
                            tried to laugh at it.
For a long time after this, the farmer was admired and consulted by all
                            the neighbouring parishes, as a man who had seen the world. His
                            labourers, also, one man and a boy, for a fortnight called him "Sir," a
                            great discomfort to him; more than this, some letters were brought for
                            him to interpret, and Beany Dawe became unduly jealous. But in this, as
                            in most other matters, things came to their level, and when it was
                            slowly discovered that the farmer was just the same, his neighbours
                            showed much disappointment, and even some contempt.
It was not long before the thought of that letter, which had been laid by
                            so scornfully, began to work within me. Again and again, as time wore
                            on, and the deep barb of sorrow darkly rusted away, it came home to me
                            as a sin, that I was neglecting a special guidance. Moreover, my reason
                            for staying in Devonshire was gone, and as my spirit recovered its tone,
                            it could not put up with inaction.
Three months after our return, one breezy afternoon in August, when the
                            heath had long succeeded the gorse and broom upon the cleve, and the
                            children were searching for "wuts" and half-kerneled nuts, I sat on a
                            fallen tree, where a break in the copse made a frame for one of our
                            favourite views. Of late I had been trying to take some sketches in
                            water-colours of what my mother and I had so often admired together, and
                            this had been kept for the last. Wild as the scheme may appear to all
                            who know the world and its high contempt for woman's skill, I had some
                            hope of earning money in London by the pencil, and was doing my utmost
                            to advance in art. Also, I wished to take away with me some memorials of
                            a time comparatively happy.
Little Sally Huxtable, a dear little child, now my chief companion, had
                            strayed into the wood to string more strawberry beads on her spike of
                            grass, for the wood strawberries here last almost to the equinox; and I
                            had just roughed in my outline, and was correcting the bold strokes, by
                            nature's soft gradations; when suddenly through a cobnut bush, and down
                            the steep bank at my side, came, in a sliding canter, a magnificent red
                            deer. He passed so close before me, with antlers, like a varnished
                            crabstick, russet in the sun, that I could have touched his brown flank
                            with my pencil. Being in no hurry or fright whatever, he regarded me
                            from his large deep eyes with a look of courteous interest, a dignified
                            curiosity too well bred for words; and then, as if with an evening of
                            pleasant business before him, trotted away through the podded wild broom
                            on the left.
Before I had time to call him back, which, with a childish impulse, I was
                            about to do, the nutbush where he had entered moved again, and, laughing
                            at his own predicament on the steep descent, a young man leaped and
                            landed in the bramble at my feet. Before me stood the one whom we had so
                            often longed to thank. But at sight of me, his countenance changed
                            entirely. The face, so playful just before, suddenly grew dark and sad,
                            and, with a distant salutation, he was hurrying away, when I sprang
                            forward and caught him by the hand. Every nerve in my body thrilled, as
                            I felt the grasp that had saved my mother and me.
"Excuse me," he said coldly, "I will lose my prey."
But I would not let him go so curtly. What I said I cannot tell, only
                            that it was very foolish, and clumsy, and cold by the side of what I
                            felt. Whom but God and him had I to thank for my mother's peaceful end,
                            and all her treasured words, each worth a dozen lives of mine? He
                            answered not at all, nor looked at me; but listened with a cold
                            constraint, and, as I thought, contemptuous pity, at which my pride
                            began to take alarm.
"Sir," I exclaimed, when still he answered not, "Sir, I will detain you
                            no longer from murdering that poor stag."
He answered very haughtily, "I am not of the Devonshire hunters, who toil
                            to exterminate this noble race."
As he spoke he pointed down the valley, where the red deer, my late
                            friend, was crossing, for his evening browse, to a gnoll of juicy grass.
                            Then why was he pursuing him, and why did he call him his prey? The
                            latter, probably a pretext to escape me, but the former question I could
                            not answer, and did not choose to ask. He went his way, and I felt
                            discharged of half my obligation.
