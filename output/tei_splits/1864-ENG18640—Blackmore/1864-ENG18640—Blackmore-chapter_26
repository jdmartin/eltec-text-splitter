CHAPTER VIII.
Ann Maples had done her best to persuade me to call on my godmother, Lady
                            Cranberry, but I was quite resolved to do nothing of the sort. In the
                            first place, Lady Cranberry was a person of great wealth, living in a
                            very large house, and keeping up such state as gay widows love, who have
                            forgotten old affections and are looking out for new. In me, therefore,
                            to whose fixed estimate fidelity seemed the very pith of honour, there
                            could be no love towards such a changeling. And even if I had liked her,
                            my circumstances would not admit of our visiting upon equal terms, and
                            it was not likely that I would endure to be patronized by any one. In
                            the second place, the same most amiable lady had written letters of
                            beautiful condolence, and taken a tender interest in our change of
                            fortune, so long as there was any novelty in it; but soon flagged off,
                            and had not even replied to my announcement of dearest mother's death.
                            Finally, I hated her without any compromise, from what I had seen of
                            her, and what she had done to me at Vaughan Park.
So my good Ann set off all alone, for she hoped to obtain some
                            recommendation there, and I was left to receive Mrs. Shelfer's morning
                            visit.
Her queer episodical conversation, and strange biographies of every
                            table, chair, and cushion—her "sticks," as she delighted to call them—I
                            shall not try to repeat, for my history is not a comic one; neither will
                            she appear, unless the connexion requires it. One vein of sympathy
                            between us was opened at once, by her coming into the room with a lame
                            blackbird on her finger; and I was quite surprised at the number of her
                            pets. As for the "splendid apartments," they were two little rooms on
                            the first floor, adjoining one another, and forming, together with the
                            landing outside and a coal-closet, the entirety of that storey. The
                            rooms above were occupied by a young dress-maker. Mr. and Mrs. Shelfer,
                            who had no children kept the ground-floor (consisting of a parlour and
                            kitchen) and the two attics, one of which was always full of onions and
                            carrot seed. Upon the whole, though the "sticks" were very old, and not
                            over clean, until I scoured them, and the drawing-room (as my landlady
                            loved to call it) was low and small, and looked through the rails of a
                            narrow balcony upon a cheese-monger's shop across the road (instead of a
                            wooded dingle), I was very well satisfied with them; and above all the
                            rent was within my means.
In the afternoon, when things were growing tidy, a carriage drove up
                            rapidly, and a violent ringing of the bell ensued. It was Lady
                            Cranberry, who, under the pretext of bringing Ann Maples home, was come
                            to gratify her own sweet curiosity. She ran upstairs in her most
                            charming manner, caught me by both hands, and would have kissed me
                            desperately, if I had shown any tendency that way. Then she stopped to
                            admire me.
"Oh, you lovely creature! How you are grown to be sure! I should never
                            have known you. How delicious all this is!"
Of course I was pleased with her admiration; but only for a moment,
                            because I disliked her.
"I am glad you find it delicious," I replied quite coldly; "perhaps I
                            shall by-and-by."
"What would I give to be entering life under such sweetly romantic
                            circumstances? Dear me! I must introduce you. What a sensation you will
                            cause! With such a face and figure and such a delightful story, we shall
                            all rave about you. And how well you are dressed from that outlandish
                            place! What a piece of luck! It's the greatest marvel on earth that you
                            found me in London now."
"Excuse me," I said, "I neither found, nor meant to find you."
"Oh, of course you are cross with me. I forgot about that. But who made
                            your dress, in the name of all woodland graces?"
"I always make my own dresses."
"Then you shall make mine. Say no more about it. You shall live with me,
                            and make my dresses by day; and by night you shall go with me
                            everywhere, and I won't be jealous. I will introduce you everywhere.
                            'This is my ward, Miss Vaughan, whose father—ah, I see, you know that
                            romantic occurrence in Gloucestershire.' Do you think it will be a
                            your—and the Great Exhibition season—before you are mistress of a
                            property ten times the size of Vaughan Park? If you doubt it, look in
                            the glass. Ah me! You know nothing of the world, I forget, I am so
                            warm-hearted. But you may take my word for it. Will you cry a
                            bargain?"
She held out her hand, as she had seen the fast men do, whose society she
                            affected. I noticed it not, but led her on; my fury had long been
                            gathering. I almost choked when she spoke in that way of my father,
                            utterly as I despised her. But I made it a trial of self-control, which
                            might be demanded against more worthy objects.
"Are you sure that I shall be useful? Sure that I shall earn my
                            board?"
"Oh, you Vaughans are always so conscientious. I want an eider-down
                            petticoat quilted at once for the winter, and I dare not trust it to
                            Biggs, I know she will pucker it so. That shall be the first little job
                            for my Clara."
Her cup was full. She had used dearest mother's fond appellative, and, as
                            I thought, in mockery. I did not lower myself by any sarcastic language.
                            She would not have understood it. I merely opened the door, and said
                            calmly to my landlady, who was there, of course "promiscuously;" "Mrs.
                            Shelfer, show out the Countess of Cranberry."
Poor godmother, she was so frightened that I was sorry for her. They
                            helped her into the carriage, and she had just strength to draw down the
                            blinds.
Mrs. Shelfer had been in raptures at having so grand a vehicle and two
                            great footmen at her door. Lest the street should lose the effect, she
                            had run in and out a dozen times, and banged the door, and got into talk
                            with the coachman, and sent for beer to the Inn, though she had it in
                            the house. She now came again to my door, in what she called a "terrible
                            quandary." I could not attend to her, but locked myself in, and wrestled
                            with my passionate nature, at one time indulging, then spurning and
                            freezing it. Yet I could not master it, as I fancied I had done.
