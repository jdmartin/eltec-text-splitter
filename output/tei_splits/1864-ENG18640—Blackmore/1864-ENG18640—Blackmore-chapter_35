CHAPTER XVII.
Late in the evening of that same day, I sat in my room by the firelight
                            only (for I could not work) and tried to look into myself, and find out
                            the cause of my strange attraction or rather impulsion towards Isola.
                            Somehow or other I did not wonder so much that she should be drawn quite
                            as strongly towards me, although an impartial observer would perhaps
                            have wondered far more. Alter puzzling myself in vain with this inquiry,
                            my thoughts began to move, in their usual gloomy train.
Eight years had now elapsed, and what had I discovered? Nothing; but at
                            long dark intervals some impress of the deed itself, more than of the
                            doer. Had I halted in pursuit, or had my vengeance cooled? To the former
                            question my conscience answered "yes," to the latter "no." Gentle
                            influences had been shed around me, sorrow had bedewed the track of
                            hate, intercourse with happy harmless people, and gratitude for
                            unmerited kindness; it was not in human nature, however finely
                            constitute for evil, entirely to repulse these powers.
I could not deny, that the religion of my heart, during the last
                            twelvemonth, had been somewhat neglected. For my devotion to dear
                            mother, no plea was required. But the time since that, what business had
                            I with laughing children, and snug firesides, with dickybirds, and Sandy
                            the squirrel? Even sweet Isola caused me a pang of remorse; but no, I
                            could not quite abandon her. But now, thank God, I was in the right road
                            again, and plodding resolutely as my father could expect. To his spirit,
                            ever present with me, I knelt down and poured out my remorse; and swore
                            to make amends, whatever it might cost me. Yet even then, a gentle
                            shadow seemed to come as well, and whisper the words that calmed the
                            face of death.
My musings, if so mild a word may suit them, were roughly interrupted by
                            a loud step on the stairs. Inspector Cutting, who could walk when
                            needful like a cat, loved to redress this injury to the Goddess Echo, by
                            making double noise when not on business. Farmer Huxtable, a man of
                            twice the weight, would have come up those stairs at half the expense in
                            sound.
When he entered the room, he found himself in a semi-official state
                            again, and I saw that he was not come for nothing. In a few brief words,
                            he told me what he had done, which was not very much; or perhaps my
                            suspicion was right, that he only told me a part of it. Then he said
                            abruptly,
"Miss Valence, I know pluck when I see it."
"What do you mean, Mr. Cutting?"
"Excuse me, I forgot that you have been reared in the country. What I
                            mean is, that I believe you possess an unusual share of courage."
"As to that, I cannot say, having never been severely tried; but in such
                            a cause as mine, I could go through a good deal."
"And not lose your presence of mind, even in real danger?"
"That again I cannot say, and for the same reason. But I am quite ready
                            to make the trial."
I felt the colour mounting in my cheeks. How glad I should be to prove to
                            myself that I was not ignoble. He observed me closely, and appeared
                            quite satisfied.
"What I have to propose to you, is attended with no little danger."
"I will do my utmost not to be afraid. I am more impulsive perhaps than
                            brave, but what is life worth to me? I will try to think of that all the
                            time. No doubt you have a good reason for exposing me to danger."
"Certainly I have, Miss Valence. For your own purpose it is most
                            important that you should be able to identify certain persons, whom I
                            shall show you to-night; that is, unless I am misinformed."
"To-night! so late as this?" And I began to tremble already.
"Yes, we must go to-night, or wait for another fortnight; and then it
                            would be no earlier, even if we got such a chance again. And for your
                            sake it is better than to be in a fright for a fortnight."
"Inspector Cutting, I am in no fright whatever. At least I mean no more
                            so than any other girl would be, who felt a vague danger impending. I
                            hope and trust that my father's memory and the justice of God will be
                            with me."
"Young lady, I see that I may safely venture it. If you had boasted, I
                            should have hesitated, though I have had some proof already of your
                            determination. The chief, and indeed the only danger, is lest you lose
                            your presence of mind, and that most females would do, if placed as you
                            will be. Now I wish you to make deliberate choice, and not to be carried
                            away by impulse vindictiveness, or the love of adventure; which, when
                            the spirit is high like yours, too often leads young females into
                            trouble, from which it is not always possible even for the most capable
                            members of the force to extricate them."
"Of course I know all that. How much longer are we to talk? Must I
                            disguise myself? When am I to be ready? And where are we going?"
"Now you are growing impatient. That is not a good sign. Remember, I can
                            easily procure another witness; but for your own sake I wish to give you
                            the chance. Probably you will see to-night the man who killed your
                            father."
As he spoke my flesh was creeping, and my blood ran cold, then suddenly
                            flushed through my system like electric fluid. He began again as coolly
                            as if he were reporting a case of some one discovered "drunk and
                            incapable." From force of habit, he touched his forehead, and stood at
                            attention, as he spoke. "In consequence of information which I have
                            received, I have been induced to make certain inquiries, which have
                            resulted in the conviction that the criminal I am in search of will be
                            present at a certain place this night, at a certain hour. It is
                            therefore my intention to embrace the opportunity ofâ€”"
"Catching him!" cried I in a breathless hurry.
"To embrace the opportunity," continued the Inspector, like a talking
                            oak, "of conducting my investigations personally, and in the presence of
                            a witness. The effect thereby produced upon my mind shall be entered
                            duly, the moral effect I should have said, and the cause of justice will
                            be promoted as rapidly as is consistent with the principles of our
                            glorious constitution."
"Do you mean to say that you will let him go?"
"No, I shall not let him go, Miss Valence, for the simple reason that I
                            shall not apprehend him. I see that you are inclined to take the law
                            into your own hands. That will never do for me."
"Oh no, I am not. A year ago I would have done so. But I am older and
                            wiser now."
I was thinking of dear mother; and began to feel already that my
                            character was changing.
