CHAPTER III.
Low fever followed the long prostration to which the fear of outer
                            darkness had reduced my jaded nerves. This fever probably redeemed my
                            sight, by generalizing the local inflammation, to which object the
                            doctor's efforts had been directed. Tossing on my weary bed, without a
                            glimpse of anything, how I longed for the soft caresses and cool lips of
                            Isola! But since that one visit, she had been sternly excluded. The
                            Professor had no chance of delivering his therapeutic lecture. In fact
                            he did not come. "Once for all," said Dr. Franks, when he heard of that
                            proposal, "choose, Miss Valence, between my services, and the maundering
                            of some pansophist. If you prefer the former, I will do my utmost, and
                            can almost promise you success; but I must and will be obeyed. None
                            shall enter your room, except Mrs. Shelfer and myself. As to your lovely
                            friend, of whom Mrs. Shelfer is so full, if she truly loves you, she
                            will keep away. She has done you already more harm than I can undo in a
                            week. I am deeply interested in this case, and feel for you sincerely;
                            but unless you promise me to see—I mean to receive—no one without my
                            permission, I will come no more."
It sounded very hard, but I felt that he was right.
"No crying, my dear child, no crying! Dear me, I have heard so much of
                            your courage. Too much inflammation already. Whatever you do, you must
                            not cry. That is one reason why I will not have your friend here. When
                            two young ladies get together in trouble, I know by my own daughters
                            what they do. You may laugh as much as you like, in a quiet way; and I
                            am sure Mrs. Shelfer can make any one laugh, under almost any
                            circumstances. Can't you now?"
"To be sure, my good friend, I have seen such a many rogues. That is,
                            when I know Charley's a-coming home."
"Now good bye, Miss Valence. But I would recommend you not to play with
                            your paints so. There is an effluvium from them."
"Oh, what can I do, what am I to do to pass the endless night? I was only
                            trying to build a house in the dark."
"Sleep as much as you can. I am giving you gentle opiates. When you can
                            sleep no longer, let Mrs. Shelfer talk or read to you, and have a little
                            music. I will lend you my musical box, which plays twenty-four tunes:
                            have it in the next room, not to be too loud. And then play on the
                            musical glasses, not too long at a time: you will soon find out how to
                            do that in the dark."
He most kindly sent us both the boxes that very day; and many a weary
                            hour they lightened of its load. Poor Isola came every day to inquire,
                            and several times she had her brother with her. She made an entire
                            conquest of Mrs. Shelfer, who even gave her a choice canary bird. I was
                            never tired of hearing the little woman's description of her beauty, and
                            her visit to the kitchen formed the chief event of the day. Mrs. Shelfer
                            (who had Irish blood in her veins) used to declare that the ground was
                            not good enough for them to walk on.
"Such a pair, Miss! To see her so light, and soft, and loving, tripping
                            along, and such eyes and such fur; and him walking so straight, and
                            brave, and noble. I am sure you'd go a mile, Miss, to see him walk."
"You forget, Mrs. Shelfer, I may never enjoy that pleasure."
"No, no. Quite true, my good friend. But then we may, all the same."
Exactly so. There lay all the difference to me, but none to any other.
                            This set me moralising in my shallow way, a thing by no means natural to
                            me, who was so concentrated and subjective. But loss of sight had done
                            me good, had turned the mind's eye inward into the darkness of myself. I
                            think the blind, as a general rule, are less narrow-minded than those
                            endowed with sight. Less inclined, I mean, to judge their neighbours
                            harshly, less arrogant in exacting that every pulse keep time with their
                            own. If eyes are but the chinks through which we focus on our brain
                            censoriousness and bigotry, if rays of light are shafts and lances of
                            ill will; then better is it to have no crystalline lens. Far better to
                            be blind, than print the world-distorted puppets of myself. I, that
                            smallest speck of dust, blown upon the shore of time, blown off when my
                            puff shall come; a speck ignored by moon and stars; too small (however
                            my ambition leap) for earth to itch, whate'er I suck; and yet a speck
                            that is a mountain in the telescope of God; shall I never learn that His
                            is my only magnitude; shall I wriggle to be all in all to my own
                            corpuscle?
