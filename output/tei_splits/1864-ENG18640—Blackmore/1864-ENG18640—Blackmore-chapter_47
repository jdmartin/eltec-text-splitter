CHAPTER XI.
Beloved Giudice remained many days under my care, until he became
                            convinced that he was my dog absolutely, and had no claim on any other
                            human being. He more than paid for his board and medical attendance, by
                            sitting repeatedly for his portrait; in which at last I succeeded to his
                            and my own satisfaction. Though by no means a conceited dog, there was
                            nothing he loved better than having his likeness taken; and directly
                            after breakfast he always assumed the most becoming attitude, and
                            watched intently for the appearance of the pencil with his massive head
                            a little on one side, and his dark brown eyes full of dignified
                            interest, and his great ears curving down through russet tufts, like
                            tawny cascades in autumn, he seemed fit study for a real artist, who
                            should quicken as well as copy him. However, he was too much of a
                            gentleman to sneer at my weak efforts, for he saw that I did my best.
                            Oftentimes he would gaze steadfastly at the portrait and then at me, and
                            hobble up, and nudge me, and whine, a little, and then sigh in
                            self-abasement at his want of speech. Whenever he did this, I knew that
                            he wished to have something altered; but it was long before I could
                            discover what that something was. I tried every change of line or colour
                            that I could think of—all to no purpose. At length it struck me that as
                            he criticised more with nose than eyes, the defect must be in the smell.
                            Happy idea! I satisfied my Giudice at last, and did it thus. After
                            shading around the nose and mouth, before laying on the colour, I took a
                            clean dry brush, and passed it lightly round the hollows of his own
                            sweet saltish nostrils, carefully avoiding the cut; then one turn of the
                            brush, not on the palette, but on a dry square of colour, and with that
                            I expressed the dear dog's nose so well, that he would have spoiled it
                            in a sniffing ecstasy, if I had not pulled it away. His portrait now
                            possessed the life which he required.
Meanwhile I received almost daily visits from Isola and her brother; the
                            latter was, of course, very anxious about his poor dog, and could only
                            relieve that anxiety by long interviews with him. It happened strangely
                            enough, yet more and more often as time went on, that Isola during these
                            interviews felt an especial desire for Mrs. Shelfer's society, which she
                            could only enjoy by betaking herself to the kitchen. There, with all the
                            pets, except old Tom, who was constancy itself, and the lame blackbird
                            who was all gratitude, her influence began to supersede mine, and even
                            Mrs. Shelfer's; for this I cared but little, so long as Giudice kept to
                            me.
Over that great dog, as he turned upon his side, and lifted one hind leg
                            (the canine mode of showing submission to the will of God), over him we
                            bent, Conrad and I, in most interesting diagnosis, until it seemed the
                            proper thing that our hair should flow together, and our breath make one
                            soft breeze. From this position we would rise with a conscious colour in
                            our cheeks, and a flutter at the heart, and a certain awe of one
                            another. Then it would be ever so long before either of us dared to seek
                            the other's eyes. Haply when those eyes were met—unwitting yet
                            inevitably—they would drop, or turn away, or find some new attraction in
                            the dog or clouds.
Then some weak remark would follow, for which the hearer cared no whit,
                            yet feigned deep interest therein.
Why labour thus to cheat ourselves—each other we cannot cheat—why feel we
                            so confused and guilty, why long so heartily to be a hundred leagues
                            away, yet knowing thoroughly that, if it were so, all the space between
                            were void and heartache? The reason neither we nor other mortal knows;
                            the cause is this, that we love one another.
I have felt that it must be so, at least on my part, ever since the day
                            he came with Isola, and knew me not, though I knew him so well. Does he
                            know me now as the Clara Vaughan whom he once avoided? These eyelashes
                            are as long and dark as ever; the large eyes, shaded by them, are as
                            deep a gray as twilight in a grove of willows. My cheeks have regained
                            their curve, my hair was never injured; let me hie to the glass now he
                            is gone, and see if I be like myself, and whether I have face and form
                            likely to win Conrad's love.
No, I am not like myself. No wonder he does not know me. The gloom
                            habitual to my face is gone. It is the difference betwixt a cavern well
                            and a sunny fountain. I see a laughing graceful girl, with high birth
                            marked in every vein, and self-respect in every motion; her clear cheeks
                            glowing with soft wonder, her red lips parted with delight, her arching
                            neck and shoulder curve gleaming through a night of tresses, her
                            forehead calm and thoughtful still, half-belying the bright eyes where
                            love and pleasure sparkle. For a moment self-approval heightens the
                            expression. At my silly self my foolish self is smiling; but the smile
                            has warmer source than maiden's light conceit. I smile because I see
                            that, as regards exterior, he who slights me must be hard to please; and
                            some one, whom I think of, is not hard to please. Straight upon the
                            thought of him—Ah well.
My father used to quote from the "Hero and Leander" a beautiful verse,
                            which neither he nor any other could in English render duly,
[Greek: Aidoûs hyròn éreuphos apostazousa prosôpou.]—v. 173.
 "Showering from her cheek the flowing carmine of her
                            shame."
