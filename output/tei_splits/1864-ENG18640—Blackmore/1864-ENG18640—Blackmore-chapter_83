CHAPTER XI.
At the door we found Mrs. Fletcher just returned from Lady Cranberry's,
                            and eager to say a great deal which could not now be listened to. Having
                            proved the speed of our horse, I begged the cabman to wait for a quarter
                            of an hour, and then take us to Paddington at any fare he pleased, so
                            long as he drove full gallop. This suited his views very nicely, and
                            knowing Mr. Shelfer, as every one in London does—so at least I am forced
                            to believe—he fain would have kept me ten minutes of the fifteen, to
                            tell of Charley's knowingness, how he had kept it all dark as could be,
                            you see, Miss, and had won three hundred and twenty-five pounds, without
                            reckoning the odd money, Miss—
"Reckon it then, Mr. Cabman," and I ran upstairs full speed, after
                            telling Mrs. Shelfer the sum, lest she should be cheated.
In five minutes I was ready, and came out of my bedroom into the
                            sitting-room, with my hat in one hand, and a little bag in the other;
                            and there, instead of Mrs. Fletcher, I found, whom?—Conrad!
Very pale and ill he looked, so unlike himself that I was shocked, and
                            instead of leaping to him, fell upon a chair. He mistook me, and
                            approached very slowly, but with his dear old smile: how my heart beat,
                            how I longed to be in his arms; but they looked too weak to hold me.
"Oh, Miss Vaughan, I know everything. Will you ever forgive me?"
"Never, my own darling, while you call me that. Forgive you indeed! Can I
                            ever forgive myself, for the evil I have thought of you? How very ill
                            you look! Come and let me kiss you well."
But instead of my doing that, he had to do it for me; for I was quite
                            beaten at last, and fainted away in his arms. By this folly five minutes
                            were lost; and I had so much to say to him, and more to think of than
                            twenty such heads could hold. But he seemed to think that it must be all
                            right, so long as he had me there.
"Oh, Conny," I said through my tears at last, "my own pet Conny, come
                            with me. Your father is in such danger."
"Life of my heart, I will follow you by the very next train. This one I
                            cannot go by."
I could wait for no explanation, and he seemed inclined to give none.
                            Perhaps this was the reason that he spent all the time in kissing me;
                            which, much as I enjoyed it, would have done quite as well at leisure.
                            Be that as it may, there was no time to talk about it; he said it did
                            his lips good, and I believe it did, they were so pale at first, and now
                            so fine a red. Suddenly in the midst of it, a great voice was heard from
                            the passage:
"Why now, what ever be us to do with the chillers?"
Out I ran, with my hair down as usual, and a great flush in my cheeks,
                            but I did not let any one see me.
"Leave them here, to be sure, leave them here, Mr. Huxtable. They shall
                            have my rooms; and in all London they would not find such a hostess as
                            Mrs. Shelfer."
There was no time to consider it. The throat of hurry is large, and gulps
                            almost any suggestion. Away we went full gallop; the farmer was on the
                            box,—how the driver found room I can't say,—Mrs. Fletcher and I inside,
                            all consulting her watch every minute. Across the Regent's Park,
                            scattering the tame wild ducks, past Marylebone Church, and the
                            Yorkshire Stingo, and Edgware Road—we saved it by just two minutes.
                            Although I had taken his ticket, the farmer would not come with us, but
                            went in a second-class carriage.
"They blue featherbeds trimmed with pig's tails, is too good for the
                            likes of I, Miss Clara; and I should be afeared all the wai that the
                            Missus was rating of me for my leg-room. I paid parlour price coming up,
                            and went in the kitchen waggons, because it zim'd only fair, as I takes
                            such a dale of room."
I knew that none ever could turn him from what he considered just, and
                            therefore allowed him to ride where he pleased. But a dozen times I
                            thought we should have lost him on the way; for at every station, where
                            the train stopped, he made a point of coming to our window, which he had
                            marked with a piece of chalk, and "humbly axing our pardon, but was we
                            all right and no fire? He couldn't think what they wanted, not he, with
                            tempting God Almighty fast." Not fast enough for me, I told him every
                            time; whereupon he put on his hat with a sigh, and said he supposed I
                            was born to it. And yet all the time he seemed to consider that he was
                            protecting me somehow, and once he called me his dearie, to the great
                            surprise of the other passengers, and the horror of Mrs. Fletcher;
                            seeing which he repented hastily, and "Miss Vaughan'd" me three times in
                            a sentence, with a hot flush on his forehead. At Swindon, where we
                            changed carriages, he pulled out very mysteriously from an inner
                            breast-pocket a little sack tied with whipcord, and in which, I do
                            believe, the simple soul had deposited all his hard-earned prize-money.
                            Then he led us to the counter, proud to show that he had been there
                            before, and earnestly begged for the honour of treating us to a drop of
                            somewhat. His countenance fell so on my refusal, that I was fain to
                            cancel it, and to drink at his expense a glass of iced sherry and water;
                            while Mrs. Fletcher, with much persuasion and simpering, and for the
                            sake of her poor inside, that had been so long her enemy, ventured on a
                            "wee wee thimbleful of Cognac." The farmer himself, much abashed at the
                            splendour around him, which he told me, in a whisper, beat Pewter Will's
                            out and out, and even the "Fortescue Arms," would not call for anything,
                            until I insisted upon it; being hard pressed he asked at last, hoping no
                            offence of the lady, for a pint of second cider. The young woman turned
                            up her nose, but I soon made her turn it down again, and fetch him, as
                            the nearest thing, a bottle of sparkling perry.
As always happens, when one is in a great hurry, the train was an hour
                            behind its time, and the setting sun was casting gold upon the old
                            cathedral—to my mind one of the lightest and grandest buildings in
                            England, though the farmer prefers that squat and heavy Norman thing at
                            Exeter—when we glided smoothly and swiftly into the Gloucester Station.
                            I fully intended to have sent an electric message from London, not for
                            the sake of the carriage, which mattered nothing, but to warn my dear
                            uncle; at Paddington, however, we found no time to do it, and so stupid
                            I was that I never once thought of telegraphing from Swindon. To make up
                            by over alacrity, in a case of far less importance, I went to the office
                            at Gloucester, and sent this message to Tiverton, then the nearest
                            Station to Exmoor—"Farmer has won, and got the money. Clara Vaughan to
                            Mrs. Huxtable." The amazement of the farmer, I cannot stop to
                            describe.
No time was lost by doing this, for I had ordered a pair of horses, and
                            they were being put to. Then, stimulating the driver, we dashed off for
                            Vaughan St. Mary. Anxious as I was, and wretched at the thought of what
                            we might find, so exhausted was my frame by the thaumatrope of the last
                            six-and-thirty hours, that I fell fast asleep, and woke not until we
                            came to the lodge. Old Whitehead came out, hat in hand, and whispered
                            something into Mrs. Fletcher's ear. That good old lady had been worrying
                            me dreadfully about her jams, for the weather was so hot, she was sure
                            all the fruit would be over, etc., none of which could I listen to
                            now. As Whitehead spoke, I saw through my half-open lashes that she
                            started violently; but she would not tell me what it was, and I did not
                            want to intrude on secrets that might be between them. The farmer also
                            diverted attention by calling from the box, as we wound into the avenue,
                            "Dear heart alaive; this bate all the sojers as ever I see, Miss Clara,
                            or even the melisher to Coom. Why, arl thiccy treeses must a growed so a
                            puppose, just over again one another, and arl of a bigness too. Wull,
                            wull! Coachman, was ever you to Davonsheer?"
I do believe those men of Devon see nothing they admire, without thinking
                            at once of their county.
At the front door, the butler met us, which surprised me rather, as being
                            below his dignity. He was a trusty old servant, who had been under
                            Thomas Henwood, and had come back to his place since the general
                            turn-out of the household. Now he looked very grave and sad, and instead
                            of leading me on, drew me aside in the hall. It was getting dark, and
                            the fire in the west was dying. Great plumes of asparagus—shame it was
                            to cut them—waved under the ancient mantel-piece.
"Bad news it is, Miss Clara"—they all seemed to call me that—"very bad
                            news indeed, Miss. But I hope you was prepared for it."
"What do you mean?"
"Why, haven't you heard about poor master's death?"
"Dead, my dear uncle dead! Do you mean to say"—I could not finish the
                            sentence.
"No, Miss, only to-day, and not as you thinks; no fit at all, nor
                            paralyatic stroke. He went off quiet as a lamb, as near as could be
                            three o'clock. He was very poorly before; but he had a deal to do, and
                            would not give in on no account. He was sitting by himself in the study
                            after breakfast, and at last he rang the bell, and told them to send me
                            up. When I went in, he was bolt upright in his chair, with a beautiful
                            smile on his face, but so pale, white I ought to say, Miss, and so weak
                            he could hardly move. 'John,' he says, 'Yes, Sir,' says I; 'John,' he
                            says again, 'you are a most respectable man, and I can trust you with
                            anything in the world, John. Take this letter for Miss Vaughan, and put
                            it with your own hands into her own, directly the moment she comes back.
                            I am rather uneasy about the poor girl,' he says, as it were to himself.
                            'Which Miss Vaughan, Sir?' says I. 'Your mistress, John. Can't you see
                            what is written on it? And now help me upstairs; and if ever I spoke to
                            you harshly, John Hoxton, I ask your pardon for it. You will find as I
                            haven't forgotten you.' And with that I helped him upstairs, Miss, and I
                            had almost to carry him; and then he says, 'Help me to bed, John. I
                            would like to die in my bed, and it will save some trouble. And let me
                            look out of the window; what a lovely day it is, it reminds me quite of
                            the South. So I set him up in the bed, Miss, handy altogether, and
                            beautiful, and he could see two larks on the lawn, and he asked me what
                            they was. Then he says, 'Thank you, John, you have done it wonderful
                            well, and I hope they won't speak evil of me round this place, after I
                            am gone. I have tried to do my duty, John, as between man and man:
                            though I would be softer with them, if I had my time over again. Now
                            send my daughter to me, though I wish I had seen my son, John. But I
                            ought to be very thankful, and what's more, I am. All of you likes Miss
                            Lily, unless they tell me stories, John.' 'Sir,' says I, 'we wusships
                            her, though not like our own Miss Vaughan.'"
Ah, John Hoxton, did you say that to him, I wonder, or interpolate, ex post facto?
"So he looked very pleased at that, Miss, and he says again, 'John, let
                            all that love her know that she is the living image of her mother. Now
                            go and send her quickly; but John, take care not to frighten my little
                            darling.' So I went and found Miss Lily got along with the Shetland pony
                            and giving it bits of clover, and I sent her up and Jane too, for I was
                            dreadfully frightened, and you away, Miss, at the time. And what come
                            afterwards I can't tell, only no luncheon went up, and there was orders
                            not to ring the bell for the servants' dinner; and I heard poor Miss
                            Lily crying terrible all along the corridor, and I did hear say that his
                            last words was, and he trying to raise his arms toward the window,
                            'Blessed be God, I can see my own Lily,' but she warn't that side of the
                            bed, Miss; so he must have made some mistake."
"No. He meant her mother. Where is my cousin now?"
"In your own room, Miss, lying down, they tell me. She did take on so
                            awful, Jane thought she would have died. But at last she brought her
                            round a little, and persuaded her to lie down. She calls for you, Miss,
                            every time she comes to herself."
I went straightway to the poor little dear, without even stopping to read
                            the letter placed in my hands. The room in which she lay was dark; for
                            Jane, who was watching in my little parlour, whispered to me that the
                            poor child could not bear the lamp-light, her eyes were so weak and
                            sore.
At first Lily did not know me; and it went to my heart, after all my own
                            great sorrows, to hear the sad low moaning. She lay on my own little
                            bed, with her pale face turned to the wall, her thick hair all over her
                            shoulders, and both hands pressed to her heart. Annie Franks had been
                            many times to ask for her, but Lily would not let her come in. Bending
                            over I laid my cheek on Lily's, and softly whispered her name. At last
                            she knew me, and took my hand, and turned her sweet lips to kiss me.
                            Then she sobbed and cried most bitterly; but I saw that it did her good.
                            By and by she said, with her fingers among my hair:
"Oh, Clara, isn't it hard to find him at last, and love him so, and only
                            for three days, and then, and then—"
"And then, my pet, to let him go where his heart has been nearly twenty
                            years. Would you be so selfish as to rob your mother of him? And to go
                            so happy. I am sure he has. Come with me and see."
"Oh no, oh no. I cannot." And her lovely young form trembled, at the
                            thought of visiting death.
"Yes, you can, if you only try, and I am sure that he would wish it. That
                            you and I should kneel hand in hand and bless him, as others shall kneel
                            some day by us. What, Lily afraid of her father! Then I have no fear of
                            my Uncle."
God knows that I spoke so, not from harshness, only in the hope to do her
                            good.
"If you really think he would wish it, dear—"
"Yes. It is a duty I owe him. He would be disappointed in me, if I
                            failed."
"Oh, how he longed to see you once more, dear Clara, But he felt that you
                            were safe, and he said you would come to see him, though he could not
                            see you. He talked of you quite to the last; you and darling Conny."
"Conny will be here to-night."
"No! Oh I am so glad!" and a bright flash of joy shone forth from the
                            eyes that were red with weeping. Something cold pushed quietly in
                            between us, and then gave a sniff and a sigh. It was darling Judy's
                            nose. He had learned in the lower regions, where he always dwelled in my
                            absence, that Miss Clara was come home; and knowing my name as well as
                            his own, he had set off at once in quest of me. After offering me his
                            best love and respects, with the tip of his tongue, as he always did, he
                            looked from one to the other of us, with his eyebrows raised in
                            surprise, and the deepest sorrow and sympathy in his beautiful
                            soft-brown pupils. I declare it made us cry more than ever.
"Oh, Clara," sobbed Lily at length, "he did howl so last night. Do you
                            think he could have known it?"
His eyes dropped, as she was telling me. They always did, when he thought
                            he had been a bad dog.
"Now go down, Judy; good little Judy, go to Mrs. Fletcher. A great friend
                            of mine is with her."
Away he trotted obediently, and his tail recovered its flourish before he
                            had got to the corner.
"Now, darling, let us go there," said the poor child, trembling again. "I
                            would go anywhere with you."
Hand in hand we walked into my Uncle's chamber. Young as I was, and still
                            thoughtless in many ways, twice before now had I gazed on the solemn
                            face of death; but never, not even in my mother's holy countenance, saw
                            I such perfect peace and bliss as dwelt in and seemed to smile from my
                            dearest Uncle's lineaments. The life, in youth puffed here and there by
                            every captious breeze of pride, in its prime becalmed awhile on the
                            halycon deep of love, then tempest-tossed through the lonely dark, and
                            shattered of late by blows from God, that life whose flaw of misanthropy
                            and waste of high abilities had been redeemed, ennobled even, by a pure
                            and perfect love—now it had bidden farewell to all below the clouds,
                            calmly, happily, best of all—in faith.
We knelt beside the bed and prayed—Lily as a Catholic, Clara as a
                            Protestant—that we, and all we loved, might have so blest an end. Then
                            we both sat peacefully, with a happy awe upon us, in the dark recess
                            behind the velvet curtains. Two wax candles were burning on the table
                            towards the door, and by their light the face we loved, looked not wan,
                            but glorious, as with a silver glory.
Clasping each the other's waist, and kissing away each other's tranquil
                            tears, how long we sat there I know not, neither what high fluttering
                            thoughts, thoughts or angels, which be they—stealthily a door was
                            opened, not the door of heaven, not even the main door of the room we
                            sat in, but a narrow side-door. Through it crept, with crawling caution,
                            he whom most of all men I now despised and pitied. Lily did not hear his
                            entrance, neither did she see him; but my eyes and ears were keen from
                            many a call of danger. Stunned for a while by the heavy blow, that met
                            me on my return, I had forgotten all about him; I mean, at least, all
                            about his present design. I had indeed told the farmer, for it was only
                            fair to do so, my object in bringing him down; and how I relied on his
                            wonderful strength and courage, having then no other to help me; but
                            since I got home, and heard the sad tidings, it seemed a mere thing for
                            contempt. Not even Lepardo Della Croce could catch a departed spirit.
                            So, and in the landslip of the mind, sapped by its own, and sliding
                            swiftly into another's sorrow, I had not even ordered that the house
                            should be watched at all; I had not even posted Giudice, who had a
                            vendetta of his own, anywhere on guard.
With a stiletto still concealed, all but the handle on which the light
                            fell, he approached the bed, wriggling along and crouching, as a cat or
                            leopard would. Then he rose and stood upright at the side of the bed,
                            not our side but the other, and glared upon his intended victim's face.
                            I pushed Lily back behind the curtain as if with the weight of my bosom,
                            while I watched the whole. Never in all my tempestuous life, of all the
                            horrible things I have seen, and heard, and shuddered at, saw I anything
                            so awful, so utterly beyond not only description, but conception, as
                            that disdainful, arrogant face, when the truth burst on him. Not the
                            body only, but the mind and soul—if God had cursed him with one—were
                            smitten back all of a lump, as if he had leaped from a train at full
                            speed into a firing cannon's mouth. Before he had time to recover, I
                            advanced and faced him. All dressed in white I was, with my black hair
                            below my waist, for I had thrown off my travelling frock, and taken what
                            first came to hand. They tell me I look best in white, it shows my hair
                            and eyes so.
He believed that it was a spirit, the Vendetta spirit of the other side;
                            and he cowered from me. I was the first to speak. "Lepardo Della Croce,
                            it is the rebuke of heaven. Dust upon ashes; such is man's revenge. I
                            have nursed, but scorn it now. Go in peace, and pray the Almighty that
                            He be not like you. Stop; I will show you forth. You have a vindictive
                            foe here, who would tear you to atoms."
I led the way, trembling at every corner lest we should meet Giudice; for
                            I knew he would not obey me, if he once caught sight of this hated one.
                            After standing silently, unable to take his eyes from the placid face of
                            the dead, Lepardo began to follow me, walking as if in a dream. Meeting
                            none, I led him forth along the corridor, down the end staircase, and
                            out on the eastern terrace. There I waved him off, and pointed to the
                            dark refuge of the shrubbery, beyond the mineral spring. The moonlight
                            slept upon the black water narrowly threading the grass. Over our heads
                            drooped the ivy, the creeper of oblivion. The murderer turned and looked
                            at me; hitherto he had glided along with his head down, as in
                            bewilderment. Oh that he had said one word of sorrow or repentance! He
                            spoke not at all; but shuddered, as the ivy rustled above us. His face
                            was pale as the moonlight. Did he see in me something higher than the
                            spirit of Vendetta?
I pointed again to the trees, and urged him away from the house. He had
                            two strong enemies there; a minute might make all the difference.
                            Breaking as if from a spell, he waved his Italian cap, and his lithe
                            strong figure was lost among the Portugal laurels. For a minute I stood
                            there, wondering; then slowly went round the house-corner, and gazed at
                            the grey stone mullions of the room which had been my father's.
I was still in the anguish of doubt and misgiving—what right had an
                            ignorant girl like me to play judge and jury, or more, to absolve and
                            release a crime against all humanity?—when a mighty form stood beside
                            me, and Giudice, all bristle and fire, dashed forth from the door in the
                            gable. With command and entreaty I called him, but he heard me not,
                            neither looked at me; but scoured the ground like a shadow, quartering
                            it as a pointer does, only he carried his nose down.
"Dang my slow bones," said the farmer, "but I'll have him yet, Miss. I
                            seed him go, I'll soon find him."
"No, no. I won't have him stopped. He shall go free, and repent."
"By your lave, Miss, it can't be. A man as have done what he have, us has
                            no right to play buff with. Never before did I go again your will, Miss;
                            but axing your pardon, I must now. Look, the girt dog know better."
As the dog found the track and gave tongue, the farmer rushed from me and
                            followed him, dashing headlong into the shrubbery, after leaping the
                            mineral spring, at the very spot where the footprints had been. Judy and
                            Farmer Huxtable were fast friends already; for that dog always made up
                            his mind in a moment on the question of like and dislike.
For a time I was so horror-struck, that no power of motion was left. I
                            knew that the farmer was quite unarmed, he carried not even a stick.
                            Even with the great dog to help him, what could he do against fire-arms,
                            which Lepardo was sure to have? What should I say to his wife and
                            children, what should I say to myself, if John Huxtable fell a victim to
                            that wily and desperate criminal?
Resolved to be present, if possible, I rushed down the narrow path which
                            led to the little park-gate, where probably they would pass. I was
                            right: they had passed, and flung it wide open. Breathless I looked
                            around, for hence several tracks diverged. No living thing could I see
                            or hear, but the beating of my heart, which seemed to be in my throat,
                            and the hooting of an owl from the hollow elm at the corner. I flung
                            myself down on the dewy grass, and strained my eyes in vain; until by
                            some silver birch-trees on which the moonlight was glancing, I saw first
                            a gliding figure that looked like a deer in the distance, then a tall
                            man running rapidly. Away I made by a short cut for the "Witches'
                            grave," as the end of the lake was called, for I knew that the path they
                            were on led thither. Quite out of breath I was, for I had run more than
                            half a mile, when I came full upon a scene, which would have robbed me
                            of breath if I had any. At the end of a little dingle, under a
                            willow-tree, and within a few feet of the water, stood Lepardo Della
                            Croce, brought to bay at last. A few yards from him, Giudice was
                            struggling furiously to escape the farmer's grasp; perhaps no other hand
                            in England could have held him. His eyes kindled in the moonlight, like
                            the red stars of a rocket, and a deep roar of baffled rage came from the
                            surge of his chest, as he champed his monstrous fangs, and volleyed all
                            the spring of his loins. The farmer leaned backward to hold him, and
                            stayed himself by a tree-stump.
"Sharp now, surrender, wull e, man. In the name of of the Quane and the
                            Lord Chafe Justice, and the High Shariff of Devon, I tell e
                            surrender—dang this here dog—surrender, and I 'ont hoort e; and I 'ont
                            let the girt dog."
Lepardo answered calmly, in a voice that made my blood cold:
"Do you value your life? If so, stand out of my way. I have death here
                            for you, and five other dogs."
I saw the barrel of a large revolver, with a stream of light upon it. He
                            held it steadily as a tobacco-pipe. I am glad he owned some courage. For
                            my life, I could not stir. All the breath in my body was gone.
"Dear heart alaive. Thiccy man must be a fule," said the farmer quite
                            contemplatively. "Don't e know who I be? Do e reckon they peppermint
                            twistesses can hurt Jan Uxtable? I seed ever so many in a smarl shop
                            window to Lunnon. Surrender now wull e, thou shalt have fair traial to
                            Hexeter, as a Davonshire man have took e, and a dale more nor e
                            desarves. Sharp now: I be afeared of the girt dog getting loose. Dang
                            you dog. Ston up a bit." And the farmer approached him coolly, trailing
                            the dog along; as if what the murderer held in his hand was a stick of
                            Spanish liquorice.
"Fool, if you pass that stump, your great carcase shall lie on it."
"Fire away," said the farmer, "I knowed you was a coward, and I be glad
                            it be so. Now mind, if so be you shuts, I lets the dog go, honour
                            braight, because e dunno what fair play be. But if e harken to rason,
                            I'll give e one chance more. I'll tie up the dog with my braces to
                            thiccy tree—allers wear cart rope I does—and I'll tak e Quane's
                            prisoner, with my left hond, and t'other never out of my breeches
                            pocket; look e, zee, laike thiccy."
And the farmer buried his right hand in his capacious trowsery. The
                            Corsican seemed astonished.
"Fool-hardy clown, worthy son of a bull-headed country, stop at the
                            stump—then, take that."
Out blazed the pistol with a loud ring, and I saw that the farmer was
                            struck. He let go the dog, and leaped up; his right hand fell on
                            Lepardo's temple, and seemed to crush the skull in,—another shot at the
                            same instant and down fell the farmer heavily. "Great God," I screamed,
                            and leaped forward. But Giudice was loose to avenge him, though I could
                            swear that it was on a corpse. Corpse or living body, over and over it
                            rolled, with the dog's fangs in its throat. I heard a gurgle, a tearing,
                            and grinding, and then a loud splash in the water. The dog, and the
                            murderer, both of man and dog, sunk in the lake together. Twenty feet
                            out from the shore rose above water one moment, drawn ghastly white in
                            the moonbeams, the last view seen till the judgment-day of the face of
                            Lepardo Della Croce.
Almost drowned himself—for he would not release his father's murderer,
                            while a gasp was in him—staggered at last to the shore my noble and true
                            dog Giudice. He fell down awhile, to recover his breath, then shook
                            himself gratefully, tottered to me, where I knelt at the farmer's side,
                            and wagged his tail for approval. The water from his chest and stomach
                            dripped on the farmer's upturned face, and for a moment revived him.
"No belt, no tino lad, I 'ont tak' it. Zimth laike a ticket for chating.
                            I dunno as I'd tak' the mony, if it warn't for the poor chillers, naine
                            chillers now, and anither a-coomin. Mustn't drink no more beer, but
                            Beany shall have his'n." And his head fell back on my lap, and I felt
                            sure that he was dead. How I screamed and shrieked, till I lay beside
                            him, with Judy licking my face, none can tell but the gamekeepers, who
                            had heard the shots, and came hurrying.
Of this lower end of the lake they happened to be most jealous; for a
                            brood of pintail ducks, very rare I believe in England, had been hatched
                            here this summer, and no one was allowed to go near them. Poor Judy kept
                            all the men aloof, till I was able to speak to him. Then I perceived
                            that he as well was bleeding, wounded perhaps by the poniard as he
                            leaped on his enemy's breast. It had entered just under the shoulder,
                            and narrowly missed the heart.
They took us at once towards the house, carrying the farmer and Judy on
                            the wooden floodgates of the stream called the "Witches' brook," which
                            here fell into the lake. As we entered the avenue, being obliged to take
                            the broad way, though much further round, we heard a carriage coming. It
                            was the one I had sent for Conrad, with a hurried note to break the sad
                            news of his father's death. He had been detained in London by a
                            challenge he found from Lepardo; which was of course a stratagem to keep
                            him out of the way. How delighted I was to see his calm brave face
                            again, as he leaped down, and took my tottering form in his arms. In a
                            minute he understood everything, and knew what was best to be done. He
                            would not allow them to place the poor farmer in the carriage, as they
                            foolishly wanted to do; but laid the rude litter down, examined the
                            wounds by the lamplight, and bound them up most cleverly with the
                            appliances of the moment.
"Oh, Conrad, will he die?"
"No, my darling, I hope not; but he must if they had let him bleed so
                            much longer."
"I never heard that you were a surgeon, Conny."
"Could I call myself a sculptor, without having studied anatomy? My
                            dearest one, how you tremble! Go home in the carriage, and give
                            directions for us. A room downstairs, with a wide doorway, and plenty of
                            air. I will stay with them, and see that they bear him gently. Poor Judy
                            may go with you."
Thus Conrad saw for the first time the hearth and home of his ancestors,
                            with his father lying dead there, and his avenger carried helpless. But
                            I met him at the door. Did that comfort you just a little, my
                            darling?
