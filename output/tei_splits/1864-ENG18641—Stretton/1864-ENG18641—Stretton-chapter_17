CHAPTER XVII.
A NEW CALLING.
Stephen's recovery went on so slowly, that the doctor who attended him said
                         it would not be fit for him to resume his underground labour for some
                         months to come, if he were ever able to do so; and advised him to seek some
                         out-door employment. His old comrades began to find the weekly subscription
                         to make up his wages rather a tax upon their own earnings; and Stephen
                         himself was unwilling to be a burden upon them any longer. As soon,
                         therefore, as he was strong enough to bear the journey, he resolved to
                         cross the hills again to Danesford, to see when Mr. Lockwood was coming
                         home, and what help the clergyman left in charge of his duty could give to
                         him. Tim brought his father's donkey for him to ride, and went with him
                         across the uplands. The hard frosts and the snow were over, for it was past
                         the middle of March; but the house at Fern's Hollow remained in precisely
                         the same state as when little Nan died; not a stroke of work had been done
                         at it, and a profound silence brooded over the place. Perhaps the master
                         had lost all pleasure in his ill-gotten possession!
So changed was Stephen, though Danesford looked exactly the same, so tall had
                         he grown during his illness, and so white was his formerly brown face, that
                         the big boy who had shown him the way to the rectory did not know him again
                         in the least. Probably Mr. Lockwood and his daughter would not have
                         recognised him; but they were still lingering in a warmer climate, until
                         the east winds had quite finished their course. The strange clergyman,
                         however, was exceedingly kind to both the boys, and promised to send a full
                         and faithful account to Mr. Lockwood of all the circumstances they narrated
                         to him; for Tim told of many things which Stephen passed over. They had
                         done right in coming to him, he said; and he gave Stephen enough money to
                         supply the immediate necessities of his family, at the same time bidding
                         him apply for more if he needed any; for he knew that a boy of his
                         principle and character would never live upon other people's charity
                         whenever he could work for himself.
How refreshing and strengthening it was upon the tableland that spring
                         afternoon! The red leaf-buds of the bilberry-wires were just bursting
                         forth, and the clumps of gorse were tinged with the first golden flowers.
                         Every kind of moss was there carpeting the ground with a bright fresh green
                         from the moisture of the spring showers. As for the birds, they seemed
                         absolutely in a frenzy of enjoyment, and seemed to forget that they had
                         their nests to build as they flew from bush to bush, singing merrily in the
                         sunshine.
Tim wrapped a cloak round Stephen; and then they faced the breeze gaily, as
                         it swept to meet them with a pure breath over miles of heath and budding
                         flowers. No wonder that Stephen's heart rose within him with a rekindled
                         gladness and gratitude; while Tim became almost as wild as the birds. But
                         Stephen began to feel a little tired as they neared Fern's Hollow, though
                         they were still two miles from the cinder-hill cabin.
'Home, home!' he said, rather mournfully, pointing to the new house. 'Tim, I
                         remember I used to feel in myself as if that was to be my own home for
                         ever. I didn't think that God only meant it to be mine for a little while,
                         even if I kept it till I died. And when I thought I was going to die, it
                         seemed as if it didn't signify what kind of a place we'd lived in, or what
                         troubles had happened to us. Yesterday, Tim, Miss Anne showed me a verse
                         about us being strangers and pilgrims upon the earth.'
'Perhaps we are pilgrims,' replied Tim, 'but we aren't much strangers on
                         these hills.'
'It means,' said Stephen, 'that we are no more at home here than a stranger
                         is when he is passing through Botfield. I'm willing now never to go back to
                         Fern's Hollow, if God pleases. Not that little Nan is gone; but because I'm
                         sure God will do what is best with me, and we're to have no continuing city
                         here. I think I shouldn't feel a bit angry if I saw other people living
                         there.'
'Hillo! what's that?' cried Tim.
Surely it could not be smoke from the top of the new chimney? Yes; a thin,
                         clear blue column of smoke was curling briskly up into the air, and then
                         floating off in a banner over the hillside. Somebody was there, that was
                         certain; and the first fire had been lighted on the hearthstone. There was
                         a sharp pang in Stephen's heart, and he cast down his eyes for a moment,
                         but then he looked up to the sky above him with a smile; while Tim set up a
                         loud shout, and urged the donkey to a canter.
'It's Martha!' he cried; 'I saw her gown peeping round the corner of the
                         wall. I'll lay a wager it's her print gown. Come thy ways; we'll make sure
                         afore we pass.'
It was Martha waiting for them at the old wicket, and Bess was just within
                         the doorway. They were come so far to meet the travellers, and had even
                         prepared tea for them in the new kitchen, having cleared away some of the
                         bricks and mortar, and raised benches with the pieces of planks left about.
                         Tea was just ready for Stephen's refreshment, and he felt that he was in
                         the greatest need of it; so they sat down to it as soon as Martha had laid
                         out the provisions, among which was a cake sent by Miss Anne. The fire of
                         wood-chips blazed brightly, and gave out a pleasant heat; and every one of
                         the little party felt a quiet enjoyment, though there were many tender
                         thoughts of little Nan.
'We may be pilgrims,' said Tim reflectively, over a slice of cake, 'but
                         there's lots of pleasant things sent us by the way.'
They were still at tea when the gamekeeper, who was passing by, and who
                         guessed from the smoke from the chimney, and the donkey grazing in the new
                         pasture, that some gipsies had taken possession of Fern's Hollow, came to
                         look through the unglazed window. He had not seen Stephen since his
                         illness, and there was something in his wasted face and figure which
                         touched even him.
'I'm sorry to see thee looking so badly, my lad,' he said; 'I must speak to
                         my missis to send you something nourishing, for I've not forgotten you,
                         Stephen. If ever there comes a time when I can speak up about any business
                         of yours without hurting myself, you may depend upon me; but I don't like
                         making enemies, and the Bible says we must live peaceably with all men. I
                         heard talk of you wanting some out-door work for a while; and there's my
                         wife's brother is wanting a shepherd's boy. He'd take you at my
                         recommendation, and I'd be glad to speak a word for you. Would that do for
                         you?'
Stephen accepted the offer gladly; and when the gamekeeper was gone, they
                         sang a hymn together, so blotting out by an offering of praise the evil
                         prayer which he had uttered upon that hearth on the night of his desolation
                         and strong conflict. Pleasant was the way home to the old cabin in the
                         twilight; pleasant the hearty 'Good-night' of Tim and Bess; but most
                         pleasant of all was the calm sense of truth, and the submissive will with
                         which Stephen resigned himself to the providence of God.
The work of a shepherd was far more to Stephen's taste than his dangerous
                         toil as a collier. From his earliest years he had been accustomed to wander
                         with his grandfather over the extensive sheep-walks, seeking out any
                         strayed lambs, or diligently gathering food for the sick ones of the flock.
                         To be sure, he could only earn little more than half his former wages, and
                         his time for returning from his work would always be uncertain, and often
                         very late. But then, sorrowful consideration! there was no little Nan to
                         provide for now, nor to fill up his leisure hours at home. Martha was
                         earning money for herself; and as yet the master had demanded no rent for
                         their miserable cabin; so his earnings as a shepherd's boy would do until
                         Mr. Lockwood came back. Still upon the mountains he would be exposed to the
                         bleak winds and heavy storms of the spring; while underground the
                         temperature had always been the same. No wonder that Miss Anne, when she
                         looked at the boy's wasted and enfeebled frame, listened with unconcealed
                         anxiety to his new project for gaining his livelihood; and so often as the
                         spring showers swept in swift torrents across the sky, lifted up her eyes
                         wistfully to the unsheltered mountains, as she pictured Stephen at the
                         mercy of the pitiless storm.
