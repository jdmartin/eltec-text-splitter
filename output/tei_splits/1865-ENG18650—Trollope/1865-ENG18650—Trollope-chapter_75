CHAPTER LXXV. Rouge et Noir.  
Alice insisted on being left up in the churchyard, urging that she wanted to "think about it
      all," but, in truth, fearing that she might not be able to carry herself well, if she were to
      walk down with her lover to the hotel. To this he made no objection, and, on reaching the inn,
      met Mr. Palliser in the hall. Mr. Palliser was already inspecting the arrangement of certain
      large trunks which had been brought down-stairs, and was preparing for their departure. He was
      going about the house, with a nervous solicitude to do something, and was flattering himself
      that he was of use. As he could not be Chancellor of the Exchequer, and as, by the nature of
      his disposition, some employment was necessary to him, he was looking to the cording of the
      boxes. "Good morning! good morning!" he said to Grey, hardly looking at him, as though time
      were too precious with him to allow of his turning his eyes upon his friend. "I am going up to
      the station to see after a carriage for to-morrow. Perhaps you'll come with me." To this
      proposition Mr. Grey assented. "Sometimes, you know," continued Mr. Palliser, "the springs of
      the carriages are so very rough." Then, in a very few words, Mr. Grey told him what had been
      his own morning's work. He hated secrets and secrecy, and as the Pallisers knew well what had
      brought him upon their track, it was, he thought, well that they should know that he had been
      successful. Mr. Palliser congratulated him very cordially, and then, running up-stairs for his
      gloves or his stick, or, more probably, that he might give his wife one other caution as to
      her care of herself, he told her also that Alice had yielded at last. "Of course she has,"
      said Lady Glencora.
"I really didn't think she would," said he.
"That's because you don't understand things of that sort," said his wife. Then the caution
      was repeated, the mother of the future duke was kissed, and Mr. Palliser went off on his
      mission about the carriage, its cushions, and its springs. In the course of their walk Mr.
      Palliser suggested that, as things were settled so pleasantly, Mr. Grey might as well return
      with them to England, and to this suggestion Mr. Grey assented.
Alice remained alone for nearly an hour, looking out upon the rough sides and gloomy top of
      Mount Pilate. No one disturbed her in the churchyard,—no steps were heard along the
      tombstones,—no voice sounded through the cloisters. She was left in perfect solitude to think
      of the past, and form her plans of the future. Was she happy, now that the manner of her life
      to come was thus settled for her; that all further question as to the disposal of herself was
      taken out of her hands, and that her marriage with a man she loved was so firmly arranged that
      no further folly of her own could disarrange it? She was happy, though she was slow to confess
      her happiness to herself. She was happy, and she was resolute in this,—that she would now do
      all she could to make him happy also. And there must now, she acknowledged, be an end to her
      pride,—to that pride which had hitherto taught her to think that she could more wisely follow
      her own guidance than that of any other who might claim to guide her. She knew now that she
      must follow his guidance. She had found her master, as we sometimes say, and laughed to
      herself with a little inward laughter as she confessed that it was so. She was from henceforth
      altogether in his hands. If he chose to tell her that they were to be married at Michaelmas,
      or at Christmas, or on Lady Day, they would, of course, be married accordingly. She had taken
      her fling at having her own will, and she and all her friends had seen what had come of it.
      She had assumed the command of the ship, and had thrown it upon the rocks, and she felt that
      she never ought to take the captain's place again. It was well for her that he who was to be
      captain was one whom she respected as thoroughly as she loved him.
She would write to her father at once,—to her father and Lady Macleod,—and would confess
      everything. She felt that she owed it to them that they should be told by herself that they
      had been right and that she had been wrong. Hitherto she had not mentioned to either of them
      the fact that Mr. Grey was with them in Switzerland. And, then, what must she do as to Lady
      Midlothian? As to Lady Midlothian, she would do nothing. Lady Midlothian, of course, would
      triumph;—would jump upon her, as Lady Glencora had once expressed it, with very triumphant
      heels,—would try to patronize her, or, which would be almost worse, would make a parade of her
      forgiveness. But she would have nothing to do with Lady Midlothian, unless, indeed, Mr. Grey
      should order it. Then she laughed at herself again with that inward laughter, and, rising from
      her seat, proceeded to walk down the hill to the hotel.
"Vanquished at last!" said Lady Glencora, as Alice entered the room.
"Yes, vanquished; if you like to call it so," said Alice.
"It is not what I call it, but what you feel it," said the other. "Do you think that I don't
      know you well enough to be sure that you regard yourself now as an unfortunate prisoner,—as a
      captive taken in war, to be led away in triumph, without any hope of a ransom? I know that it
      is quite a misery to you that you should be made a happy woman of at last. I understand it
      all, my dear, and my heart bleeds for you."
"Of course; I knew that was the way you would treat me."
"In what way would you have me treat you? If I were to hug you with joy, and tell you how
      good he is, and how fortunate you are,—if I were to praise him, and bid you triumph in your
      success, as might be expected on such an occasion,—you would put on a long face at once, and
      tell me that though the thing is to be, it would be much better that the thing shouldn't be.
      Don't I know you, Alice?"
"I shouldn't have said that;—not now."
"I believe in my heart you would;—that, or something like it. But I do wish you joy all the
      same, and you may say what you please. He has got you in his power now, and I don't think even
      you can go back."
"No; I shall not go back again."
"I would join with Lady Midlothian in putting you into a madhouse, if you did. But I am so
      glad; I am, indeed. I was afraid to the last,—terribly afraid; you are so hard and so proud. I
      don't mean hard to me, dear. You have never been half hard enough to me. But you are hard to
      yourself, and, upon my word, you have been hard to him. What a deal you will have to make up
      to him!"
"I feel that I ought to stand before him always as a penitent,—in a white sheet."
"He will like it better, I dare say, if you will sit upon his knee. Some penitents do, you
      know. And how happy you will be! He'll never explain the sugar-duties to you, and there'll be
      no Mr. Bott at Nethercoats." They sat together the whole morning,—while Mr. Palliser was
      seeing to the springs and cushions,—and by degrees Alice began to enjoy her happiness. As she
      did so her friend enjoyed it with her, and at last they had something of the comfort and
      excitement which such an occasion should give. "I'll tell you what, Alice; you shall come and
      be married at Matching, in August, or perhaps September. That's the only way in which I can be
      present; and if we can bespeak some sun, we'll have the breakfast out in the ruins."
On the following morning they all started together, a first-class compartment having been
      taken for the Palliser family, and a second-class compartment close to them for the Palliser
      servants. Mr. Palliser, as he slowly handed his wife in, was a triumphant man; as was also Mr.
      Grey, as he handed in his lady-love, though, in a manner, much less manifest. We may say that
      both the gentlemen had been very fortunate while at Lucerne. Mr. Palliser had come abroad with
      a feeling that all the world had been cut from under his feet. A great change was needed for
      his wife, and he had acknowledged at once that everything must be made to yield to that
      necessity. He certainly had his reward,—now in his triumphant return. Terrible troubles had
      afflicted him as he went, which seemed now to have dissipated themselves altogether. When he
      thought of Burgo Fitzgerald he remembered him only as a poor, unfortunate fellow, for whom he
      should be glad to do something, if the doing of anything were only in his power; and he had in
      his pocket a letter which he had that morning received from the Duke of St. Bungay, marked
      private and confidential, which was in its nature very private and confidential, and in which
      he was told that Lord Brock and Mr. Finespun were totally at variance about French wines. Mr.
      Finespun wanted to do something, now in the recess,—to send some political agent over to
      France,—to which Lord Brock would not agree; and no one knew what would be the consequence of
      this disagreement. Here might be another chance,—if only Mr. Palliser could give up his winter
      in Italy! Mr. Palliser, as he took his place opposite his wife, was very triumphant.
And Mr. Grey was triumphant, as he placed himself gently in his seat opposite to Alice. He
      seemed to assume no right, as he took that position apparently because it was the one which
      came naturally to his lot. No one would have been made aware that Alice was his own simply by
      seeing his arrangements for her comfort. He made no loud assertion as to his property and his
      rights, as some men do. He was quiet and subdued in his joy, but not the less was he
      triumphant. From the day on which Alice had accepted his first offer,—nay, from an earlier day
      than that; from the day on which he had first resolved to make it, down to the present hour,
      he had never been stirred from his purpose. By every word that he had said, and by every act
      that he had done, he had shown himself to be unmoved by that episode in their joint lives,
      which Alice's other friends had regarded as so fatal. When she first rejected him, he would
      not take his rejection. When she told him that she intended to marry her cousin, he silently
      declined to believe that such marriage would ever take place. He had never given her up for a
      day, and now the event proved that he had been right. Alice was happy, very happy; but she was
      still disposed to regard her lover as Fate, and her happiness as an enforced necessity.
They stopped a night at Basle, and again she stood upon the balcony. He was close to her as
      she stood there,—so close that, putting out her hand for his, she was able to take it and
      press it closely. "You are thinking of something, Alice," he said. "What is it?"
"It was here," she said—"here, on this very balcony, that I first rebelled against you, and
      now you have brought me here that I should confess and submit on the same spot. I do confess.
      How am I to thank you for forgiving me?"

On the following morning they went on to Baden-Baden, and there they stopped for a couple of
      days. Lady Glencora had positively refused to stop a day at Basle, making so many objections
      to the place that her husband had at last yielded. "I could go from Vienna to London without
      feeling it," she said, with indignation; "and to tell me that I can't do two easy days'
      journey running!" Mr. Palliser had been afraid to be imperious, and therefore, immediately on
      his arrival at one of the stations in Basle, he had posted across the town, in the heat and
      the dust, to look after the cushions and the springs at the other.
"I've a particular favour to ask of you," Lady Glencora said to her husband, as soon as they
      were alone together in their rooms at Baden. Mr. Palliser declared that he would grant her any
      particular favour,—only premising that he was not to be supposed to have thereby committed
      himself to any engagement under which his wife should have authority to take any exertion upon
      herself. "I wish I were a milkmaid," said Lady Glencora.
"But you are not a milkmaid, my dear. You haven't been brought up like a milkmaid."
But what was the favour? If she would only ask for jewels,—though they were the Grand
      Duchess's diamond eardrops, he would endeavour to get them for her. If she would have quaffed
      molten pearls, like Cleopatra, he would have procured the beverage,—having first fortified
      himself with a medical opinion as to the fitness of the drink for a lady in her condition.
      There was no expenditure that he would not willingly incur for her, nothing costly that he
      would grudge. But when she asked for a favour, he was always afraid of an imprudence. Very
      possibly she might want to drink beer in an open garden.
And her request was, at last, of this nature: "I want you to take me up to the
      gambling-rooms!" said she.
"The gambling-rooms!" said Mr. Palliser in dismay.
"Yes, Plantagenet; the gambling-rooms. If you had been with me before, I should not have
      made a fool of myself by putting my piece of money on the table. I want to see the place; but
      then I saw nothing, because I was so frightened when I found that I was winning."
Mr. Palliser was aware that all the world of Baden,—or rather the world of the strangers at
      Baden,—assembles itself in those salons. It may be also that he himself was curious to see how
      men looked when they lost their own money, or won that of others. He knew how a Minister
      looked when he lost or gained a tax. He was familiar with millions and tens of millions in a
      committee of the whole House. He knew the excitement of a near division upon the estimates.
      But he had never yet seen a poor man stake his last napoleon, and rake back from off the table
      a small hatful of gold. A little exercise after an early dinner was, he had been told, good
      for his wife; and he agreed therefore that, on their second evening at Baden, they would all
      walk up and see the play.
"Perhaps I shall get back my napoleon," said Glencora to Alice.
"And perhaps I shall be forgiven when somebody sees how difficult it is to manage you," said
      Alice, looking at Mr. Palliser.
"She isn't in earnest," said Mr. Palliser, almost fearing the result of the experiment.
"I don't know that," said Lady Glencora.
They started together, Mr. Palliser with his wife, and Mr. Grey with Alice on his arm, and
      found all the tables at work. They at first walked through the different rooms, whispering to
      each other their comments on the people that they saw, and listening to the quick, low,
      monotonous words of the croupiers as they arranged and presided over the games. Each table was
      closely surrounded by its own crowd, made up of players, embryo players, and simple
      lookers-on, so that they could not see much as they walked. But this was not enough for Lady
      Glencora. She was anxious to know what these men and women were doing,—to see whether the
      croupiers wore horns on their heads and were devils indeed,—to behold the faces of those who
      were wretched and of those who were triumphant,—to know how the thing was done, and to learn
      something of that lesson in life. "Let us stand here a moment," she said to her husband,
      arresting him at one corner of the table which had the greatest crowd. "We shall be able to
      see in a few minutes." So he stood with her there, giving way to Alice, who went in front with
      his wife; and in a minute or two an aperture was made, so that they could all see the marked
      cloth, and the money lying about, and the rakes on the table, and the croupier skilfully
      dealing his cards, and,—more interesting than all the rest, the faces of those who were
      playing. Grey looked on, over Alice's shoulder, very attentively,—as did Palliser also,—but
      both of them kept their eyes upon the ministers of the work. Alice and Glencora did the same
      at first, but as they gained courage they glanced round upon the gamblers.
It was a long table, having, of course, four corners, and at the corner appropriated by them
      they were partly opposite to the man who dealt the cards. The corner answering to theirs at
      the other end was the part of the table most removed from their sight, and that on which their
      eyes fell last. As Lady Glencora stood she could hardly see,—indeed, at first she could not
      see,—one or two who were congregated at this spot. Mr. Palliser, who was behind her, could not
      see them at all. But to Alice,—and to Mr. Grey, had he cared about it,—every face at the table
      was visible except the faces of those who were immediately close to them. Before long Alice's
      attention was riveted on the action and countenance of one young man who sat at that other
      corner. He was leaning, at first listlessly, over the table, dressed in a velveteen jacket,
      and with his round-topped hat brought far over his eyes, so that she could not fully see his
      face. But she had hardly begun to observe him before he threw back his hat, and taking some
      pieces of gold from under his left hand, which lay upon the table, pushed three or four of
      them on to one of the divisions marked on the cloth. He seemed to show no care, as others did,
      as to the special spot which they should occupy. Many were very particular in this respect,
      placing their ventures on the lines, so as to share the fortunes of two compartments, or
      sometimes of four; or they divided their coins, taking three or four numbers, selecting the
      numbers with almost grotesque attention to some imagined rule of their own. But this man let
      his gold go all together, and left it where his half-stretched rake deposited it by chance.
      Alice could not but look at his face. His eyes she could see were bloodshot, and his hair,
      when he pushed back his hat, was rough and dishevelled; but still there was that in his face
      which no woman could see and not regard. It was a face which at once prepossessed her in his
      favour,—as it had always prepossessed all others. On this occasion he had won his money, and
      Alice saw him drag it in as lazily as he had pushed it out.
"Do you see that little Frenchman?" said Lady Glencora. "He has just made half a napoleon,
      and has walked off with it. Isn't it interesting? I could stay here all the night." Then she
      turned round to whisper something to her husband, and Alice's eyes again fell on the face of
      the man at the other end of the table. After he had won his money, he had allowed the game to
      go on for a turn without any action on his part. The gold again went under his hand, and he
      lounged forward with his hat over his eyes. One of the croupiers had said a word, as though
      calling his attention to the game, but he had merely shaken his head. But when the fate of the
      next turn had been decided, he again roused himself, and on this occasion, as far as Alice
      could see, pushed his whole stock forward with the rake. There was a little mass of gold, and,
      from his manner of placing it, all might see that he left its position to chance. One piece
      had got beyond its boundary, and the croupier pushed it back with some half-expressed inquiry
      as to his correctness. "All right," said a voice in English. Then Lady Glencora started and
      clutched Alice's arm with her hand. Mr. Palliser was explaining to Mr. Grey, behind them,
      something about German finance as connected with gambling-tables, and did not hear the voice,
      or see his wife's motion. I need hardly tell the reader that the gambler was Burgo
      Fitzgerald.
But Lady Glencora said not a word,—not as yet. She looked forward very gently, but still
      with eager eyes, till she could just see the face she knew so well. His hat was now pushed
      back, and his countenance had lost its listlessness. He watched narrowly the face of the man
      as he told out the amount of the cards as they were dealt. He did not try to hide his anxiety,
      and when, after the telling of some six or seven cards, he heard a certain number named, and a
      certain colour called, he made some exclamation which even Glencora could not hear. And then
      another croupier put down, close to Burgo's money, certain rolls of gold done up in paper, and
      also certain loose napoleons.
"Why doesn't he take it?" said Lady Glencora.
"He is taking it," said Alice, not at all knowing the cause of her cousin's anxiety.
Burgo had paused a moment, and then prepared to rake the money to him; but as he did so, he
      changed his mind, and pushed it all back again,—now, on this occasion, being very careful to
      place it on its former spot. Both Alice and Glencora could see that a man at his elbow was
      dissuading him,—had even attempted to stop the arm which held the rake. But Burgo shook him
      off, speaking to him some word roughly, and then again he steadied the rolls upon their
      appointed place. The croupier who had paused for a moment now went on quickly with his cards,
      and in two minutes the fate of Burgo's wealth was decided. It was all drawn back by the
      croupier's unimpassioned rake, and the rolls of gold were restored to the tray from whence
      they had been taken.
Burgo looked up and smiled at them all round the table. By this time most of those who stood
      around were looking at him. He was a man who gathered eyes upon him wherever he might be, or
      whatever he was doing; and it had been clear that he was very intent upon his fortune, and on
      the last occasion the amount staked had been considerable. He knew that men and women were
      looking at him, and therefore he smiled faintly as he turned his eyes round the table. Then he
      got up, and, putting his hands in his trousers pockets, whistled as he walked away. His
      companion followed him, and laid a hand upon his shoulder; but Burgo shook him off, and would
      not turn round. He shook him off, and walked on whistling, the length of the whole salon.
"Alice," said Lady Glencora, "it is Burgo Fitzgerald." Mr. Palliser had gone so deep into
      that question of German finance that he had not at all noticed the gambler. "Alice, what can
      we do for him? It is Burgo," said Lady Glencora.
Many eyes were now watching him. Used as he was to the world and to misfortune, he was not
      successful in his attempt to bear his loss with a show of indifference. The motion of his
      head, the position of his hands, the tone of his whistling, all told the tale. Even the
      unimpassioned croupiers furtively cast an eye after him, and a very big Guard, in a cocked
      hat, and uniform, and sword, who hitherto had hardly been awake, seemed evidently to be
      interested by his movements. If there is to be a tragedy at these places,—and tragedies will
      sometimes occur,—it is always as well that the tragic scene should be as far removed as
      possible from the salons, in order that the public eye should not suffer.
Lady Glencora and Alice had left their places, and had shrunk back, almost behind a pillar.
      "Is it he, in truth?" Alice asked.
"In very truth," said Glencora. "What can I do? Can I do anything? Look at him, Alice. If he
      were to destroy himself, what should I do then?"
Burgo, conscious that he was the regarded of all eyes, turned round upon his heel and again
      walked the length of the salon. He knew well that he had not a franc left in his possession,
      but still he laughed and still he whistled. His companion, whoever he might be, had slunk away
      from him, not caring to share the notoriety which now attended him.
"What shall I do, Alice?" said Lady Glencora, with her eyes still fixed on him who had been
      her lover.
"Tell Mr. Palliser," whispered Alice.
Lady Glencora immediately ran up to her husband, and took him away from Mr. Grey. Rapidly
      she told her story,—with such rapidity that Mr. Palliser could hardly get in a word. "Do
      something for him;—do, do. Unless I know that something is done, I shall die. You needn't be
      afraid."
"I'm not afraid," said Mr. Palliser.
Lady Glencora, as she went on quickly, got hold of her husband's hand, and caressed it. "You
      are so good," said she. "Don't let him out of your sight. There; he is going. I will go home
      with Mr. Grey. I will be ever so good; I will, indeed. You know what he'll want, and for my
      sake you'll let him have it. But don't let him gamble. If you could only get him home to
      England, and then do something. You owe him something, Plantagenet; do you not?"
"If money can do anything, he shall have it."
"God bless you, dearest! I shall never see him again; but if you could save him! There;—he
      is going now. Go;—go." She pushed him forward, and then retreating, put her arm within Mr.
      Grey's, still keeping her eye upon her husband.
Burgo, when he first got to the door leading out of the salon, had paused a moment, and,
      turning round, had encountered the big gendarme close to him. "Well, old Buffer, what do you
      want?" said he, accosting the man in English. The big gendarme simply walked on through the
      door, and said nothing. Then Burgo also passed out, and Mr. Palliser quickly went after him.
      They were now in the large front salon, from whence the chief door of the building opened out
      upon the steps. Through this door Burgo went without pausing, and Mr. Palliser went after him.
      They both walked to the end of the row of buildings, and then Burgo, leaving the broad way,
      turned into a little path which led up through the trees to the hills. That hillside among the
      trees is a popular resort at Baden, during the day; but now, at nine in the evening, it was
      deserted. Palliser did not press on the other man, but followed him, and did not accost Burgo
      till he had thrown himself on the grass beneath a tree.
"You are in trouble, I fear, Mr. Fitzgerald," said Mr. Palliser, as soon as he was close at
      Burgo's feet.
"We will go home. Mr. Palliser has something to do," said Lady Glencora to Mr. Grey, as soon
      as the two men had disappeared from her sight.
"Is that a friend of Mr. Palliser?" said Mr. Grey.
"Yes;—that is, he knows him, and is interested about him. Alice, shall we go home? Oh! Mr.
      Grey, you must not ask any questions. He,—Mr. Palliser, will tell you everything when he sees
      you,—that is, if there is anything to be told." Then they all went home, and soon separated
      for the night. "Of course I shall sit up for him," said Lady Glencora to Alice, "but I will do
      it in my own room. You can tell Mr. Grey, if you like." But Alice told nothing to Mr. Grey,
      nor did Mr. Grey ask any questions.
