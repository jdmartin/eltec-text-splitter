CHAPTER VIII. Mr. Cheesacre.  
Yarmouth is not a happy place for a picnic. A picnic should be held among green things.
      Green turf is absolutely an essential. There should be trees, broken ground, small paths,
      thickets, and hidden recesses. There should, if possible, be rocks, old timber, moss, and
      brambles. There should certainly be hills and dales,—on a small scale; and above all, there
      should be running water. There should be no expanse. Jones should not be able to see all
      Greene's movements, nor should Augusta always have her eye upon her sister Jane. But the spot
      chosen for Mr. Cheesacre's picnic at Yarmouth had none of the virtues above described. It was
      on the seashore. Nothing was visible from the site but sand and sea. There were no trees there
      and nothing green;—neither was there any running water. But there was a long, dry, flat
      strand; there was an old boat half turned over, under which it was proposed to dine; and in
      addition to this, benches, boards, and some amount of canvas for shelter were provided by the
      liberality of Mr. Cheesacre. Therefore it was called Mr. Cheesacre's picnic.
But it was to be a marine picnic, and therefore the essential attributes of other picnics
      were not required. The idea had come from some boating expeditions, in which mackerel had been
      caught, and during which food had been eaten, not altogether comfortably, in the boats. Then a
      thought had suggested itself to Captain Bellfield that they might land and eat their food, and
      his friend Mr. Cheesacre had promised his substantial aid. A lady had surmised that Ormesby
      sands would be the very place for dancing in the cool of the evening. They might "Dance on the
      sand," she said, "and yet no footing seen." And so the thing had progressed, and the picnic
      been inaugurated.
It was Mr. Cheesacre's picnic undoubtedly. Mr. Cheesacre was to supply the boats, the wine,
      the cigars, the music, and the carpenter's work necessary for the turning of the old boat into
      a banqueting saloon. But Mrs. Greenow had promised to provide the eatables, and enjoyed as
      much of the éclat as the master of the festival. She had known Mr. Cheesacre now for
      ten days and was quite intimate with him. He was a stout, florid man, of about forty-five, a
      bachelor, apparently much attached to ladies' society, bearing no sign of age except that he
      was rather bald, and that grey hairs had mixed themselves with his whiskers, very fond of his
      farming, and yet somewhat ashamed of it when he found himself in what he considered to be
      polite circles. And he was, moreover, a little inclined to seek the honour which comes from a
      well-filled and liberally-opened purse. He liked to give a man a dinner and then to boast of
      the dinner he had given. He was very proud when he could talk of having mounted, for a day's
      hunting, any man who might be supposed to be of higher rank than himself. "I had Grimsby with
      me the other day,—the son of old Grimsby of Hatherwick, you know. Blessed if he didn't stake
      my bay mare. But what matters? I mounted him again the next day just the same." Some people
      thought he was soft, for it was very well known throughout Norfolk that young Grimsby would
      take a mount wherever he could get it. In these days Mrs. Greenow had become intimate with Mr.
      Cheesacre, and had already learned that he was the undoubted owner of his own acres.
"It wouldn't do for me," she had said to him, "to be putting myself forward, as if I were
      giving a party myself, or anything of that sort;—would it now?"
"Well, perhaps not. But you might come with us."
"So I will, Mr. Cheesacre, for that dear girl's sake. I should never forgive myself if I
      debarred her from all the pleasures of youth, because of my sorrows. I need hardly say that at
      such a time as this nothing of that sort can give me any pleasure."
"I suppose not," said Mr. Cheesacre, with solemn look.
"Quite out of the question." And Mrs. Greenow wiped away her tears. "For though as regards
      age I might dance on the sands as merrily as the best of them—"
"That I'm sure you could, Mrs. Greenow."
"How's a woman to enjoy herself if her heart lies buried?"
"But it won't be so always, Mrs. Greenow."
Mrs. Greenow shook her head to show that she hardly knew how to answer such a question.
      Probably it would be so always;—but she did not wish to put a damper on the present occasion
      by making so sad a declaration. "But as I was saying," continued she—"if you and I do it
      between us won't that be the surest way of having it come off nicely?"
Mr. Cheesacre thought that it would be the best way.
"Exactly so;—I'll do the meat and pastry and fruit, and you shall do the boats and the
      wine."
"And the music," said Cheesacre, "and the expenses at the place." He did not choose that any
      part of his outlay should go unnoticed.
"I'll go halves in all that if you like," said Mrs. Greenow. But Mr.. Cheesacre had declined
      this. He did not begrudge the expense, but only wished that it should be recognised.
"And, Mr. Cheesacre," continued Mrs. Greenow. "I did mean to send the music; I did,
      indeed."
"I couldn't hear of it, Mrs. Greenow."
"But I mention it now, because I was thinking of getting Blowehard to come. That other man,
      Flutey, wouldn't do at all out in the open air."
"It shall be Blowehard," said Mr. Cheesacre; and it was Blowehard. Mrs. Greenow liked to
      have her own way in these little things, though her heart did lie buried.
On the morning of the picnic Mr. Cheesacre came down to Montpelier Parade with Captain
      Bellfield, whose linen on that occasion certainly gave no outward sign of any quarrel between
      him and his washerwoman. He was got up wonderfully, and was prepared at all points for the
      day's work. He had on a pseudo-sailor's jacket, very liberally ornamented with brass buttons,
      which displayed with great judgement the exquisite shapes of his pseudo-sailor's duck
      trousers. Beneath them there was a pair of very shiny patent-leather shoes, well adapted for
      dancing on the sand, presuming him to be anxious of doing so, as Venus offered to do, without
      leaving any footmarks. His waistcoat was of a delicate white fabric, ornamented with very many
      gilt buttons. He had bejewelled studs in his shirt, and yellow kid gloves on his hands;
      having, of course, another pair in his pocket for the necessities of the evening. His array
      was quite perfect, and had stricken dismay into the heart of his friend Cheesacre, when he
      joined that gentleman. He was a well-made man, nearly six feet high, with dark hair, dark
      whiskers, and dark moustache, nearly black, but of that suspicious hue which to the observant
      beholder seems always to tell a tale of the hairdresser's shop. He was handsome, too, with
      well-arranged features,—but carrying, perhaps, in his nose some first symptoms of the effects
      of midnight amusements. Upon the whole, however, he was a nice man to look at—for those who
      like to look on nice men of that kind.
Cheesacre, too, had adopted something of a sailor's garb. He had on a jacket of a rougher
      sort, coming down much lower than that of the captain, being much looser, and perhaps somewhat
      more like a garment which a possible seaman might possibly wear. But he was disgusted with
      himself the moment that he saw Bellfield. His heart had been faint, and he had not dared to
      ornament himself boldly as his friend had done. "I say, Guss, you are a swell," he exclaimed.
      It may be explained that Captain Bellfield had been christened Gustavus.
"I don't know much about that," said the captain; "my fellow sent me this toggery, and said
      that it was the sort of thing. I'll change with you if you like it." But Cheesacre could not
      have worn that jacket, and he walked on, hating himself.
It will be remembered that Mrs. Greenow had spoken with considerable severity of Captain
      Bellfield's pretensions when discussing his character with her niece; but, nevertheless, on
      the present occasion she received him with most gracious smiles. It may be that her estimate
      of his character had been altered, or that she was making sacrifice of her own feelings in
      consideration of Mr. Cheesacre, who was known to be the captain's intimate friend. But she had
      smiles for both of them. She had a wondrous power of smiling; and could, upon occasion, give
      signs of peculiar favour to half a dozen different gentlemen in as many minutes. They found
      her in the midst of hampers which were not yet wholly packed, while Mrs. Jones, Jeannette, and
      the cook of the household moved around her, on the outside of the circle, ministering to her
      wants. She had in her hand an outspread clean napkin, and she wore fastened round her dress a
      huge coarse apron, that she might thus be protected from some possible ebullition of gravy, or
      escape of salad mixture, or cream; but in other respects she was clothed in the fullest
      honours of widowhood. She had not mitigated her weeds by half an inch. She had scorned to make
      any compromise between the world of pleasure and the world of woe. There she was, a widow,
      declared by herself to be of four months' standing, with a buried heart, making ready a dainty
      banquet with skill and liberality. She was ready on the instant to sit down upon the baskets
      in which the grouse pie had been just carefully inhumed, and talked about her sainted lamb
      with a deluge of tears. If anybody didn't like it, that person—might do the other thing. Mr.
      Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield thought that they did like it.
"Oh, Mr. Cheesacre, if you haven't caught me before I've half done! Captain Bellfield, I
      hope you think my apron becoming."
"Everything that you wear, Mrs. Greenow, is always becoming."
"Don't talk in that way when you know—; but never mind—we will think of nothing sad to-day
      if we can help it. Will we, Mr.. Cheesacre?"
"Oh dear no; I should think not;—unless it should come on to rain."
"It won't rain—we won't think of such a thing. But, by the by, Captain Bellfield, I and my
      niece do mean to send out a few things, just in a bag you know, so that we may tidy ourselves
      up a little after the sea. I don't want it mentioned, because if it gets about among the other
      ladies, they'd think we wanted to make a dressing of it;—and there wouldn't be room for them
      all; would there?"
"No; there wouldn't," said Mr. Cheesacre, who had been out on the previous evening,
      inspecting, and perhaps limiting, the carpenters in their work.
"That's just it," said Mrs. Greenow. "But there won't be any harm, will there, Mr.
      Cheesacre, in Jeanette's going out with our things? She'll ride in the cart, you know, with
      the eatables. I know Jeannette's a friend of yours."
"We shall be delighted to have Jeanette," said Mr. Cheesacre.
"Thank ye, sir," said Jeannette, with a curtsey.
"Jeannette, don't you let Mr. Cheesacre turn your head; and mind you behave yourself and be
      useful. Well; let me see;—what else is there? Mrs. Jones, you might as well give me that ham
      now. Captain Bellfield, hand it over. Don't you put it into the basket, because you'd turn it
      the wrong side down. There now, if you haven't nearly made me upset the apricot pie." Then, in
      the transfer of the dishes between the captain and the widow, there occurred some little
      innocent by-play, which seemed to give offence to Mr. Cheesacre; so that that gentleman turned
      his back upon the hampers and took a step away towards the door.
Mrs. Greenow saw the thing at a glance, and immediately applied herself to cure the wound.
      "What do you think, Mr. Cheesacre," said she, "Kate wouldn't come down because she didn't
      choose that you should see her with an apron on over her frock!"
"I'm sure I don't know why Miss Vavasor should care about my seeing her."
"Nor I either. That's just what I said. Do step up into the drawing-room; you'll find her
      there, and you can make her answer for herself."
"She wouldn't come down for me," said Mr. Cheesacre. But he didn't stir. Perhaps he wasn't
      willing to leave his friend with the widow.
At length the last of the dishes was packed and Mrs. Greenow went up-stairs with the two
      gentlemen. There they found Kate and two or three other ladies who had promised to embark
      under the protection of Mrs. Greenow's wings. There were the two Miss Fairstairs, whom Mrs.
      Greenow had especially patronized, and who repaid that lady for her kindness by an amount of
      outspoken eulogy which startled Kate by its audacity.
"Your dear aunt!" Fanny Fairstairs had said on coming into the room. "I don't think I ever
      came across a woman with such genuine milk of human kindness!"
"Nor with so much true wit," said her sister Charlotte,—who had been called Charlie on the
      sands of Yarmouth for the last twelve years.
When the widow came into the room, they flew at her and devoured her with kisses, and swore
      that they had never seen her looking so well. But as the bright new gloves which both the
      girls wore had been presents from Mrs. Greenow, they certainly did owe her some affection.
      There are not many ladies who would venture to bestow such gifts upon their friends after so
      very short an acquaintance; but Mrs. Greenow had a power that was quite her own in such
      matters. She was already on a very confidential footing with the Miss Fairstairs, and had
      given them much useful advice as to their future prospects.
And then was there a Mrs. Green, whose husband was first-lieutenant on board a man-of-war on
      the West Indian Station. Mrs. Green was a quiet, ladylike little woman, rather pretty, very
      silent, and, as one would have thought, hardly adapted for the special intimacy of Mrs.
      Greenow. But Mrs. Greenow had found out that she was alone, not very rich, and in want of the
      solace of society. Therefore she had, from sheer good-nature, forced herself upon Mrs. Green,
      and Mrs. Green, with much trepidation, had consented to be taken to the picnic. "I know your
      husband would like it," Mrs. Greenow had said, "and I hope I may live to tell him that I made
      you go."
There came in also a brother of the Fairstairs girls, Joe Fairstairs, a lanky, useless, idle
      young man, younger than them, who was supposed to earn his bread in an attorney's office at
      Norwich, or rather to be preparing to earn it at some future time, and who was a heavy burden
      upon all his friends. "We told Joe to come to the house," said Fanny to the widow,
      apologetically, "because we thought he might be useful in carrying down the cloaks." Mrs.
      Greenow smiled graciously upon Joe, and assured him that she was charmed to see him, without
      any reference to such services as those mentioned.
And then they started. When they got to the door both Cheesacre and the captain made an
      attempt to get possession of the widow's arm. But she had it all arranged. Captain Bellfield
      found himself constrained to attend to Mrs. Green, while Mr. Cheesacre walked down to the
      beach beside Kate Vavasor. "I'll take your arm, Mr. Joe," said the widow, "and the girls shall
      come with us." But when they got to the boats, round which the other comers to the picnic were
      already assembled, Mr. Cheesacre,—although both the boats were for the day his own,—found
      himself separated from the widow. He got into that which contained Kate Vavasor, and was
      shoved off from the beach while he saw Captain Bellfield arranging Mrs. Greenow's drapery. He
      had declared to himself that it should be otherwise; and that as he had to pay the piper, the
      piper should play as he liked it. But Mrs. Greenow with a word or two had settled it all, and
      Mr. Cheesacre had found himself to be powerless. "How absurd Bellfield looks in that jacket,
      doesn't he?" he said to Kate, as he took his seat in the boat.
"Do you think so? I thought it was so very pretty and becoming for the occasion."
Mr. Cheesacre hated Captain Bellfield, and regretted more than ever that he had not done
      something for his own personal adornment. He could not endure to think that his friend, who
      paid for nothing, should carry away the honours of the morning and defraud him of the delights
      which should justly belong to him, "It may be becoming," said Cheesacre; "but don't you think
      it's awfully extravagant?"
"As to that I can't tell. You see I don't at all know what is the price of a jacket covered
      all over with little brass buttons."
"And the waistcoat, Miss Vavasor!" said Cheesacre, almost solemnly.
"The waistcoat I should think must have been expensive."
"Oh, dreadful! and he's got nothing, Miss Vavasor; literally nothing. Do you know,"—and he
      reduced his voice to a whisper as he made this communication,—"I lent him twenty pounds the
      day before yesterday; I did indeed. You won't mention it again, of course. I tell you,
      because, as you are seeing a good deal of him just now, I think it right that you should know
      on what sort of a footing he stands." It's all fair, they say, in love and war, and this small
      breach of confidence was, we must presume, a love stratagem on the part of Mr. Cheesacre. He
      was at this time smitten with the charms both of the widow and of the niece, and he constantly
      found that the captain was interfering with him on whichever side he turned himself. On the
      present occasion he had desired to take the widow for his share, and was, upon the whole,
      inclined to think that the widow was the more worthy of his attentions. He had made certain
      little inquiries within the last day or two, the answers to which had been satisfactory. These
      he had by no means communicated to his friend, to whom, indeed, he had expressed an opinion
      that Mrs. Greenow was after all only a flash in the pan. "She does very well pour passer le
      temps," the captain had answered. Mr. Cheesacre had not quite understood the exact gist of the
      captain's meaning, but had felt certain that his friend was playing him false.
"I don't want it to be mentioned again, Miss Vavasor," he continued.
"Such things should not be mentioned at all," Kate replied, having been angered at the
      insinuation that the nature of Captain Bellfield's footing could be a matter of any moment to
      her.
"No, they shouldn't; and therefore I know that I'm quite safe with you, Miss Vavasor. He's a
      very pleasant fellow, very; and has seen the world,—uncommon; but he's better for eating and
      drinking with than he is for buying and selling with, as we say in Norfolk. Do you like
      Norfolk, Miss Vavasor?"
"I never was in it before, and now I've only seen Yarmouth."
"A nice place, Yarmouth, very; but you should come up and see our lands. I suppose you don't
      know that we feed one-third of England during the winter months."
"Dear me!"
"We do, though; nobody knows what a county Norfolk is. Taking it altogether, including the
      game you know, and Lord Nelson, and its watering-places and the rest of it, I don't think
      there's a county in England to beat it. Fancy feeding one-third of all England and Wales!"
"With bread and cheese, do you mean, and those sort of things?"
"Beef!" said Mr. Cheesacre, and in his patriotic energy he repeated the word aloud. "Beef!
      Yes indeed; but if you were to tell them that in London they wouldn't believe you. Ah! you
      should certainly come down and see our lands. The 7.45 a.m. train would take you
      through Norwich to my door, as one may say, and you would be back by the 6.22 p.m."
      In this way he brought himself back again into good-humour, feeling, that in the absence of
      the widow, he could not do better than make progress with the niece.
In the mean time Mrs. Greenow and the captain were getting on very comfortably in the other
      boat. "Take an oar, Captain," one of the men had said to him as soon as he had placed the
      ladies. "Not to-day, Jack," he had answered. "I'll content myself with being bo'san this
      morning." "The best thing as the bo'san does is to pipe all hands to grog," said the man. "I
      won't be behind in that either," said the captain; and so they all went on swimmingly.
"What a fine generous fellow your friend, Mr. Cheesacre, is!" said the widow.
"Yes, he is; he's a capital fellow in his way. Some of these Norfolk farmers are no end of
      good fellows."
"And I suppose he's something more than a common farmer. He's visited by the people about
      where he lives, isn't he?"
"Oh, yes, in a sort of a way. The county people, you know, keep themselves very much to
      themselves."
"That's of course. But his house;—he has a good sort of place, hasn't he?"
"Yes, yes;—a very good house;—a little too near to the horse-pond for my taste. But when a
      man gets his money out of the till, he mustn't be ashamed of the counter;—must he, Mrs.
      Greenow?"
"But he could live like a gentleman if he let his own land, couldn't he?"
"That depends upon how a gentleman wishes to live." Here the privacy of their conversation
      was interrupted by an exclamation from a young lady to the effect that Charlie Fairstairs was
      becoming sick. This Charlie stoutly denied, and proved the truth of her assertion by her
      behaviour. Soon after this they completed their marine adventures, and prepared to land close
      to the spot at which the banquet was prepared.
