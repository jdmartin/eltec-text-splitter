CHAPTER XLVII.

The devil tempts us not—'tis we tempt him,
Beckoning his skill with opportunity.
The more permanent effect of Esther's action in the trial was visible in a meeting
      which took place the next day in the principal room of the White Hart at Loamford. To the
      magistrates and other county gentlemen who were drawn together about noon, some of the
      necessary impulse might have been lacking but for that stirring of heart in certain
      just-spirited men and good fathers among them, which had been raised to a high pitch of
      emotion by Esther's maidenly fervour. Among these one of the foremost was Sir Maximus Debarry,
      who had come to the assizes with a mind, as usual, slightly rebellious under an influence
      which he never ultimately resisted—the influence of his son. Philip Debarry himself was
      detained in London, but in his correspondence with his father he had urged him, as well as his
      uncle
       Augustus, to keep eyes and interest awake on the subject of Felix Holt, whom,
      from all the knowledge of the case he had been able to obtain, he was inclined to believe
      peculiarly unfortunate rather than guilty. Philip had said he was the more anxious that his
      family should intervene benevolently in this affair, if it were possible, because he
      understood that Mr Lyon took the young man's case particularly to heart, and he should always
      regard himself as obliged to the old preacher. At this superfineness of consideration Sir
      Maximus had vented a few "pshaws!" and, in relation to the whole affair, had grumbled that
      Phil was always setting him to do he didn't know what—always seeming to turn nothing into
      something by dint of words which hadn't so much substance as a mote behind them. Nevertheless
      he was coerced; and in reality he was willing to do anything fair or good-natured which had a
      handle that his understanding could lay hold of. His brother, the Rector, desired to be
      rigorously just; but he had come to Loamford with a severe opinion concerning Felix, thinking
      that some sharp punishment might be a wholesome check on the career of a young man disposed to
      rely too much on his own crude devices.
Before the trial commenced, Sir Maximus had
       naturally been one of those who had observed Esther with curiosity, owing to the
      report of her inheritance, and her probable marriage to his once welcome but now exasperating
      neighbour, Harold Transome; and he had made the emphatic comment— "A fine girl! something
      thoroughbred in the look of her. Too good for a Radical; that's all I have to say." But during
      the trial Sir Maximus was wrought into a state of sympathetic ardour that needed no fanning.
      As soon as he could take his brother by the buttonhole, he said,
"I tell you what, Gus! we must exert ourselves to get a pardon for this young fellow.
      Confound it! what's the use of mewing him up for four years? Example? Nonsense. Will there be
      a man knocked down the less for it? That girl made me cry. Depend upon it, whether she's going
      to marry Transome or not, she's been fond of Holt—in her poverty, you know. She's a modest,
      brave, beautiful woman. I'd ride a steeplechase, old as I am, to gratify her feelings. Hang
      it! the fellow's a good fellow if she thinks so. And he threw out a fine sneer, I thought, at
      the Radical candidate. Depend upon it, he's a good fellow at bottom."
The Rector had not exactly the same kind of ardour, nor was he open to precisely that
      process of
       proof which appeared to have convinced Sir Maximus; but he had been so far
      influenced as to be inclined to unite in an effort on the side of mercy, observing, also, that
      he "knew Phil would be on that side." And by the co-operation of similar movements in the
      minds of other men whose names were of weight, a meeting had been determined on to consult
      about getting up a memorial to the Home Secretary on behalf of Felix Holt. His case had never
      had the sort of significance that could rouse political partisanship; and such interest as was
      now felt in him was still more unmixed with that inducement. The gentlemen who gathered in the
      room at the White Hart were—not as the large imagination of the North Loamshire
       Herald suggested, "of all shades of political opinion," but—of as many shades as were to
      be found among the gentlemen of that county.
Harold Transome had been energetically active in bringing about this meeting. Over and above
      the stings of conscience and a determination to act up to the level of all recognised
      honourableness, he had the powerful motive of desiring to do what would satisfy Esther. His
      gradually heightened perception that she had a strong feeling towards Felix Holt had not made
      him uneasy. Harold had
       a conviction that might have seemed like fatuity if it had not been that he saw
      the effect he produced on Esther by the light of his opinions about women in general. The
      conviction was, that Felix Holt could not be his rival in any formidable sense: Esther's
      admiration for this eccentric young man was, he thought, a moral enthusiasm, a romantic
      fervour, which was one among those many attractions quite novel in his own experience; her
      distress about the trouble of one who had been a familiar object in her former home, was no
      more than naturally followed from a tender woman's compassion. The place young Holt had held
      in her regard had necessarily changed its relations now that her lot was so widely changed. It
      is undeniable, that what most conduced to the quieting nature of Harold's conclusions was the
      influence on his imagination of the more or less detailed reasons that Felix Holt was a
      watchmaker, that his home and dress were of a certain quality, that his person and
      manners—that, in short (for Harold, like the rest of us, had many impressions which saved him
      the trouble of distinct ideas), Felix Holt was not the sort of man a woman would be likely to
      be in love with when she was wooed by Harold Transome.

Thus, he was sufficiently at rest on this point not to be exercising any painful
      self-conquest in acting as the zealous advocate of Felix Holt's cause with all persons worth
      influencing; but it was by no direct intercourse between him and Sir Maximus that they found
      themselves in co-operation, for the old baronet would not recognise Harold by more than the
      faintest bow, and Harold was not a man to expose himself to a rebuff. Whatever he in his
      inmost soul regarded as nothing more than a narrow prejudice, he could defy, not with airs of
      importance, but with easy indifference. He could bear most things good-humouredly where he
      felt that he had the superiority. The object of the meeting was discussed, and the memorial
      agreed upon without any clashing. Mr Lingon was gone home, but it was expected that his
      concurrence and signature would be given, as well as those of other gentlemen who were absent.
      The business gradually reached that stage at which the concentration of interest ceases—when
      the attention of all but a few who are more practically concerned drops off and disperses
      itself in private chat, and there is no longer any particular reason why everybody stays
      except that everybody is there. The room was rather a long one, and invited to a little
      movement:
       one gentleman drew another aside to speak in an under-tone about Scotch
      bullocks, another had something to say about the North Loamshire Hunt to a friend who was the
      reverse of good-looking, but who, nevertheless, while listening, showed his strength of mind
      by giving a severe attention also to his full-length reflection in the handsome tall mirror
      that filled the space between two windows. And in this way the groups were continually
      shifting.
But in the mean time there were moving towards this room at the White Hart the footsteps of
      a person whose presence had not been invited, and who, very far from being drawn thither by
      the belief that he would be welcome, knew well that his entrance would, to one person at
      least, be bitterly disagreeable. They were the footsteps of Mr Jermyn, whose appearance that
      morning was not less comely and less carefully tended than usual, but who was suffering the
      torment of a compressed rage, which, if not impotent to inflict pain on another, was impotent
      to avert evil from himself. After his interview with Mrs Transome there had been for some
      reasons a delay of positive procedures against him by Harold, of which delay Jermyn had twice
      availed himself; first, to seek an interview with
       Harold, and then to send him a letter. The interview had been refused; and the
      letter had been returned, with the statement that no communication could take place except
      through Harold's lawyers. And yesterday Johnson had brought Jermyn the information that he
      would quickly hear of the proceedings in Chancery being resumed: the watch Johnson kept in
      town had given him secure knowledge on this head. A doomed animal, with every issue earthed up
      except that where its enemy stands, must, if it has teeth and fierceness, try its one chance
      without delay. And a man may reach a point in his life in which his impulses are not
      distinguished from those of a hunted brute by any capability of scruples. Our selfishness is
      so robust and many-clutching, that, well encouraged, it easily devours all sustenance away
      from our poor little scruples.
Since Harold would not give Jermyn access to him, that vigorous attorney was resolved to
      take it. He knew all about the meeting at the White Hart, and he was going thither with the
      determination of accosting Harold. He thought he knew what he should say, and the tone in
      which he should say it. It would be a vague intimation, carrying the effect of a threat, which
      should compel Harold to give
       him a private interview. To any counter-consideration that presented itself in
      his mind—to anything that an imagined voice might say—the imagined answer arose, "That's all
      very fine, but I'm not going to be ruined if I can help it—least of all, ruined in that way."
      Shall we call it degeneration or gradual development—this effect of thirty additional winters
      on the soft-glancing, versifying young Jermyn?
When Jermyn entered the room at the White Hart he did not immediately see Harold. The door
      was at the extremity of the room, and the view was obstructed by groups of gentlemen with
      figures broadened by overcoats. His entrance excited no peculiar observation: several persons
      had come in late. Only one or two, who knew Jermyn well, were not too much preoccupied to have
      a glancing remembrance of what had been chatted about freely the day before—Harold's irritated
      reply about his agent, from the witness-box. Receiving and giving a slight nod here and there,
      Jermyn pushed his way, looking round keenly, until he saw Harold standing near the other end
      of the room. The solicitor who had acted for Felix was just then speaking to him, but having
      put a paper into his hand turned away; and Harold, standing isolated, though at no great
      distance
       from others, bent his eyes on the paper. He looked brilliant that morning; his
      blood was flowing prosperously. He had come in after a ride, and was additionally brightened
      by rapid talk and the excitement of seeking to impress himself favourably, or at least
      powerfully, on the minds of neighbours nearer or more remote. He had just that amount of flush
      which indicates that life is more enjoyable than usual; and as he stood with his left hand
      caressing his whisker, and his right holding the paper and his riding-whip, his dark eyes
      running rapidly along the written lines, and his lips reposing in a curve of good-humour which
      had more happiness in it than a smile, all beholders might have seen that his mind was at
      ease.
Jermyn walked quickly and quietly close up to him. The two men were of the same height, and
      before Harold looked round Jermyn's voice was saying, close to his ear, not in a whisper, but
      in a hard, incisive, disrespectful and yet not loud tone.
"Mr Transome, I must speak to you in private."
The sound jarred through Harold with a sensation all the more insufferable because of the
      revulsion from the satisfied, almost elated, state in which it had seized him. He started and
      looked round into Jermyn's eyes. For an instant, which seemed long,
       there was no sound between them, but only angry hatred gathering in the two
      faces. Harold felt himself going to crush this insolence: Jermyn felt that he had words within
      him that were fangs to clutch this obstinate strength, and wring forth the blood and compel
      submission. And Jermyn's impulse was the more urgent. He said, in a tone that was rather
      lower, but yet harder and more biting.
"You will repent else—for your mother's sake."
At that sound, quick as a leaping flame, Harold had struck Jermyn across the face with his
      whip. The brim of the hat had been a defence. Jermyn, a powerful man, had instantly thrust out
      his hand and clutched Harold hard by the clothes just below the throat, pushing him slightly
      so as to make him stagger.
By this time everybody's attention had been called to this end of the room, but both Jermyn
      and Harold were beyond being arrested by any consciousness of spectators.
"Let me go, you scoundrel!" said Harold, fiercely, "or I'll be the death of you."
"Do," said Jermyn, in a grating voice; " I am your father. "
In the thrust by which Harold had been made to stagger backward a little, the two men had
      got very
       near the long mirror. They were both white; both had anger and hatred in their
      faces; the hands of both were upraised. As Harold heard the last terrible words he started at
      a leaping throb that went through him, and in the start turned his eyes away from Jermyn's
      face. He turned them on the same face in the glass with his own beside it, and saw the hated
      fatherhood reasserted.
The young strong man reeled with a sick faintness. But in the same moment Jermyn released
      his hold, and Harold felt himself supported by the arm. It was Sir Maximus Debarry who had
      taken hold of him.
"Leave the room, sir!" the Baronet said to Jermyn, in a voice of imperious scorn. "This is a
      meeting of gentlemen."
"Come, Harold," he said, in the old friendly voice, "come away with me."
