Chapter XVI
That evening was one which all the people in Grange Lane had unanimously concluded would be
     rather hard upon Miss Marjoribanks. To be sure, when a crisis arrives there is always a certain
     excitement which keeps one up; but afterwards, when the excitement is over, then is the time
     when it becomes really trying. There was naturally, under these circumstances, a larger
     assemblage than usual to watch the progress of the little drama, and how Lucilla would behave;
     for, after all, society would be excessively tame if it were not for these personal
     complications, which are always arising, and which are so much better than a play. As for the
     Doctor himself, the portion of the evening's entertainment which particularly amused him was
     that which preceded all the rest—the reception given by Lucilla to her guests at dinner, and
     especially to the culprit, who came in quite alone, and found nobody to stand up for him. Mr
     Cavendish, who felt to the full the difficulty of his position, and, to tell the truth, was a
     little ashamed of himself, came late, in order to abridge his trial as much as possible; but
     Lucilla's habitual good-fortune was not confined only to her own necessities, but seemed to
     involve everybody opposed to her in a ceaseless ill-luck, which was very edifying to the
     spectators. Mr Cavendish was so late that the other guests had formed into groups round the
     room, leaving a great open space and avenue of approach to the lady of the house in the middle;
     and the audience, thus arranged, was very impatient and unfavourable to the lingerer who kept
     them waiting for their dinner. When he came in at last, instead of doing anything to help him,
     everybody ceased talking and looked on in stern silence as the wretched culprit walked all the
     length of the room up to Lucilla through the unoccupied space which exposed him so unmercifully
     on every side. They all stopped in the middle of what they were saying, and fixed stony eyes on
     him, as the dead sailors did on the Ancient Mariner. He had a very good spirit, but still there
     are circumstances which take the courage out of a man. To be sure, Miss Marjoribanks, when he
     reached her at last, received Mr Cavendish with the utmost grace and cordiality, but it is easy
     to imagine what must have been the feelings of the unfortunate hero. The Balaclava charge
     itself, in the face of all the guns, could have been nothing to the sensation of walking
     through that horrible naked space, through a crowd of reproachful men who were waiting for
     dinner; and it was only after it was all over, and Mr Cavendish had safely arrived at Miss
     Marjoribanks's side, and was being set at his ease, poor wretch, by her incomparable sweetness,
     that the Doctor, with a certain grim smile on his countenance, came and shook hands with his
     unfortunate guest.
"You are late," Dr Marjoribanks said, taking out the great watch by which all the pulses of
     Grange Lane considered it their duty to keep time, and which marked five minutes after seven,
     as everybody could see. It was ten minutes after seven by the pretty French clock on the
     mantelpiece, and at least twenty by the lowering countenances of Dr Marjoribanks's guests. Mr
     Cavendish made the best of his unhappy position, and threw himself upon Lucilla's charity, who
     was the only one who had any compassion upon him; for to see Mrs Chiley's forbidding
     countenance no one could have believed that she had ever called him "my dear." "Dinner is on
     the table, papa," Miss Marjoribanks said, with a little reassuring nod to the culprit who had
     made her his refuge; and she got up and shook out her white draperies with a charitable
     commotion for which her faithless admirer blessed her in his heart.
But the place at her left hand was not left vacant for Mr Cavendish; he had not the spirit to
     claim it, even had he had the time; and the consequence was that he found himself next to his
     brother-in-law at table, which was indeed a hard fate. As for Lucilla, she was quite radiant
     when the famous dish made its appearance which Nancy had elaborated to please her, and told the
     story of its introduction to her two next neighbours, in a half whisper, to their immense
     amusement. "When the servants are gone I will tell you what we are laughing at," she breathed
     across the table to Mrs Chiley, who was "more than delighted," as she said, to see her dear
     Lucilla keeping up so well; and when the dessert was put upon the table, and Thomas had finally
     disappeared, Miss Marjoribanks kept her promise. "I could not think how I was going to get her
     to consent," Lucilla said, "but you know she thought I was in low spirits, the dear old soul,
     and that it would be a comfort to me." Though there was often a great deal of fun at Dr
     Marjoribanks's table, nothing was ever heard there to compare with the laughter that greeted
     Lucilla's narrative. Everybody was so entirely aware of the supposed cause of the low spirits,
     and indeed was so conscious of having speculated, like Nancy, upon Miss Marjoribanks's probable
     demeanour at this trying moment, that the laughter was not mere laughter, but conveyed, at the
     same time a confession of guilt and a storm of applause and admiration. As for Mr Cavendish, it
     was alarming to look at him in the terrible paroxysm of confusion and shame which he tried to
     shield under the universal amusement. Miss Marjoribanks left the dining-room that evening with
     the soothing conviction that she had administered punishment of the most annihilating kind,
     without for a moment diverging from the perfect sweetness and amiability with which it was her
     duty to treat all her father's guests. It was so complete and perfect that there was not
     another word to be said either on one side or the other; and yet Lucilla had not in the least
     committed herself, or condescended from her maiden dignity. As for Dr Marjoribanks, if he had
     chuckled over it before, in anticipation, it may be supposed how he enjoyed now this perfect
     vindication of his daughter's capacity for taking care of herself. The sound of the victory was
     even heard upstairs, where the young ladies at the open windows were asking each other, with a
     little envy, what the men could be laughing at. There was, as we have said, a larger assembly
     than usual that night. For one thing, it was moonlight, and all the people from the country
     were there; and then public curiosity was profoundly concerned as to how Lucilla was to conduct
     herself on so trying an occasion. The laughter even jarred on the sensitive feelings of some
     people who thought, where a young girl's happiness was concerned, that it was too serious a
     matter to be laughed at; but then Miss Marjoribanks was not a person who could be classed with
     ordinary young girls, in the general acceptation of the word.
It was when things were at this crisis, and all eyes were directed to Lucilla, and a certain
     expectation was diffused through the company, that Miss Marjoribanks made that proposal of
     adjourning to the garden, which was received with so much applause. Lucilla's instinct, or
     rather her genius, had warned her that something out of the ordinary course of proceedings
     would be expected from her on that special occasion. She could not get up and make a speech to
     her excited and curious audience, neither could she, apropos of nothing, tell over again the
     story which had been received with such applause downstairs; and yet something was wanting. The
     ordinary routine did not satisfy Lucilla's constituency, who had come with the laudable
     intention of observing her on a trying occasion, and watching how she got through it. "The air
     is so delicious to-night that I had some seats placed in the garden," Miss Marjoribanks said,
     "and if you all like we will sing to you up here, and give you as much music as ever you
     please. You know I never would consent to be too musical when everybody was in one room. It
     does not matter so much, when there are a suite; but then papa, you know, is only a
     professional man, and I have but one drawing-room," said Lucilla, with sweet humility. It was
     Lady Richmond to whom she was addressing herself at the moment, who was a lady who liked to be
     the great lady of the party. "It is only in summer that we can be a little like you fine
     people, who have as many rooms as you please. When you are at a little distance we will sing to
     you all the evening, if you like."
"But, my dear, are you sure you feel able for so much exertion?" said Lady Richmond, who was
     one of those people who did not think a young girl's happiness a thing to be trifled with; and
     she looked with what she described afterwards as a very searching expression in Miss
     Marjoribanks's face.
"Dear Lady Richmond, I hope I am always able for my duty," said that gentle martyr. "Papa
     would be wretched if he did not think we were all enjoying ourselves; and you know it is the
     object of my life to be a comfort to papa."
This was what the searching expression in Lady Richmond's eyes elicited from Lucilla. The
     sentiment was perhaps a little different from that which she had conveyed to her delighted
     auditors in the dining-room, but at the same time it was equally true; for everybody in
     Carlingford was aware of the grand object of Miss Marjoribanks's existence. Lady Richmond went
     down to the garden at the head of a bevy of ladies, and seated herself under the drawing-room
     windows, and placed a chair beside her own for Mrs Chiley. "I am afraid that dear girl is
     keeping up too well," Lady Richmond said; "I never saw such fortitude. All the young people say
     she does not feel it; but as soon as I fixed my eyes on her I saw the difference. You can
     always find out what a girl's feelings are when you look into her eyes."
"Yes," said Mrs Chiley, with a little doubt, for she had been shaken in her convictions by
     the universal laughter, though she was a little mystified herself by Lucilla's anecdote; and
     then she had never been gifted with eyes like Lady Richmond's, which looked people through and
     through. "She goes through a great deal, and it never seems to do her any harm," the old lady
     said, with a little hesitation. "It is such a comfort that she has a good constitution,
     especially as her mother was so delicate; and then Lucilla has such a spirit——"
"But one may try a good constitution too far," said Lady Richmond; "and I am certain she is
     full of feeling. It is sure to come out when she sings, and that is why I came to this seat. I
     should not like to lose a note. And do tell me who is that horrid flirting, disagreeable girl,"
     added the county lady, drawing her chair a little closer. By this time the garden was full of
     pretty figures and pleasant voices, and under the lime-tree there was a glimmer of yellow light
     from the lamps, and on the other side the moon was coming up steady like a ball of silver over
     the dark outlines of Carlingford; and even the two voices which swelled forth upstairs in the
     fullest accord, betraying nothing of the personal sentiments of their owners, were not more
     agreeable to hear than the rustle and murmur of sound which rose all over Dr Marjoribanks's
     smooth lawn and pretty shrubbery. Here and there a group of the older people sat, like Lady
     Richmond and Mrs Chiley, listening with all their might; and all about them were clusters of
     girls and their natural attendants, arrested in their progress, and standing still breathless,
     "just for this bar," as young people pause in their walks and talks to listen to a chance
     nightingale. And, to be sure, whenever anybody was tired of the music, there were quantities of
     corners to retire into, not to speak of that bright spot full of yellow light under the
     lime-tree.
"Nobody but Lucilla ever could have thought of anything so delicious," was what everybody
     said. And then the two singers upstairs gave so much scope to curiosity. "Do you think they are
     all by themselves?" Lydia Brown was heard to ask, with a little natural anxiety; and the
     livelier imaginations among the party set to work at once to invent impossible tortures which
     the soprano might inflict on the contralto. But, to tell the truth, the two singers were by no
     means alone. Half the gentlemen of the dinner-party, who were past the sentimental age, and did
     not care about moonlight, had gone upstairs according to their use and wont, and remained
     there, finding, to their great satisfaction, room to move about, and comfortable chairs to sit
     down in. They sat and chatted in the corners in great content and good-humour, while Lucilla
     and Barbara executed the most charming duets. Now and then old Colonel Chiley paused to put his
     two hands softly together and cry "Brava!" but on the whole the gentlemen were not much
     disturbed by the music. And then there were a few ladies, who were subject to neuralgia, or apt
     to take bad colds in the head, who preferred being upstairs. So that if Lucilla had meant to
     pinch or maltreat her rival, circumstances would have made it impossible. Miss Marjoribanks did
     nothing to Barbara, except incite her to sing her very best; but no doubt she was the means of
     inflicting considerable pain on Mr Cavendish, who stood at a little distance, and looked and
     listened to both, and perhaps had inward doubts as to the wisdom of his choice. Such was the
     arrangement of the personages of the social drama, and it was in this way that everybody was
     occupied, when an event occurred which at a later period awoke much excitement in Carlingford,
     and had no small influence upon the future fate of some of the individuals whose history is
     here recorded.
Everything was as calm and cheerful and agreeable as if Carlingford had been a social
     paradise, and Miss Marjoribanks's drawing-room the seventh heaven of terrestrial harmony. The
     sky itself was not more peaceful, nor gave less indication of any tempest than did the tranquil
     atmosphere below, where all the people knew each other, and everybody was friendly. Lucilla had
     just risen from the piano, and there was a little pause, in which cheers were audible from the
     garden, and Colonel Chiley, in the midst of his conversation, patted his two hands together;
     and it was just at that moment that the drawing-room door opened, and Thomas came in, followed
     by a gentleman. The gentleman was a stranger, whom Miss Marjoribanks had never seen before, and
     she made a step forward, as was her duty as mistress of the house. But when she had made that
     one step, Lucilla suddenly stood still, arrested by something more urgent than the arrival of a
     stranger. Mr Cavendish, too, had been standing with his face to the door, and had seen the new
     arrival. He was directly in front of Lucilla, so near her that he could not move without
     attracting her attention. When Miss Marjoribanks took that step in advance, Mr Cavendish, as if
     by the same impulse, suddenly, and without saying a word, turned right round like a man who had
     seen something terrible, at which he dared not take a second look. He was too much absorbed at
     that moment in his own feelings to know that he was betraying himself to Lucilla, or even to be
     conscious that she was near him. His face was more than pale; it had a green ghastly look, as
     of a face from which all the blood had suddenly been withdrawn to reinforce the vital centre in
     some failing of nature. His under-lip hung down, and two hollows which had never been seen
     there before appeared in his cheeks. Miss Marjoribanks was so taken by surprise that she stood
     still, thinking no more of her duties, but regarding in utter dismay and amazement the look of
     dead stupefied terror which thus appeared so unexpectedly before her. Mr Cavendish had turned
     right round, turning his back upon a lady to whom he had been talking the minute before. But he
     was as unconscious of doing so as of the fact that he had presented the spectacle of his
     miserable surprise and alarm in the most striking way to the one woman present who had a right
     to entertain a certain grudge against him.
During this moment of unusual inaction on Lucilla's part, the stranger had been led up to
     Colonel Chiley, and had shaken hands with him, and was entering into some explanations which
     Miss Marjoribanks divined with her usual quick intelligence; and then the old Colonel roused
     himself up from his easy-chair, and leaned over to speak to Dr Marjoribanks, and showed
     symptoms of approaching the lady of the house. All these movements Lucilla followed
     breathlessly, with a strange consciousness that only her presence of mind stood between her
     faithless suitor and a real danger. And as if to prove the difference, Barbara Lake chose that
     moment of all others to show her power, and made an appeal to Mr Cavendish and his taste in
     music, to which the unhappy man made no response. Miss Marjoribanks saw there was no time to
     lose. With a fearless hand she threw down a great portfolio of music which happened to be close
     to her, just at his feet, making a merciful disturbance. And then she turned and made her
     curtsey, and received the homage of Mr Archdeacon Beverley, who had arrived a day before he was
     expected, and had come to look after his host, since his host had not been at home to receive
     him.
"But you have broken your music-stand or something, Lucilla," said the Colonel.
"Oh, no; it is only a portfolio. I can't think what could make me so awkward," said Miss
     Marjoribanks; "I suppose it was seeing some one come in whom I didn't know." And then the old
     gentleman, as was his duty, paid the Archdeacon a compliment on having made such a commotion.
     "We used to have the best of it in our day," said the old soldier; "but now you churchmen are
     the men." Miss Marjoribanks heard the door open again before this little speech was finished.
     It was Mr Cavendish, who was going out with a long step, as if he with difficulty kept himself
     from running; and he never came back again to say good-night, or made any further appearance
     either out of doors or indoors. It is true that the Archdeacon made himself very agreeable, but
     then one man never quite makes up for another. Miss Marjoribanks said nothing about it, not
     even when Mrs Woodburn came up to her with a scared face, and in full possession of her own
     identity, which of itself was an extraordinary fact, and proved that something had happened;
     but it would be vain to say that Lucilla was not much excited by this sudden gleam of mystery.
     It gave the Archdeacon an extraordinary and altogether unexpected attraction; and as for Mr
     Cavendish, it was utterly inconceivable that a man in society, whom everybody knew about,
     should give way to such a panic. The question was, What did it mean?
