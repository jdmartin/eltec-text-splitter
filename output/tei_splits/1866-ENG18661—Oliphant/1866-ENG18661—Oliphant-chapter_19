Chapter XIX
But Lucilla's good luck and powers of persuasion were such that after a while she even
     succeeded in convincing little Rose Lake of the perfect reasonableness, and indeed necessity,
     of sacrificing herself to the public interests of the community. "As for enjoying it," Miss
     Marjoribanks said, "that is quite a different matter. Now and then perhaps for a minute one
     enjoys it; but that is not what I am thinking of. One owes something to one's fellow-creatures,
     you know; and if it made the evening go off well, I should not mind in the least to be hustled
     up in a corner and contradicted. To be sure, I don't remember that it ever happened to me; but
     then I have such luck; and I am sure I give you full leave to box the Archdeacon's ears next
     Thursday; or to tell him he does not know anything in the world about art," said Miss
     Marjoribanks thoughtfully, with a new combination rising in her mind.
"Thank you, Lucilla," said Rose, "but I shall not come back again. I am much obliged to you.
     It does not do for people who have work to do. My time is all I have, and I cannot afford to
     waste it, especially——"
"Rose," said Miss Marjoribanks, "how are you ever to be an artist if you do not know life?
     That is just the very reason why you ought to go out into the world; and I don't see, for my
     part, that it matters whether it is pleasant or not. To practise scales all day long is
     anything but pleasant, but then one has to do it, you know. I don't blame you," said Lucilla,
     with tender condescension. "You are a dear little thing, and you don't know any better; but
      I went through Political Economy, and learnt all about that;—you don't think
      I choose it for the pleasure? But you all know what is the object of my life, and I
     hope I am not one to shrink from my duty," Miss Marjoribanks added. And it was difficult to
     reply to such a sublime declaration. Little Rose left her friend with the conviction that it
     was her duty, too, to sacrifice herself for the benefit of society and the advancement of art.
     Such were the lofty sentiments elicited naturally, as enthusiasm responds to enthusiasm, by
     Lucilla's self-devotion. Already, although she was not much more than twenty, she had the
     consoling consciousness that she had wrought a great work in Carlingford; and if Miss
     Marjoribanks required a little sacrifice from her assistants, she did not shrink from making
     the same in her own person, as has been shadowed forth in the case of Mr Cavendish, and as will
     yet, in the course of this history, be still more seriously and even sadly evolved.
Three weeks had passed in this way, making it still more and more visible to Lucilla how much
     she had lost in losing Mr Cavendish, of whom nothing as yet had been heard, when suddenly, one
     day, about luncheon-time, at the hour when Miss Marjoribanks was known to be at home, the
     drawing-room door opened without any warning, and the missing man walked in. It was thus that
     Lucilla herself described the unexpected apparition, which appeared to her to have dropped from
     the clouds. She avowed afterwards to Mrs Chiley that his entrance was so utterly unexpected, so
     noiseless, and without warning, that she felt quite silly, and could not tell in the least how
     she behaved; though the friends of Miss Marjoribanks, it is to be hoped, are too well
     acquainted with her promptitude of mind and action to imagine that she in any way compromised
     herself even under the surprise of the moment. As for Mr Cavendish, he exhibited a certain
     mixture of timidity and excitement which it was remarkable, and indeed rather flattering for
     any lady to see, in such an accomplished man of the world. Lucilla was not a person to deceive
     herself, nor did she want experience in such matters, as has been already shown; but it would
     be vain to deny that the conviction forced upon her mind by the demeanour of her visitor was
     that it was a man about to propose who thus made his unlooked-for appearance before
     her. She confessed afterwards to her confidential friend that he had all the signs of it in his
     looks and manners. "He gave that little nervous cough," Lucilla said, "and pulled his cravat
      just so, and stared into his hat as if he had it all written down there; and looked
     as They always look," Miss Marjoribanks added, with a touch of natural contempt. Nor was this
     all the change in Mr Cavendish's appearance. He had managed miraculously in his month's absence
     to grow the most charming little moustache and beard, which were, to be sure, slightly red,
     like most people's. It gleamed into Miss Marjoribanks's mind in a moment that people did such
     things sometimes by way of disguising themselves; but if such had been Mr Cavendish's
     intention, it had utterly failed, since he seemed rather more like himself than before, in
     Lucilla's opinion, and certainly was more likely to attract attention, since beards were not so
     usual in these days. They met on the very spot where Lucilla had seen him last, with that look
     of insane terror on his handsome face. And the Archdeacon was still in Carlingford, if it was
     he who had occasioned such a panic. Mr Cavendish came in as if he had never been absent, as if
     he had seen Miss Marjoribanks on the previous night, and had no fear of anything in the world
     but of failing to please her; and Lucilla fortunately saw the nature of the position, and was
     not to be put out even by such an emergency. Of course, under the circumstances, to accept him
     was utterly out of the question; but, at the same time, Lucilla did not feel it expedient,
     without much more distinct information, to put a definitive and cruel negative on Mr
     Cavendish's hopes. As for Barbara Lake, that was a trifle not worth thinking of; and,
     notwithstanding that there was something rather unaccountable in his conduct, he was still the
     probable member for Carlingford, just, as Mrs Chiley so often said, the position which, of all
     others, she would have chosen for Lucilla; so that Miss Marjoribanks was not prepared, without
     due consideration, to bring the matter to a final end.
While Lucilla made this rapid summary of affairs and took her stand in her own mind, Mr
     Cavendish had taken a chair and had opened the conversation. He hoped he had not been entirely
     forgotten, though a fortnight's absence was a severe tax on anybody's memory——
"A fortnight!" said Miss Marjoribanks; "how happy you must have been while you have been
     away!—for I assure you a month is a month at Carlingford; and one does not get such ornaments
     in two weeks," said Lucilla, putting her hand to her chin, which made Mr Cavendish laugh, and
     look more nervous than ever.
"It is a souvenir of where I have been," he said. "I could imagine I had been gone two years,
     judging by my own feelings. I am so pleased to see that you remember how long it is. I dare say
     it looked a little droll running away so, but I dared not trust myself with leave-takings," Mr
     Cavendish said, with an air of sentiment. "I have been watching over a poor friend of mine on
     his sick-bed. He was once very good to me, and when he sent for me I could not delay or refuse
     him. I found he had telegraphed for me when I got home the last Thursday evening I was here,"
     he continued, looking Lucilla full in the face with the candour of conscious truth—though, to
     be sure, when people are stating a simple fact, it is seldom that they take the pains to be so
     particular. "I started by the night-train, and crossed the Channel while you were all fast
     asleep. I wonder if any one gave me a thought," continued Mr Cavendish; and it was still more
     and more impressed upon Lucilla that he had all the signs of a man who had come to propose.
"I cannot say about that night in particular, but I am sure a great many people have given
     you a thought," said Miss Marjoribanks. "We have all been wondering what had become of you,
     where you were, and when you were coming back. So far as I am concerned, I have missed you
     dreadfully," said Lucilla, with her usual openness; and she really thought for a moment that Mr
     Cavendish in a sudden transport was going down on his knees.
"I scarcely hoped for so much happiness," he said; and though he kept up the tone proper to
     good society, which might mean sport or earnest according as the occasion required, there was a
     certain air of gratitude and tenderness in his face which sent Lucilla's active mind
     a-wondering. "He is thinking of the music-stand," she said to herself, and then went on with
     what she was saying; for though Miss Marjoribanks had a very good opinion of herself, it had
     not occurred to her that Mr Cavendish was very deeply in love—with her, at all
     events.
"Ah, yes—not only for the flirting, you know, which of itself is a dreadful loss; but then
     you were so good in keeping the gentlemen to their duty. I missed you dreadfully—there has been
     nobody at all to help me," said Lucilla. Her tone was so genuinely plaintive that Mr Cavendish
     grew more and more moved. He put down his hat, he cleared his throat, he got up and walked to
     the window—evidently he was getting up his courage for the last step.
"But I heard you had some distinguished strangers here," he said, coming back to his seat
     without having, as it appeared, made up his mind. "My sister wrote—that is to say I heard—I
     really don't remember how I got the news; a dean, or bishop, or something——?"
"Oh, yes, Mr Archdeacon Beverley; he came precisely the night you went away," said Lucilla.
     "Didn't you see him? I thought you stayed till after he came into the room. A nice clergyman is
     very nice, you know; but, after all, a man who has some experience in society—and we have had
     no music to speak of since you went away. Poor dear Barbara has had such a bad cold. In short,
     we have all been at sixes and sevens; and the Archdeacon——"
"Oh, never mind the Archdeacon," said Mr Cavendish, and Miss Marjoribanks felt that he had
     not winced at the name, though he did glance up at her in spite of himself with a little gleam
     in his eyes when she mentioned Barbara Lake. Perhaps this was because he knew nothing about the
     Archdeacon, perhaps because he was prepared to hear the Archdeacon named. Lucilla did not give
     him all the benefit of the uncertainty, for she began to get a little impatient, and to wonder,
     if the man had come to propose, as appearances suggested, why he did not do it and get done
     with it?—which was a very reasonable question. This time, however, it certainly was coming. "I
     don't like nice clergymen," said Mr Cavendish, "especially not when it is you who find
     them so. If I could really flatter myself that you missed me——"
"We all did," said Lucilla; "there is no compliment about it; and poor dear Barbara has had
     such a cold——"
"Ah!" said the unfortunate aspirant; and once more he gave a doubtful glance at
     Lucilla—decidedly the name of Barbara had more effect upon him than that of the Archdeacon. It
     seemed to damp his fire and smother the words on his lips, and he had to take another promenade
     to the window to recover himself. After that, however, he came back evidently wound up and
     determined; and his eyes, as he returned to Miss Marjoribanks's side, fell upon the music-stand
     by means of which she had covered his fright and flight (if it was not a mere hallucination on
     Lucilla's part that he had been frightened and had fled) on the night he left Carlingford. He
     came back with the air of a man who means to delay and deliberate no more.
"If I could flatter myself that you had missed me," he said; "you—not any
     one else—I might have the courage to ask——"
It was at that precise moment of all moments that Mrs Chiley, whom they had not heard coming
     upstairs, though she was sufficiently audible, suddenly opened the door. Mr Cavendish, as was
     natural, broke off in a moment with a face which had turned crimson, and even Lucilla herself
     felt a little annoyed and put out, when, as in duty bound, she got up to meet and welcome her
     old friend. One thing was fortunate, as Miss Marjoribanks afterwards reflected, that since it
     was to be interrupted, it had been interrupted so early, before he could have put himself in
     any ridiculous attitude, for example; for at such moments it is well known that some men go
     down upon their knees—or at least such is the ineradicable belief of womankind. If Mr Cavendish
     had been on his knees—though, to tell the truth, he was not a very likely subject—the position
     would have been much more embarrassing. But as it was, there was an end. He turned
     back again to the window, biting his glove in the most frantic way, and taking up his hat,
     while she, always mistress of the position, advanced to the new-comer with
     outstretched hands.
"I know you have come to have lunch with me," said Lucilla. "You are always so nice—just when
     I wanted you; for, of course, I dared not have asked Mr Cavendish to go downstairs if I had
     been all alone."
"Mr Cavendish!" cried the old lady, with a little scream. "So he has really come back! I am
     so glad to see you. I can't tell you how glad I am to see you; and, I declare, with a beard!
     Oh, you need not blush for what I say. I am old enough to be both your grandmothers, and I am
     so glad to see you together again!" said Mrs Chiley, with an imprudent effusion of sentiment.
     And it may be imagined what the effect of this utterance was upon the suitor whose love-making
     (if he was really going to make love) was thus cut short in the bud. He coughed more than ever
     when he shook hands with the new-comer, and kept fast hold of his hat with that despairing
     grasp which is common to men in trouble. And then he kept looking at the door, as if he
     expected some one else to come in, or wanted to escape; and so far from following up his
     interrupted address by any explanatory or regretful glances, he never even looked at Lucilla,
     which, to be sure, struck her as odd enough.
"Miss Marjoribanks is very good," he said, "and I am very glad to see you so soon after my
     return, Mrs Chiley—though, of course, I should have called; but I may have to go away in a day
     or two; and I am afraid I cannot have the pleasure of staying to lunch."
"Oh, yes, you must stay," said Mrs Chiley; "I want to hear all about it. Go away again in a
     day or two? If I were Lucilla I would not let you go away. She is queen now in Carlingford, you
     know;—and then poor old Mr Chiltern is so ill. I hope you won't think of going away. They all
     say it would be such a pity if anything happened to him while you were away. Tell me where you
     have been, and what you have been doing all this time. We have missed you so dreadfully. And
     now you look quite like a military man with that beard."
"I have been nursing a sick friend—on the Continent," said Mr Cavendish; "not very cheerful
     work. I am sorry about Mr Chiltern, but I cannot help it. I have doubts now whether, even if he
     were to die, I should offer myself. I couldn't give pledges to all the shopkeepers about my
     opinions," said the embarrassed man; and as he spoke, he put his hat against his breast like a
     buckler. "I must not detain you from your lunch. Good-bye, Miss Marjoribanks; I am very sorry I
     can't stay."
"But, dear me, stop a minute—don't run away from us," said Mrs Chiley. "Come and talk it all
     over with the Colonel, there is a dear—and don't do anything rash. Good-bye, if you
      will go," said the old lady. She sat with a look of consternation in her face,
     looking at Miss Marjoribanks, as he made his way downstairs. "Did I come in at a wrong time,
     Lucilla?" said Mrs Chiley, in distress. "Have you refused him, my dear? What is the matter? I
     am so dreadfully afraid I came in at the wrong time."
"Dear Mrs Chiley," said Lucilla sweetly, "you can never come in at a wrong time; and it is
     just as well, on the whole, that he didn't—for I was not prepared to give him any answer. I am
     sure, on the contrary, it was quite providential," Miss Marjoribanks said; but it may be
     doubted whether Lucilla's mind perfectly corresponded to her words on this occasion, though she
     was so amiable about it, as Mrs Chiley afterwards said. For even when a woman has not her
     answer ready, she has always a certain curiosity about a proposal; and then when such a
     delicate matter is crushed in the bud like this, who can tell if it will ever blossom again,
     and find full expression? Miss Marjoribanks could not be said to be disappointed, but
     unquestionably she regretted a little that he had not been permitted to say out his say. As for
     Mrs Chiley, when she understood all the rights of it, she was afflicted beyond measure, and
     could not forgive herself for the unlucky part she had played.
"If you had only said you were engaged," the old lady exclaimed, "or not at home—or anything,
     Lucilla! You know, you need never stand on ceremony with me. No wonder he looked as if he could
     eat me! Poor fellow! and I dare say he has gone away with his heart full," said Mrs Chiley,
     with the tenderest sympathy. She could not get over it, nor eat any lunch, nor think of
     anything else. "Poor dear boy! He need not have been so put out with an old woman like me. He
     might have known if he had given me the least hint, or even a look, I would have gone away,"
     said the kind old woman. "But you must be all the kinder to him when he comes back, Lucilla.
     And, my dear, if I were you, I would stay in this afternoon. He is sure to come back, and I
     would not keep him in pain."
"I don't think he will come back," Lucilla could not help saying; for she had a conviction
     that nothing more would come of it; but nevertheless she did stay in that afternoon, and
     received several visits, but saw nothing more of Mr Cavendish. It was rather vexatious, to tell
     the truth; for to see a man so near the point and not even to have the satisfaction of refusing
     him, is naturally aggravating to a woman. But Miss Marjoribanks had far too much philosophy as
     well as good sense to be vexed on that account with Mrs Chiley, who could not forgive herself,
     and to make up for the consequences of her unlucky visit, would have done anything in the
     world. The old lady herself returned in the afternoon to know the result, and was doubly vexed
     and distressed to hear he had not come back.
"I ought to be on the Archdeacon's side, Lucilla," she said, with tears in her eyes. "I know
     I ought, when it was I that brought him here: but I can't help feeling for the other, my dear.
     He always was so nice—a great deal nicer, to my way of thinking, than Mr Beverley; not to say
     but that the Archdeacon is very agreeable," Mrs Chiley added, recollecting herself; for in
     matters of that description a woman of experience is aware that she cannot be too particular
     about what she says; and supposing that Mr Cavendish did not come back, it would never do to
     prejudice Lucilla against the other candidate. "I never blamed Mr Cavendish about that Lake
     girl," the old lady continued. "It was not his fault, poor young man. I know he was always
     devoted to you in his heart; and to think he should come here the very first place as soon as
     he returned! I only wish I had had one of my headaches this morning, my dear, to keep me
     indoors for an old Malaprop. I do indeed, Lucilla. It would have served me right, and I should
     not have minded the pain."
"But indeed I don't wish anything of the sort," said Miss Marjoribanks. "I would not have the
     best man in the world at the cost of one of those dreadful headaches of yours. It is so good of
     you to say so; but you know very well it is not that sort of thing I am thinking of. If I were
     to go off and marry just now, after all that has been done to the drawing-room and everything,
     I should feel as if I were swindling papa; and it is the object of my life to be a comfort to
      him."
"Yes, my dear," said Mrs Chiley, "but we must not neglect your own interest for all that. I
     think it is most likely he will come this evening. He has just come from the Continent, you
     know, where people do make calls in the evening. I meant to have asked you to come down to us,
     as we shall be all alone——"
"All alone? Then where is the Archdeacon?" asked Lucilla.
"He has gone out to Sir John's for a day or two, my dear," said Mrs Chiley, and she could not
     understand the little gleam of intelligence that shot into Lucilla's eye. "He left word with me
     for you that he would be sure to be back before Thursday, but seeing Mr Cavendish when I came
     in made me forget all about it. He would be quite distressed, poor man! if he thought I had
     forgotten to give you his message. I won't ask you now to come down and cheer me up a little,
     Lucilla. I think poor Mr Cavendish is sure to come this evening, and I will not stand in his
     way again. But, my dear, you must send me a little note after he has been. Now promise. I shall
     be quite in suspense all night."
"Dear Mrs Chiley, I don't think he will come," said Miss Marjoribanks. "For my part, I think
     it was providential your coming to-day—for I am sure I don't know what I should have said to
     him. And it is so odd the Archdeacon should be away just at this moment. I feel quite sure he
     will not come to-night."
"There is nothing odd about the Archdeacon," said Mrs Chiley. "It was for to-day he was
     asked, you know; that is simple enough. If you are sure that you prefer the
     Archdeacon, my dear——" the old lady added, with an anxious look. But Lucilla cut short the
     inquiry, which was becoming too serious, by bringing her kind visitor a cup of tea.
"I hope you don't think I prefer any of them," said the injured maiden. "If I had been
     thinking of that sort of thing, you know, I need never have come home. If they would only let
     one do one's duty in peace and quiet," said Lucilla, with a sigh; and to tell the truth, both
     the ladies had occasion on that trying afternoon for the consolation of their cup of tea. But
     while they were thus refreshing themselves, a conversation of a very different kind, yet
     affecting the same interests, was being carried on not very far off, under the shelter of a
     little flowery arbour in another of the embowered gardens of Grange Lane, where the subject was
     just then being discussed from the other side.
