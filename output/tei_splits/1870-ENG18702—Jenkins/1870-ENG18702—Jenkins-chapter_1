I.—Ab initio.
The name of the father of Ginx's Baby was Ginx. By a not unexceptional coincidence, its
            mother was Mrs. Ginx. The gender of Ginx's Baby was masculine.
On the day when our hero was born, Mr. and Mrs. Ginx were living at Number Five,
            Rosemary Street, in the City of Westminster. The being then and there brought into the
            world was not the only human entity to which the title of “Ginx's Baby” was or had been
            appropriate. Ginx had been married to Betsy Hicks at St. John's, Westminster, on the
            twenty-fifth day of October, 18—, as appears from the “marriage lines” retained by Betsy
            Ginx, and carefully collated by me with the original register. Our hero was their
            thirteenth child. Patient inquiry has enabled me to verify the following history of
            their propagations. On July the twenty-fifth, the year after their marriage, Mrs. Ginx
            was safely delivered of a girl. No announcement of this appeared in the newspapers.
On the tenth of April following, the whole neighborhood, including Great Smith Street,
            Marsham Street, Great and Little Peter Streets, Regent Street, Horseferry Road, and
            Strutton Ground, was convulsed by the report that a woman named Ginx had given birth to
            “a triplet,” consisting of two girls and a boy. The news penetrated to Dean's Yard and
            the ancient school of Westminster. The Dean, who accepted nothing on trust, sent to
            verify the report, his messenger bearing a bundle of baby-clothes from the Dean's wife,
            who thought that the mother could scarcely have provided for so large an addition to her
            family. The schoolboys, on their way to the play-ground at Vincent Square, slyly
            diverged to have a look at the curiosity, paying sixpence a head to Mrs. Ginx's friend
            and crony, Mrs. Spittal, who pocketed the money, and said nothing about it to the sick
            woman. THIS birth was announced in all the newspapers throughout the kingdom, with the
            further news that Her Majesty the Queen had been graciously pleased to forward to Mrs.
            Ginx the sum of three pounds.
What could have possessed the woman I can't say, but about a twelvemonth after, Mrs.
            Ginx, with the assistance of two doctors hastily fetched from the hospital by her
            frightened husband, nearly perished in a fresh effort of maternity. This time two sons
            and two daughters fell to the lot of the happy pair. Her Majesty sent four pounds. But
            whatever peace there was at home, broils disturbed the street. The neighbors, who had
            sent for the police on the occasion, were angered by a notoriety which was becoming
            uncomfortable to them, and began to testify their feelings in various rough ways. Ginx
            removed his family to Rosemary Street, where, up to a year before the time when Ginx's
            Baby was born, his wife had continued to add to her offspring until the tale reached one
            dozen. It was then that Ginx affectionately but firmly begged that his wife would
            consider her family ways, since, in all conscience, he had fairly earned the blessedness
            of the man who hath his quiver full of them; and frankly gave her notice that, as his
            utmost efforts could scarcely maintain their existing family, if she ventured to present
            him with any more, either single, or twins, or triplets, or otherwise, he would most
            assuredly drown him, or her, or them in the water-butt, and take the consequences.
