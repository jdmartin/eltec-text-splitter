IX.—Good Samaritans, and Good-Samaritan Twopences.
At every breakfast-table in town next morning the report of the great Protestant
            meeting was read, and a further report, in leaded type, of the discovery of Ginx's Baby
            at a later period of the evening by a policeman. A pretty comment on the proceedings!
            The Good Samaritan put his patient on his ass and carried him to an inn; while the
            priest and the Levite, though the latter looked at him, at least let him alone. To have
            called a public meeting to discuss his fate before deserting him, would have been a
            refinement of inhumanity. The committee were rather ashamed when they met. Instant
            measures were taken to recover the child and place him in good hands. The duchess again
            provided baby-clothes. The next Sunday sermons were preached on his behalf in a score of
            chapels. The collections amounted to L 800, a sum increased by donations and
            subscriptions to the handsome total of L 1360 10s. 3 1/2d.
It will be seen hereafter what the committee did with the baby, but I happen to have an
            account of what became of the funds. They were spent as follows, according to a balance
            sheet never submitted to the subscribers:—
 Pounds s. d. Committee-rooms............. 45 0 0 2 Secretaries employed by the
              Committee................ 120 0 0 Agents, canvassing, etc.......... 88 6 2 Printing
              Notices, Placards, Pamphlets, a “Daily Bulletin of Health,” “Life of Ginx's Baby,”
              “Protestant Babyhood, a Tale,” “The Cradle of an Infant Martyr,” “A Snatched Brand,”
              and other Works issued by the Committee...... 596 13 5 Advertisements of Meetings,
              Sermons, etc............... 261 1 1 Legal Expenses............... 77 6 8
              Stationery................ 35 10 0 Postage, Firing, and Sundries....... 27 19 2
              ———————— Total Pounds 1251 16 6 
This left L 108 13s. 9 1/2d. for the baby's keep. No child could have been more
            thoroughly discussed, preached and written about, advertised, or advised by counsel; but
            his resources dwindled in proportion to these advantages. Benevolent subscribers too
            seldom examine the financial items of a report: had any who contributed to this fund
            seen the balance sheet they might have grudged that so little of their bounty went to
            make flesh, bone, and comfort for the object of it. A cynic would tell them that to look
            sharply after the disposal of their guerdon was half the gift. Their indifference was
            akin to that satirized by the poet—
 “Prodigus et stultus dedit quae spernit et odit.” 
In an age of luxury we are grown so luxurious as to be content to pay agents to do our
            good deeds for us; but they charge us three hundred per cent. for the privilege.
