X.—The Force—and a Specimen of its Weakness.
Ginx's baby had been discovered by a policeman swaddled in a penny paper, distressingly
            familiar to metropolitan travellers by rail. To omit the details of his treatment at the
            hands of that great institution, “The Force,” would be invidious. The member thereof who
            fell in with him was walking a back street, sighting doors with his bull's-eye. He was
            provided with massive boots, so that a thief could hear him coming a hundred yards off;
            he was personally tall and unwieldy, and a dexterous commissioner had invented a dress
            designed to enhance these qualities—a heavy coat, a cart-horse belt, and a round cape.
            He had been carefully drilled not to walk more than three miles an hour. He was not a
            little startled when the rays of his lamp fell upon a struggling newspaper, out of
            which, as from a shell, came mysterious cries. He took up a corner of the paper and
            peeped in upon the face of Ginx's Baby; then he occupied a quarter of an hour in
            embarrassing reflections. A nearly naked child crying in the cold ought to be housed as
            soon as possible, but X 99 was ON HIS BEAT, and those magic words chained him to certain
            limits. This, of course, was the rule under a former commissioner, and every one knows
            that such absurd strategy has been abolished in the existing regime. At that time,
            however, each watchman had his beat, to leave which was neglect of duty, except with a
            prisoner, and then it was neglect of all the householders within the magic compass. Had
            X 99 heard the baby crying across the street, which was part of the beat of X 101, he
            would have passed on with a cheery heart, for the case would have been beyond his
            jurisdiction. Unhappily the baby was on his beat, and he was delivered from the
            temptation of transferring it to the other by the appearance of X 101's bull's-eye not
            far off. What was he to do? The station was a mile away—the inspector would not arrive
            for an hour—and it would be awkward, if not undignified, to carry on his rounds a
            shouting baby wrapped in the largest daily paper. If he left it where it was, and it
            perished, he might be charged with murder. He was at his wits' end—but having got there,
            he resolved on the simplest process, namely to carry it to the station. No provision was
            made by the regulations of the force to protect a beat casually deserted even for a
            proper purpose. Hence, while X 99 was absent on his errand of mercy, the valuable shop
            of Messrs. Trinkett and Blouse, ecclesiastical tailors, was broken into, and several
            stoles, chasubles, altar-cloths and other decorative tapestries were appropriated to
            profane uses.
At the station the baby was disposed of according to rule. Due entry was first made in
            the night-book by the superintendent of all the particulars of his discovery. Some cold
            milk was then procured and poured down the child's throat. Afterwards, wrapped in a
            constable's cape, he was placed in a cell where, when the door was locked, he could not
            disturb the guardians of the peace.
The same night, in the next cell, an innocent gentleman, seized with an apoplexy in the
            street but entered in the charge-sheet as drunk and incapable, died like a dog.
