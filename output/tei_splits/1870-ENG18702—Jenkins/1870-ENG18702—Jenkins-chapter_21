XIII.â€”In transitu.
One night, near twelve o'clock, a shrewd tradesman, looking out of his shopdoor before
            he turned into bed, heard a cry which proceeded from a bundle on the pavement. This he
            discovered to be an infant wrapt in a potato-sack. He was quick enough to observe that
            it had been deftly laid over a line chiselled across the pavement to the corner of his
            house, which line he knew to be the boundary between his own parish of St. Simon Magus
            and the adjacent parish of St. Bartimeus. He took note, being a business man, of the
            exact position of the child's body in relation to this line, and then conveyed it to the
            workhouse of the other parish.
