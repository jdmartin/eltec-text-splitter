V.—Reasons and Resolves.
Ginx has been waiting through three chapters to explain his truculence upon the birth
            of his twelfth child. Much explanation is not necessary. When he looked round his nest
            and saw the many open mouths about him, he might well be appalled to have another added
            to them. His children were not chameleons, yet they were already forced to be content
            with a proportion of air for their food. And even the air was bad. They were pallid and
            pinched. How they were clad will ever be a mystery, save to the poor woman who strung
            the limp rags together and Him who watched the noble patience and sacrifice of a daily
            heroism. Of her own unsatisfied cravings, and the dense motherly horrors that sometimes
            brooded over her while she nursed these infants, let me refrain from speaking, since if
            as vividly depicted as they were real, you, Madam, could not endure to read of them. Her
            poor, unintelligent mind clung tenaciously to the controverted aphorism, “Where God
            sends mouths he sends food to fill them.” Believing that there was a God, and that He
            must be kind, she trusted in this as a truth, and perhaps an all-seeing eye reading some
            quaint characters on her simple heart, viewed them not too nearly, but had regard to
            their general import, for, as she expressed it, “Thank God! they had always been able to
            get along.”
In the rush and tumult of the world it is likely that the summum bonum of nine-tenths
            of mankind is embraced in that purely negative happiness—to get along. Not to perish: to
            open eyes, however wearily, on a new morning: to satisfy with something, no matter what,
            a craving appetite: to close eyes at night under some shadow or shelter: or, it may be,
            in certain ranks to walk another day free from bankruptcy or arrest: Thank Heaven, they
            are just able to get along!
Convinced that another infant straw would break his back, Ginx calmly proposed to
            disconcert physical, moral, and legal relations by drowning the straw Mrs. Ginx clinging
            to Number Twelve listened aghast. If a mother can forget her sucking child she was not
            that mother. The stream of her affections, though divided into twelve rills, would not
            have been exhausted in twenty-four, and her soul, forecasting its sorrow, yearned after
            that nonentity Number Thirteen. She pictured to herself the hapless strangeling borne
            away from her bosom by those strong arms, and—in fact she sobbed so that Ginx grew
            ashamed, and sought to comfort her by the suggestion that she could not have any more.
            But she knew better.
