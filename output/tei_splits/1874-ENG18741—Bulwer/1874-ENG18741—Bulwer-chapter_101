CHAPTER XIV.
“I knew I should find you in the Madeleine,” said Lemercier, “and I wished much to know when
      you had news from Duplessis. He and your fair fiancee are with your aunt still staying at
      Rochebriant?”
“Certainly. A pigeon arrived this morning with a few lines. All well there.”
“And Duplessis thinks, despite the war, that he shall be able, when the time comes, to pay
      Louvier the mortgage-sum?”
“He never doubts that. His credit in London is so good. But of course all works of
      improvement are stopped.”
“Pray did he mention me?—anything about the messenger who was to pierce the Prussian
      lines?”
“What! has the man not arrived? It is two weeks since he left.”
“The Uhlans have no doubt shot him—the assassins, and drunk up my 25,000 francs—the
      thieves.”
“I hope not. But in case of delay, Duplessis tells me I am to remit to you 2,000 francs for
      your present wants. I will send them to you this evening.”
“How the deuce do you possess such a sum?”
“I came from Brittany with a purse well filled. Of course I could have no scruples in
      accepting money from my destined father-in-law.”
“And you can spare this sum?”
“Certainly—the State now provides for me; I am in command of a Breton company.”
“True. Come and dine with me and De Breze.”
“Alas! I cannot. I have to see both the Vandemars before I return to the camp for the night.
      And now-hush—come this way (drawing Frederic further from De Breze), I have famous news for
      you. A sortie on a grand scale is imminent; in a few days we may hope for it.”
“I have heard that so often that I am incredulous.”
“Take it as a fact now.”
“What! Trochu has at last matured his plan?”
“He has changed its original design, which was to cut through the Prussian lines to Rouen,
      occupying there the richest country for supplies, guarding the left bank of the Seine and a
      watercourse to convoy them to Paris. The incidents of war prevented that: he has a better plan
      now. The victory of the army of the Loire at Orleans opens a new enterprise. We shall cut our
      way through the Prussians, join that army, and with united forces fall on the enemy at the
      rear. Keep this a secret as yet, but rejoice with me that we shall prove to the invaders what
      men who fight for their native soil can do under the protection of Heaven.”
“Fox, Fox, mon cheri,” said Lemercier, as he walked towards the cafe Riche with De Breze;
      “thou shalt have a festin de Balthazar under the protection of Heaven.”
