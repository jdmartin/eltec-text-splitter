CHAPTER XV.
On leaving Lemercier and De Breze, Savarin regained the Boulevard, and pausing every now and
      then to exchange a few words with acquaintances—the acquaintances of the genial author were
      numerous—turned into the quartier Chaussee d’Antin, and gaining a small neat house, with a
      richly-ornamented facade, mounted very clean, well-kept stairs to a third story. On one of the
      doors on the landing-place was nailed a card, inscribed, “Gustave Rameau, homme de lettres.”
      Certainly it is not usual in Paris thus to afficher one’s self as a “man of letters”? But
      Genius scorns what is usual. Had not Victor Hugo left in the hotel-books on the Rhine his
      designation “homme de lettres”? Did not the heir to one of the loftiest houses in the peerage
      of England, and who was also a first-rate amateur in painting, inscribe on his studio when in
      Italy, “—artiste”? Such examples, no doubt, were familiar to Gustave Rameau, and “homme de
      lettres” was on the scrap of pasteboard nailed to his door.
Savarin rang; the door opened, and Gustave appeared. The poet was, of course, picturesquely
      attired. In his day of fashion he had worn within doors a very pretty fanciful costume,
      designed after portraits of the young Raffaelle; that costume he had preserved—he wore it now.
      It looked very threadbare, and the pourpoint very soiled. But the beauty of the poet’s face
      had survived the lustre of the garments. True, thanks to absinthe, the cheeks had become
      somewhat puffy and bloated. Grey was distinctly visible in the long ebon tresses. But still
      the beauty of the face was of that rare type which a Thorwaldsen or a Gibson seeking a model
      for a Narcissus would have longed to fix into marble.
Gustave received his former chief with a certain air of reserved dignity; led him into his
      chamber, only divided by a curtain from his accommodation for washing and slumber, and placed
      him in an arm-chair beside a drowsy fire—fuel had already become very dear.
“Gustave,” said Savarin, “are you in a mood favourable to a little serious talk?”
“Serious talk from M. Savarin is a novelty too great not to command my profoundest
      interest.”
“Thank you,—and to begin: I who know the world and mankind advise you, who do not, never to
      meet a man who wishes to do you a kindness with an ungracious sarcasm. Irony is a weapon I
      ought to be skilled in, but weapons are used against enemies, and it is only a tyro who
      flourishes his rapier in the face of his friends.”
“I was not aware that M. Savarin still permitted me to regard him as a friend.”
“Because I discharged the duties of friend—remonstrated, advised, and warned. However, let
      bygones be bygones. I entreated you not to quit the safe shelter of the paternal roof. You
      insisted on doing so. I entreated you not to send to one of the most ferocious of the Red, or
      rather, the Communistic, journals, articles, very eloquent, no doubt, but which would most
      seriously injure you in the eyes of quiet, orderly people, and compromise your future literary
      career for the sake of a temporary flash in the pan during a very evanescent period of
      revolutionary excitement. You scorned my adjurations, but at all events you had the grace not
      to append your true name to those truculent effusions. In literature, if literature revive in
      France, we two are henceforth separated. But I do not forego the friendly interest I took in
      you in the days when you were so continually in my house. My wife, who liked you so cordially,
      implored me to look after you during her absence from Paris, and, enfin, mon pauvre garcon, it
      would grieve me very much if, when she comes back, I had to say to her, ‘Gustave Rameau has
      thrown away the chance of redemption and of happiness which you deemed was secure to him.’ A
      l’oeil malade, la lumiere nuit.”
So saying, he held out his hand kindly.
Gustave, who was far from deficient in affectionate or tender impulses, took the hand
      respectfully, and pressed it warmly.
“Forgive me if I have been ungracious, M. Savarin, and vouchsafe to hear my
      explanation.”
“Willingly, mon garcon.”
“When I became convalescent, well enough to leave my father’s house, there were
      circumstances which compelled me to do so. A young man accustomed to the life of a garcon
      can’t be always tied to his mother’s apron-strings.”
“Especially if the apron-pocket does not contain a bottle of absinthe,” said Savarin, drily.
      “You may well colour and try to look angry; but I know that the doctor strictly forbade the
      use of that deadly liqueur, and enjoined your mother to keep strict watch on your liability to
      its temptations. And hence one cause of your ennui under the paternal roof. But if there you
      could not imbibe absinthe, you were privileged to enjoy a much diviner intoxication. There you
      could have the foretaste of domestic bliss,—the society of the girl you loved, and who was
      pledged to become your wife. Speak frankly. Did not that society itself begin to be
      wearisome?”
“No,” cried Gustave, eagerly, “it was not wearisome—”
“Yes, but—”
“But it could not be all-sufficing to a soul of fire like mine.”
“Hem,” murmured Savarin—“a soul of fire! This is very interesting; pray go on.”
“The calm, cold, sister-like affection of a childish undeveloped nature, which knew no
      passion except for art, and was really so little emancipated from the nursery as to take for
      serious truth all the old myths of religion—such companionship may be very soothing and
      pleasant when one is lying on one’s sofa, and must live by rule, but when one regains the
      vigour of youth and health—”
“Do not pause,” said Savarin, gazing with more compassion than envy on that melancholy
      impersonation of youth and health. “When one regains that vigour of which I myself have no
      recollection, what happens?”
“The thirst for excitement, the goads of ambition, the irresistible claims which the world
      urges upon genius, return.”
“And that genius, finding itself at the North Pole amid Cimmerian darkness in the atmosphere
      of a childish intellect—in other words, the society of a pure-minded virgin, who, though a
      good romance-writer, writes nothing but what a virgin may read, and, though a bel esprit, says
      her prayers and goes to church—then genius—well, pardon my ignorance, what does genius
      do?”
“Oh, M. Savarin, M. Savarin! don’t let us talk any more. There is no sympathy between us. I
      cannot bear that bloodless, mocking, cynical mode of dealing with grand emotions, which
      belongs to the generation of the Doctrinaires. I am not a Thiers or a Guizot.”
“Good heavens! who ever accused you of being either? I did not mean to be cynical.
      Mademoiselle Cicogna has often said I am, but I did not think you would. Pardon me. I quite
      agree with the philosopher who asserted that the wisdom of the past was an imposture, that the
      meanest intellect now living is wiser than the greatest intellect which is buried in Pere la
      Chaise; because the dwarf who follows the giant, when perched on the shoulders of the giant,
      sees farther than the giant ever could. Allez. I go in for your generation. I abandon Guizot
      and Thiers. Do condescend and explain to my dull understanding, as the inferior mortal of a
      former age, what are the grand emotions which impel a soul of fire in your wiser generation.
      The thirst of excitement—what excitement? The goads of ambition—what ambition?”
“A new social system is struggling from the dissolving elements of the old one, as, in the
      fables of priestcraft, the soul frees itself from the body which has become ripe for the
      grave. Of that new system I aspire to be a champion—a leader. Behold the excitement that
      allures me, the ambition that goads.”
“Thank you,” said Savarin, meekly; “I am answered. I recognise the dwarf perched on the back
      of the giant. Quitting these lofty themes, I venture to address to you now one simple
      matter-of-fact question: How about Mademoiselle Cicogna? Do you think you can induce her to
      transplant herself to the new social system, which I presume will abolish, among other
      obsolete myths, the institution of marriage?”
“M. Savarin, your question offends me. Theoretically I am opposed to the existing
      superstitions that encumber the very simple principle by which may be united two persons so
      long as they desire the union, and separated so soon as the union becomes distasteful to
      either. But I am perfectly aware that such theories would revolt a young lady like
      Mademoiselle Cicogna. I have never even named them to her, and our engagement holds good.”
“Engagement of marriage? No period for the ceremony fixed?”
“That is not my fault. I urged it on Isaura with all earnestness before I left my father’s
      house.”
“That was long after the siege had begun. Listen to me, Gustave. No persuasion of mine or my
      wife’s, nor Mrs. Morley’s, could induce Isaura to quit Paris while it was yet time. She said
      very simply that, having pledged her truth and hand to you, it would be treason to honour and
      duty if she should allow any considerations for herself to be even discussed so long as you
      needed her presence. You were then still suffering, and, though convalescent, not without
      danger of a relapse. And your mother said to her—I heard the words: ‘‘Tis not for his bodily
      health I could dare to ask you to stay, when every man who can afford it is sending away his
      wife, sisters, daughters. As for that, I should suffice to tend him; but if you go, I resign
      all hope for the health of his mind and his soul.’ I think at Paris there may be female poets
      and artists whom that sort of argument would not have much influenced. But it so happens that
      Isaura is not a Parisienne. She believes in those old myths which you think fatal to
      sympathies with yourself; and those old myths also lead her to believe that where a woman has
      promised she will devote her life to a man, she cannot forsake him when told by his mother
      that she is necessary to the health of his mind and his soul. Stay. Before you interrupt me,
      let me finish what I have to say. It appears that, so soon as your bodily health was improved,
      you felt that your mind and your soul could take care of themselves; and certainly it seems to
      me that Isaura Cicogna is no longer of the smallest use to either.”
Rameau was evidently much disconcerted by this speech. He saw what Savarin was driving
      at—the renunciation of all bond between Isaura and himself. He was not prepared for such
      renunciation. He still felt for the Italian as much of love as he could feel for any woman who
      did not kneel at his feet, as at those of Apollo condescending to the homage of Arcadian
      maids. But on the one hand, he felt that many circumstances had occurred since the disaster at
      Sedan to render Isaura a very much less desirable partie than she had been when he had first
      wrung from her the pledge of betrothal. In the palmy times of a Government in which literature
      and art commanded station and insured fortune, Isaura, whether as authoress or singer, was a
      brilliant marriage for Gustave Rameau. She had also then an assured and competent, if modest,
      income. But when times change, people change with them. As the income for the moment (and
      Heaven only can say how long that moment might last), Isaura’s income had disappeared. It will
      be recollected that Louvier had invested her whole fortune in the houses to be built in the
      street called after his name. No houses, even when built, paid any rent now. Louvier had
      quitted Paris; and Isaura could only be subsisting upon such small sum as she might have had
      in hand before the siege commenced. All career in such literature and art as Isaura adorned
      was at a dead stop. Now, to do Rameau justice, he was by no means an avaricious or mercenary
      man. But he yearned for modes of life to which money was essential. He liked his “comforts;”
      and his comforts included the luxuries of elegance and show-comforts not to be attained by
      marriage with Isaura under existing circumstances.
Nevertheless it is quite true that he had urged her to marry him at once, before he had
      quitted his father’s house; and her modest shrinking from such proposal, however excellent the
      reasons for delay in the national calamities of the time, as well as the poverty which the
      calamity threatened, had greatly wounded his amour propre. He had always felt that her
      affection for him was not love; and though he could reconcile himself to that conviction when
      many solid advantages were attached to the prize of her love, and when he was ill, and
      penitent, and maudlin, and the calm affection of a saint seemed to him infinitely preferable
      to the vehement passion of a sinner,—yet when Isaura was only Isaura by herself—Isaura minus
      all the et cetera which had previously been taken into account—the want of adoration for
      himself very much lessened her value.
Still, though he acquiesced in the delayed fulfilment of the engagement with Isaura, he had
      no thought of withdrawing from the engagement itself, and after a slight pause he replied:
      “You do me great injustice if you suppose that the occupations to which I devote myself render
      me less sensible to the merits of Mademoiselle Cicogna, or less eager for our union. On the
      contrary, I will confide to you—as a man of the world—one main reason why I quitted my
      father’s house, and why I desire to keep my present address a secret. Mademoiselle Caumartin
      conceived for me a passion—a caprice—which was very flattering for a time, but which latterly
      became very troublesome. Figure to yourself—she daily came to our house while I was lying ill,
      and with the greatest difficulty my mother got her out of it. That was not all. She pestered
      me with letters containing all sorts of threats—nay, actually kept watch at the house; and one
      day when I entered the carriage with my mother and Signora Venosta for a drive in the Bois
      (meaning to call for Isaura by the way), she darted to the carriage-door, caught my hand, and
      would have made a scene if the coachman had given her leave to do so. Luckily he had the tact
      to whip on his horses, and we escaped. I had some little difficulty in convincing the Signora
      Venosta that the girl was crazed. But I felt the danger I incurred of her coming upon me some
      moment when in company with Isaura, and so I left my father’s house; and naturally wishing to
      steer clear of this vehement little demon till I am safely married, I keep my address a secret
      from all who are likely to tell her of it.”
“You do wisely if you are really afraid of her, and cannot trust your nerves to say to her
      plainly, ‘I am engaged to be married; all is at an end between us. Do not force me to employ
      the police to protect myself from unwelcome importunities.’”
“Honestly speaking, I doubt if I have the nerve to do that, and I doubt still more if it
      would be of any avail. It is very ennuayant to be so passionately loved; but, que voulez vous?
      It is my fate.”
“Poor martyr! I condole with you: and, to say truth, it was chiefly to warn you of
      Mademoiselle Caumartin’s pertinacity that I call this evening.”
Here Savarin related the particulars of his rencontre with Julie, and concluded by saying:
      “I suppose I may take your word of honour that you will firmly resist all temptation to renew
      a connection which would be so incompatible with the respect due to your fiancee? Fatherless
      and protectorless as Isaura is, I feel bound to act as a virtual guardian to one in whom my
      wife takes so deep an interest, and to whom, as she thinks, she had some hand in bringing
      about your engagement: she is committed to no small responsibilities. Do not allow poor Julie,
      whom I sincerely pity, to force on me the unpleasant duty of warning your fiancee of the
      dangers to which she might be subjected by marriage with an Adonis whose fate it is to be so
      profoundly beloved by the sex in general, and ballet nymphs in particular.”
“There is no chance of so disagreeable a duty being incumbent on you, M. Savarin. Of course,
      what I myself have told you in confidence is sacred.”
“Certainly. There are things in the life of a garcon before marriage which would be an
      affront to the modesty of his fiancee to communicate and discuss. But then those things must
      belong exclusively to the past and cast no shadow over the future. I will not interrupt you
      further. No doubt you have work for the night before you. Do the Red journalists for whom you
      write pay enough to support you in these terribly dear times?”
“Scarcely. But I look forward to wealth and fame in the future. And you?”
“I just escape starvation. If the siege last much longer, it is not of the gout I shall die.
      Good-night to you.”
