CHAPTER XVIII.
The streets swarmed with the populace troops as they passed to their destination. Among
      those of the Mobiles who especially caught the eye were two companies in which Enguerrand de
      Vandemar and Victor de Mauleon commanded. In the first were many young men of good family, or
      in the higher ranks of the bourgeoisie, known to numerous lookers-on; there was something
      inspiriting in their gay aspects, and in the easy carelessness of their march. Mixed with this
      company, however, and forming of course the bulk of it, were those who belonged to the lower
      classes of the population; and though they too might seem gay to an ordinary observer, the
      gaiety was forced. Many of them were evidently not quite sober; and there was a disorderly
      want of soldiership in their mien and armament which inspired distrust among such vieux
      moustaches as, too old for other service than that of the ramparts, mixed here and there among
      the crowd.
But when De Mauleon’s company passed, the vieux moustaches impulsively touched each other.
      They recognised the march of well-drilled men; the countenances grave and severe, the eyes not
      looking on this side and that for admiration, the step regularly timed; and conspicuous among
      these men the tall stature and calm front of the leader.
“These fellows will fight well,” growled a vieux moustache, “where did they fish out their
      leader?”
“Don’t you know?” said a bourgeois. “Victor de Mauleon. He won the cross in Algeria for
      bravery. I recollect him when I was very young; the very devil for women and fighting.”
“I wish there were more such devils for fighting and fewer for women,” growled again le
      vieux moustache.
One incessant roar of cannon all the night of the 29th. The populace had learned the names
      of the French cannons, and fancied they could distinguish the several sounds of their thunder.
      “There spits ‘Josephine’!” shouts an invalid sailor. “There howls our own ‘Populace’!” cries a
      Red Republican from Belleville.

 [The “Populace” had been contributed to the artillery, sou a sou, by the working class.]
      
“There sings ‘Le Chatiment’!” laughed Gustave Rameau, who was now become an enthusiastic
      admirer of the Victor Hugo he had before affected to despise. And all the while, mingled with
      the roar of the cannon, came, far and near from the streets, from the ramparts, the gusts of
      song—song sometimes heroic, sometimes obscene, more often carelessly joyous. The news of
      General Vinoy’s success during the early part of the day had been damped by the evening report
      of Ducrot’s delay in crossing the swollen Marne. But the spirits of the Parisians rallied from
      a momentary depression on the excitement at night of that concert of martial music.
During that night, close under the guns of the double redoubt of Gravelle and La
      Faisanderie, eight pontoon-bridges were thrown over the Marne; and at daybreak the first
      column of the third army under Blanchard and Renoult crossed with all their artillery, and,
      covered by the fire of the double redoubts, of the forts of Vincennes, Nogent, Rossuey, and
      the batteries of Mont Avron, had an hour before noon carried the village of Champingy, and the
      first echelon of the important plateau of Villiers, and were already commencing the work of
      intrenchment, when, rallying from the amaze of a defeat, the German forces burst upon them,
      sustained by fresh batteries. The Prussian pieces of artillery established at Chennevieres and
      at Neuilly opened fire with deadly execution; while a numerous infantry, descending from the
      intrenchments of Villiers, charged upon the troops under Renoult. Among the French in that
      strife were Enguerrand and the Mobiles of which he was in command. Dismayed by the unexpected
      fire, these Mobiles gave way, as indeed did many of the line. Enguerrand rushed forward to the
      front: “On, mes enfans, on! What will our mothers and wives say of us if we fly? Vive la
      France!—On!” Among those of the better class in that company there rose a shout of applause,
      but it found no sympathy among the rest. They wavered, they turned. “Will you suffer me to go
      on alone, countrymen?” cried Enguerrand; and alone he rushed on towards the Prussian
      line—rushed, and fell, mortally wounded, by a musket-ball. “Revenge, revenge!” shouted some of
      the foremost; “Revenge!” shouted those in the rear; and, so shouting, turned on their heels
      and fled. But ere they could disperse they encountered the march, steadfast though rapid, of
      the troop led by Victor de Mauleon. “Poltroons!” he thundered, with the sonorous depth of his
      strong voice, “halt and turn, or my men shall fire on you as deserters.”
“Va, citoyen,” said one fugitive, an officer-popularly elected, because he was the loudest
      brawler in the club of the Salle Favre,—we have seen him before—Charles, the brother of Armand
      Monnier;—“men can’t fight when they despise their generals. It is our generals who are
      poltroons and fools both.”
“Carry my answer to the ghosts of cowards,” cried De Mauldon, and shot the man dead.
His followers, startled and cowed by the deed, and the voice and the look of the
      death-giver, halted. The officers, who had at first yielded to the panic of their men, took
      fresh courage, and finally led the bulk of the troop back to their post “enlevis a la
      baionette,” to use the phrase of a candid historian of that day.
Day, on the whole, not inglorious to France. It was the first, if it was the last, really
      important success of the besieged. They remained masters of the ground, the Prussians leaving
      to them the wounded and the dead.
That night what crowds thronged from Paris to the top of the Montmartre heights, from the
      observatory on which the celebrated inventor Bazin had lighted up, with some magical electric
      machine, all the plain of Gennevilliers from Mont Valerien to the Fort de la Briche! The
      splendour of the blaze wrapped the great city;—distinctly above the roofs of the houses soared
      the Dome des Invalides, the spires of Notre Dame, the giant turrets of the Tuileries;—and died
      away on resting on the infames scapulos Acroceraunia, the “thunder crags” of the heights
      occupied by the invading army.
Lemercier, De Breze, and the elder Rameau—who, despite his peaceful habits and grey hairs,
      insisted on joining in the aid of la patrie—were among the National Guards attached to the
      Fort de la Briche and the neighbouring eminence, and they met in conversation.
“What a victory we have had!” said the old Rameau.
“Rather mortifying to your son, M. Rameau,” said LeMercier.
“Mortifying to my son, sir!—the victory of his countrymen. What do you mean?”
“I had the honour to hear M. Gustave the other night at the club de la Vengeance.”
“Bon Dieu! do you frequent those tragic reunions?” asked De Breze.
“They are not at all tragic: they are the only comedies left us, as one must amuse one’s
      self somewhere, and the club de la Vengeance is the prettiest thing of the sort going. I quite
      understand why it should fascinate a poet like your son, M. Rameau. It is held in a salle de
      cafe chantant—style Louis Quinze—decorated with a pastoral scene from Watteau. I and my dog
      Fox drop in. We hear your son haranguing. In what poetical sentences he despaired of the
      Republic! The Government (he called them les charlatans de l’Hotel de Ville) were imbeciles.
      They pretended to inaugurate a revolution, and did not employ the most obvious of
      revolutionary means. There Fox and I pricked up our ears: what were those means? Your son
      proceeded to explain: ‘All mankind were to be appealed to against individual interests. The
      commerce of luxury was to be abolished. Clearly luxury was not at the command of all mankind.
      Cafes and theatres were to be closed for ever—all mankind could not go to cafes and theatres.
      It was idle to expect the masses to combine for anything in which the masses had not an
      interest in common. The masses had no interest in any property that did not belong to the
      masses. Programmes of the society to be founded, called the Ligue Cosmopolite Democratique,
      should be sent at once into all the States of the civilised world—how? by balloons. Money
      corrupts the world as now composed: but the money at the command of the masses could buy all
      the monarchs and courtiers and priests of the universe.’ At that sentiment, vehemently
      delivered, the applauses were frantic, and Fox in his excitement began to bark. At the sound
      of his bark one man cried out, ‘That’s a Prussian!’ another, ‘Down with the spy!’ another,
      ‘There’s an aristo present—he keeps alive a dog which would be a week’s meal for a family!’ I
      snatch up Fox at the last cry, and clasp him to a bosom protected by the uniform of the
      National Guard.
“When the hubbub had subsided, your son, M. Rameau, proceeded, quitting mankind in general,
      and arriving at the question in particular most interesting to his audience—the mobilisation
      of the National Guard; that is, the call upon men who like talking and hate fighting to talk
      less and fight more. ‘It was the sheerest tyranny to select a certain number of free citizens
      to be butchered. If the fight was for the mass, there ought to be la levee en masse. If one
      did not compel everybody to fight, why should anybody fight?’ Here the applause again became
      vehement, and Fox again became indiscreet. I subdued Fox’s bark into a squeak by pulling his
      ears. ‘What!’ cries your poet-son, ‘la levee en masse gives us fifteen millions of soldiers,
      with which we could crush, not Prussia alone, but the whole of Europe. (Immense sensation.)
      Let us, then, resolve that the charlatans of the Hotel de Ville are incapable of delivering us
      from the Prussians; that they are deposed; that the Ligue of the Democratie Cosmopolite is
      installed; that meanwhile the Commune shall be voted the Provisional Government, and shall
      order the Prussians to retire within three days from the soil of Paris.’
“Pardon me this long description, my dear M. Rameau, but I trust I have satisfactorily
      explained why victory obtained in the teeth of his eloquent opinions, if gratifying to him as
      a Frenchman, must be mortifying to him as a politician.”
The old Rameau sighed, hung his head, and crept away. While, amid this holiday illumination,
      the Parisians enjoyed the panorama before them, the Freres Chretiens and the attendants of the
      various ambulances were moving along the battle-plains; the first in their large-brimmed hats
      and sable garbs, the last in strange motley costume, many of them in glittering uniform—all
      alike in their serene indifference to danger; often pausing to pick up among the dead their
      own brethren who had been slaughtered in the midst of their task. Now and then they came on
      sinister forms apparently engaged in the same duty of tending the wounded and dead, but in
      truth murderous plunderers, to whom the dead and the dying were equal harvests. Did the
      wounded man attempt to resist the foul hands searching for their spoil, they added another
      wound more immediately mortal, grinning as they completed on the dead the robbery they had
      commenced on the dying.
Raoul de Vandemar had been all the earlier part of the day with the assistants of the
      ambulance over which he presided, attached to the battalions of the National Guard in a
      quarter remote from that in which his brother had fought and fallen. When those troops, later
      in the day, were driven from the Montmedy plateau, which they had at first carried, Raoul
      repassed towards the plateau at Villiers, on which the dead lay thickest. On the way he heard
      a vague report of the panic which had dispersed the Mobiles of whom Enguerrand was in command,
      and of Enguerrand’s vain attempt to inspirit them. But his fate was not known. There, at
      midnight, Raoul is still searching among the ghastly heaps and pools of blood, lighted from
      afar by the blaze from the observatory of Montmartre, and more near at hand by the bivouac
      fires extended along the banks to the left of the Marne, while everywhere about the field
      flitted the lanterns of the Frere Chretiens. Suddenly, in the dimness of a spot cast into
      shadow by an incompleted earthwork, he observed a small sinister figure perched on the breast
      of some wounded soldier, evidently not to succour. He sprang forward and seized a
      hideous-looking urchin, scarcely twelve years old, who held in one hand a small crystal
      locket, set in filigree gold, torn from the soldier’s breast, and lifted high in the other a
      long case-knife. At a glance Raoul recognised the holy relic he had given to Enguerrand, and,
      flinging the precocious murderer to be seized by his assistants, he cast himself beside his
      brother. Enguerrand still breathed, and his languid eyes brightened as he knew the dear
      familiar face. He tried to speak, but his voice failed, and he shook his head sadly, but still
      with a faint smile on his lips. They lifted him tenderly, and placed him on a litter. The
      movement, gentle as it was, brought back pain, and with the pain strength to mutter, “My
      mother—-I would see her once more.”
As at daybreak the loungers on Montmartre and the ramparts descended into the streets—most
      windows in which were open, as they had been all night, with anxious female faces peering
      palely down-they saw the conveyances of the ambulances coming dismally along, and many an eye
      turned wistfully towards the litter on which lay the idol of the pleasure-loving Paris, with
      the dark, bareheaded figure walking beside it,—onwards, onwards, till it reached the Hotel de
      Vandemar, and a woman’s cry was heard at the entrance—the mother’s cry, “My son! my son!”
