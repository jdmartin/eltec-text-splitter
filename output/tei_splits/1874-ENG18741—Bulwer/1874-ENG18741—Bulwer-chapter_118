CHAPTER XIII.
In proportion to the nearer roar of the besiegers’ cannon, and the sharper gripe of famine
      within the walls, the Parisians seemed to increase their scorn for the skill of the enemy, and
      their faith in the sanctity of the capital. All false news was believed as truth; all truthful
      news abhorred as falsehood. Listen to the groups round the cafes. “The Prussian funds have
      fallen three per cent. at Berlin,” says a threadbare ghost of the Bourse (he had been a clerk
      of Louvier’s). “Ay,” cries a National Guard, “read extracts from La Liberte. The barbarians
      are in despair. Nancy is threatened, Belfort is freed. Bourbaki is invading Baden. Our fleets
      are pointing their cannon upon Hamburg. Their country endangered, their retreat cut off, the
      sole hope of Bismarck and his trembling legions is to find a refuge in Paris. The increasing
      fury of the bombardment is a proof of their despair.”
“In that case,” whispered Savarin to De Breze, “suppose we send a flag of truce to
      Versailles with a message from Trochu that, on disgorging their conquests, ceding the left
      bank of the Rhine, and paying the expenses of the war, Paris, ever magnanimous to the
      vanquished; will allow the Prussians to retire.”
“The Prussians! Retire!” cried Edgar Ferrier, catching the last word and glancing fiercely
      at Savarin. “What Prussian spy have we among us? Not one of the barbarians shall escape. We
      have but to dismiss the traitors who have usurped the government, proclaim the Commune and the
      rights of labour, and we give birth to a Hercules that even in its cradle can strangle the
      vipers.”
Edgar Ferrier was the sole member of his political party among the group which he thus
      addressed; but such was the terror which the Communists already began to inspire among the
      bourgeoisie that no one volunteered a reply.
Savarin linked his arm in De Breze’s, and prudently drew him off.
“I suspect,” said the former, “that we shall soon have worse calamities to endure than the
      Prussian obus and the black loaf. The Communists will have their day.”
“I shall be in my grave before then,” said De Breze, in hollow accents. “It is twenty-four
      hours since I spent my last fifty sous on the purchase of a rat, and I burnt the legs of my
      bedstead for the fuel by which that quadruped was roasted.”
“Entre nous, my poor friend, I am much in the same condition,” said Savarin, with a ghastly
      attempt at his old pleasant laugh. “See how I am shrunken! My wife would be unfaithful to the
      Savarin of her dreams if she accepted a kiss from the slender gallant you behold in me. But I
      thought you were in the National Guard, and therefore had not to vanish into air.”
“I was a National Guard, but I could not stand the hardships, and being above the age, I
      obtained my exemption. As to pay, I was then too proud to claim my wage of 1 franc 25
      centimes. I should not be too proud now. Ah, blessed be Heaven! here comes Lemercier; he owes
      me a dinner—he shall pay it.”
“Bon jour, my dear Frederic! How handsome you look in your kepi! Your uniform is brilliantly
      fresh from the soil of powder. What a contrast to the tatterdemalions of the Line!”
“I fear,” said Lemercier, ruefully, “that my costume will not look so well a day or two
      hence. I have just had news that will no doubt seem very glorious—in the news papers. But then
      newspapers are not subjected to cannonballs.”
“What do you mean?” answered De Breze.
“I met, as I emerged from my apartment a few minutes ago, that fire-eater, Victor de
      Mauleon, who always contrives to know what passes at headquarters. He told me that
      preparations are being made for a great sortie. Most probably the announcement will appear in
      a proclamation tomorrow, and our troops march forth to-morrow night. The National Guard (fools
      and asses who have been yelling out for decisive action) are to have their wish, and to be
      placed in the van of battle,—amongst the foremost, the battalion in which I am enrolled.
      Should this be our last meeting on earth, say that Frederic Lemercier has finished his part in
      life with eclat.”
“Gallant friend,” said De Breze, feebly seizing him by the arm, “if it be true that thy
      mortal career is menaced, die as thou hast lived. An honest man leaves no debt unpaid. Thou
      owest me a dinner.”
“Alas! ask of me what is possible. I will give thee three, however, if I survive and regain
      my rentes. But today I have not even a mouse to share with Fox.”
“Fox lives then?” cried De Breze, with sparkling hungry eyes.
“Yes. At present he is making the experiment how long an animal can live without food.”
“Have mercy upon him, poor beast! Terminate his pangs by a noble death. Let him save thy
      friends and thyself from starving. For myself alone I do not plead; I am but an amateur in
      polite literature. But Savarin, the illustrious Savarin,—in criticism the French Longinus—in
      poetry the Parisian Horace—in social life the genius of gaiety in pantaloons,—contemplate his
      attenuated frame! Shall he perish for want of food while thou hast such superfluity in thy
      larder? I appeal to thy heart, thy conscience, thy patriotism. What, in the eyes of France,
      are a thousand Foxes compared to a single Savarin?”
“At this moment,” sighed Savarin, “I could swallow anything, however nauseous, even thy
      flattery, De Breze. But, my friend Frederic, thou goest into battle—what will become of Fox if
      thou fall? Will he not be devoured by strangers? Surely it were a sweeter thought to his
      faithful heart to furnish a repast to thy friends?—his virtues acknowledged, his memory
      blest!”
“Thou dost look very lean, my poor Savarin! And how hospitable thou wert when yet plump!”
      said Frederic, pathetically. “And certainly, if I live, Fox will starve; if I am slain, Fox
      will be eaten. Yet, poor Fox, dear Fox, who lay on my breast when I was frostbitten. No; I
      have not the heart to order him to the spit for you. Urge it not.”
“I will save thee that pang,” cried De Breze. “We are close by thy rooms. Excuse me for a
      moment: I will run in and instruct thy bonne.”
So saying, he sprang forward with an elasticity of step which no one could have anticipated
      from his previous languor. Frederic would have followed, but Savarin clung to him, whimpering:
      “Stay; I shall fall like an empty sack, without the support of thine arm, young hero. Pooh! of
      course De Breze is only joking—a pleasant joke. Hist! a secret: he has moneys, and means to
      give us once more a dinner at his own cost, pretending that we dine on thy dog. He was
      planning this when thou camest up. Let him have his joke, and we shall have a festin de
      Balthazar.”
“Hein!” said Frederic, doubtfully; “thou art sure he has no designs upon Fox?”
“Certainly not, except in regaling us. Donkey is not bad, but it is 14 francs a pound. A
      pullet is excellent, but it is 30 francs. Trust to De Breze; we shall have donkey and pullet,
      and Fox shall feast upon the remains.”
Before Frederic could reply, the two men were jostled and swept on by a sudden rush of a
      noisy crowd in their rear. They could but distinguish the words—Glorious
      news—victory—Faidherbe—Chanzy. But these words were sufficient to induce them to join
      willingly in the rush. They forgot their hunger; they forget Fox. As they were hurried on,
      they learned that there was a report of a complete defeat of the Prussians by Faidherbe near
      Amiens, of a still more decided one on the Loire by Chanzy. These generals, with armies
      flushed with triumph, were pressing on towards Paris to accelerate the destruction of the
      hated Germans. How the report arose no one exactly knew.
All believed it, and were making their way to the Hotel de Ville to hear it formally
      confirmed.
Alas! before, they got there they were met by another crowd returning, dejected but angry.
      No such news had reached the Government. Chanzy and Faidherbe were no doubt fighting
      bravely,—with every probability of success; but—
The Parisian imagination required no more. “We should always be defeating the enemy,” said
      Savarin, “if there were not always a but;” and his audience, who, had he so expressed himself
      ten minutes before, would have torn him to pieces, now applauded the epigram; and with
      execrations on Trochu, mingled with many a peal of painful sarcastic laughter, vociferated and
      dispersed.
As the two friends sauntered back towards the part of the Boulevards on which De Breze had
      parted company with them, Savarin quitted Lemercier suddenly, and crossed the street to accost
      a small party of two ladies and two men who were on their way to the Madeleine. While he was
      exchanging a few words with them, a young couple, arm in arm, passed by Lemercier,—the man in
      the uniform of the National Guard-uniform as unsullied as Frederic’s, but with as little of a
      military air as can well be conceived. His gait was slouching; his head bent downwards. He did
      not seem to listen to his companion, who was talking with quickness and vivacity, her fair
      face radiant with smiles. Lemercier looked at them as they passed by. “Sur mon ame,” muttered
      Frederic to himself, “surely that is la belle Julie; and she has got back her truant poet at
      last.”
While Lemercier thus soliloquised, Gustave, still looking down, was led across the street by
      his fair companion, and into the midst of the little group with whom Savarin had paused to
      speak. Accidentally brushing against Savarin himself, he raised his eyes with a start, about
      to mutter some conventional apology, when Julie felt the arm on which she leant tremble
      nervously. Before him stood Isaura, the Countess de Vandemar by her side; her two other
      companions, Raoul and the Abbe Vertpre, a step or two behind.
Gustave uncovered, bowed low, and stood mute and still for a moment, paralysed by surprise
      and the chill of a painful shame.
Julie’s watchful eyes, following his, fixed themselves on the same face. On the instant she
      divined the truth. She beheld her to whom she had owed months of jealous agony, and over whom,
      poor child, she thought she had achieved a triumph. But the girl’s heart was so instinctively
      good that the sense of triumph was merged in a sense of compassion. Her rival had lost
      Gustave. To Julie the loss of Gustave was the loss of all that makes life worth having. On her
      part, Isaura was moved not only by the beauty of Julie’s countenance, but still more by the
      childlike ingenuousness of its expression.
So, for the first time in their lives, met the child and the stepchild of Louise Duval. Each
      so deserted, each so left alone and inexperienced amid the perils of the world, with fates so
      different, typifying orders of womanhood so opposed. Isaura was naturally the first to break
      the silence that weighed like a sensible load on all present.
She advanced towards Rameau, with sincere kindness in her look and tone.
“Accept my congratulations,” she said, with a grave smile. “Your mother informed me last
      evening of your nuptials. Without doubt I see Madame Gustave Rameau;”—and she extended her
      hand towards Julie. The poor Ondine shrank back for a moment, blushing up to her temples. It
      was the first hand which a woman of spotless character had extended to her since she had lost
      the protection of Madame Surville. She touched it timidly, humbly, then drew her bridegroom
      on; and with head more downcast than Gustave, passed through the group without a word.
She did not speak to Gustave till they were out of sight and hearing of those they had left.
      Then, pressing his arm passionately, she said: “And that is the demoiselle thou halt resigned
      for me! Do not deny it. I am so glad to have seen her; it has done me so much good. How it has
      deepened, purified, my love for thee! I have but one return to make; but that is my whole
      life. Thou shalt never have cause to blame me—never—never!”
Savarin looked very grave and thoughtful when he rejoined Lemercier.
“Can I believe my eyes?” said Frederic. “Surely that was Julie Caumartin leaning on Gustave
      Rameau’s arm! And had he the assurance, so accompanied, to salute Madame de Vandemar, and
      Mademoiselle Cicogna, to whom I understood he was affianced? Nay, did I not see Mademoiselle
      shake hands with the Ondine? or am I under one of the illusions which famine is said to
      engender in the brain?”
“I have not strength now to answer all these interrogatives. I have a story to tell; but I
      keep it for dinner. Let us hasten to thy apartment. De Breze is doubtless there waiting
      us.”
