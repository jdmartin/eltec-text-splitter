CHAPTER VI.
The Contessa di Rimini received her visitors in a boudoir furnished with much apparent
      simplicity, but a simplicity by no means inexpensive. The draperies were but of chintz, and
      the walls covered with the same material,—a lively pattern, in which the prevalents were
      rose-colour and white; but the ornaments on the mantelpiece, the china stored in the cabinets
      or arranged on the shelves, the small knickknacks scattered on the tables, were costly
      rarities of art.
The Contessa herself was a woman who had somewhat passed her thirtieth year,—not strikingly
      handsome, but exquisitely pretty. “There is,” said a great French writer, “only one way in
      which a woman can be handsome, but a hundred thousand ways in which she can be pretty;” and it
      would be impossible to reckon up the number of ways in which Adeline di Rimini carried off the
      prize in prettiness.
Yet it would be unjust to the personal attractions of the Contessa to class them all under
      the word “prettiness.” When regarded more attentively, there was an expression in her
      countenance that might almost be called divine, it spoke so unmistakably of a sweet nature and
      an untroubled soul. An English poet once described her by repeating the old lines,

 “Her face is like the milky way I’ the sky, —A meeting of gentle lights without a name.”
      
She was not alone; an elderly lady sat on an armchair by the fire, engaged in knitting; and
      a man, also elderly, and whose dress proclaimed him an ecclesiastic, sat at the opposite
      corner, with a large Angora cat on his lap.
“I present to you, Madame,” said Raoul, “my new-found cousin, the seventeenth Marquis de
      Rochebriant, whom I am proud to consider on the male side the head of our house, representing
      its eldest branch. Welcome him for my sake,—in future he will be welcome for his own.”
The Contessa replied very graciously to this introduction, and made room for Alain on the
      divan from which she had risen.
The old lady looked up from her knitting; the ecclesiastic removed the cat from his lap.
      Said the old lady, “I announce myself to M. le Marquis. I knew his mother well enough to be
      invited to his christening; otherwise I have no pretension to the acquaintance of a cavalier
      si beau, being old, rather deaf, very stupid, exceedingly poor—”
“And,” interrupted Raoul, “the woman in all Paris the most adored for bonte, and consulted
      for savoir vivre by the young cavaliers whom she deigns to receive. Alain, I present you to
      Madame de Maury, the widow of a distinguished author and academician, and the daughter of the
      brave Henri de Gerval, who fought for the good cause in La Vendee. I present you also to the
      Abbe Vertpre, who has passed his life in the vain endeavour to make other men as good as
      himself.”
“Base flatterer!” said the Abbe, pinching Raoul’s ear with one hand, while he extended the
      other to Alain. “Do not let your cousin frighten you from knowing me, Monsieur le Marquis;
      when he was my pupil, he so convinced me of the incorrigibility of perverse human nature, that
      I now chiefly address myself to the moral improvement of the brute creation. Ask the Contessa
      if I have not achieved a beau succes with her Angora cat. Three months ago that creature had
      the two worst propensities of man,—he was at once savage and mean; he bit, he stole. Does he
      ever bite now? No. Does he ever steal? No. Why? I have awakened in that cat the dormant
      conscience, and that done, the conscience regulates his actions; once made aware of the
      difference between wrong and right, the cat maintains it unswervingly, as if it were a law of
      nature. But if, with prodigious labour, one does awaken conscience in a human sinner, it has
      no steady effect on his conduct,—he continues to sin all the same. Mankind at Paris, Monsieur
      le Marquis, is divided between two classes,-one bites and the other steals. Shun both; devote
      yourself to cats.”
The Abbe delivered this oration with a gravity of mien and tone which made it difficult to
      guess whether he spoke in sport or in earnest, in simple playfulness or with latent
      sarcasm.
But on the brow and in the eye of the priest there was a general expression of quiet
      benevolence, which made Alain incline to the belief that he was only speaking as a pleasant
      humourist; and the Marquis replied gayly,—
“Monsieur L’Abbe, admitting the superior virtue of cats when taught by so intelligent a
      preceptor, still the business of human life is not transacted by cats; and since men must deal
      with men, permit me, as a preliminary caution, to inquire in which class I must rank yourself.
      Do you bite or do you steal?”
This sally, which showed that the Marquis was already shaking off his provincial reserve,
      met with great success. Raoul and the Contessa laughed merrily; Madame de Maury clapped her
      hands, and cried “Bien!”
The Abbe replied, with unmoved gravity, “Both. I am a priest; it is my duty to bite the bad
      and steal from the good, as you will see, Monsieur le Marquis, if you will glance at this
      paper.”
Here he handed to Alain a memorial on behalf of an afflicted family who had been burnt out
      of their home, and reduced from comparative ease to absolute want. There was a list appended
      of some twenty subscribers, the last being the Contessa, fifty francs, and Madame de Maury,
      five.
“Allow me, Marquis,” said the Abbe, “to steal from you. Bless you two-fold, mon fils!”
      (taking the napoleon Alain extended to him) “first for your charity; secondly, for the effect
      of its example upon the heart of your cousin. Raoul de Vandemar, stand and deliver. Bah! what!
      only ten francs.”
Raoul made a sign to the Abbe, unperceived by the rest, as he answered, “Abbe, I should
      excel your expectations of my career if I always continue worth half as much as my
      cousin.”
Alain felt to the bottom of his heart the delicate tact of his richer kinsman in giving less
      than himself, and the Abbe replied, “Niggard, you are pardoned. Humility is a more difficult
      virtue to produce than charity, and in your case an instance of it is so rare that it merits
      encouragement.”
The “tea equipage” was now served in what at Paris is called the English fashion; the
      Contessa presided over it, the guests gathered round the table, and the evening passed away in
      the innocent gayety of a domestic circle. The talk, if not especially intellectual, was at
      least not fashionable. Books were not discussed, neither were scandals; yet somehow or other
      it was cheery and animated, like that of a happy family in a country-house. Alain thought
      still the better of Raoul that, Parisian though he was, he could appreciate the charm of an
      evening so innocently spent.
On taking leave, the Contessa gave Alain a general invitation to drop in whenever he was not
      better engaged.
“I except only the opera nights,” said she. “My husband has gone to Milan on his affairs,
      and during his absence I do not go to parties; the opera I cannot resist.”
Raoul set Alain down at his lodgings. “Au revoir; tomorrow at one o’clock expect Enguerrand
      and myself.”
