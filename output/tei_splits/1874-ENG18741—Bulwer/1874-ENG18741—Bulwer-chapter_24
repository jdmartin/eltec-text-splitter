CHAPTER VIII.
Since the evening spent at the Savarins’, Graham had seen no more of Isaura. He had avoided
      all chance of seeing her; in fact, the jealousy with which he had viewed her manner towards
      Rameau, and the angry amaze with which he had heard her proclaim her friendship for Madame de
      Grantmesnil, served to strengthen the grave and secret reasons which made him desire to keep
      his heart yet free and his hand yet unpledged. But alas! the heart was enslaved already. It
      was under the most fatal of all spells,—first love conceived at first sight. He was wretched;
      and in his wretchedness his resolves became involuntarily weakened. He found himself making
      excuses for the beloved. What cause had he, after all, for that jealousy of the young poet
      which had so offended him; and if in her youth and inexperience Isaura had made her dearest
      friend of a great writer by whose genius she might be dazzled, and of whose opinions she might
      scarcely be aware, was it a crime that necessitated her eternal banishment from the reverence
      which belongs to all manly love? Certainly he found no satisfactory answers to such
      self-questionings. And then those grave reasons known only to himself, and never to be
      confided to another—why he should yet reserve his hand unpledged—were not so imperative as to
      admit of no compromise. They might entail a sacrifice, and not a small one to a man of
      Graham’s views and ambition. But what is love if it can think any sacrifice, short of duty and
      honour, too great to offer up unknown uncomprehended, to the one beloved? Still, while thus
      softened in his feelings towards Isaura, he became, perhaps in consequence of such softening,
      more and more restlessly impatient to fulfil the object for which he had come to Paris, the
      great step towards which was the discovery of the undiscoverable Louise Duval.
He had written more than once to M. Renard since the interview with that functionary already
      recorded, demanding whether Renard had not made some progress in the research on which he was
      employed, and had received short unsatisfactory replies preaching patience and implying
      hope.
The plain truth, however, was that M. Renard had taken no further pains in the matter. He
      considered it utter waste of time and thought to attempt a discovery to which the traces were
      so faint and so obsolete. If the discovery were effected, it must be by one of those chances
      which occur without labour or forethought of our own. He trusted only to such a chance in
      continuing the charge he had undertaken. But during the last day or two Graham had become yet
      more impatient than before, and peremptorily requested another visit from this dilatory
      confidant.
In that visit, finding himself pressed hard, and though naturally willing, if possible, to
      retain a client unusually generous, yet being on the whole an honest member of his profession,
      and feeling it to be somewhat unfair to accept large remuneration for doing nothing, M. Renard
      said frankly, “Monsieur, this affair is beyond me; the keenest agent of our police could make
      nothing of it. Unless you can tell me more than you have done, I am utterly without a clew. I
      resign, therefore, the task with which you honoured me, willing to resume it again if you can
      give me information that could render me of use.”
“What sort of information?”
“At least the names of some of the lady’s relations who may yet be living.”
“But it strikes me that, if I could get at that piece of knowledge, I should not require the
      services of the police. The relations would tell me what had become of Louise Duval quite as
      readily as they would tell a police agent.”
“Quite true, Monsieur. It would really be picking your pockets if I did not at once retire
      from your service. Nay, Monsieur, pardon me, no further payments; I have already accepted too
      much. Your most obedient servant.”
Graham, left alone, fell into a very gloomy revery. He could not but be sensible of the
      difficulties in the way of the object which had brought him to Paris, with somewhat sanguine
      expectations of success founded on a belief in the omniscience of the Parisian police, which
      is only to be justified when they have to deal with a murderess or a political incendiary. But
      the name of Louise Duval is about as common in France as that of Mary Smith in England; and
      the English reader may judge what would be the likely result of inquiring through the ablest
      of our detectives after some Mary Smith of whom you could give little more information than
      that she was the daughter of a drawing-master who had died twenty years ago, that it was about
      fifteen years since anything had been heard of her, that you could not say if through marriage
      or for other causes she had changed her name or not, and you had reasons for declining resort
      to public advertisements. In the course of inquiry so instituted, the probability would be
      that you might hear of a great many Mary Smiths, in the pursuit of whom your employee would
      lose all sight and scent of the one Mary Smith for whom the chase was instituted.
In the midst of Graham’s despairing reflections his laquais announced M. Frederic
      Lemercier.
“Cher Grarm-Varn. A thousand pardons if I disturb you at this late hour of the evening; but
      you remember the request you made me when you first arrived in Paris this season?”
“Of course I do,—in case you should ever chance in your wide round of acquaintance to fall
      in with a Madame or Mademoiselle Duval of about the age of forty, or a year or so less, to let
      me know; and you did fall in with two ladies of that name, but they were not the right one,
      not the person whom my friend begged me to discover; both much too young.”
“Eh bien, mon cher. If you will come with me to the bal champetre in the Champs Elysees
      to-night, I can show you a third Madame Duval,—her Christian name is Louise, too, of the age
      you mention,—though she does her best to look younger, and is still very handsome. You said
      your Duval was handsome. It was only last evening that I met this lady at a soiree given by
      Mademoiselle Julie Caumartin, coryphee distinguee, in love with young Rameau.”
“In love with young Rameau? I am very glad to hear it. He returns the love?”
“I suppose so. He seems very proud of it. But apropos of Madame Duval, she has been long
      absent from Paris, just returned, and looking out for conquests. She says she has a great
      penchant for the English; promises me to be at this ball. Come.”
“Hearty thanks, my dear Lemercier. I am at your service.”
