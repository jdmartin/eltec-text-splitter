CHAPTER VII.
The next morning Graham sent for M. Renard, and consulted with that experienced functionary
      as to the details of the plan of action which he had revolved during the hours of a sleepless
      night.
“In conformity with your advice,” said he, “not to expose myself to the chance of future
      annoyance, by confiding to a man so dangerous as the false Lebeau my name and address, I
      propose to take the lodging offered to me, as Mr. Lamb, an attorney’s clerk, commissioned to
      get in certain debts, and transact other matters of business, on behalf of his employer’s
      clients. I suppose there will be no difficulty with the police in this change of name, now
      that passports for the English are not necessary?”
“Certainly not. You will have no trouble in that respect.”
“I shall thus be enabled very naturally to improve acquaintance with the professional
      letter-writer, and find an easy opportunity to introduce the name of Louise Duval. My chief
      difficulty, I fear, not being a practical actor, will be to keep up consistently the queer
      sort of language I have adopted, both in French and in English. I have too sharp a critic in a
      man so consummate himself in stage trick and disguise as M. Lebeau not to feel the necessity
      of getting through my role as quickly as I can. Meanwhile, can you recommend me to some
      magasin where I can obtain a suitable change of costume? I can’t always wear a travelling
      suit, and I must buy linen of coarser texture than mine, and with the initials of my new name
      inscribed on it.”
“Quite right to study such details; I will introduce you to a magasin near the Temple, where
      you will find all you want.”
“Next, have you any friends or relations in the provinces unknown to M. Lebeau, to whom I
      might be supposed to write about debts or business matters, and from whom I might have
      replies?”
“I will think over it, and manage that for you very easily. Your letters shall find their
      way to me, and I will dictate the answers.”
After some further conversation on that business, M. Renard made an appointment to meet
      Graham at a cafe near the Temple later in the afternoon, and took his departure.
Graham then informed his laquais de place that, though he kept on his lodgings, he was going
      into the country for a few days, and should not want the man’s services till he returned. He
      therefore dismissed and paid him off at once, so that the laquais might not observe, when he
      quitted his rooms the next day, that he took with him no change of clothes, etc.
