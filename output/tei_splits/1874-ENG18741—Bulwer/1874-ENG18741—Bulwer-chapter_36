CHAPTER I.
The next day at noon M. Louvier was closeted in his study with M. Gandrin.
“Yes,” cried Louvier, “I have behaved very handsomely to the beau Marquis. No one can say to
      the contrary.”
“True,” answered Gandrin. “Besides the easy terms for the transfer of the mortgages, that
      free bonus of one thousand louis is a generous and noble act of munificence.”
“Is it not! and my youngster has already begun to do with it as I meant and expected. He has
      taken a fine apartment; he has bought a coupe and horses; he has placed himself in the hands
      of the Chevalier de Finisterre; he is entered at the Jockey Club. Parbleu, the one thousand
      louis will be soon gone.”
“And then?”
“And then! why, he will have tasted the sweets of Parisian life; he will think with disgust
      of the vieux manoir. He can borrow no more. I must remain sole mortgagee, and I shall behave
      as handsomely in buying his estates as I have behaved in increasing his income.”
Here a clerk entered and said that a monsieur wished to see M. Louvier for a few minutes in
      private, on urgent business.
“Tell him to send in his card.”
“He has declined to do so, but states that he has already the honour of your
      acquaintance.”
“A writer in the press, perhaps; or is he an artist?”
“I have not seen him before, Monsieur, but he has the air tres comme il faut.”
“Well, you may admit him. I will not detain you longer, my dear Gandrin. My homages to
      Madame. Bonjour.”
Louvier bowed out M. Gandrin, and then rubbed his hands complacently. He was in high
      spirits. “Aha, my dear Marquis, thou art in my trap now. Would it were thy father instead,” he
      muttered chucklingly, and then took his stand on the hearth, with his back to the fireless
      grate. There entered a gentleman exceedingly well dressed,—dressed according to the fashion,
      but still as became one of ripe middle age, not desiring to pass for younger than he was.
He was tall, with a kind of lofty ease in his air and his movements; not slight of frame,
      but spare enough to disguise the strength and endurance which belong to sinews and thews of
      steel, freed from all superfluous flesh, broad across the shoulders, thin in the flanks. His
      dark hair had in youth been luxuriant in thickness and curl; it was now clipped short, and had
      become bare at the temples, but it still retained the lustre of its colour and the crispness
      of its ringlets. He wore neither beard nor mustache, and the darkness of his hair was
      contrasted by a clear fairness of complexion, healthful, though somewhat pale, and eyes of
      that rare gray tint which has in it no shade of blue,—peculiar eyes, which give a very
      distinct character to the face. The man must have been singularly handsome in youth; he was
      handsome still, though probably in his forty-seventh or forty-eighth year, doubtless a very
      different kind of comeliness. The form of the features and the contour of the face were those
      that suit the rounded beauty of the Greek outline, and such beauty would naturally have been
      the attribute of the countenance in earlier days; but the cheeks were now thin, and with lines
      of care and sorrow between nostril and lip, so that the shape of the face seemed lengthened,
      and the features had become more salient.
Louvier gazed at his visitor with a vague idea that he had seen him before, and could not
      remember where or when; but at all events he recognized at the first glance a man of rank and
      of the great world.
“Pray be seated, Monsieur,” he said, resuming his own easy-chair.
The visitor obeyed the invitation with a very graceful bend of his head, drew his chair near
      to the financier’s, stretched his limbs with the ease of a man making himself at home, and
      fixing his calm bright eyes quietly on Louvier, said, with a bland smile,—
“My dear old friend, do you not remember me? You are less altered than I am.”
Louvier stared hard and long; his lip fell, his cheek paled, and at last he faltered out,
      “Ciel! is it possible! Victor, the Vicomte de Mauleon?”
“At your service, my dear Louvier.”
There was a pause; the financier was evidently confused and embarrassed, and not less
      evidently the visit of the “dear old friend” was unwelcome.
“Vicomte,” he said at last, “this is indeed a surprise; I thought you had long since quitted
      Paris for good.”
“‘L’homme propose,’ etc. I have returned, and mean to enjoy the rest of my days in the
      metropolis of the Graces and the Pleasures. What though we are not so young as we were,
      Louvier,—we have more vigour in us than the new generation; and though it may no longer befit
      us to renew the gay carousals of old, life has still excitements as vivid for the social
      temperament and ambitious mind. Yes, the roi des viveurs returns to Paris for a more solid
      throne than he filled before.”
“Are you serious?”
“As serious as the French gayety will permit one to be.”
“Alas, Monsieur le Vicomte! can you flatter yourself that you will regain the society you
      have quitted, and the name you have—”
Louvier stopped short; something in the Vicomte’s eye daunted him.
“The name I have laid aside for convenience of travel. Princes travel incognito, and so may
      a simple gentilhomme. ‘Regain my place in society,’ say you? Yes; it is not that which
      troubles me.”
“What does?”
“The consideration whether on a very modest income I can be sufficiently esteemed for myself
      to render that society more pleasant than ever. Ah, mon cher! why recoil? why so frightened?
      Do you think I am going to ask you for money? Have I ever done so since we parted; and did I
      ever do so before without repaying you? Bah! you roturiers are worse than the Bourbons. You
      never learn or unlearn. ‘Fors non mutat genus.’”
The magnificent millionaire, accustomed to the homage of grandees from the Faubourg and
      lions from the Chaussee d’Antin, rose to his feet in superb wrath, less at the taunting words
      than at the haughtiness of mien with which they were uttered.
“Monsieur, I cannot permit you to address me in that tone. Do you mean to insult me?”
“Certainly not. Tranquillize your nerves, reseat yourself, and listen,—reseat yourself, I
      say.”
Louvier dropped into his chair.
“No,” resumed the Vicomte, politely, “I do not come here to insult you, neither do I come to
      ask money; I assume that I am in my rights when I ask Monsieur Louvier what has become of
      Louise Duval?”
“Louise Duval! I know nothing about her.”
“Possibly not now; but you did know her well enough, when we two parted, to be a candidate
      for her hand. You did know her enough to solicit my good offices in promotion of your suit;
      and you did, at my advice, quit Paris to seek her at Aix-la-Chapelle.”
“What! have you, Monsieur de Mauleon, not heard news of her since that day?”
“I decline to accept your question as an answer to mine. You went to Aix-la-Chapelle; you
      saw Louise Duval, at my urgent request she condescended to accept your hand.”
“No, Monsieur de Mauleon, she did not accept my hand. I did not even see her. The day before
      I arrived at Aix-la-Chapelle she had left it,—not alone,—left it with her lover.”
“Her lover! You do not mean the miserable Englishman who—”
“No Englishman,” interrupted Louvier, fiercely. “Enough that the step she took placed an
      eternal barrier between her and myself. I have never even sought to hear of her since that
      day. Vicomte, that woman was the one love of my life. I loved her, as you must have known, to
      folly, to madness. And how was my love requited? Ah! you open a very deep wound, Monsieur le
      Vicomte.”
“Pardon me, Louvier; I did not give you credit for feelings so keen and so genuine, nor did
      I think myself thus easily affected by matters belonging to a past life so remote from the
      present. For whom did Louise forsake you?”
“It matters not; he is dead.”
“I regret to hear that; I might have avenged you.”
“I need no one to avenge my wrong. Let this pass.”
“Not yet. Louise, you say, fled with a seducer? So proud as she was, I can scarcely believe
      it.”
“Oh, it was not with a roturier she fled; her pride would not have allowed that.”
“He must have deceived her somehow. Did she continue to live with him?”
“That question, at least, I can answer; for though I lost all trace of her life, his life
      was pretty well known to me till its end; and a very few months after she fled he was
      enchained to another. Let us talk of her no more.”
“Ay, ay,” muttered De Mauleon, “some disgraces are not to be redeemed, and therefore not to
      be discussed. To me, though a relation, Louise Duval was but little known, and after what you
      tell me, I cannot dispute your right to say, ‘Talk of her no more.’ You loved her, and she
      wronged you. My poor Louvier, pardon me if I made an old wound bleed afresh.”
These words were said with a certain pathetic tenderness; they softened Louvier towards the
      speaker.
After a short pause the Vicomte swept his hand over his brow, as if to dismiss from his mind
      a painful and obtrusive thought; then with a changed expression of countenance,—an expression
      frank and winning,—with voice and with manner in which no vestige remained of the irony or the
      haughtiness with which he had resented the frigidity of his reception, he drew his chair still
      nearer to Louvier’s, and resumed: “Our situations, Paul Louvier, are much changed since we two
      became friends. I then could say, ‘Open sesame’ to whatever recesses, forbidden to vulgar
      footsteps, the adventurer whom I took by the hand might wish to explore. In those days my
      heart was warm; I liked you, Louvier,—honestly liked you. I think our personal acquaintance
      commenced in some gay gathering of young viveurs, whose behaviour to you offended my sense of
      good breeding?”
Louvier coloured and muttered inaudibly. De Mauleon continued: “I felt it due to you to
      rebuke their incivilities, the more so as you evinced on that occasion your own superiority in
      sense and temper, permit me to add, with no lack of becoming spirit.”
Louvier bowed his head, evidently gratified.
“From that day we became familiar. If any obligation to me were incurred, you would not have
      been slow to return it. On more than one occasion when I was rapidly wasting money—and money
      was plentiful with you—you generously offered me your purse. On more than one occasion I
      accepted the offer; and you would never have asked repayment if I had not insisted on
      repaying. I was no less grateful for your aid.” Louvier made a movement as if to extend his
      hand, but he checked the impulse.
“There was another attraction which drew me towards you. I recognized in your character a
      certain power in sympathy with that power which I imagined lay dormant in myself, and not to
      be found among the freluquets and lions who were my more habitual associates. Do you not
      remember some hours of serious talk we have had together when we lounged in the Tuileries, or
      sipped our coffee in the garden of the Palais Royal?—hours when we forgot that those were the
      haunts of idlers, and thought of the stormy actions affecting the history of the world of
      which they had been the scene; hours when I confided to you, as I confided to no other man,
      the ambitious hopes for the future which my follies in the present, alas! were hourly tending
      to frustrate.”
“Ay, I remember the starlit night; it was not in the gardens of the Tuileries nor in the
      Palais Royal,—it was on the Pont de la Concorde, on which we had paused, noting the starlight
      on the waters, that you said, pointing towards the walls of the Corps Legislatif, ‘Paul, when
      I once get into the Chamber, how long will it take me to become First Minister of
      France?’”
“Did I say so?—possibly; but I was too young then for admission to the Chamber, and I
      fancied I had so many years yet to spare in idle loiterings at the Fountain of Youth. Pass
      over these circumstances. You became in love with Louise. I told you her troubled history; it
      did not diminish your love; and then I frankly favoured your suit. You set out for
      Aix-la-Chapelle a day or two afterwards; then fell the thunderbolt which shattered my
      existence, and we have never met again till this hour. You did not receive me kindly, Paul
      Louvier.”
“But,” said Louvier, falteringly, “but since you refer to that thunderbolt, you cannot but
      be aware that—that—”
“I was subjected to a calumny which I expect those who have known me as well as you did to
      assist me now to refute.”
“If it be really a calumny.”
“Heavens, man! could you ever doubt that?” cried De Mauleon, with heat; “ever doubt that I
      would rather have blown out my brains than allowed them even to conceive the idea of a crime
      so base?”
“Pardon me,” answered Louvier, meekly, “but I did not return to Paris for months after you
      had disappeared. My mind was unsettled by the news that awaited me at Aix; I sought to
      distract it by travel,—visited Holland and England; and when I did return to Paris, all that I
      heard of your story was the darker side of it. I willingly listen to your own account. You
      never took, or at least never accepted, the Duchesse de ———‘s jewels; and your friend M. de
      ——- never sold them to one jeweller and obtained their substitutes in paste from another?”
The Vicomte made a perceptible effort to repress an impulse of rage; then reseating himself
      in his chair, and with that slight shrug of the shoulder by which a Frenchman implies to
      himself that rage would be out of place, replied calmly, “M. de N. did as you say, but of
      course not employed by me, nor with my knowledge. Listen; the truth is this,—the time has come
      to tell it. Before you left Paris for Aix I found myself on the brink of ruin. I had glided
      towards it with my characteristic recklessness, with that scorn of money for itself, that
      sanguine confidence in the favour of fortune, which are vices common to every roi des viveurs.
      Poor mock Alexanders that we spendthrifts are in youth! we divide all we have among others,
      and when asked by some prudent friend, ‘What have you left for your own share?’ answer,
      ‘Hope.’ I knew, of course, that my patrimony was rapidly vanishing; but then my horses were
      matchless. I had enough to last me for years on their chance of winning—of course they would
      win. But you may recollect when we parted that I was troubled,—creditors’ bills before
      me—usurers’ bills too,—and you, my dear Louvier, pressed on me your purse, were angry when I
      refused it. How could I accept? All my chance of repayment was in the speed of a horse. I
      believed in that chance for myself; but for a trustful friend, no. Ask your own heart
      now,—nay, I will not say heart,—ask your own common-sense, whether a man who then put aside
      your purse—spendthrift, vaurien, though he might be—was likely to steal or accept a woman’s
      jewels. Va, mon pauvre Louvier, again I say, ‘Fors non mutat genus.’”
Despite the repetition of the displeasing patrician motto, such reminiscences of his
      visitor’s motley character—irregular, turbulent, the reverse of severe, but, in its own loose
      way, grandly generous and grandly brave—struck both on the common-sense and the heart of the
      listener; and the Frenchman recognized the Frenchman. Louvier doubted De Mauleon’s word no
      more, bowed his head, and said, “Victor de Mauleon, I have wronged you; go on.”
“On the day after you left for Aix came that horse-race on which my all depended: it was
      lost. The loss absorbed the whole of my remaining fortune; it absorbed about twenty thousand
      francs in excess, a debt of honour to De N., whom you called my friend. Friend he was not;
      imitator, follower, flatterer, yes. Still I deemed him enough my friend to say to him, ‘Give
      me a little time to pay the money; I must sell my stud, or write to my only living relation
      from whom I have expectations.’ You remember that relation,—Jacques de Mauleon, old and
      unmarried. By De N.‘s advice I did write to my kinsman. No answer came; but what did come were
      fresh bills from creditors. I then calmly calculated my assets. The sale of my stud and
      effects might suffice to pay every sou that I owed, including my debt to De N.; but that was
      not quite certain. At all events, when the debts were paid I should be beggared. Well, you
      know, Louvier, what we Frenchmen are: how Nature has denied to us the quality of patience; how
      involuntarily suicide presents itself to us when hope is lost; and suicide seemed to me here
      due to honour, namely, to the certain discharge of my liabilities,—for the stud and effects of
      Victor de Mauleon, roi des viveurs, would command much higher prices if he died like Cato than
      if he ran away from his fate like Pompey. Doubtless De N. guessed my intention from my words
      or my manner; but on the very day in which I had made all preparations for quitting the world
      from which sunshine had vanished, I received in a blank envelope bank-notes amounting to
      seventy thousand francs, and the post-mark on the envelope was that of the town of
      Fontainebleau, near to which lived my rich kinsman Jacques. I took it for granted that the sum
      came from him. Displeased as he might have been with my wild career, still I was his natural
      heir. The sum sufficed to pay my debt to De N., to all creditors, and leave a surplus. My
      sanguine spirits returned. I would sell my stud; I would retrench, reform, go to my kinsman as
      the penitent son. The fatted calf would be killed, and I should wear purple yet. You
      understand that, Louvier?”
“Yes, yes; so like you. Go on.”
“Now, then, came the thunderbolt! Ah! in those sunny days you used to envy me for being so
      spoilt by women. The Duchesse de ——— had conceived for me one of those romantic fancies which
      women without children and with ample leisure for the waste of affection do sometimes conceive
      for very ordinary men younger than themselves, but in whom they imagine they discover sinners
      to reform or heroes to exalt. I had been honoured by some notes from the Duchesse in which
      this sort of romance was owned. I had not replied to them encouragingly. In truth, my heart
      was then devoted to another,—the English girl whom I had wooed as my wife; who, despite her
      parents’ retraction of their consent to our union when they learned how dilapidated were my
      fortunes, pledged herself to remain faithful to me, and wait for better days.” Again De
      Mauleon paused in suppressed emotion, and then went on hurriedly: “No, the Duchesse did not
      inspire me with guilty passion, but she did inspire me with an affectionate respect. I felt
      that she was by nature meant to be a great and noble creature, and was, nevertheless, at that
      moment wholly misled from her right place amongst women by an illusion of mere imagination
      about a man who happened then to be very much talked about, and perhaps resembled some
      Lothario in the novels which she was always reading. We lodged, as you may remember, in the
      same house.”
“Yes, I remember. I remember how you once took me to a great ball given by the Duchesse; how
      handsome I thought her, though no longer young; and you say right—how I did envy you, that
      night!”
“From that night, however, the Duc, not unnaturally, became jealous. He reproved the
      Duchesse for her too amiable manner towards a mauvais sujet like myself, and forbade her in
      future to receive my visits. It was then that these notes became frequent and clandestine,
      brought to me by her maid, who took back my somewhat chilling replies.
“But to proceed. In the flush of my high spirits, and in the insolence of magnificent ease
      with which I paid De N——— the trifle I owed him, something he said made my heart stand
      still.”
“I told him that the money received had come from Jacques de Mauleon, and that I was going
      down to his house that day to thank him. He replied, ‘Don’t go; it did not come from him.’ ‘It
      must; see the post-mark of the envelope,—Fontainebleau.’ ‘I posted it at Fontainebleau.’ ‘You
      sent me the money, you!’ ‘Nay, that is beyond my means. Where it came from,’ said this
      miserable, ‘much more may yet come;’ and then be narrated, with that cynicism so in vogue at
      Paris, how he had told the Duchesse (who knew him as my intimate associate) of my stress of
      circumstance, of his fear that I meditated something desperate; how she gave him the jewels to
      sell and to substitute; how, in order to baffle my suspicion and frustrate my scruples, he had
      gone to Fontainebleau and there posted the envelope containing the bank-notes, out of which he
      secured for himself the payment he deemed otherwise imperilled. De N. having made this
      confession, hurried down the stairs swiftly enough to save himself a descent by the window. Do
      you believe me still?”
“Yes; you were always so hot-blooded, and De N. so considerate of self, I believe you
      implicitly.”
“Of course I did what any man would do; I wrote a hasty letter to the Duchesse, stating all
      my gratitude for an act of pure friendship so noble; urging also the reasons that rendered it
      impossible for a man of honour to profit by such an act. Unhappily, what had been sent was
      paid away ere I knew the facts; but I could not bear the thought of life till my debt to her
      was acquitted; in short, Louvier, conceive for yourself the sort of letter which I—which any
      honest man—would write, under circumstances so cruel.”
“H’m!” grunted Louvier.
“Something, however, in my letter, conjoined with what De N. had told her as to my state of
      mind, alarmed this poor woman, who had deigned to take in me an interest so little deserved.
      Her reply, very agitated and incoherent, was brought to me by her maid, who had taken my
      letter, and by whom, as I before said, our correspondence had been of late carried on. In her
      reply she implored me to decide, to reflect on nothing till I had seen her; stated how the
      rest of her day was pre-engaged; and since to visit her openly had been made impossible by the
      Due’s interdict, enclosed the key to the private entrance to her rooms, by which I could gain
      an interview with her at ten o’clock that night, an hour at which the Duc had informed her he
      should be out till late at his club. Now, however great the indiscretion which the Duchesse
      here committed, it is due to her memory to say that I am convinced that her dominant idea was
      that I meditated self-destruction; that no time was to be lost to save me from it; and for the
      rest she trusted to the influence which a woman’s tears and adjurations and reasonings have
      over even the strongest and hardest men. It is only one of those coxcombs in whom the world of
      fashion abounds who could have admitted a thought that would have done wrong to the impulsive,
      generous, imprudent eagerness of a woman to be in time to save from death by his own hand a
      fellow-being for whom she had conceived an interest. I so construed her note. At the hour she
      named I admitted myself into the rooms by the key she sent. You know the rest: I was
      discovered by the Duc and by the agents of police in the cabinet in which the Duchesse’s
      jewels were kept. The key that admitted me into the cabinet was found in my possession.”
De Mauleon’s voice here faltered, and he covered his face with a convulsive hand. Almost in
      the same breath he recovered from visible sign of emotion, and went on with a half laugh.
“Ah! you envied me, did you, for being spoiled by the women? Enviable position indeed was
      mine that night! The Duc obeyed the first impulse of his wrath. He imagined that I had
      dishonoured him; he would dishonour me in return. Easier to his pride, too, a charge against
      the robber of jewels than against a favoured lover of his wife. But when I, obeying the first
      necessary obligation of honour, invented on the spur of the moment the story by which the
      Duchesse’s reputation was cleared from suspicion, accused myself of a frantic passion and the
      trickery of a fabricated key, the Due’s true nature of gentilhomme came back. He retracted the
      charge which he could scarcely even at the first blush have felt to be well-founded; and as
      the sole charge left was simply that which men comme il faut do not refer to criminal courts
      and police investigations, I was left to make my bow unmolested and retreat to my own rooms,
      awaiting there such communciations as the Duc might deem it right to convey to me on the
      morrow.
“But on the morrow the Duc, with his wife and personal suite, quitted Paris en route for
      Spain; the bulk of his retinue, including the offending Abigail, was discharged; and, whether
      through these servants or through the police, the story before evening was in the mouth of
      every gossip in club or cafe,—exaggerated, distorted, to my ignominy and shame. My detection
      in the cabinet, the sale of the jewels, the substitution of paste by De N., who was known to
      be my servile imitator and reputed to be my abject tool, all my losses on the turf, my
      debts,—all these scattered fibres of flax were twisted together in a rope that would have
      hanged a dog with a much better name than mine. If some disbelieved that I could be a thief,
      few of those who should have known me best held me guiltless of a baseness almost equal to
      that of theft,—the exaction of profit from the love of a foolish woman.”
“But you could have told your own tale, shown the letters you had received from the
      Duchesse, and cleared away every stain on your honour.”
“How?—shown her letters, ruined her character, even stated that she had caused her jewels to
      be sold for the uses of a young roue! Ah, no, Louvier! I would rather have gone to the
      galleys.”
“H’m!” grunted Louvier again.
“The Duc generously gave me better means of righting myself. Three days after he quitted
      Paris I received a letter from him, very politely written, expressing his great regret that
      any words implying the suspicion too monstrous and absurd to need refutation should have
      escaped him in the surprise of the moment; but stating that since the offence I had owned was
      one that he could not overlook, he was under the necessity of asking the only reparation I
      could make. That if it ‘deranged’ me to quit Paris, he would return to it for the purpose
      required; but that if I would give him the additional satisfaction of suiting his convenience,
      he should prefer to await my arrival at Bayonne, where he was detained by the indisposition of
      the Duchesse.”
“You have still that letter?” asked Louvier, quickly. “Yes; with other more important
      documents constituting what I may call my pieces justificatives.
“I need not say that I replied stating the time at which I should arrive at Bayonne, and the
      hotel at which I should await the Duc’s command. Accordingly I set out that same day, gained
      the hotel named, despatched to the Duc the announcement of my arrival, and was considering how
      I should obtain a second in some officer quartered in the town—for my soreness and resentment
      at the marked coldness of my former acquaintances at Paris had forbidden me to seek a second
      among any of that faithless number—when the Due himself entered my room. Judge of my amaze at
      seeing him in person; judge how much greater the amaze became when he advanced with a grave
      but cordial smile, offering me his hand!
“‘Monsieur de Mauleon,’ said he, ‘since I wrote to you, facts have become known to me which
      would induce me rather to ask your friendship than call on you to defend your life. Madame la
      Duchesse has been seriously ill since we left Paris, and I refrained from all explanations
      likely to add to the hysterical excitement under which she was suffering. It is only this day
      that her mind became collected, and she herself then gave me her entire confidence. Monsieur,
      she insisted on my reading the letters that you addressed to her. Those letters, Monsieur,
      suffice to prove your innocence of any design against my peace. The Duchesse has so candidly
      avowed her own indiscretion, has so clearly established the distinction between indiscretion
      and guilt, that I have granted her my pardon with a lightened heart and a firm belief that we
      shall be happier together than we have been yet.’
“The Due continued his journey the next day, but he subsequently honoured me with two or
      three letters written as friend to friend, and in which you will find repeated the substance
      of what I have stated him to say by word of mouth.”
“But why not then have returned to Paris? Such letters, at least, you might have shown, and
      in braving your calumniators you would have soon lived them down.”
“You forget that I was a ruined man. When, by the sale of my horses, etc., my debts,
      including what was owed to the Duchesse, and which I remitted to the Duc, were discharged, the
      balance left to me would not have maintained me a week at Paris. Besides, I felt so sore, so
      indignant. Paris and the Parisians had become to me so hateful. And to crown all, that girl,
      that English girl whom I had so loved, on whose fidelity I had so counted—well, I received a
      letter from her, gently but coldly bidding me farewell forever. I do not think she believed me
      guilty of theft; but doubtless the offence I had confessed, in order to save the honour of the
      Duchesse, could but seem to her all sufficient! Broken in spirit, bleeding at heart to the
      very core, still self-destruction was no longer to be thought of. I would not die till I could
      once more lift up my head as Victor de Mauleon.”
“What then became of you, my poor Victor?”
“Ah! that is a tale too long for recital. I have played so many parts that I am puzzled to
      recognize my own identity with the Victor de Mauleon whose name I abandoned. I have been a
      soldier in Algeria, and won my cross on the field of battle,—that cross and my colonel’s
      letter are among my pieces justificatives; I have been a gold-digger in California, a
      speculator in New York, of late in callings obscure and humble. But in all my adventures,
      under whatever name, I have earned testimonials of probity, could manifestations of so vulgar
      a virtue be held of account by the enlightened people of Paris. I come now to a close. The
      Vicomte de Mauleon is about to re-appear in Paris, and the first to whom he announces that
      sublime avatar is Paul Louvier. When settled in some modest apartment, I shall place in your
      hands my pieces justificatives. I shall ask you to summon my surviving relations or
      connections, among which are the Counts de Vandemar, Beauvilliers, De Passy, and the Marquis
      de Rochebriant, with any friends of your own who sway the opinions of the Great World. You
      will place my justification before them, expressing your own opinion that it suffices; in a
      word, you will give me the sanction of your countenance. For the rest, I trust to myself to
      propitiate the kindly and to silence the calumnious. I have spoken; what say you?”
“You overrate my power in society. Why not appeal yourself to your high-born relations?”
“No, Louvier; I have too well considered the case to alter my decision. It is through you,
      and you alone, that I shall approach my relations. My vindicator must be a man of whom the
      vulgar cannot say, ‘Oh, he is a relation,—a fellow-noble; those aristocrats whitewash each
      other.’ It must be an authority with the public at large,—a bourgeois, a millionaire, a roi de
      la Bourse. I choose you, and that ends the discussion.”
Louvier could not help laughing good-humouredly at the sang froid of the Vicomte. He was
      once more under the domination of a man who had for a time dominated all with whom he
      lived.
De Mauleon continued: “Your task will be easy enough. Society changes rapidly at Paris. Few
      persons now exist who have more than a vague recollection of the circumstances which can be so
      easily explained to my complete vindication when the vindication comes from a man of your
      solid respectability and social influence. Besides, I have political objects in view. You are
      a Liberal; the Vandemars and Rochebriants are Legitimists. I prefer a godfather on the Liberal
      side. Pardieu, mon ami, why such coquettish hesitation? Said and done. Your hand on it.”
“There is my hand then. I will do all I can to help you.”
“I know you will, old friend; and you do both kindly and wisely.” Here De Mauleon cordially
      pressed the hand he held, and departed.
On gaining the street, the Vicomte glided into a neighbouring courtyard, in which he had
      left his fiacre, and bade the coachman drive towards the Boulevard Sebastopol. On the way, he
      took from a small bag that he had left in the carriage the flaxen wig and pale whiskers which
      distinguished M. Lebeau, and mantled his elegant habiliments in an immense cloak, which he had
      also left in the fiacre. Arrived at the Boulevard Sebastopol, he drew up the collar of the
      cloak so as to conceal much of his face, stopped the driver, paid him quickly, and, bag in
      hand, hurried on to another stand of fiacres at a little distance, entered one, drove to the
      Faubourg Montmartre, dismissed the vehicle at the mouth of a street not far from M. Lebeau’s
      office, and gained on foot the private side-door of the house, let himself in with his
      latchkey, entered the private room on the inner side of his office, locked the door, and
      proceeded leisurely to exchange the brilliant appearance which the Vicomte de Mauleon had
      borne on his visit to the millionaire for the sober raiment and bourgeois air of M. Lebeau,
      the letter-writer.
Then after locking up his former costume in a drawer of his secretaire, he sat himself down
      and wrote the following lines:—

 DEAR MONSIEUR GEORGES,—I advise you strongly, from information that has just reached me,
      to lose no time in pressing M. Savarin to repay the sum I recommended you to lend him, and for
      which you hold his bill due this day. The scandal of legal measures against a writer so
      distinguished should be avoided if possible. He will avoid it and get the money somehow; but
      he must be urgently pressed. If you neglect this warning, my responsibility is past. Agreez
      mes sentimens les plus sinceres. J. L.
