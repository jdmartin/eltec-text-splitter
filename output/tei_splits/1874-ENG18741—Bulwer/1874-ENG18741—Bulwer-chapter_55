CHAPTER I.
It is the first week in the month of May, 1870. Celebrities are of rapid growth in the
      salons of Paris. Gustave Rameau has gained the position for which he sighed. The journal he
      edits has increased its hold on the public, and his share of the profits has been liberally
      augmented by the secret proprietor. Rameau is acknowledged as a power in literary circles. And
      as critics belonging to the same clique praise each other in Paris, whatever they may do in
      communities more rigidly virtuous, his poetry has been declared by authorities in the press to
      be superior to that of Alfred de Musset in vigour—to that of Victor Hugo in refinement;
      neither of which assertions would much, perhaps, shock a cultivated understanding.
It is true that it (Gustave’s poetry) has not gained a wide audience among the public. But
      with regard to poetry nowadays, there are plenty of persons who say as Dr. Johnson said of the
      verse of Spratt, “I would rather praise it than read.”
At all events, Rameau was courted in gay and brilliant circles, and, following the general
      example of French litterateurs in fashion, lived well up to the income he received, had a
      delightful bachelor’s apartment, furnished with artistic effect, spent largely on the
      adornment of his person, kept a coupe, and entertained profusely at the cafe Anglais and the
      Maison Doree. A reputation that inspired a graver and more unquiet interest had been created
      by the Vicomte de Mauleon. Recent articles in the Sens Commun, written under the name of
      Pierre Firmin on the discussions on the vexed question of the plebiscite, had given umbrage to
      the Government, and Rameau had received an intimation that he, as editor, was responsible for
      the compositions of the contributors to the journal he edited; and that though, so long as
      Pierre Firmin had kept his caustic spirit within proper bounds, the Government had winked at
      the evasion of the law which required every political article in a journal to be signed by the
      real name of its author, it could do so no longer. Pierre Firmin was apparently a nom de
      plume; if not, his identity must be proved, or Rameau would pay the penalty which his
      contributor seemed bent on incurring.
Rameau, much alarmed for the journal that might be suspended, and for himself who might be
      imprisoned, conveyed this information through the publisher to his correspondent Pierre
      Firmin, and received the next day an article signed Victor de Mauleon, in which the writer
      proclaimed himself to be one and the same with Pierre Firmin, and, taking a yet bolder tone
      than he had before assumed, dared the Government to attempt legal measures against him. The
      Government was prudent enough to disregard that haughty bravado, but Victor de Mauleon rose at
      once into political importance. He had already in his real name and his quiet way established
      a popular and respectable place in Parisian society. But if this revelation created him
      enemies whom he had not before provoked, he was now sufficiently acquitted, by tacit consent,
      of the sins formerly laid to his charge, to disdain the assaults of party wrath. His old
      reputation for personal courage and skill in sword and pistol served, indeed, to protect him
      from such charges as a Parisian journalist does not reply to with his pen. If he created some
      enemies, he created many more friends, or, at least, partisans and admirers. He only needed
      fine and imprisonment to become a popular hero.
A few days after he had thus proclaimed himself, Victor de Mauleon—who had before kept aloof
      from Rameau, and from salons at which he was likely to meet that distinguished
      minstrel—solicited his personal acquaintance, and asked him to breakfast.
Rameau joyfully went. He had a very natural curiosity to see the contributor whose articles
      had so mainly insured the sale of the Sens Commun.
In the dark-haired, keen-eyed, well-dressed, middle-aged man, with commanding port and
      courtly address, he failed to recognise any resemblance to the flaxen-wigged, long-coated,
      be-spectacled, shambling sexagenarian whom he had known as Lebeau. Only now and then a tone of
      voice struck him as familiar, but he could not recollect where he had heard the voice it
      resembled. The thought of Lebeau did not occur to him; if it had occurred it would only have
      struck him as a chance coincidence. Rameau, like most egotists, was rather a dull observer of
      men. His genius was not objective.
“I trust, Monsieur Rameau,” said the Vicomte, as he and his guest were seated at the
      breakfast-table, “that you are not dissatisfied with the remuneration your eminent services in
      the journal have received.”
“The proprietor, whoever he be, has behaved most liberally,” answered Rameau.
“I take that compliment to myself, cher confrere; for though the expenses of starting the
      Sens Commun, and the caution money lodged, were found by a friend of mine, that was as a loan,
      which I have long since repaid, and the property in the journal is now exclusively mine. I
      have to thank you not only for your own brilliant contributions, but for those of the
      colleagues you secured. Monsieur Savarin’s piquant criticisms were most valuable to us at
      starting. I regret to have lost his aid. But as he has set up a new journal of his own, even
      he has not wit enough to spare for another. A propos of our contributors, I shall ask you to
      present me to the fair author of The Artist’s Daughter. I am of too prosaic a nature to
      appreciate justly the merits of a roman; but I have heard warm praise of this story from the
      young—they are the best judges of that kind of literature; and I can at least understand the
      worth of a contributor who trebled the sale of our journal. It is a misfortune to us, indeed,
      that her work is completed, but I trust that the sum sent to her through our publisher
      suffices to tempt her to favour us with another roman in series.”
“Mademoiselle Cicogna,” said Rameau, with a somewhat sharper intonation of his sharp voice,
      “has accepted for the republication of her roman in a separate form terms which attest the
      worth of her genius, and has had offers from other journals for a serial tale of even higher
      amount than the sum so generously sent to her through your publisher.”
“Has she accepted them, Monsieur Rameau? If so, tant pis pour vous. Pardon me, I mean that
      your salary suffers in proportion as the Sens Commun declines in sale.”
“She has not accepted them. I advised her not to do so until she could compare them with
      those offered by the proprietor of the Sens Commun.”
“And your advice guides her? Ah, cher confrere, you are a happy man!—you have influence over
      this young aspirant to the fame of a De Stael or a Georges Sand.”
“I flatter myself that I have some,” answered Rameau, smiling loftily as he helped himself
      to another tumbler of. Volnay wine—excellent, but rather heady.
“So much the better. I leave you free to arrange terms with Mademoiselle Cicogna, higher
      than she can obtain elsewhere, and kindly contrive my own personal introduction to her—you
      have breakfasted already?—permit me to offer you a cigar—excuse me if I do not bear you
      company; I seldom smoke—never of a morning. Now to business, and the state of France. Take
      that easy-chair, seat yourself comfortably. So! Listen! If ever Mephistopheles revisit the
      earth, how he will laugh at Universal Suffrage and Vote by Ballot in an old country like
      France, as things to be admired by educated men, and adopted by friends of genuine
      freedom!”
“I don’t understand you,” said Rameau.
“In this respect at least, let me hope that I can furnish you with understanding.
“The Emperor has resorted to a plebiscite—viz., a vote by ballot and universal suffrage—as
      to certain popular changes which circumstances compel him to substitute for his former
      personal rule. Is there a single intelligent Liberal who is not against that plebiscite?—is
      there any such who does not know that the appeal of the Emperor to universal suffrage and vote
      by ballot must result in a triumph over all the variations of free thought, by the unity which
      belongs to Order, represented through an able man at the head of the State? The multitude
      never comprehend principles; principles are complex ideas; they comprehend a single idea, and
      the simplest idea is, a Name that rids their action of all responsibility to thought.
“Well, in France there are principles superabundant which you can pit against the principle
      of Imperial rule. But there is not one name you can pit against Napoleon the Third; therefore,
      I steer our little bark in the teeth of the popular gale when I denounce the plebiscite, and
      Le Sens Commun will necessarily fall in sale—it is beginning to fall already. We shall have
      the educated men with us, the rest against. In every country—even in China, where all are
      highly educated—a few must be yet more highly educated than the many. Monsieur Rameau, I
      desire to overthrow the Empire: in order to do that, it is not enough to have on my side the
      educated men, I must have the canaille—the canaille of Paris and of the manufacturing towns.
      But I use the canaille for my purpose—I don’t mean to enthrone it. You comprehend?—the
      canaille quiescent is simply mud at the bottom of a stream; the canaille agitated is mud at
      the surface. But no man capable of three ideas builds the palaces and senates of civilised
      society out of mud, be it at the top or the bottom of an ocean. Can either you or I desire
      that the destinies of France shall be swayed by coxcombical artisans who think themselves
      superior to every man who writes grammar, and whose idea of a common-wealth is the
      confiscation of private property?” Rameau, thoroughly puzzled by this discourse, bowed his
      head, and replied whisperingly, “Proceed. You are against the Empire, yet against the
      populace!—What are you for? not, surely, the Legitimists?—are you Republican? Orleanist? or
      what?”
“Your questions are very pertinent,” answered the Vicomte, courteously, “and my answer shall
      be very frank. I am against absolute rule, whether under a Buonaparte or a Bourbon. I am for a
      free State, whether under a constitutional hereditary sovereign like the English or Belgian,
      or whether, republican in name, it be less democratic than constitutional monarchy in
      practice, like the American. But as a man interested in the fate of le Sens Commun, I hold in
      profound disdain all crotchets for revolutionising the elements of Human Nature. Enough of
      this abstract talk. To the point. You are of course aware of the violent meetings held by the
      Socialists, nominally against the plebiscite, really against the Emperor himself?”
“Yes, I know at least that the working class are extremely discontented; the numerous
      strikes last month were not on a mere question of wages—they were against the existing forms
      of society. And the articles by Pierre Firmin which brought me into collision with the
      Government, seemed to differ from what you now say. They approve those strikes; they appeared
      to sympathise with the revolutionary meetings at Belleville and Montmartre.”
“Of course—we use coarse tools for destroying; we cast them aside for finer ones when we
      want to reconstruct.
“I attended one of those meetings last night. See, I have a pass for all such assemblies,
      signed by some dolt who cannot even spell the name he assumes—‘Pom-de-Tair.’ A commissary of
      police sat yawning at the end of the orchestra, his secretary by his side, while the orators
      stammer out fragments of would-be thunderbolts. Commissary of police yawns more wearily than
      before, secretary disdains to use his pen, seizes his penknife and pares his nails. Up rises a
      wild-haired, weak-limbed silhouette of a man, and affecting a solemnity of mien which might
      have become the virtuous Guizot, moves this resolution: ‘The French people condemns Charles
      Louis Napoleon the Third to the penalty of perpetual hard labour.’ Then up rises the
      commissary of police and says quietly, ‘I declare this meeting at an end.’
“Sensation among the audience—they gesticulate—they screech—they bellow—the commissary puts
      on his greatcoat—the secretary gives a last touch to his nails and pockets his penknife—the
      audience disperses—the silhouette of a man effaces itself—all is over.”
“You describe the scene most wittily,” said Rameau, laughing, but the laugh was constrained.
      A would-be cynic himself, there was a something grave and earnest in the real cynic that awed
      him.
“What conclusion do you draw from such a scene, cher poete” asked De Mauleon, fixing his
      keen quiet eyes on Rameau.
“What conclusion? Well, that—that—”
“Yes, continue.”
“That the audience were sadly degenerated from the time when Mirabeau said to a Master of
      the Ceremonies, ‘We are here by the power of the French people, and nothing but the point of
      the bayonet shall expel us.’”
“Spoken like a poet, a French poet. I suppose you admire M. Victor Hugo. Conceding that he
      would have employed a more sounding phraseology, comprising more absolute ignorance of men,
      times, and manners in unintelligible metaphor and melodramatic braggadocio, your answer might
      have been his; but pardon me if I add, it would not be that of Common Sense.”
“Monsieur le Vicomte might rebuke me more politely,” said Rameau, colouring high.
“Accept my apologies; I did not mean to rebuke, but to instruct. The times are not those of
      1789. And Nature, ever repeating herself in the production of coxcombs and blockheads, never
      repeats herself in the production of Mirabeaus. The Empire is doomed—doomed, because it is
      hostile to the free play of intellect. Any Government that gives absolute preponderance to the
      many is hostile to intellect, for intellect is necessarily confined to the few.
“Intellect is the most revengeful of all the elements of society. It cares not what the
      materials through which it insinuates or forces its way to its seat.
“I accept the aid of Pom-de-Tair. I do not demean myself to the extent of writing articles
      that may favor the principles of Pom-de-Tair, signed in the name of Victor de Mauleon or of
      Pierre Firinin.
“I will beg you, my dear editor, to obtain clever, smart writers, who know nothing about
      Socialists and Internationalists, who therefore will not commit Le Sens Commun by advocating
      the doctrines of those idiots, but who will flatter the vanity of the canaille—vaguely; write
      any stuff they please about the renown of Paris, ‘the eye of the world,’ ‘the sun of the
      European system,’ etc., of the artisans of Paris as supplying soul to that eye and fuel to
      that sun—any blague of that sort—genre Victor Hugo; but nothing definite against life and
      property, nothing that may not be considered hereafter as the harmless extravagance of a
      poetic enthusiasm. You might write such articles yourself. In fine, I want to excite the
      multitude, and yet not to commit our journal to the contempt of the few. Nothing is to be
      admitted that may bring the law upon us except it be signed by my name. There may be a moment
      in which it would be desirable for somebody to be sent to prison: in that case, I allow no
      substitute—I go myself.
“Now you have my most secret thoughts. I intrust them to your judgment with entire
      confidence. Monsieur Lebeau gave you a high character, which you have hitherto deserved. By
      the way, have you seen anything lately of that bourgeois conspirator?”
“No, his professed business of letter-writer or agent is transferred to a clerk, who says M.
      Lebeau is abroad.”
“Ah! I don’t think that is true. I fancy I saw him the other evening gilding along the lanes
      of Belleville. He is too confirmed a conspirator to be long out of Paris; no place like Paris
      for seething brains.”
“Have you known M. Lebeau long?” asked Rameau. “Ay, many years. We are both Norman by birth,
      as you may perceive by something broad in our accent.”
“Ha! I knew your voice was familiar to me; certainly it does remind me of Lebeau’s.”
“Normans are like each other in many things besides voice and accent—obstinacy, for
      instance, in clinging to ideas once formed; this makes them good friends and steadfast
      enemies. I would advise no man to make an enemy of Lebeau.
“Au revoir, cher confrere. Do not forget to present me to Mademoiselle Cicogna.”
