CHAPTER VI.
“I believe,” said Lemercier, as the coupe rolled through the lively alleys of the Bois de
      Boulogne, “that Paris is built on a loadstone, and that every Frenchman with some iron
      globules in his blood is irresistibly attracted towards it. The English never seem to feel for
      London the passionate devotion that we feel for Paris. On the contrary, the London middle
      class, the commercialists, the shopkeepers, the clerks, even the superior artisans compelled
      to do their business in the capital, seem always scheming and pining to have their home out of
      it, though but in a suburb.”
“You have been in London, Frederic?”
“Of course; it is the mode to visit that dull and hideous metropolis.”
“If it be dull and hideous, no wonder the people who are compelled to do business in it seek
      the pleasures of home out of it.”
“It is very droll that though the middle class entirely govern the melancholy Albion, it is
      the only country in Europe in which the middle class seem to have no amusements; nay, they
      legislate against amusement. They have no leisure-day but Sunday; and on that day they close
      all their theatres, even their museums and picture-galleries. What amusements there may be in
      England are for the higher classes and the lowest.”
“What are the amusements of the lowest class?”
“Getting drunk.”
“Nothing else?”
“Yes. I was taken at night under protection of a policeman to some cabarets, where I found
      crowds of that class which is the stratum below the working class; lads who sweep crossings
      and hold horses, mendicants, and, I was told, thieves, girls whom a servant-maid would not
      speak to, very merry, dancing quadrilles and waltzes, and regaling themselves on sausages,—the
      happiest-looking folks I found in all London; and, I must say, conducting themselves very
      decently.”
“Ah!” Here Lemercier pulled the check-string. “Will you object to a walk in this quiet
      alley? I see some one whom I have promised the Englishman to—But heed me, Alain, don’t fall in
      love with her.”
