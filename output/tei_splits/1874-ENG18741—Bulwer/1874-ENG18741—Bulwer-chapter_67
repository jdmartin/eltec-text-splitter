CHAPTER II.
That evening the Morleys looked in at Isaura’s on their way to a crowded assembly at the
      house of one of those rich Americans, who were then outvying the English residents at Paris in
      the good graces of Parisian society. I think the Americans get on better with the French than
      the English do—I mean the higher class of Americans. They spend more money; their men speak
      French better; the women are better dressed, and, as a general rule, have read more largely,
      and converse more frankly. Mrs. Morley’s affection for Isaura had increased during the last
      few months. As so notable an advocate of the ascendancy of her sex, she felt a sort of
      grateful pride in the accomplishments and growing renown of so youthful a member of the
      oppressed sisterhood. But, apart from that sentiment, she had conceived a tender mother-like
      interest for the girl who stood in the world so utterly devoid of family ties, so destitute of
      that household guardianship and protection which, with all her assertion of the strength and
      dignity of woman, and all her opinions as to woman’s right of absolute emancipation from the
      conventions fabricated by the selfishness of man, Mrs. Morley was too sensible not to value
      for the individual, though she deemed it not needed for the mass. Her great desire was that
      Isaura should marry well, and soon. American women usually marry so young that it seemed to
      Mrs. Morley an anomaly in social life, that one so gifted in mind and person as Isaura should
      already have passed the age in which the belles of the great Republic are enthroned as wives
      and consecrated as mothers. We have seen that in the past year she had selected from our
      unworthy but necessary sex, Graham Vane as a suitable spouse to her young friend. She had
      divined the state of his heart—she had more than suspicions of the state of Isaura’s. She was
      exceedingly perplexed and exceedingly chafed at the Englishman’s strange disregard to his
      happiness and her own projects. She had counted, all this past winter, on his return to Paris;
      and she became convinced that some misunderstanding, possibly some lover’s quarrel, was the
      cause of his protracted absence, and a cause that, if ascertained, could be removed. A good
      opportunity now presented itself—Colonel Morley was going to London the next day. He had
      business there which would detain him at least a week. He would see Graham; and as she
      considered her husband the shrewdest and wisest person in the world—I mean of the male sex—she
      had no doubt of his being able to turn Graham’s mind thoroughly inside out, and ascertain his
      exact feelings and intentions. If the Englishman, thus assayed, were found of base metal,
      then, at least, Mrs. Morley would be free to cast him altogether aside, and coin for the uses
      of the matrimonial market some nobler effigy in purer gold.
“My dear child,” said Mrs. Morley, in a low voice, nestling herself close to Isaura, while
      the Colonel, duly instructed, drew off the Venosta, “have you heard anything lately of our
      pleasant friend Mr. Vane?”
You can guess with what artful design Mrs. Morley put that question point-blank, fixing keen
      eyes on Isaura while she put it. She saw the heightened colour, the quivering lip of the girl
      thus abruptly appealed to, and she said inly: “I was right—she loves him!”
“I heard of Mr. Vane last night—accidentally.”
“Is he coming to Paris soon?”
“Not that I know of. How charmingly that wreath becomes you! it suits the earrings so well,
      too.”
“Frank chose it; he has good taste for a man. I trust him with my commissions to Hunt and
      Roskell’s but I limit him as to price, he is so extravagant—men are, when they make presents.
      They seem to think we value things according to their cost. They would gorge us with jewels,
      and let us starve for want of a smile. Not that Frank is so bad as the rest of them. But a
      propos of Mr. Vane—Frank will be sure to see him, and scold him well for deserting us all. I
      should not be surprised if he brought the deserter back with him, for I send a little note by
      Frank, inviting him to pay us a visit. We have spare rooms in our apartments.”
Isaura’s heart heaved beneath her robe, but she replied in a tone of astonishing
      indifference: “I believe this is the height of the London season, and Mr. Vane would probably
      be too engaged to profit even by an invitation so tempting.”
“Nous verrons. How pleased he will be to hear of your triumphs! He admired you so much
      before you were famous: what will be his admiration now! men are so vain—they care for us so
      much more when people praise us. But till we have put the creatures in their proper place, we
      must take them for what they are.”
Here the Venosta, with whom the poor Colonel had exhausted all the arts at his command for
      chaining her attention, could be no longer withheld from approaching Mrs. Morley, and venting
      her admiration of that lady’s wreath, earrings, robes, flounces. This dazzling apparition had
      on her the effect which a candle has on a moth—she fluttered round it, and longed to absorb
      herself in its blaze. But the wreath especially fascinated her—a wreath which no prudent lady
      with colourings less pure, and features less exquisitely delicate than the pretty champion of
      the rights of women, could have fancied on her own brows without a shudder. But the Venosta in
      such matters was not prudent. “It can’t be dear,” she cried piteously, extending her arms
      towards Isaura. “I must have one exactly like. Who made it? Cara signora, give me the
      address.”
“Ask the Colonel, dear Madame; he chose and bought it,” and Mrs. Morley glanced
      significantly at her well-tutored Frank.
“Madame,” said the Colonel, speaking in English, which he usually did with the Venosta—who
      valued herself on knowing that language and was flattered to be addressed in it—while he
      amused himself by introducing into its forms the dainty Americanisms with which he puzzled the
      Britisher—he might well puzzle the Florentine,—“Madame, I am too anxious for the appearance of
      my wife to submit to the test of a rival schemer like yourself in the same apparel. With all
      the homage due to a sex of which I am enthused dreadful, I decline to designate the florist
      from whom I purchased Mrs. Morley’s head-fixings.”
“Wicked man!” cried the Venosta, shaking her finger at him coquettishly. “You are jealous!
      Fie! a man should never be jealous of a woman’s rivalry with women;” and then, with a cynicism
      that might have become a greybeard, she added, “but of his own sex every man should be
      jealous—though of his dearest friend. Isn’t it so, Colonello?”
The Colonel looked puzzled, bowed, and made no reply. “That only shows,” said Mrs. Morley,
      rising, “what villains the Colonel has the misfortune to call friends and fellow-men.”
“I fear it is time to go,” said Frank, glancing at the clock.
In theory the most rebellious, in practice the most obedient, of wives, Mrs. Morley here
      kissed Isaura, resettled her crinoline, and shaking hands with the Venosta, retreated to the
      door.
“I shall have the wreath yet,” cried the Venosta, impishly. “La speranza e fenamina” (Hope
      is female).
“Alas!” said Isaura, half mournfully, half smiling, “alas! do you not remember what the poet
      replied when asked what disease was most mortal?—‘the hectic fever caught from the chill of
      hope.’”
