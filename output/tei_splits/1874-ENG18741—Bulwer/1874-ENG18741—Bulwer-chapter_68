CHAPTER III.
Graham Vane was musing very gloomily in his solitary apartment one morning, when his servant
      announced Colonel Morley.
He received his visitor with more than the cordiality with which every English politician
      receives an American citizen. Graham liked the Colonel too well for what he was in himself to
      need any national title to his esteem. After some preliminary questions and answers as to the
      health of Mrs. Morley, the length of the Colonel’s stay in London, what day he could dine with
      Graham at Richmond or Gravesend, the Colonel took up the ball. “We have been reckoning to see
      you at Paris, sir, for the last six months.”
“I am very much flattered to hear that you have thought of me at all; but I am not aware of
      having warranted the expectation you so kindly express.”
“I guess you must have said something to my wife which led her to do more than expect—to
      reckon on your return. And, by the way, sir, I am charged to deliver to you this note from
      her, and to back the request it contains that you will avail yourself of the offer. Without
      summarising the points I do so.”
Graham glanced over the note addressed to him

 “DEAR MR. VANE,—Do you forget how beautiful the environs of Paris are in May and June? how
      charming it was last year at the lake of Enghien? how gay were our little dinners out of doors
      in the garden arbours, with the Savarins and the fair Italian, and her incomparably amusing
      chaperon? Frank has my orders to bring you back to renew these happy days, while the birds are
      in their first song, and the leaves are in their youngest green. I have prepared your rooms
      chez nous—a chamber that looks out on the Champs Elysees, and a quiet cabinet de travail at
      the back, in which you can read, write, or sulk undisturbed. Come, and we will again visit
      Enghien and Montmorency. Don’t talk of engagements. If man proposes, woman disposes. Hesitate
      not—obey. Your sincere little friend, Lizzy.” 
“My dear Morley,” said Graham, with emotion, “I cannot find words to thank your wife
      sufficiently for an invitation so graciously conveyed. Alas! I cannot accept it.”
“Why?” asked the Colonel, drily.
“I have too much to do in London.”
“Is that the true reason, or am I to suspicion that there is anything, sir, which makes you
      dislike a visit to Paris?”
The Americans enjoy the reputation of being the frankest putters of questions whom liberty
      of speech has yet educated into la recherche de la verite, and certainly Colonel Morley in
      this instance did not impair the national reputation.
Graham Vane’s brow slightly contracted, and he bit his lip as if stung by a sudden pang; but
      after a moment’s pause, he answered with a good-humoured smile:
“No man who has taste enough to admire the most beautiful city, and appreciate the charms of
      the most brilliant society in the world, can dislike Paris.”
“My dear sir, I did not ask you if you disliked Paris, but if there were anything that made
      you dislike coming back to it on a visit.”
“What a notion! and what a cross-examiner you would have made if you had been called to the
      bar! Surely, my dear friend, you can understand that when a man has in one place business
      which he cannot neglect, he may decline going to another place, whatever pleasure it would
      give him to do so. By the way, there is a great ball at one of the Ministers’ to-night; you
      should go there, and I will point out to you all those English notabilities in whom Americans
      naturally take interest. I will call for you at eleven o’clock. Lord ———, who is a connection
      of mine, would be charmed to know you.”
Morley hesitated; but when Graham said, “How your wife will scold you if you lose such an
      opportunity of telling her whether the Duchess of —— is as beautiful as report says, and
      whether Gladstone or Disraeli seems to your phrenological science to have the finer head!” the
      Colonel gave in, and it was settled that Graham should call for him at the Langham Hotel.
That matter arranged, Graham probably hoped that his inquisitive visitor would take leave
      for the present, but the Colonel evinced no such intention. On the contrary, settling himself
      more at ease in his arm-chair, he said, “if I remember aright, you do not object to the odour
      of tobacco?”
Graham rose and presented to his visitor a cigar-box which he took from the mantelpiece.
The Colonel shook his head, and withdrew from his breast pocket a leather case, from which
      he extracted a gigantic regalia; this he lighted from a gold match-box in the shape of a
      locket attached to his watch-chain, and took two or three preliminary puffs, with his head
      thrown back and his eyes meditatively intent upon the ceiling.
We know already that strange whim of the Colonel’s (than whom, if he so pleased, no man
      could speak purer English as spoken by the Britisher) to assert the dignity of the American
      citizen by copious use of expressions and phrases familiar to the lips of the governing class
      of the great Republic—delicacies of speech which he would have carefully shunned in the polite
      circles of the Fifth Avenue in New York. Now the Colonel was much too experienced a man of the
      world not to be aware that the commission with which his Lizzy had charged him was an
      exceedingly delicate one; and it occurred to his mother wit that the best way to acquit
      himself of it, so as to avoid the risk of giving or of receiving serious affront, would be to
      push that whim of his into more than wonted exaggeration. Thus he could more decidedly and
      briefly come to the point; and should he, in doing so, appear too meddlesome, rather provoke a
      laugh than a frown-retiring from the ground with the honours due to a humorist. Accordingly,
      in his deepest nasal intonation, and withdrawing his eyes from the ceiling, he began:
“You have not asked, sir, after the signorina, or as we popularly call her, Mademoiselle
      Cicogna?”
“Have I not? I hope she is quite well, and her lively companion, Signora Venosta.”
“They are not sick, sir; or at least they were not so last night when my wife and I had the
      pleasure to see them. Of course you have read Mademoiselle Cicogna’s book—a bright
      performance, sir, age considered.”
“Certainly, I have read the book; it is full of unquestionable genius. Is Mademoiselle
      writing another? But of course she is.”
“I am not aware of the fact, sir. It may be predicated; such a mind cannot remain inactive;
      and I know from M. Savarin and that rising young man Gustave Rameau, that the publishers bid
      high for her brains considerable. Two translations have already appeared in our country. Her
      fame, sir, will be world-wide. She may be another George Sand, or at least another Eulalie
      Grantmesnil.”
Graham’s cheek became as white as the paper I write on. He inclined his head as in assent,
      but without a word. The Colonel continued:
“We ought to be very proud of her acquaintance, sir. I think you detected her gifts while
      they were yet unconjectured. My wife says so. You must be gratified to remember that,
      sir—clear grit, sir, and no mistake.”
“I certainly more than once have said to Mrs. Morley, that I esteemed Mademoiselle’s powers
      so highly that I hoped she would never become a stage-singer and actress. But this M. Rameau?
      You say he is a rising man. It struck me when at Paris that he was one of those charlatans
      with a great deal of conceit and very little information, who are always found in scores on
      the ultra-Liberal side of politics;-possibly I was mistaken.”
“He is the responsible editor of Le Sens Commun, in which talented periodical Mademoiselle
      Cicogna’s book was first raised.”
“Of course, I know that; a journal which, so far as I have looked into its political or
      social articles, certainly written by a cleverer and an older man than M. Rameau, is for
      unsettling all things and settling nothing. We have writers of that kind among ourselves—I
      have no sympathy with them. To me it seems that when a man says, ‘Off with your head,’ he
      ought to let us know what other head he would put on our shoulders, and by what process the
      change of heads shall be effected. Honestly speaking, if you and your charming wife are
      intimate friends and admirers of Mademoiselle Cicogna, I think you could not do her a greater
      service than that of detaching her from all connection with men like M. Rameau, and journals
      like La Sens Commun.”
The Colonel here withdrew his cigar from his lips, lowered his head to a level with
      Graham’s, and relaxing into an arch significant smile, said: “Start to Paris, and dissuade her
      yourself. Start—go ahead—don’t be shy—don’t seesaw on the beam of speculation. You will have
      more influence with that young female than we can boast.” Never was England in greater danger
      of quarrel with America than at that moment; but Graham curbed his first wrathful impulse, and
      replied coldly:
“It seems to me, Colonel, that you, though very unconsciously, derogate from the respect due
      to Mademoiselle Cicogna. That the counsel of a married couple like yourself and Mrs. Morley
      should be freely given to and duly heeded by a girl deprived of her natural advisers in
      parents, is a reasonable and honourable supposition; but to imply that the most influential
      adviser of a young lady so situated is a young single man, in no way related to her, appears
      to me a dereliction of that regard to the dignity of her sex which is the chivalrous
      characteristic of your countrymen—and to Mademoiselle Cicogna herself, a surmise which she
      would be justified in resenting as an impertinence.”
“I deny both allegations,” replied the Colonel serenely. “I maintain that a single man whips
      all connubial creation when it comes to gallantising a single young woman; and that no young
      lady would be justified in resenting as impertinence my friendly suggestion to the single man
      so deserving of her consideration as I estimate you to be, to solicit the right to advise her
      for life. And that’s a caution.”
Here the Colonel resumed his regalia, and again gazed intent on the ceiling.
“Advise her for life! You mean, I presume, as a candidate for her hand.”
“You don’t Turkey now. Well, I guess, you are not wide of the mark there, sir.”
“You do me infinite honour, but I do not presume so far.”
“So, so—not as yet. Before a man who is not without gumption runs himself for Congress, he
      likes to calculate how the votes will run. Well, sir, suppose we are in caucus, and let us
      discuss the chances of the election with closed doors.”
Graham could not help smiling at the persistent officiousness of his visitor, but his smile
      was a very sad one.
“Pray change the subject, my dear Colonel Morley—it is not a pleasant one to me; and as
      regards Mademoiselle Cicogna, can you think it would not shock her to suppose that her name
      was dragged into the discussions you would provoke, even with closed doors?”
“Sir,” replied the Colonel, imperturbably, “since the doors are closed, there is no one,
      unless it be a spirit-listener under the table, who can wire to Mademoiselle Cicogna the
      substance of debate. And, for my part, I do not believe in spiritual manifestations. Fact is,
      that I have the most amicable sentiments towards both parties, and if there is a
      misunderstanding which is opposed to the union of the States, I wish to remove it while yet in
      time. Now, let us suppose that you decline to be a candidate; there are plenty of others who
      will run; and as an elector must choose one representative or other, so a gal must choose one
      husband or other. And then you only repent when it is too late. It is a great thing to be
      first in the field. Let us approximate to the point; the chances seem good-will you run? Yes
      or no?”
“I repeat, Colonel Morley, that I entertain no such presumption.”
The Colonel here, rising, extended his hand, which Graham shook with constrained cordiality,
      and then leisurely walked to the door; there he paused, as if struck by a new thought, and
      said gravely, in his natural tone of voice, “You have nothing to say, sir, against the young
      lady’s character and honour?”
“I!—heavens, no! Colonel Morley, such a question insults me.”
The Colonel resumed his deepest nasal bass: “It is only, then, because you don’t fancy her
      now so much as you did last year—fact, you are soured on her and fly off the handle. Such
      things do happen. The same thing has happened to myself, sir. In my days of celibacy, there
      was a gal at Saratoga whom I gallantised, and whom, while I was at Saratoga, I thought Heaven
      had made to be Mrs. Morley: I was on the very point of telling her so, when I was suddenly
      called off to Philadelphia; and at Philadelphia, sir, I found that Heaven had made another
      Mrs. Morley. I state this fact, sir, though I seldom talk of my own affairs, even when willing
      to tender my advice in the affairs of another, in order to prove that I do not intend to
      censure you if Heaven has served you in the same manner. Sir, a man may go blind for one gal
      when he is not yet dry behind the ears, and then, when his eyes are skinned, go in for one
      better. All things mortal meet with a change, as my sisters little boy said when, at the age
      of eight, he quitted the Methodys and turned Shaker. Threep and argue as we may, you and I are
      both mortals—more’s the pity. Good morning, sir (glancing at the clock, which proclaimed the
      hour of 3 P.M.),—I err—good evening.”
By the post that day the Colonel transmitted a condensed and laconic report of his
      conversation with Graham Vane. I can state its substance in yet fewer words. He wrote word
      that Graham positively declined the invitation to Paris; that he had then, agreeably to
      Lizzy’s instruction, ventilated the Englishman, in the most delicate terms, as to his
      intentions with regard to Isaura, and that no intentions at all existed. The sooner all
      thoughts of him were relinquished, as a new suitor on the ground, the better it would be for
      the young lady’s happiness in the only state in which happiness should be, if not found, at
      least sought, whether by maid or man.
Mrs. Morley was extremely put out by this untoward result of the diplomacy she had intrusted
      to the Colonel; and when, the next day, came a very courteous letter from Graham, thanking her
      gratefully for the kindness of her invitation, and expressing his regret briefly, though
      cordially, at his inability to profit by it, without the most distant allusion to the subject
      which the Colonel had brought on the tapis, or even requesting his compliments to the Signoras
      Venosta and Cicogna, she was more than put out, more than resentful,—she was deeply grieved.
      Being, however, one of those gallant heroes of womankind who do not give in at the first
      defeat, she began to doubt whether Frank had not rather overstrained the delicacy which he
      said he had put into his “soundings.” He ought to have been more explicit. Meanwhile she
      resolved to call on Isaura, and, without mentioning Graham’s refusal of her invitation,
      endeavour to ascertain whether the attachment which she felt persuaded the girl secretly
      cherished for this recalcitrant Englishman were something more than the first romantic
      fancy—whether it were sufficiently deep to justify farther effort on Mrs. Morley’s part to
      bring it to a prosperous issue.
She found Isaura at home and alone; and, to do her justice, she exhibited wonderful tact in
      the fulfilment of the task she had set herself. Forming her judgment by manner and look—not
      words—she returned home, convinced that she ought to seize the opportunity afforded to her by
      Graham’s letter. It was one to which she might very naturally reply, and in that reply she
      might convey the object at her heart more felicitously than the Colonel had done. “The
      cleverest man is,” she said to herself, “stupid compared to an ordinary woman in the real
      business of life, which does not consist of fighting and moneymaking.”
Now there was one point she had ascertained by words in her visit to Isaura—a point on which
      all might depend. She had asked Isaura when and where she had seen Graham last; and when
      Isaura had given her that information, and she learned it was on the eventful day on which
      Isaura gave her consent to the publication of her MS. if approved by Savarin, in the journal
      to be set up by the handsome-faced young author, she leapt to the conclusion that Graham had
      been seized with no unnatural jealousy, and was still under the illusive glamoury of that
      green-eyed fiend. She was confirmed in this notion, not altogether an unsound one, when asking
      with apparent carelessness, “And in that last interview, did you see any change in Mr. Vane’s
      manner, especially when he took leave?”
Isaura turned away pale, and involuntarily clasping her hands-as women do when they would
      suppress pain-replied, in a low murmur, “His manner was changed.”
Accordingly, Mrs. Morley sat down and wrote the following letter:
“DEAR MR. VANE,—I am very angry indeed with you for refusing my invitation—I had so counted
      on you, and I don’t believe a word of your excuse. Engagements! To balls and dinners, I
      suppose, as if you were not much too clever to care about such silly attempts to enjoy
      solitude in crowds. And as to what you men call business, you have no right to have any
      business at all. You are not in commerce; you are not in Parliament; you told me yourself that
      you had no great landed estates to give you trouble; you are rich, without any necessity to
      take pains to remain rich, or to become richer; you have no business in the world except to
      please yourself: and when you will not come to Paris to see one of your truest friends—which I
      certainly am—it simply means, that no matter how such a visit would please me, it does not
      please yourself. I call that abominably rude and ungrateful.
“But I am not writing merely to scold you. I have something else on my mind, and it must
      come out. Certainly, when you were at Paris last year you did admire, above all other young
      ladies, Isaura Cicogna. And I honoured you for doing so. I know no other young lady to be
      called her equal. Well, if you admired her then, what would you do now if you met her? Then
      she was but a girl—very brilliant, very charming, it is true—but undeveloped, untested. Now
      she is a woman, a princess among women, but retaining all that is most lovable in a girl; so
      courted, yet so simple—so gifted, yet so innocent. Her head is not a bit turned by all the
      flattery that surrounds her. Come and judge for yourself. I still hold the door of the rooms
      destined to you open for repentance.
“My dear Mr. Vane, do not think me a silly match-making little woman, when I write to you
      thus, a coeur ouvert.
“I like you so much that I would fain secure to you the rarest prize which life is ever
      likely to offer to your ambition. Where can you hope to find another Isaura? Among the
      stateliest daughters of your English dukes, where is there one whom a proud man would be more
      proud to show to the world, saying, ‘She is mine!’ where one more distinguished—I will not say
      by mere beauty, there she might be eclipsed—but by sweetness and dignity combined—in aspect,
      manner, every movement, every smile?
“And you, who are yourself so clever, so well read—you who would be so lonely with a wife
      who was not your companion, with whom you could not converse on equal terms of intellect,—my
      dear friend, where could you find a companion in whom you would not miss the poet-soul of
      Isaura? Of course I should not dare to obtrude all these questionings on your innermost
      reflection, if I had not some idea, right or wrong, that since the days when at Enghien and
      Montmorency, seeing you and Isaura side by side, I whispered to Frank, ‘So should those two be
      through life,’ some cloud has passed between your eyes and the future on which they gazed.
      Cannot that cloud be dispelled? Were you so unjust to yourself as to be jealous of a rival,
      perhaps of a Gustave Rameau? I write to you frankly—answer me frankly; and if you answer,
      ‘Mrs. Morley, I don’t know, what you mean; I admired Mademoiselle Cicogna as I might admire
      any other pretty, accomplished girl, but it is really nothing to me whether she marries
      Gustave Rameau or any one else,’—why, then, burn this letter—forget that it has been written;
      and may you never know the pang of remorseful sigh, if, in the days to come, you see her—whose
      name in that case I should profane did I repeat it—the comrade of another man’s mind, the half
      of another man’s heart, the pride and delight of another man’s blissful home.”
