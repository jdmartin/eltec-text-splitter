CHAPTER VII.
The lady in the pearl-coloured dress! Certainly it was a face that might well arrest the eye
      and linger long on the remembrance.
There are certain “beauty-women” as there are certain “beauty-men,” in whose features one
      detects no fault, who are the show figures of any assembly in which they appear, but who,
      somehow or other, inspire no sentiment and excite no interest; they lack some expression,
      whether of mind, or of soul, or of heart, without which the most beautiful face is but a
      beautiful picture. This lady was not one of those “beauty-women.” Her features taken singly
      were by no means perfect, nor were they set off by any brilliancy of colouring. But the
      countenance aroused and impressed the imagination with a belief that there was some history
      attached to it, which you longed to learn. The hair, simply parted over a forehead unusually
      spacious and high for a woman, was of lustrous darkness; the eyes, of a deep violet blue, were
      shaded with long lashes.
Their expression was soft and mournful, but unobservant. She did not notice Alain and
      Lemercier as the two men slowly passed her. She seemed abstracted, gazing into space as one
      absorbed in thought or revery. Her complexion was clear and pale, and apparently betokened
      delicate health.
Lemercier seated himself on a bench beside the path, and invited Alain to do the same. “She
      will return this way soon,” said the Parisian, “and we can observe her more attentively and
      more respectfully thus seated than if we were on foot; meanwhile, what do you think of her? Is
      she French? is she Italian? can she be English?”
“I should have guessed Italian, judging by the darkness of the hair and the outline of the
      features; but do Italians have so delicate a fairness of complexion?”
“Very rarely; and I should guess her to be French, judging by the intelligence of her
      expression, the simple neatness of her dress, and by that nameless refinement of air in which
      a Parisienne excels all the descendants of Eve,—if it were not for her eyes. I never saw a
      Frenchwoman with eyes of that peculiar shade of blue; and if a Frenchwoman had such eyes, I
      flatter myself she would have scarcely allowed us to pass without making some use of
      them.”
“Do you think she is married?” asked Alain.
“I hope so; for a girl of her age, if comme il faut, can scarcely walk alone in the Bois,
      and would not have acquired that look so intelligent,—more than intelligent,—so poetic.”
“But regard that air of unmistakable distinction; regard that expression of face,-so pure,
      so virginal: comme il faut she must be.”
As Alain said these last words, the lady, who had turned back, was approaching them, and in
      full view of their gaze. She seemed unconscious of their existence as before, and Lemercier
      noticed that her lips moved as if she were murmuring inaudibly to herself.
She did not return again, but continued her walk straight on till at the end of the alley
      she entered a carriage in waiting for her, and was driven off.
“Quick, quick!” cried Lemercier, running towards his own coupe; “we must give chase.”
Alain followed somewhat less hurriedly, and, agreeably to instructions Lemercier had already
      given to his coachman, the Parisian’s coupe set off at full speed in the track of the strange
      lady’s, which was still in sight.
In less than twenty minutes the carriage in chase stopped at the grille of one of those
      charming little villas to be found in the pleasant suburb of A——-; a porter emerged from the
      lodge, opened the gate; the carriage drove in, again stopped at the door of the house, and the
      two gentlemen could not catch even a glimpse of the lady’s robe as she descended from the
      carriage and disappeared within the house.
“I see a cafe yonder,” said Lemercier; “let us learn all we can as to the fair unknown, over
      a sorbet or a petit verre.” Alain silently, but not reluctantly, consented. He felt in the
      fair stranger an interest new to his existence.
They entered the little cafe, and in a few minutes Lemercier, with the easy savoir vivre of
      a Parisian, had extracted from the garcon as much as probably any one in the neighbourhood
      knew of the inhabitants of the villa.
It had been hired and furnished about two months previously in the name of Signora Venosta;
      but, according to the report of the servants, that lady appeared to be the gouvernante or
      guardian of a lady much younger, out of whose income the villa was rented and the household
      maintained.
It was for her the coupe was hired from Paris. The elder lady very rarely stirred out during
      the day, but always accompanied the younger in any evening visits to the theatre or the houses
      of friends.
It was only within the last few weeks that such visits had been made.
The younger lady was in delicate health, and under the care of an English physician famous
      for skill in the treatment of pulmonary complaints. It was by his advice that she took daily
      walking exercise in the Bois. The establishment consisted of three servants, all Italians, and
      speaking but imperfect French. The garcon did not know whether either of the ladies was
      married, but their mode of life was free from all scandal or suspicion; they probably belonged
      to the literary or musical world, as the garcon had observed as their visitors the eminent
      author M. Savarin and his wife; and, still more frequently, an old man not less eminent as a
      musical composer.
“It is clear to me now,” said Lemercier, as the two friends reseated themselves in the
      carriage, “that our pearly ange is some Italian singer of repute enough in her own country to
      have gained already a competence; and that, perhaps on account of her own health or her
      friend’s, she is living quietly here in the expectation of some professional engagement, or
      the absence of some foreign lover.”
“Lover! do you think that?” exclaimed Alain, in a tone of voice that betrayed pain.
“It is possible enough; and in that case the Englishman may profit little by the information
      I have promised to give him.”
“You have promised the Englishman?”
“Do you not remember last night that he described the lady, and said that her face haunted
      him: and I—”
“Ah! I remember now. What do you know of this Englishman? He is rich, I suppose.”
“Yes, I hear he is very rich now; that an uncle lately left him an enormous sum of money. He
      was attached to the English Embassy many years ago, which accounts for his good French and his
      knowledge of Parisian life. He comes to Paris very often, and I have known him some time.
      Indeed he has intrusted to me a difficult and delicate commission. The English tell me that
      his father was one of the most eminent members of their Parliament, of ancient birth, very
      highly connected, but ran out his fortune and died poor; that our friend had for some years to
      maintain himself, I fancy, by his pen; that he is considered very able; and, now that his
      uncle has enriched him, likely to enter public life and run a career as distinguished as his
      father’s.”
“Happy man! happy are the English,” said the Marquis, with a sigh; and as the carriage now
      entered Paris, he pleaded the excuse of an engagement, bade his friend goodby, and went his
      way musing through the crowded streets.
