CHAPTER VI.
On leaving his cousin’s house Graham walked on, he scarce knew or cared whither, the image
      of the beloved dead so forcibly recalled the solemnity of the mission with which he had been
      intrusted, and which hitherto he had failed to fulfil. What if the only mode by which he
      could, without causing questions and suspicions that might result in dragging to day the
      terrible nature of the trust he held, enrich the daughter of Richard King, repair all wrong
      hitherto done to her, and guard the sanctity of Lady Janet’s home,—should be in that union
      which Richard King had commended to him while his heart was yet free? In such a case, would
      not gratitude to the dead, duty to the living, make that union imperative at whatever
      sacrifice of happiness to himself? The two years to which Richard King had limited the
      suspense of research were not yet expired. Then, too, that letter of Lady Janet’s,—so tenderly
      anxious for his future, so clear-sighted as to the elements of his own character in its
      strength or its infirmities—combined with graver causes to withhold his heart from its
      yearning impulse, and—no, not steel it against Isaura, but forbid it to realise, in the fair
      creature and creator of romance, his ideal of the woman to whom an earnest, sagacious,
      aspiring man commits all the destinies involved in the serene dignity of his hearth. He could
      not but own that this gifted author—this eager seeker after fame—this brilliant and bold
      competitor with men on their own stormy battle-ground-was the very person from whom Lady Janet
      would have warned away his choice. She (Isaura) merge her own distinctions in a husband’s;—she
      leave exclusively to him the burden of fame and calumny!—she shun “to be talked about!” she
      who could feel her life to be a success or a failure, according to the extent and the loudness
      of the talk which it courted!
While these thoughts racked his mind, a kindly hand was laid on his arm, and a cheery voice
      accosted him. “Well met, my dear Vane! I see we are bound to the same place; there will be a
      good gathering to-night.”
“What do you mean, Bevil? I am going nowhere, except to my own quiet rooms.”
“Pooh! Come in here at least for a few minutes,”—and Bevil drew him up to the door-step of a
      house close by, where, on certain evenings, a well-known club drew together men who seldom
      meet so familiarly elsewhere—men of all callings; a club especially favoured by wits, authors,
      and the flaneurs of polite society.
Graham shook his head, about to refuse, when Bevil added, “I have just come from Paris, and
      can give you the last news, literary, political, and social. By the way, I saw Savarin the
      other night at the Cicogna’s—he introduced me there.” Graham winced; he was spelled by the
      music of a name, and followed his acquaintance into the crowded room, and, after returning
      many greetings and nods, withdrew into a remote corner, and motioned Bevil to a seat beside
      him.
“So you met Savarin? Where, did you say?”
“At the house of the new lady-author—I hate the word authoress—Mademoiselle Cicogna! Of
      course you have read her book?”
“Yes.”
“Full of fine things, is it not?—though somewhat highflown and sentimental: however, nothing
      succeeds like success. No book has been more talked about at Paris: the only thing more talked
      about is the lady-author herself.”
“Indeed, and how?”
“She doesn’t look twenty, a mere girl—of that kind of beauty which so arrests the eye that
      you pass by other faces to gaze on it, and the dullest stranger would ask, ‘Who, and what is
      she?’ A girl, I say, like that—who lives as independently as if she were a middle-aged widow,
      receives every week (she has her Thursdays), with no other chaperon than an old ci-devant
      Italian singing woman, dressed like a guy—must set Parisian tongues into play even if she had
      not written the crack book of the season.”
“Mademoiselle Cicogna receives on Thursdays,—no harm in that; and if she have no other
      chaperon than the Italian lady you mention, it is because Mademoiselle Cicogna is an orphan,
      and having a fortune, such as it is, of her own, I do not see why she should not live as
      independently as many an unmarried woman in London placed under similar circumstances. I
      suppose she receives chiefly persons in the literary or artistic world, and if they are all as
      respectable as the Savarins, I do not think ill-nature itself could find fault with her social
      circle.”
“Ah! you know the Cicogna, I presume. I am sure I did not wish to say anything that could
      offend her best friends, only I do think it is a pity she is not married, poor girl!”
“Mademoiselle Cicogna, accomplished, beautiful, of good birth (the Cicogna’s rank among the
      oldest of Lombard families), is not likely to want offers.”
“Offers of marriage,—h’m—well, I dare say, from authors and artists. You know Paris better
      even than I do, but I don’t suppose authors and artists there make the most desirable
      husbands; and I scarcely know a marriage in France between a man-author and lady-author which
      does not end in the deadliest of all animosities—that of wounded amour propre. Perhaps the man
      admires his own genius too much to do proper homage to his wife’s.”
“But the choice of Mademoiselle Cicogna need not be restricted to the pale of
      authorship—doubtless she has many admirers beyond that quarrelsome borderland.”
“Certainly-countless adorers. Enguerrand de Vandemar—you know that diamond of dandies?”
“Perfectly—is he an admirer?”
“Cela va sans dire—he told me that though she was not the handsomest woman in Paris, all
      other women looked less handsome since he had seen her. But, of course, French lady-killers
      like Enguerrand, when it comes to marriage, leave it to their parents to choose their wives
      and arrange the terms of the contract. Talking of lady-killers, I beheld amid the throng at
      Mademoiselle Cicogna’s the ci-devant Lovelace whom I remember some twenty-three years ago as
      the darling of wives and the terror of husbands-Victor de Mauleon.”
“Victor de Mauleon at Mademoiselle Cicogna’s!—what, is that man restored to society?”
“Ah! you are thinking of the ugly old story about the jewels—oh, yes, he has got over that;
      all his grand relations, the Vandemars, Beauvilliers, Rochebriant, and others, took him by the
      hand when he reappeared at Paris last year; and though I believe he is still avoided by many,
      he is courted by still more—and avoided, I fancy, rather from political than social causes.
      The Imperialist set, of course, execrate and prescribe him. You know he is the writer of those
      biting articles signed Pierre Firmin in the Sens Commun; and I am told he is the proprietor of
      that very clever journal, which has become a power.”
“So, so—that is the journal in which Mademoiselle Cicogna’s roman first appeared. So,
      so—Victor de Mauleon one of her associates, her counsellor and friend—ah!”
“No, I didn’t say that; on the contrary, he was presented to her the first time the evening
      I was at the house. I saw that young silk-haired coxcomb, Gustave Rameau, introduce him to
      her. You don’t perhaps know Rameau, editor of the Sens Commun—writes poems and criticisms.
      They say he is a Red Republican, but De Mauleon keeps truculent French politics subdued if not
      suppressed in his cynical journal. Somebody told me that the Cicogna is very much in love with
      Rameau; certainly he has a handsome face of his own, and that is the reason why she was so
      rude to the Russian Prince X——-.”
“How rude! Did the Prince propose to her?”
“Propose! you forget—he is married. Don’t you know the Princess? Still there are other kinds
      of proposals than those of marriage which a rich Russian prince may venture to make to a
      pretty novelist brought up for the stage.”
“Bevil!” cried Graham, grasping the man’s arm fiercely, “how dare you?”
“My dear boy,” said Bevil, very much astonished, “I really did not know that your interest
      in the young lady was so great. If I have wounded you in relating a mere on dit picked up at
      the Jockey Club, I beg you a thousand pardons. I dare say there was not a word of truth in
      it.”
“Not a word of truth, you may be sure, if the on dit was injurious to Mademoiselle Cicogna.
      It is true, I have a strong interest in her; any man—any gentleman—would have such interest in
      a girl so brilliant and seemingly so friendless. It shames one of human nature to think that
      the reward which the world makes to those who elevate its platitudes, brighten its dulness,
      delight its leisure, is Slander! I have had the honour to make the acquaintance of this lady
      before she became a ‘celebrity,’ and I have never met in my paths through life a purer heart
      or a nobler nature. What is the wretched on dit you condescend to circulate? Permit me to
      add:
“‘He who repeats a slander shares the crime.’”
“Upon my honour, my dear Vane,” said Bevil seriously (he did not want for spirit), “I hardly
      know you this evening. It is not because duelling is out of fashion that a man should allow
      himself to speak in a tone that gives offence to another who intended none; and if duelling is
      out of fashion in England, it is still possible in France.—Entre nous, I would rather cross
      the Channel with you than submit to language that conveys unmerited insult.”
Graham’s cheek, before ashen pale, flushed into dark red. “I understand you,” he said
      quietly, “and will be at Boulogne to-morrow.”
“Graham Vane,” replied Bevil, with much dignity, “you and I have known each other a great
      many years, and neither of us has cause to question the courage of the other; but I am much
      older than yourself—permit me to take the melancholy advantage of seniority. A duel between us
      in consequence of careless words said about a lady in no way connected with either, would be a
      cruel injury to her; a duel on grounds so slight would little injure me—a man about town, who
      would not sit an hour in the House of Commons if you paid him a thousand pounds a minute. But
      you, Graham Vane—you whose destiny it is to canvass electors and make laws—would it not be an
      injury to you to be questioned at the hustings why you broke the law, and why you sought
      another man’s life? Come, come! shake hands and consider all that seconds, if we chose them,
      would exact, is said, every affront on either side retracted, every apology on either side
      made.”
“Bevil, you disarm and conquer me. I spoke like a hotheaded fool; forget it—forgive.
      But—but—I can listen calmly now—what is that on dit?”
“One that thoroughly bears out your own very manly upholding of the poor young orphan, whose
      name I shall never again mention without such respect as would satisfy her most sensitive
      champion. It was said that the Prince X——— boasted that before a week was out Mademoiselle
      Cicogna should appear in his carriage at the Bois de Boulogne, and wear at the opera diamonds
      he had sent to her; that this boast was enforced by a wager, and the terms of the wager
      compelled the Prince to confess the means he had taken to succeed, and produce the evidence
      that he had lost or won. According to this on dit, the Prince had written to Mademoiselle
      Cicogna, and the letter had been accompanied by a parure that cost him half a million of
      francs; that the diamonds had been sent back with a few words of such scorn as a queen might
      address to an upstart lackey. But, my dear Vane, it is a mournful position for the girl to
      receive such offers; and you must agree with me in wishing she were safely married, even to
      Monsieur Rameau, coxcomb though he be. Let us hope that they will be an exception to French
      authors, male and female, in general, and live like turtle-doves.”
