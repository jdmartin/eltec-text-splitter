CHAPTER VIII.
The day which had inflicted on Isaura so keen an anguish was marked by a great trial in the
      life of Alain de Rochebriant.
In the morning he received the notice “of un commandement tendant a saisie immobiliere,” on
      the part of his creditor, M. Louvier; in plain English, an announcement that his property at
      Rochebriant would be put up to public sale on a certain day, in case all debts due to the
      mortgagee were not paid before. An hour afterwards came a note from Duplessis stating that “he
      had returned from Bretagne on the previous evening, and would be very happy to see the Marquis
      de Rochebriant before two o’clock, if not inconvenient to call.”
Alain put the “commandement” into his pocket, and repaired to the Hotel Duplessis.
The financier received him with very cordial civility. Then he began: “I am happy to say I
      left your excellent aunt in very good health. She honoured the letter of introduction to her
      which I owe to your politeness with the most amiable hospitalities; she insisted on my
      removing from the auberge at which I first put up and becoming a guest under your venerable
      roof-tree—a most agreeable lady, and a most interesting chateau.”
“I fear your accommodation was in striking contrast to your comforts at Paris; my chateau is
      only interesting to an antiquarian enamoured of ruins.”
“Pardon me, ‘ruins’ is an exaggerated expression. I do not say that the chateau does not
      want some repairs, but they would not be costly; the outer walls are strong enough to defy
      time for centuries to come, and a few internal decorations and some modern additions of
      furniture would make the old manoir a home fit for a prince. I have been over the whole
      estate, too, with the worthy M. Hebert,—a superb property.”
“Which M. Louvier appears to appreciate,” said Alain, with a somewhat melancholy smile,
      extending to Duplessis the menacing notice.
Duplessis glanced at it, and said drily: “M. Louvier knows what he is about. But I think we
      had better put an immediate stop to formalities which must be painful to a creditor so
      benevolent. I do not presume to offer to pay the interest due on the security you can give for
      the repayment. If you refused that offer from so old a friend as Lemercier, of course you
      could not accept it from me. I make another proposal, to which you can scarcely object. I do
      not like to give my scheming rival on the Bourse the triumph of so profoundly planned a
      speculation. Aid me to defeat him. Let me take the mortgage on myself, and become sole
      mortgagee—hush!—on this condition,—that there should be an entire union of interests between
      us two; that I should be at liberty to make the improvements I desire, and when the
      improvements be made, there should be a fair arrangement as to the proportion of profits due
      to me as mortgagee and improver, to you as original owner. Attend, my dear Marquis,—I am
      speaking as a mere man of business. I see my way to adding more than a third, I might even say
      a half—to the present revenues of Rochbriant. The woods have been sadly neglected, drainage
      alone would add greatly to their produce. Your orchards might be rendered magnificent supplies
      to Paris with better cultivation. Lastly, I would devote to building purposes or to market
      gardens all the lands round the two towns of ——— and ————-. I think I can lay my hands on
      suitable speculators for these last experiments. In a word, though the market value of
      Rochebriant, as it now stands, would not be equivalent to the debt on it, in five or six years
      it could be made worth—well, I will not say how much—but we shall be both well satisfied with
      the result. Meanwhile, if you allow me to find purchasers for your timber, and if you will not
      suffer the Chevalier de Finisterre to regulate your expenses, you need have no fear that the
      interest due to me will not be regularly paid, even though I shall be compelled, for the first
      year or two at least, to ask a higher rate of interest than Louvier exacted—say a quarter per
      cent. more; and in suggesting that, you will comprehend that this is now a matter of business
      between us, and not of friendship.”
Alain turned his head aside to conceal his emotion, and then, with the quick affectionate
      impulse of the genuine French nature, threw himself on the financier’s breast and kissed him
      on both cheeks.
“You save me! you save the home and the tombs of my ancestors! Thank you I cannot; but I
      believe in God—I pray—I will pray for you as for a father; and if ever,” he hurried on in
      broken words, “I am mean enough to squander on idle luxuries one franc that I should save for
      the debt due to you, chide me as a father would chide a graceless son.”
Moved as Alain was, Duplessis was moved yet more deeply. “What father would not be proud of
      such a son? Ah, if I had such a one!” he said softly. Then, quickly recovering his wonted
      composure, he added, with the sardonic smile which often chilled his friends and alarmed his
      foes, “Monsieur Louvier is about to pass that which I ventured to promise him, a ‘mauvais
      quart-d’heure.’ Lend me that commandement tendant a saisie. I must be off to my avoue with
      instructions. If you have no better engagement, pray dine with me to-day and accompany Valerie
      and myself to the opera.”
I need not say that Alain accepted the invitation. How happy Valerie was that evening!
