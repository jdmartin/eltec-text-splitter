CHAPTER XV.
It needs no length of words to inform thee, my intelligent reader, be thou man or woman—but
      more especially woman—of the consequences following each other, as wave follows wave in a
      tide, that resulted from the interview with which my last chapter closed. Gustave is removed
      to his parents’ house; he remains for weeks confined within doors, or, on sunny days, takes an
      hour or so in his own carriage, drawn by the horse bought from Rochebriant, into by-roads
      remote from the fashionable world; Isaura visits his mother, liking, respecting, influenced by
      her more and more; in those visits she sits beside the sofa on which Rameau reclines.
      Gradually, gently—more and more by his mother’s lips—is impressed on her the belief that it is
      in her power to save a human life, and to animate its career towards those goals which are
      never based wholly upon earth in the earnest eyes of genius, or perhaps in the yet more upward
      vision of pure-souled believing woman.
And Gustave himself, as he passes through the slow stages of convalescence, seems so
      gratefully to ascribe to her every step in his progress—seems so gently softened in
      character—seems so refined from the old affectations, so ennobled above the old cynicism—and,
      above all, so needing her presence, so sunless without it, that—well, need I finish the
      sentence?—the reader will complete what I leave unsaid.
Enough, that one day Isaura returned home from a visit at Madame Rameau’s with the knowledge
      that her hand was pledged—her future life disposed of; and that, escaping from the Venosta,
      whom she so fondly, and in her hunger for a mother’s love, called Madre, the girl shut herself
      up in her own room with locked doors.
Ah, poor child! ah, sweet-voiced Isaura! whose delicate image I feel myself too rude and too
      hard to transfer to this page in the purity of its outlines, and the blended softnesses of its
      hues—thou who, when saying things serious in the words men use, saidst them with a seriousness
      so charming, and with looks so feminine—thou, of whom no man I ever knew was quite worthy—ah,
      poor, simple, miserable girl, as I see thee now in the solitude of that white-curtained
      virginal room; hast thou, then, merged at last thy peculiar star into the cluster of all these
      commonplace girls whose lips have said “Ay,” when their hearts said “No”?—thou, O brilliant
      Isaura! thou, O motherless child!
She had sunk into her chair—her own favourite chair, the covering of it had been embroidered
      by Madame de Grantmesnil, and bestowed on her as a birthday present last year—the year in
      which she had first learned what it is to love—the year in which she had first learned what it
      is to strive for fame. And somehow uniting, as many young people do, love and fame in dreams
      of the future, that silken seat had been to her as the Tripod of Delphi was to the Pythian:
      she had taken to it, as it were intuitively, in all those hours, whether of joy or sorrow,
      when youth seeks to prophesy, and does but dream.
There she sat now, in a sort of stupor—a sort of dreary bewilderment—the illusion of the
      Pythian gone—desire of dream and of prophecy alike extinct—pressing her hands together, and
      muttering to herself, “What has happened?—what have I done?”
Three hours later you would not have recognised the same face that you see now. For then the
      bravery, the honour, the loyalty of the girl’s nature had asserted their command. Her promise
      had been given to one man—it could not be recalled. Thought itself of any other man must be
      banished. On her hearth lay ashes and tinder—the last remains of every treasured note from
      Graham Vane; of the hoarded newspaper extracts that contained his name; of the dry treatise he
      had published, and which had made the lovely romance-writer first desire “to know something
      about politics.” Ay, if the treatise had been upon fox-hunting, she would have desired “to
      know something about” that! Above all, yet distinguishable from the rest—as the sparks still
      upon stem and leaf here and there faintly glowed and twinkled—the withered flowers which
      recorded that happy hour in the arbour, and the walks of the forsaken garden—the hour in which
      she had so blissfully pledged herself to renounce that career in art wherein fame would have
      been secured, but which would not have united Fame with Love—in dreams evermore over now.
