CHAPTER XXV. I KEEP MY APPOINTMENT.
THE poverty-stricken aspect of the street when we entered it, the
                                   dirty and dilapidated condition of the house when we drew up at
                                   the door, would have warned most men, in my position, to prepare
                                   themselves for a distressing discovery when they were admitted to
                                   the interior of the dwelling. The first impression which the
                                   place produced on my mind suggested, on
                                   the contrary, that the boy’s answers to my questions had led me
                                   astray. It was simply impossible to associate Mrs. Van Brandt (as
                                        I remembered her) with the spectacle
                                   of such squalid poverty as I now beheld. I rang the door-bell,
                                   feeling persuaded beforehand that my inquiries would lead to no
                                   useful result.
As I lifted my hand to the bell, my little companion’s dread of a
                                   beating revived in full force. He hid himself behind me; and when
                                   I asked what he was about, he answered, confidentially: “Please
                                   stand between us, sir, when mother opens the door!”
A tall and truculent woman answered the bell. No introduction was
                                   necessary. Holding a cane in her hand, she stood self-proclaimed
                                   as my small friend’s mother.
“I thought it was that vagabond of a boy of mine,” she explained,
                                   as an apology for the exhibition of the cane. “He has been gone
                                   on an errand more than two hours. What did you please to want,
                                   sir?”
I interceded for the unfortunate boy before I entered on my own
                                   business.
“I must beg you to forgive your son this time,” I said. “I found
                                   him lost in the streets; and I have brought him home.”
The woman’s astonishment when she heard what I had done, and
                                   discovered her son behind me, literally struck her dumb. The
                                   language of the eye, superseding on this occasion the language of
                                   the tongue, plainly revealed the impression that I had produced
                                   on her: “You bring my lost brat home in a cab! Mr. Stranger, you
                                   are mad.”
“I hear that you have a lady named Brand lodging in the house,” I
                                   went on. “I dare say I am mistaken in supposing her to be a lady
                                   of the same name whom I know. But I should like to make sure
                                   whether I am right or wrong. Is it too late to disturb your
                                   lodger to-night?”
The woman recovered the use of her tongue.
“My lodger is up and waiting for that little fool, who doesn’t know
                                   his way about London yet!” She emphasized those words by shaking
                                   her brawny fist at her son—who instantly returned to his place of
                                   refuge behind the tail of my coat. “Have you got the money?”
                                   inquired the terrible person, shouting at her hidden offspring
                                   over my shoulder. “Or have you lost that
                                   as well as your own stupid little self?”
The boy showed himself again, and put the money into his mother’s
                                   knotty hand. She counted it, with eyes which satisfied themselves
                                   fiercely that each coin was of genuine silver—and then became
                                   partially pacified.
“Go along upstairs,” she growled, addressing her son; “and don’t
                                   keep the lady waiting any longer. They’re half starved, she and
                                   her child,” the woman proceeded, turning to me. “The food my boy
                                   has got for them in his basket will be the first food the mother
                                   has tasted today. She’s pawned everything by this time; and what
                                   she’s to do unless you help her is more than I can say. The
                                   doctor does what he can; but he told me today, if she wasn’t
                                   better nourished, it was no use sending for him. Follow the boy; and see for yourself if it’s the
                                   lady you know.”
I listened to the woman, still feeling persuaded that I had acted
                                   under a delusion in going to her house. How was it possible to
                                   associate the charming object of my heart’s worship with the
                                   miserable story of destitution which I had just heard? I stopped
                                   the boy on the first landing, and told him to announce me simply
                                   as a doctor, who had been informed of Mrs. Brand’s illness, and
                                   who had called to see her.
We ascended a second flight of stairs, and a third. Arrived now at
                                   the top of the house, the boy knocked at the door that was
                                   nearest to us on the landing. No audible voice replied. He opened
                                   the door without ceremony, and went in. I waited outside to hear
                                   what was said. The door was left ajar. If the voice of “Mrs.
                                   Brand” was (as I believed it would prove to be) the voice of a
                                   stranger, I resolved to offer her delicately such help as lay
                                   within my power, and to return forthwith to my post under “the
                                   shadow of Saint Paul’s.”
The first voice that spoke to the boy was the voice of a child.
“I’m so hungry, Jemmy—I’m so hungry!”
“All right, missy—I’ve got you something to eat.”
“Be quick, Jemmy! Be quick!”
There was a momentary pause; and then I heard the boy’s voice once
                                   more.
“There’s a slice of bread-and-butter, missy. You must wait for your
                                   egg till I can boil it. Don’t you eat too fast, or you’ll choke
                                   yourself. What’s the matter with your mamma? Are you asleep,
                                   ma’am?”
I could barely hear the answering voice—it was so faint; and it
                                   uttered but one word: “No!”
The boy spoke again.
“Cheer up, missus. There’s a doctor outside waiting to see
                                   you.”
This time there was no audible reply. The boy showed himself to me
                                   at the door. “Please to come in, sir. I
                                   can’t make anything of her.”
It would have been misplaced delicacy to have hesitated any longer
                                   to enter the room. I went in.
There, at the opposite end of a miserably furnished bed-chamber,
                                   lying back feebly in a tattered old arm-chair, was one more among
                                   the thousands of forlorn creatures, starving that night in the
                                   great city. A white handkerchief was laid over her face as if to
                                   screen it from the flame of the fire hard by. She lifted the
                                   handkerchief, startled by the sound of my footsteps as I entered
                                   the room. I looked at her, and saw in the white, wan, death-like
                                   face the face of the woman I loved!
For a moment the horror of the discovery turned me faint and giddy.
                                   In another instant I was kneeling by her chair. My arm was round
                                   her—her head lay on my shoulder. She was past speaking, past
                                   crying out: she trembled silently, and that was all. I said
                                   nothing. No words passed my lips, no tears came to my relief. I
                                   held her to me; and she let me hold her. The child, devouring its
                                   bread-and-butter at a little round table, stared at us. The boy,
                                   on his knees before the grate, mending the fire, stared at us.
                                   And the slow minutes lagged on; and the buzzing of a fly in a
                                   corner was the only sound in the room.
The instincts of the profession to which I had been trained, rather
                                   than any active sense of the horror of the situation in which I
                                   was placed, roused me at last. She was starving! I saw it in the
                                   deadly color of her skin; I felt it in the faint, quick flutter
                                   of her pulse. I called the boy to me, and sent him to the nearest
                                   public-house for wine and biscuits. “Be quick about it,” I said;
                                   “and you shall have more money for yourself than ever you had in
                                   your life!” The boy looked at me, spit on the coins in his hand,
                                   said, “That’s for luck!” and ran out of the room as never boy ran
                                   yet.
I turned to speak my first words of comfort to the mother. The cry
                                   of the child stopped me.
“I’m so hungry! I’m so hungry!”
I set more food before the famished child and kissed her. She
                                   looked up at me with wondering eyes.
“Are you a new papa?” the little creature asked. “My other papa
                                   never kisses me.”
I looked at the mother. Her eyes were closed; the tears flowed
                                   slowly over her worn, white cheeks. I took her frail hand in
                                   mine. “Happier days are coming,” I said; “you are my care now.” There was no answer. She
                                   still trembled silently, and that was all.
In less than five minutes the boy returned, and earned his promised
                                   reward. He sat on the floor by the fire counting his treasure,
                                   the one happy creature in the room. I soaked some crumbled
                                   morsels of biscuit in the wine, and, little by little, I revived
                                   her failing strength by nourishment administered at intervals in
                                   that cautious form. After a while she raised her head, and looked
                                   at me with wondering eyes that were pitiably like the eyes of her
                                   child. A faint, delicate flush began to show itself in her face.
                                   She spoke to me, for the first time, in whispering tones that I
                                   could just hear as I sat close at her side.
“How did you find me? Who showed you the way to this place?”
She paused; painfully recalling the memory of something that was
                                   slow to come back. Her color deepened; she found the lost
                                   remembrance, and looked at me with a timid curiosity. “What
                                   brought you here?” she asked. “Was it my dream?”
“Wait, dearest, till you are stronger, and I will tell you
                                   all.”
I lifted her gently, and laid her on the wretched bed. The child
                                   followed us, and climbing to the bedstead with my help, nestled
                                   at her mother’s side. I sent the boy away to tell the mistress of
                                   the house that I should remain with my patient, watching her
                                   progress toward recovery, through the night. He went out,
                                   jingling his money joyfully in his pocket. We three were left
                                   together.
As the long hours followed each other, she fell at intervals into a
                                   broken sleep; waking with a start, and looking at me wildly as if
                                   I had been a stranger at her bedside. Toward morning the
                                   nourishment which I still carefully administered wrought its
                                   healthful change in her pulse, and composed her to quieter
                                   slumbers. When the sun rose she was sleeping as peacefully as the
                                   child at her side. I was able to leave her, until my return later
                                   in the day, under the care of the woman of the house. The magic
                                   of money transformed this termagant and terrible person into a
                                   docile and attentive nurse—so eager to follow my instructions
                                   exactly that she begged me to commit them to writing before I
                                   went away. For a moment I still lingered alone at the bedside of
                                   the sleeping woman, and satisfied myself for the hundredth time
                                   that her life was safe, before I left her. It was the sweetest of
                                   all rewards to feel sure of this—to touch her cool forehead
                                   lightly with my lips—to look, and look again, at the poor worn
                                   face, always dear, always beautiful, to my
                                   eyes. change as it might. I closed the door softly and went out
                                   in the bright morning, a happy man again. So close together rise
                                   the springs of joy and sorrow in human life! So near in our
                                   heart, as in our heaven, is the brightest sunshine to the
                                   blackest cloud!
