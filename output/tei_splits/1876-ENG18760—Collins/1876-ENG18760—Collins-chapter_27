CHAPTER XXIX. OUR DESTINIES PART US.
DESCENDING to the ground-floor of the house, I sent to request a
                                   moment’s interview with the landlady. I had yet to learn in which
                                   of the London prisons Van Brandt was confined; and she was the
                                   only person to whom I could venture to address the question.
Having answered my inquiries, the woman put her own sordid
                                   construction on my motive for visiting the prisoner.
“Has the money you left upstairs gone into his greedy pockets
                                   already?” she asked. “If I was as rich as you are, I should let
                                   it go. In your place, I wouldn’t touch him with a pair of
                                   tongs!”
The woman’s coarse warning actually proved useful to me; it started
                                   a new idea in my mind! Before she spoke, I had been too dull or
                                   too preoccupied to see that it was quite needless to degrade
                                   myself by personally communicating with Van Brandt in his prison.
                                   It only now occurred to me that my legal advisers were, as a
                                   matter of course, the proper persons to represent me in the
                                   matter—with this additional advantage, that they could keep my
                                   share in the transaction a secret even from Van Brandt
                                   himself.
I drove at once to the office of my lawyers. The senior partner—the
                                   tried friend and adviser of our family—received me.
My instructions, naturally enough, astonished him. He was
                                   immediately to satisfy the prisoner’s creditors, on my behalf,
                                   without mentioning my name to any one. And he was gravely to
                                   accept as security for repayment—Mr. Van Brandt’s note of
                                   hand!
“I thought I was well acquainted with the various methods by which
                                   a gentleman can throw away his money,” the senior partner
                                   remarked. “I congratulate you, Mr. Germaine, on having discovered
                                   an entirely new way of effectually emptying your purse. Founding
                                   a newspaper, taking a theater, keeping race-horses, gambling at
                                   Monaco, are highly efficient as modes of losing money. But they
                                   all yield, sir, to paying the debts of Mr. Van Brandt!”
I left him, and went home.
The servant who opened the door had a message for me from my
                                   mother. She wished to see me as soon as I was at leisure to speak
                                   to her.
I presented myself at once in my mother’s sitting-room.
“Well, George?” she said, without a word to prepare me for what was
                                   coming. “How have you left Mrs. Van Brandt?”
I was completely thrown off my guard.
“Who has told you that I have seen Mrs. Van Brandt?” I asked.
“My dear, your face has told me. Don’t I know by this time how you
                                   look and how you speak when Mrs. Van Brandt is in your mind. Sit
                                   down by me. I have something to say to you which I wanted to say
                                   this morning; but, I hardly know why, my heart failed me. I am
                                   bolder now, and I can say it. My son, you still love Mrs. Van
                                   Brandt. You have my permission to marry her.”
Those were the words! Hardly an hour had elapsed since Mrs. Van
                                   Brandt’s own lips had told me that our union was impossible. Not
                                   even half an hour had passed since I had given the directions
                                   which would restore to liberty the man who was the one obstacle
                                   to my marriage. And this was the time that my mother had
                                   innocently chosen for consenting to receive as her
                                   daughter-in-law Mrs. Van Brandt!
“I see that I surprise you,” she resumed. “Let me explain my motive
                                   as plainly as I can. I should not be speaking the truth, George,
                                   if I told you that I have ceased to feel the serious objections
                                   that there are to your marrying this lady. The only difference in
                                   my way of thinking is, that I am now willing to set my objections
                                   aside, out of regard for your happiness. I am an old woman, my
                                   dear. In the course of nature, I cannot hope to be with you much
                                   longer. When I am gone, who will be left to care for you and love
                                   you, in the place of your mother? No one will be left, unless you
                                   marry Mrs. Van Brandt. Your happiness is my first consideration,
                                   and the woman you love (sadly as she has been led astray) is a
                                   woman worthy of a better fate. Marry her.”
I could not trust myself to speak. I could only kneel at my
                                   mother’s feet, and hide my face on her knees, as if I had been a
                                   boy again.
“Think of it, George,” she said. “And come back to me when you are
                                   composed enough to speak as quietly of the future as I do.”
She lifted my head and kissed me. As I rose to leave her, I saw
                                   something in the dear old eyes that met mine so tenderly, which
                                   struck a sudden fear through me, keen and cutting, like a stroke
                                   from a knife.
The moment I had closed the door, I went downstairs to the porter
                                   in the hall.
“Has my mother left the house,” I asked, “while I have been
                                   away?”
“No, sir.”
“Have any visitors called?”
“One visitor has called, sir.”
“Do you know who it was?”
The porter mentioned the name of a celebrated physician—a man at
                                   the head of his profession in those days. I instantly took my hat
                                   and went to his house.
He had just returned from his round of visits. My card was taken to
                                   him, and was followed at once by my admission to his
                                   consulting-room.
“You have seen my mother,” I said. “Is she seriously ill? and have
                                   you not concealed it from her? For God’s sake, tell me the truth;
                                   I can bear it.”
The great man took me kindly by the hand.
“Your mother stands in no need of any warning; she is herself aware
                                   of the critical state of her health,” he said. “She sent for me
                                   to confirm her own conviction. I could not conceal from her—I
                                   must not conceal from you—that the vital energies are sinking.
                                   She may live for some months longer in a milder air than the air
                                   of London. That is all I can say. At her age, her days are
                                   numbered.”
He gave me time to steady myself under the blow; and then he placed
                                   his vast experience, his matured and consummate knowledge, at my
                                   disposal. From his dictation, I committed to writing the
                                   necessary instructions for watching over the frail tenure of my
                                   mother’s life.
“Let me give you one word of warning,” he said, as we parted. “Your
                                   mother is especially desirous that you should know nothing of the
                                   precarious condition of her health. Her one anxiety is to see you
                                   happy. If she discovers your visit to me, I will not answer for
                                   the consequences. Make the best excuse you can think of for at
                                   once taking her away from London, and, whatever you may feel in
                                   secret, keep up an appearance of good spirits in her
                                   presence.”
That evening I made my excuse. It was easily found. I had only to
                                   tell my poor mother of Mrs. Van Brandt’s refusal to marry me, and
                                   there was an intelligible motive assigned for my proposing to
                                   leave London. The same night I wrote to inform Mrs. Van Brandt of
                                   the sad event which was the cause of my sudden departure, and to
                                   warn her that there no longer existed the slightest necessity for
                                   insuring her life. “My lawyers” (I wrote) “have undertaken to
                                   arrange Mr. Van Brandt’s affairs immediately. In a few hours he
                                   will be at liberty to accept the situation that has been offered
                                   to him.” The last lines of the letter assured her of my
                                   unalterable love, and entreated her to write to me before she
                                   left England.
This done, all was done. I was conscious, strange to say, of no
                                   acutely painful suffering at this saddest time of my life. There
                                   is a limit, morally as well as physically, to our capacity for
                                   endurance. I can only describe my sensations under the calamities
                                   that had now fallen on me in one way: I felt like a man whose
                                   mind had been stunned.
The next day my mother and I set forth on the first stage of our
                                   journey to the south coast of Devonshire.
