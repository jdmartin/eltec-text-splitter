CHAPTER XXXVII. THE TWO DESTINIES.
I MADE no movement to leave the room; I let no sign of sorrow
                                   escape me. At last, my heart was hardened against the woman who
                                   had so obstinately rejected me. I stood looking down at her with
                                   a merciless anger, the bare remembrance of which fills me at this
                                   day with a horror of myself. There is but one excuse for me. The
                                   shock of that last overthrow of the one hope that held me to life
                                   was more than my reason could endure. On that dreadful night
                                   (whatever I may have been at other times), I myself believe it, I
                                   was a maddened man.
I was the first to break the silence.
“Get up,” I said coldly.
She lifted her face from the floor, and looked at me as if she
                                   doubted whether she had heard aright.
“Put on your hat and cloak,” I resumed. “I must ask you to go back
                                   with me as far as the boat.”
She rose slowly. Her eyes rested on my face with a dull, bewildered
                                   look.
“Why am I to go with you to the boat?” she asked.
The child heard her. The child ran up to us with her little hat in
                                   one hand, and the key of the cabin in the other.
“I’m ready,” she said. “I will open the cabin door.”
Her mother signed to her to go back to the bed-chamber. She went
                                   back as far as the door which led into the courtyard, and waited
                                   there, listening. I turned to Mrs. Van Brandt with immovable
                                   composure, and answered the question which she had addressed to
                                   me.
“You are left,” I said, “without the means of getting away from
                                   this place. In two hours more the tide will be in my favor, and I
                                   shall sail at once on the return voyage. We part, this time,
                                   never to meet again. Before I go I am resolved to leave you
                                   properly provided for. My money is in my traveling-bag in the
                                   cabin. For that reason, I am obliged to ask you to go with me as
                                   far as the boat.”
“I thank you gratefully for your kindness,” she said. “I don’t
                                   stand in such serious need of help as you suppose.”
“It is useless to attempt to deceive me,” I proceeded. “I have
                                   spoken with the head partner of the house of Van Brandt at
                                   Amsterdam, and I know exactly what your position is. Your pride
                                   must bend low enough to take from my hands the means of
                                   subsistence for yourself and your child. If I had died in
                                   England—”
I stopped. The unexpressed idea in my mind was to tell her that she
                                   would inherit a legacy under my will, and that she might quite as
                                   becomingly take money from me in my life-time as take it from my
                                   executors after my death. In forming this thought into words, the
                                   associations which it called naturally into being revived in me
                                   the memory of my contemplated suicide in the Greenwater lake.
                                   Mingling with the remembrance thus aroused, there rose in me
                                   unbidden, a temptation so overpoweringly vile, and yet so
                                   irresistible in the state of my mind at the moment, that it shook
                                   me to the soul. “You have nothing to live for, now that she has
                                   refused to be yours,” the fiend in me whispered. “Take your leap
                                   into the next world, and make the woman whom you love take it
                                   with you!” While I was still looking at her, while my last words
                                   to her faltered on my lips, the horrible facilities for the
                                   perpetration of the double crime revealed themselves enticingly
                                   to my view. My boat was moored in the one part of the decaying
                                   harbor in which deep water still lay at the foot of the quay. I
                                   had only to induce her to follow me when I stepped on the deck,
                                   to seize her in my arms, and to jump overboard with her before
                                   she could utter a cry for help. My drowsy sailors, as I knew by
                                   experience, were hard to wake, and slow to move even when they
                                   were roused at last. We should both be drowned before the
                                   youngest and the quickest of them could get up from his bed and
                                   make his way to the deck. Yes! We should both be struck together
                                   out of the ranks of the living at one and the same moment. And
                                   why not? She who had again and again refused to be my wife—did
                                   she deserve that I should leave her free to go back, perhaps, for
                                   the second time to Van Brandt? On the evening when I had saved
                                   her from the waters of the Scotch river, I had made myself master
                                   of her fate. She had tried to destroy herself by drowning; she
                                   should drown now, in the arms of the man who had once thrown
                                   himself between her and death!
Self-abandoned to such atrocious reasoning as this, I stood face to
                                   face with her, and returned deliberately to my unfinished
                                   sentence.
“If I had died in England, you would have been provided for by my
                                   will. What you would have taken from me then, you may take from
                                   me now. Come to the boat.”
A change passed over her face as I spoke; a vague doubt of me began
                                   to show itself in her eyes. She drew back a little, without
                                   making any reply.
“Come to the boat,” I reiterated.
“It is too late.” With that answer, she looked across the room at
                                   the child, still waiting by the door. “Come, Elfie,” she said,
                                   calling the little creature by one of her favorite nicknames.
                                   “Come to bed.”
I too looked at Elfie. Might she not, I asked myself, be made the
                                   innocent means of forcing her mother to leave the house? Trusting
                                   to the child’s fearless character, and her eagerness to see the
                                   boat, I suddenly opened the door. As I had anticipated, she
                                   instantly ran out. The second door, leading into the square, I
                                   had not closed when I entered the courtyard. In another moment
                                   Elfie was out in the square, triumphing in her freedom. The
                                   shrill little voice broke the death-like stillness of the place
                                   and hour, calling to me again and again to take her to the
                                   boat.
I turned to Mrs. Van Brandt. The stratagem had succeeded. Elfie’s
                                   mother could hardly refuse to follow when Elfie led the way.
“Will you go with us?” I asked. “Or must I send the money back by
                                   the child?”
Her eyes rested on me for a moment with a deepening expression of
                                   distrust, then looked away again. She began to turn pale. “You
                                   are not like yourself to-night,” she said. Without a word more,
                                   she took her hat and cloak and went out before me into the
                                   square. I followed her, closing the doors behind me. She made an
                                   attempt to induce the child to approach her. “Come, darling,” she
                                   said, enticingly—“come and take my hand.”
But Elfie was not to be caught: she took to her heels, and answered
                                   from a safe distance. “No,” said the child; “you will take me
                                   back and put me to bed.” She retreated a little further, and held
                                   up the key: “I shall go first,” she cried, “and open the
                                   door.”
She trotted off a few steps in the direction of the harbor, and
                                   waited for what was to happen next. Her mother suddenly turned,
                                   and looked close at me under the light of the stars.
“Are the sailors on board the boat?” she asked.
The question startled me. Had she any suspicion of my purpose? Had
                                   my face warned her of lurking danger if she went to the boat? It
                                   was impossible. The more likely motive for her inquiry was to
                                   find a new excuse for not accompanying me to the harbor. If I
                                   told her that the men were on board, she might answer, “Why not
                                   employ one of your sailors to bring the money to me at the
                                   house?” I took care to anticipate the suggestion in making my
                                   reply.
“They may be honest men,” I said, watching her carefully; “but I
                                   don’t know them well enough to trust them with money.”
To my surprise, she watched me just as carefully on her side, and
                                   deliberately repeated her question:
“Are the sailors on board the boat?”
I informed her that the captain and crew slept in the boat, and
                                   paused to see what would follow. My reply seemed to rouse her
                                   resolution. After a moment’s consideration, she turned toward the
                                   place at which the child was waiting for us. “Let us go, as you
                                   insist on it,” she said, quietly. I made no further remark. Side
                                   by side, in silence we followed Elfie on our way to the boat.
Not a human creature passed us in the streets; not a light
                                   glimmered on us from the grim black houses. Twice the child
                                   stopped, and (still keeping slyly out of her mother’s reach) ran
                                   back to me, wondering at my silence. “Why don’t you speak?” she
                                   asked. “Have you and mamma quarreled?”
I was incapable of answering her—I could think of nothing but my
                                   contemplated crime. Neither fear nor remorse troubled me. Every
                                   better instinct, every nobler feeling that I had once possessed,
                                   seemed to be dead and gone. Not even a thought of the child’s
                                   future troubled my mind. I had no power of looking on further
                                   than the fatal leap from the boat: beyond that there was an utter
                                   blank. For the time being—I can only repeat it, my moral sense
                                   was obscured, my mental faculties were thrown completely off
                                   their balance. The animal part of me lived and moved as usual;
                                   the viler animal instincts in me plotted and planned, and that
                                   was all. Nobody, looking at me, would have seen anything but a
                                   dull quietude in my face, an immovable composure in my manner.
                                   And yet no madman was fitter for restraint, or less responsible
                                   morally for his own actions, than I was at that moment.
The night air blew more freshly on our faces. Still led by the
                                   child, we had passed through the last street—we were out on the
                                   empty open space which was the landward boundary of the harbor.
                                   In a minute more we stood on the quay, within a step of the
                                   gunwale of the boat. I noticed a change in the appearance of the
                                   harbor since I had seen it last. Some fishing-boats had come in
                                   during my absence. They moored, some immediately astern and some
                                   immediately ahead of my own vessel. I looked anxiously to see if
                                   any of the fishermen were on board and stirring. Not a living
                                   being appeared anywhere. The men were on shore with their wives
                                   and their families.
Elfie held out her arms to be lifted on board my boat. Mrs. Van
                                   Brandt stepped between us as I stooped to take her up.
“We will wait here,” she said, “while you go into the cabin and get
                                   the money.”
Those words placed it beyond all doubt that she had her suspicions
                                   of me—suspicions, probably, which led her to fear not for her
                                   life, but for her freedom. She might dread being kept a prisoner
                                   in the boat, and being carried away by me against her will. More
                                   than this she could not thus far possibly apprehend. The child
                                   saved me the trouble of making any remonstrance. She was
                                   determined to go with me. “I must see the cabin,” she cried,
                                   holding up the key. “I must open the door myself.”
She twisted herself out of her mother’s hands, and ran round to the
                                   other side of me. I lifted her over the gunwale of the boat in an
                                   instant. Before I could turn round, her mother had followed her,
                                   and was standing on the deck.
The cabin door, in the position which she now occupied, was on her
                                   left hand. The child was close behind her. I was on her right.
                                   Before us was the open deck, and the low gunwale of the boat
                                   overlooking the deep water. In a moment we might step across; in
                                   a moment we might take the fatal plunge. The bare thought of it
                                   brought the mad wickedness in me to its climax. I became suddenly
                                   incapable of restraining myself. I threw my arm round her waist
                                   with a loud laugh. “Come,” I said, trying to drag her across the
                                   deck—“come and look at the water.”
She released herself by a sudden effort of strength that astonished
                                   me. With a faint cry of horror, she turned to take the child by
                                   the hand and get back to the quay. I placed myself between her
                                   and the sides of the boat, and cut off her retreat in that way.
                                   Still laughing, I asked her what she was frightened about. She
                                   drew back, and snatched the key of the cabin door out of the
                                   child’s hand. The cabin was the one place of refuge now left, to
                                   which she could escape from the deck of the boat. In the terror
                                   of the moment, she never hesitated. She unlocked the door, and
                                   hurried down the two or three steps which led into the cabin,
                                   taking the child with her. I followed them, conscious that I had
                                   betrayed myself, yet still obstinately, stupidly, madly bent on
                                   carrying out my purpose. “I have only to behave quietly,” I
                                   thought to myself, “and I shall persuade her to go on deck
                                   again.”
My lamp was burning as I had left it; my traveling-bag was on the
                                   table. Still holding the child, she stood, pale as death, waiting
                                   for me. Elfie’s wondering eyes rested inquiringly on my face as I
                                   approached them. She looked half inclined to cry; the suddenness
                                   of the mother’s action had frightened the child. I did my best to
                                   compose Elfie before I spoke to her mother. I pointed out the
                                   different objects which were likely to interest her in the cabin.
                                   “Go and look at them,” I said, “go and amuse yourself.”
The child still hesitated. “Are you angry with me?” she asked.
“No, no!”
“Are you angry with mamma?”
“Certainly not.” I turned to Mrs. Van Brandt. “Tell Elfie if I am
                                   angry with you,” I said.
She was perfectly aware, in her critical position, of the necessity
                                   of humoring me. Between us, we succeeded in composing the child.
                                   She turned away to examine, in high delight, the new and strange
                                   objects which surrounded her. Meanwhile her mother and I stood
                                   together, looking at each other by the light of the lamp, with an
                                   assumed composure which hid our true faces like a mask. In that
                                   horrible situation, the grotesque and the terrible, always
                                   together in this strange life of ours, came together now. On
                                   either side of us, the one sound that broke the sinister and
                                   threatening silence was the lumpish snoring of the sleeping
                                   captain and crew.
She was the first to speak.
“If you wish to give me the money,” she said, trying to propitiate
                                   me in that way, “I am ready to take it now.”
I unlocked my traveling-bag. As I looked into it for the leather
                                   case which held my money, my overpowering desire to get her on
                                   deck again, my mad impatience to commit the fatal act, became too
                                   strong to be controlled.
“We shall be cooler on deck,” I said. “Let us take the bag up
                                   there.”
She showed wonderful courage. I could almost see the cry for help
                                   rising to her lips. She repressed it; she had still presence of
                                   mind enough to foresee what might happen before she could rouse
                                   the sleeping men.
“We have a light here to count the money by,” she answered. “I
                                   don’t feel at all too warm in the cabin. Let us stay here a
                                   little longer. See how Elfie is amusing herself!”
Her eyes rested on me as she spoke. Something in the expression of
                                   them quieted me for the time. I was able to pause and think. I
                                   might take her on deck by force before the men could interfere.
                                   But her cries would rouse them; they would hear the splash in the
                                   water, and they might be quick enough to rescue us. It would be
                                   wiser, perhaps, to wait a little and trust to my cunning to
                                   delude her into leaving the cabin of her own accord. I put the
                                   bag back on the table, and began to search for the leather
                                   money-case. My hands were strangely clumsy and helpless. I could
                                   only find the case after scattering half the contents of the bag
                                   on the table. The child was near me at the time, and noticed what
                                   I was doing.
“Oh, how awkward you are!” she burst out, in her frankly fearless
                                   way. “Let me put your bag tidy. Do, please!”
I granted the request impatiently. Elfie’s restless desire to be
                                   always doing something, instead of amusing me, as usual,
                                   irritated me now. The interest that I had once felt in the
                                   charming little creature was all gone. An innocent love was a
                                   feeling that was stifled in the poisoned atmosphere of my mind
                                   that night.
The money I had with me was mostly composed of notes of the Bank of
                                   England. Carefully keeping up appearances, I set aside the sum
                                   that would probably be required to take a traveler back to
                                   London; and I put all that remained into the hands of Mrs. Van
                                   Brandt. Could she suspect me of a design on her life now?
“That will do for the present,” I said. “I can communicate with you
                                   in the future through Messrs. Van Brandt, of Amsterdam.”
She took the money mechanically. Her hand trembled; her eyes met
                                   mine with a look of piteous entreaty. She tried to revive my old
                                   tenderness for her; she made a last appeal to my forbearance and
                                   consideration.
“We may part friends,” she said, in low, trembling tones. “And as
                                   friends we may meet again, when time has taught you to think
                                   forgivingly of what has passed between us, to-night.”
She offered me her hand. I looked at her without taking it. I
                                   penetrated her motive in appealing to my old regard for her.
                                   Still suspecting me, she had tried her last chance of getting
                                   safely on shore.
“The less we say of the past, the better,” I answered, with
                                   ironical politeness. “It is getting late. And you will agree with
                                   me that Elfie ought to be in her bed.” I looked round at the
                                   child. “Be quick, Elfie,” I said; “your mamma is going away.” I
                                   opened the cabin door, and offered my arm to Mrs. Van Brandt.
                                   “This boat is my house for the time being,” I resumed. “When
                                   ladies take leave of me after a visit, I escort them to the dock.
                                   Pray take my arm.”
She started back. For the second time she was on the point of
                                   crying for help, and for the second time she kept that last
                                   desperate alternative in reserve.
“I haven’t seen your cabin yet,” she said, her eyes wild with fear,
                                   a forced smile on her lips, as she spoke. “There are several
                                   little things here that interest me. Give me another minute or
                                   two to look at them.”
She turned away to get nearer to the child, under pretense of
                                   looking round the cabin. I stood on guard before the open door,
                                   watching her. She made a second pretense: she noisily overthrew a
                                   chair as if by accident, and then waited to discover whether her
                                   trick had succeeded in waking the men.
The heavy snoring went on; not a sound of a person moving was
                                   audible on either side of us.
“My men are heavy sleepers,” I said, smiling significantly. “Don’t
                                   be alarmed; you have not disturbed them. Nothing wakes these
                                   Dutch sailors when they are once safe in port.”
She made no reply. My patience was exhausted. I left the door and
                                   advanced toward her. She retreated in speechless terror, passing
                                   behind the table to the other end of the cabin. I followed her
                                   until she had reached the extremity of the room and could get no
                                   further. She met the look I fixed on her; she shrunk into a
                                   corner, and called for help. In the deadly terror that possessed
                                   her, she lost the use of her voice. A low moaning, hardly louder
                                   than a whisper, was all that passed her lips. Already, in
                                   imagination, I stood with her on the gunwale, already I felt the
                                   cold contact of the water—when I was startled by a cry behind me.
                                   I turned round. The cry had come from Elfie. She had apparently
                                   just discovered some new object in the bag, and she was holding
                                   it up in admiration, high above her head. “Mamma! mamma!” the
                                   child cried, excitedly, “look at this pretty thing! Oh, do, do
                                   ask him if I may have it!”
Her mother ran to her, eager to seize the poorest excuse for
                                   getting away from me. I followed; I stretched out my hands to
                                   seize her. She suddenly turned round on me, a woman transformed.
                                   A bright flush was on her face, an eager wonder sparkled in her
                                   eyes. Snatching Elfie’s coveted object out of the child’s hand,
                                   she held it up before me. I saw it under the lamp-light. It was
                                   my little forgotten keepsake—the Green Flag!
“How came you by this?” she asked, in breathless anticipation of my
                                   reply. Not the slightest trace was left in her face of the terror
                                   that had convulsed it barely a minute since! “How came you by
                                   this?” she repeated, seizing me by the arm and shaking me, in the
                                   ungovernable impatience that possessed her.
My head turned giddy, my heart beat furiously under the conflict of
                                   emotions that she had roused in me. My eyes were riveted on the
                                   green flag. The words that I wanted to speak were words that
                                   refused to come to me. I answered, mechanically: “I have had it
                                   since I was a boy.”
She dropped her hold on me, and lifted her hands with a gesture of
                                   ecstatic gratitude. A lovely, angelic brightness flowed like
                                   light from heaven over her face. For one moment she stood
                                   enraptured. The next she clasped me passionately to her bosom,
                                   and whispered in my ear: “I am Mary Dermody! I made it for
                                   You!”
The shock of discovery, following so closely on all that I had
                                   suffered before it, was too much for me. I sank, fainting, in her
                                   arms.
When I came to myself I was lying on my bed in the cabin. Elfie was
                                   playing with the green flag, and Mary was sitting by me with my
                                   hand in hers. One long look of love passed silently from her eyes
                                   to mine—from mine to hers. In that look the kindred spirits were
                                   united; The Two Destinies were fulfilled.
THE END OF THE STORY.
