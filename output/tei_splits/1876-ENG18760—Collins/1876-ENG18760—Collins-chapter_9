CHAPTER XI. THE LETTER OF INTRODUCTION.
I LOOKED at the house. It was an inn, of no great size, but of
                                   respectable appearance. If I was to be of any use to her that
                                   night, the time had come to speak of other subjects than the
                                   subject of dreams.
“After all that you have told me,” I said, “I will not ask you to
                                   admit me any further into your confidence until we meet again.
                                   Only let me hear how I can relieve your most pressing anxieties.
                                   What are your plans? Can I do anything to help them before you go
                                   to rest to-night?”
She thanked me warmly, and hesitated, looking up the street and
                                   down the street in evident embarrassment what to say next.
“Do you propose staying in Edinburgh?” I asked.
“Oh no! I don’t wish to remain in Scotland. I want to go much
                                   further away. I think I should do better in London; at some
                                   respectable milliner’s, if I could be properly recommended. I am
                                   quick at my needle, and I understand cutting out. Or I could keep
                                   accounts, if—if anybody would trust me.”
She stopped, and looked at me doubtingly, as if she felt far from
                                   sure, poor soul, of winning my confidence to begin with. I acted
                                   on that hint, with the headlong impetuosity of a man who was in
                                   love.
“I can give you exactly the recommendation you want,” I said,
                                   “whenever you like. Now, if you would prefer it.”
Her charming features brightened with pleasure. “Oh, you are indeed
                                   a friend to me!” she said, impulsively. Her face clouded
                                   again—she saw my proposal in a new light. “Have I any right,” she
                                   asked, sadly, “to accept what you offer me?”
“Let me give you the letter,” I answered, “and you can decide for
                                   yourself whether you will use it or not.”
I put her arm again in mine, and entered the inn.
She shrunk back in alarm. What would the landlady think if she saw
                                   her lodger enter the house at night in company with a stranger,
                                   and that stranger a gentleman? The landlady appeared as she made
                                   the objection. Reckless what I said or what I did, I introduced
                                   myself as her relative, and asked to be shown into a quiet room
                                   in which I could write a letter. After one sharp glance at me,
                                   the landlady appeared to be satisfied that she was dealing with a
                                   gentleman. She led the way into a sort of parlor behind the
                                   “bar,” placed writing materials on the table, looked at my
                                   companion as only one woman can look at another under certain
                                   circumstances, and left us by ourselves.
It was the first time I had ever been in a room with her alone. The
                                   embarrassing sense of her position had heightened her color and
                                   brightened her eyes. She stood, leaning one hand on the table,
                                   confused and irresolute, her firm and supple figure falling into
                                   an attitude of unsought grace which it was literally a luxury to
                                   look at. I said nothing; my eyes confessed my admiration; the
                                   writing materials lay untouched before me on the table. How long
                                   the silence might have lasted I cannot say. She abruptly broke
                                   it. Her instinct warned her that silence might have its dangers,
                                   in our position. She turned to me with an effort; she said,
                                   uneasily, “I don’t think you ought to write your letter to-night,
                                   sir.”
“Why not?”
“You know nothing of me. Surely you ought not to recommend a person
                                   who is a stranger to you? And I am worse than a stranger. I am a
                                   miserable wretch who has tried to commit a great sin—I have tried
                                   to destroy myself. Perhaps the misery I was in might be some
                                   excuse for me, if you knew it. You ought to know it. But it’s so
                                   late to-night, and I am so sadly tired—and there are some things,
                                   sir, which it is not easy for a woman to speak of in the presence
                                   of a man.”
Her head sunk on her bosom; her delicate lips trembled a little;
                                   she said no more. The way to reassure and console her lay plainly
                                   enough before me, if I chose to take it. Without stopping to
                                   think, I took it.
Reminding her that she had herself proposed writing to me when we
                                   met that evening, I suggested that she should wait to tell the
                                   sad story of her troubles until it was convenient to her to send
                                   me the narrative in the form of a letter. “In the mean time,” I
                                   added, “I have the most perfect confidence in you; and I beg as a
                                   favor that you will let me put it to the proof. I can introduce
                                   you to a dressmaker in London who is at the head of a large
                                   establishment, and I will do it before I leave you to-night.”
I dipped my pen in the ink as I said the words. Let me confess
                                   frankly the lengths to which my infatuation led me. The
                                   dressmaker to whom I had alluded had been my mother’s maid in f
                                   ormer years, and had been established in business with money lent
                                   by my late step-father, Mr. Germaine. I used both their names
                                   without scruple; and I wrote my recommendation in terms which the
                                   best of living women and the ablest of existing dressmakers could
                                   never have hoped to merit. Will anybody find excuses for me?
                                   Those rare persons who have been in love, and who have not
                                   completely forgotten it yet, may perhaps find excuses for me. It
                                   matters little; I don’t deserve them.
I handed her the open letter to read.
She blushed delightfully; she cast one tenderly grateful look at
                                   me, which I remembered but too well for many and many an
                                   after-day. The next moment, to my astonishment, this changeable
                                   creature changed again. Some forgotten consideration seemed to
                                   have occurred to her. She turned pale; the soft lines of pleasure
                                   in her face hardened, little by little; she regarded me with the
                                   saddest look of confusion and distress. Putting the letter down
                                   before me on the table, she said, timidly:
“Would you mind adding a postscript, sir?”
I suppressed all appearance of surprise as well as I could, and
                                   took up the pen again.
“Would you please say,” she went on, “that I am only to be taken on
                                   trial, at first? I am not to be engaged for more”—her voice sunk
                                   lower and lower, so that I could barely hear the next words—“for
                                   more than three months, certain.”
It was not in human nature—perhaps I ought to say it was not in the
                                   nature of a man who was in my situation—to refrain from showing
                                   some curiosity, on being asked to supplement a letter of
                                   recommendation by such a postscript as this.
“Have you some other employment in prospect?” I asked.
“None,” she answered, with her head down, and her eyes avoiding
                                   mine.
An unworthy doubt of her—the mean offspring of jealousy—found its
                                   way into my mind.
“Have you some absent friend,” I went on, “who is likely to prove a
                                   better friend than I am, if you only give him time?”
She lifted her noble head. Her grand, guileless gray eyes rested on
                                   me with a look of patient reproach.
“I have not got a friend in the world,” she said. “For God’s sake,
                                   ask me no more questions to-night!”
I rose and gave her the letter once more—with the postscript added,
                                   in her own words.
We stood together by the table; we looked at each other in a
                                   momentary silence.
“How can I thank you?” she murmured, softly. “Oh, sir, I will
                                   indeed be worthy of the confidence that you have shown in me!”
                                   Her eyes moistened; her variable color came and went; her dress
                                   heaved softly over the lovely outline of her bosom. I don’t
                                   believe the man lives who could have resisted her at that moment.
                                   I lost all power of restraint; I caught her in my arms; I
                                   whispered, “I love you!” I kissed her passionately. For a moment
                                   she lay helpless and trembling on my breast; for a moment her
                                   fragrant lips softly returned the kiss. In an instant more it was
                                   over. She tore herself away with a shudder that shook her from
                                   head to foot, and threw the letter that I had given to her
                                   indignantly at my feet.
“How dare you take advantage of me! How dare you touch me!” she
                                   said. “Take your letter back, sir; I refuse to receive it; I will
                                   never speak to you again. You don’t know what you have done. You
                                   don’t know how deeply you have wounded me. Oh!” she cried,
                                   throwing herself in despair on a sofa that stood near her, “shall
                                   I ever recover my self-respect? shall I ever forgive myself for
                                   what I have done to-night?”
I implored her pardon; I assured her of my repentance and regret in
                                   words which did really come from my heart. The violence of her
                                   agitation more than distressed me—I was really alarmed by it.
She composed herself after a while. She rose to her feet with
                                   modest dignity, and silently held out her hand in token that my
                                   repentance was accepted.
“You will give me time for atonement?” I pleaded. “You will not
                                   lose all confidence in me? Let me see you again, if it is only to
                                   show that I am not quite unworthy of your pardon—at your own
                                   time; in the presence of another person, if you like.”
“I will write to you,” she said.
“To-morrow?”
“To-morrow.”
I took up the letter of recommendation from the floor.
“Make your goodness to me complete,” I said. “Don’t mortify me by
                                   refusing to take my letter.”
“I will take your letter,” she answered, quietly. “Thank you for
                                   writing it. Leave me now, please. Good-night.”
I left her, pale and sad, with my letter in her hand. I left her,
                                   with my mind in a tumult of contending emotions, which gradually
                                   resolved themselves into two master-feelings as I walked on:
                                   Love, that adored her more fervently than ever; and Hope, that
                                   set the prospect before me of seeing her again on the next
                                   day.
