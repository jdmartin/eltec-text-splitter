BOOK III.
CHAPTER II.
 ‘AND now, Mr. Laurence,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘begin at the beginning, please,
                        and don’t do as Lord Kennington did at the Eton and Harrow match the other
                        day—go talking to me about “overs,” and “long-stops,” and things like that,
                        before I was even quite sure of the difference between “out ”and “in.”’ 
 ‘Of course,’ Laurence began, smiling with a little prefatory shyness, ‘we
                        can all understand the difference between a coarse common rustic palate,
                        like that of the burly farmer, for instance, who just enjoys food in a brute
                        way when he is hungry, and drink so long as it is spirituous at all times;
                        and the palate of the true epicure, that is sensitive to taste as the nicest
                        ear is to music, and can discriminate perfectly all the subtle semitones and
                        chords of flavour. Well, transfer this image from the mouth to the mind, and
                        there’s the whole thing in a nutshell. There is culture and no culture. A
                        person is really cultivated when he can taste not only the broad flavours of
                        life—gulping its joys and sorrows down, either with a vulgar grimace of
                        disgust, or an equally vulgar hearty voracity; but when with a delicate
                        self-possession he appreciates all the subtler taste of things, when he
                        discriminates between joy and joy, between sorrow and sorrow, between love
                        and love, between career and career; discerning in all incidents and
                        emotions their beauty, their pathos, their absurdity, or their tragedy, as
                        the case may be.’ 
 ‘You mean, then,’ said Miss Merton, ‘that a man of the highest culture is a
                        sort of emotional bon vivant?’ 
 ‘That surely is hardly a fair way—’ began Laurence. 
 ‘Excuse me, my dear Laurence,’ broke in Mr. Luke, in his most magnificent of
                        manners, ‘it is perfectly fair—it is admirably fair. Emotional bon
                            vivant!’ he exclaimed. ‘I thank Miss Merton for teaching me
                        that word! for it may remind us all,’ Mr. Luke continued, drawing out his
                        words slowly, as if he liked the taste of them, ‘how near our view of the
                        matter is to that of a certain Galilean peasant—of whom Miss Merton has
                        perhaps heard—who described the highest culture by just the same metaphor,
                        as a hunger and a thirst after righteousness. Our notion of it differs only
                        from his, from the Zeitgeist having made it somewhat
                        wider.’ 
 Miss Merton, in her inmost soul, did anything but return Mr. Luke’s
                        compliment, and consider his comment on her words as either admirably or
                        perfectly fair. However, she held her peace. The thoughts of Lady Ambrose
                        had been flowing in a slightly different direction. 
 ‘But what I want to ask,’ she said, ‘is this. I want to know why it is that
                        whenever one hears it said, “Oh, So-and-so is a very cultivated
                        person,” one always expects to find him—well, almost half professional as it
                        were, or at least able to talk of nothing but music, or painting, or books?
                        I mean, a man who’s merely a cultivated person doesn’t seem
                        ever to be quite a man of the world, or to be much good in society, except
                        when one wants him to talk on his own subjects—I hate people myself who
                            have subjects—and then, ten to one, he doesn’t know when to
                        leave off. Now, Mr. Laurence, I see you want to interrupt me; but do let me
                        say my say. A right amount of culture is of course delightful, and
                        personally, I don’t much care for people who haven’t got it. But too much of
                        it—I’m sure, Mr. Laurence, you must agree with me at heart—is a mistake. And
                        that, you know, is all I mean about it; nothing more than that.’ 
 ‘Ah,’ said Laurence, smiling, ‘I think I see what it is. You
                            will look on culture as some special kind of accomplishment
                        or taste like music; and you think that in some special way it is bound up
                        with books; and books you look upon as something special also, beginning and
                        ending with themselves; and, unless I am much mistaken, you think that the
                        more books a man has read, the more cultivated you may safely call him.’ 
 ‘Not all books,’ said Lady Ambrose in an injured tone. ‘Of course I don’t
                        mean trashy novels, and of course I don’t mean blue-books, or books of
                        history.’ 
 ‘But what I want first of all to impress on you,’ said Laurence, ‘is that
                        whatever its relation to books may be, culture is by no means a bookish
                        thing, or a thing that ought to be less in place at Hurlingham than at the
                        South Kensington Museum. Nor is it in any sense a hobby, or a special taste,
                        to be gratified at the expense of anything else. Instead of that, it is the
                        education of all our tastes, of all our powers of enjoying life; and, so far
                        from its being a thing for recluses, and a substitute for society, it is
                        only when naturalised in the best society that it can at all do itself
                        justice in expressing itself outwardly, or even exist in any completeness
                        inwardly.’ 
 Lady Ambrose smiled, and looked more interested, and began to give Laurence
                        her most intelligent attention. 
 ‘Still,’ Laurence went on, ‘culture and books have a good deal to do with
                        one another; and since they are so bound up together in your mind, let us
                        try to see at once what the relation really is. Let us begin, then, with
                        that part of culture which in this sense is most bound up with books—most
                        bound up because it cannot be got without them; the part of culture, I mean,
                        that comes from the knowledge of the past—from a knowledge of history, in
                        short, or parts of history.’ 
 Lady Ambrose here took Laurence fairly aback by the way in which she
                        repeated the word ‘History!’ 
 ‘Well, judging from the results I have seen,’ she said, with an amount of
                        decision in her voice that was positively startling, ‘I cannot say, Mr.
                        Laurence, that I agree with you. And I think that on this subject I have a
                        right to speak.’ 
 ‘What on earth can the woman be meaning?’ said Mr. Luke to
                        himself. 
 ‘It is not a fortnight ago,’ Lady Ambrose went on, ‘that I sat at dinner by
                        somebody—I won’t tell you his name—who had not only read heaven knows how
                        much history, but had written, I believe, even more than he had read. And
                        what do you think this good man did during all the early part of dinner?
                        Why, he did nothing but fume, and fret, and bluster, so that everyone was
                        made uncomfortable, simply because somebody said that King Harold was not
                        quite so excellent a character as the late Prince Consort; and I heard him
                        muttering, “What monstrous injustice! What monstrous ignorance!” to himself
                        for nearly half an hour. I don’t think I ever saw such a—I was going to
                        say,’ said Lady Ambrose, laughing softly, ‘such a beast —but I won’t; I’ll
                        say a bear instead. At last, however—I don’t know how it came about—he said
                        to me, in a very solemn voice, “What a terrible defeat that was which we had
                        at Bouvines!” I answered timidly—not thinking we were at war with
                        anyone—that I had seen nothing about it in the papers. “H’m!” he said,
                        giving a sort of a grunt that made me feel dreadfully ignorant, “why, I had
                        an Excursus on it myself in the ‘Archæological Gazette,’ only last week.”
                        And, do you know, it turned out that the Battle of Bouvines was fought in
                        the thirteenth century, and had, as far as I could make out, something to do
                        with Magna Charta. Now, Mr. Laurence, if that’s the sort of culture one gets
                        from studying history, I’m glad I’ve forgotten even the names of the twelve
                        Cæsars, and the date of the kings of England. Besides,’ Lady Ambrose added,
                        ‘it makes one think what a serious thing it is to lose a battle, if people
                        are to be made so cross about it six hundred years afterwards.’ 
 ‘I quite agree with you,’ said Laurence, ‘that if that’s the sort of culture
                        one gets from history, we had better never open a history book again. But
                        history, Lady Ambrose, has very little to do with the Battle of Bouvines,
                        and nothing with the character of Harold.’ 
 ‘Then what has it got to do with?’ asked Lady Ambrose incredulously. ‘It
                        certainly has to do with kings, and wars, and facts, and dates, hasn’t it?’ 
 ‘What people call facts,’ said Laurence, ‘are only the dry bones of history.
                        It is quite true that most professed historians have hitherto, instead of
                        painting the face of the past, simply made discrepant notes about the shape
                        of its skull: everything that could give the shape of the skull the least
                        significance they left unthought of, or dismissed it in an occasional
                        chapter. But really the least important of all the world’s events are those
                        that you can localise exactly, and put an exact date to; those which alone
                        most historians see.’ 
 ‘But,’ interposed Miss Merton, ‘don’t you call such things as the events in
                        Caesar’s life, for instance, or Hildebrand’s, history?’ 
 ‘Looked on simply as events,’ said Laurence, ‘I call them biography, or I
                        call them illustrations of history; but I do not call them
                        history. History, in its true sense, is a travelling in the past; the best
                        of histories would be but the carriage or the steamboat you travelled by;
                        your histories of dates and battles are at best but the Bradshaws and the
                        railway-maps. Our past must be an extension of the present, or it is no real
                        past. Now I expect, Lady Ambrose, that, in its true sense, you know a good
                        deal more history than you are aware of. I saw you reading Saint-Simon
                        yesterday evening, and you alluded to Grammont’s Memoirs at dinner.’ 
 ‘Oh, of course,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘books like that! But, then, they really
                        give you such a notion of the times, and quite take you back to them.’ 
 ‘Nothing is history that does not,’ said Laurence. 
 ‘Really,’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, brightening. ‘“II y a plus de vingt ans
                        que je dis de la prose, sans que j’en susse rien.” And so it seems that I
                        have known history without suspecting it, just as M. Jourdain talked prose.’ 
 ‘Pardon me,’ cried Mr. Saunders, ‘if I interrupt you for a moment; but, Mr.
                        Laurence, though I admit that there is a great deal of truth in what you
                        say, you have not even alluded to the great function of history, nor have
                        you even hinted at the great use of facts. However, perhaps I had better
                        reserve what I have to say on this, as well as on certain other matters,
                        till by-and-by.’ 
 ‘Very well,’ said Laurence, ‘if history, then, is a travelling in the
                        past—what else it is, as Mr. Saunders says, we can talk of afterwards—don’t
                        you see what it does for us, Lady Ambrose, in the way of culture—does for
                        us, not as students, but as men and women of the world? Just think for a
                        moment what our own age would seem to us if all the past, beyond the
                        memories of our grandfathers, was a blank to us; and then think how
                        infinitely our minds are enlarged, how a freer air, as it were, seems to
                        blow through them, even from that vague knowledge of the past afloat in the
                        world, which we pick up here and there as we go along. Even that has an
                        effect upon us. It prevents us being, as we else should be, merely
                            temporal people who are just as narrow-minded and dull as
                        those merely local people—the natives of a neighbourhood—who
                        wear gorgeous ribands at flower-shows in the country. Don’t you remember
                        last year, when I was staying with you, how you pointed some of them out to
                        me, and how amused you were at their ways and their finery?’ 
 Lady Ambrose smiled and nodded. 
 ‘Go on, Mr. Laurence—I can understand all this,’ she said. ‘But I want to
                        hear a little more.’ 
 ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘your own knowledge of the history of France and
                        England during the last two hundred years—you know well enough how that has
                        made you, in a certain sense, more a woman of the world. What would you be,
                        for instance, if you never knew that there had been a French Revolution, or
                        an English Revolution—a Cromwell, or a Louis Quatorze, or a Mirabeau? But
                        your knowledge of history does not end here. You know something, at any
                        rate, of the feudal times. You know what a castle was like, what a knight
                        was like, what a monk was like. You know something, too, Of Roman and Greek
                        history; and, come—to go no farther—you know the Bible.’ 
 ‘I hope,’ said Lady Ambrose, in a voice of reproving solemnity, ‘that one
                        would not call that history.’ 
 ‘Certainly not,’ said Mr. Saunders, with a small suppressed chuckle. 
 ‘At all events,’ proceeded Laurence, ignoring these interruptions, ‘you know
                        something of Rome, and Greece, and Palestine, and Egypt; and each of these
                        names is really a little aërial chariot which carries your imagination back
                        as you pronounce it into some remote age, when life was different from what
                        it is now. So is the mind widened by even a little vague history. Or, just
                        repeat to yourself such words as France and Italy,
                        and think for a moment of the effect of them. They are not mere names—mere
                        geographical expressions; but they are spells which evoke, whether you will
                        or no, hosts of subtle associations, rising up like spirits out of the past
                        centuries, and hovering in the air round you with their unbidden influence,
                        and mixing with all your notions of Europe as it is now. Or, would you feel
                        the matter more strongly yet, think, when you are travelling, what but for
                        history would Venice be, or Athens, or Jerusalem? If it were not for
                        history, be it never so vaguely understood, would you find the same
                        indescribable fascination in Rome?’ 
 ‘I never was at Rome,’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘We’re going there next winter
                        with the Kenningtons.’ 
 This piece of intelligence brought Laurence to a stop. Mr. Rose, however,
                        whose imagination had been fired by all this talk about history, suddenly
                        broke forth. 
 ‘And also,’ he exclaimed, ‘is it not by history alone that we can in our day
                        learn anything of the more subtle and gorgeous dyes that life is capable of
                        taking—how fair a thing it may be, how rich in harmonious freedom, and
                        beauty of form, and love, and passionate friendship? Why, but for history,
                        what should we be now but a flock of listless barbarians, ὀνειράτων ἀλίγκιοι
                        μορφαισι φύρόντες εἰκη πάντα ? Would not all life’s choicer and subtler
                        pleasures be lost to us, if Athens did not still live to redeem us from the
                        bondage of the middle age, and if the Italian Renaissance—that strange child
                        of Aphrodite and Tannhaüser, did not still live to stimulate us out of the
                        torpor of the present age? What, but for history, should we know,’ cried Mr.
                        Rose, ‘of the χάρις of Greece, of the lust of Rome, of the strange secrets
                        of the Borgias? Consider, too, the bowers of quiet, full of sweet dreams,
                        that history will always keep for us—how it surrounds the house of the
                        present with the boundless gardens of the past—gardens rich in woods, and
                        waters, and flowers, and outlooks on illimitable seas. Think of the immortal
                        dramas which history sets before us; of the keener and profounder passions
                        which it shows in action, of the exquisite groups and figures it reveals to
                        us, of nobler mould than ours—Harmodius and Aristogeiton, Achilles and
                        Patroclus, David and Jonathan, our English Edward and the fair Piers
                        Gaveston, ἅμα τ’ ὠκύμορος καὶ ὀϊζυρὸς περὶ πάντων, or, above all, those two
                        by the agnus castus and the plane-tree where Ilyssus flowed,’—Mr. Rose’s
                        voice gradually subsided,—‘and where the Attic grasshoppers chirped in
                        shrill summer choir.’ 
 ‘At any rate, Lady Ambrose,’ Laurence resumed briskly, ‘you now see
                        something of the way in which history gives us culture; and you see,
                        too,—this is the chief point I want to impress upon you,—that in history,
                        and many other things as well, books are only the telescopes through which
                        we see distant facts; and we no more become bookish by such a
                        use of books than you became optical when you looked through
                        your telescope in Gloucestershire, and saw Captain Audley, at the bottom of
                        the park, proposing to your under-keeper’s daughter.’ 
 ‘I really do believe,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘that that man is a little off his
                        head. However,’ she went on laughing, ‘I give up about the bookishness, Mr.
                        Laurence, and I dare say one really is the better for knowing something
                        about history; but still, I can’t help thinking that the chief thing to know
                        about is, after all, the life about one, and that knowledge, just like
                        charity, should begin at home.’ 
 ‘There,’ said Laurence, ‘we quite agree; and that, if I managed to express
                        myself clearly, was the very thing that I set out with saying. It
                            is with the life about us that all our concern lies; and
                        culture’s double end is simply this—to make us appreciate that life, and to
                        make that life worth appreciating. We only study the past to adorn our
                        present, or to make our view of it clearer. And now, since we have at any
                        rate suggested how this is done, let us put the past, and the distant
                        too—everything, in fact, to which books are only the telescopes—out of our
                        minds altogether, and merely consider the real heart of the matter—culture
                        and the present. I tried to explain just now that we meant by a man of
                        culture one on whom none of the finer flavours of life are lost—who can
                        appreciate, sympathise with, criticise, all the scenes, situations, sayings,
                        or actions around him—a sad or happy love-affair, a charm of manner and
                        conversation, a beautiful sunset, or a social absurdity. I declare,’ said
                        Laurence, ‘I could tell better whether a man was really cultivated, from the
                        way in which he talked gossip, or told a story; than from the way in which
                        he discussed a poem or a picture.’ 
 ‘Certainly,’ said Leslie. ‘I don’t call a woman cultivated who bothers me at
                        dinner first with discussing this book and then that—whose one perpetual
                        question is, “Have you read So-and-so?” But I call a woman cultivated who
                        responds and who knows what I mean as we pass naturally from subject to
                        subject—who by a flash or a softness in her eyes, by a slight gesture of the
                        hand, by a sigh, by a flush in the cheek, makes me feel as I talk of some
                        lovely scene that she too could love it—as I speak of love or sorrow, makes
                        me feel that she herself has known them; as I speak of ambition, or
                            ennui or hope, or remorse, or loss of character,
                        makes me feel that all these are not mere names to her, but things.’ 
 ‘Do you call me cultivated, Mr. Leslie?’ whispered Mrs.
                        Sinclair, in a soft parenthesis. 
 ‘I mean,’ said Leslie, finishing, ‘I like to hear each key I touch make, not
                        a dead thud as on a piece of wood, but strike a musical string.’ 
 ‘Good,’ murmured Mr. Rose; ‘that is good! Yes,’ he continued, ‘the aim of
                        culture, if Mr. Leslie will lend me his nice metaphor, is indeed to make the
                        soul a musical instrument, which may yield music either to itself or to
                        others, at any appulse from without; and the more elaborate a man’s culture
                        is, the richer and more composite can this music be. The minds of some men
                        are like a simple pastoral reed. Only single melodies, and these
                        unaccompanied, can be played upon them—glad or sad; whilst the minds of
                        others, who look at things from countless points of view, and realise, as
                        Shakespeare did, their composite nature—their minds become, as Shakespeare’s
                        was, like a great orchestra. Or sometimes,’ said Mr. Rose dreamily, as if
                        his talk was lapsing into a soliloquy—‘when he is a mere passive observer of
                        things, letting impressions from without move him as they will, I would
                        compare the man of culture to an Æolian harp, which the winds at will play
                        through—a beautiful face, a rainbow, a ruined temple, a death-bed, or a line
                        of poetry, wandering in like a breath of air amongst the chords of his soul,
                        touching note after note into soft music, and at last gently dying away into
                        silence.’ 
 ‘Well, now,’ said Laurence, in a very matter-of-fact tone, for he saw that
                        Mr. Rose’s dreamy manner always tended to confuse Lady Ambrose, ‘since we
                        are now clear that the aim of culture is to make us better company as men
                        and women of the world, let us consider a little farther how culture is
                        attained. We have just spoken of histories and other books, which merely
                        bring us face to face with facts that would else be out of our reach. We now
                        come to two other things—the facts of the life about us, the facts which
                        experience teaches us, and to which all other facts are secondary; and,
                        farther, to the way in which all this knowledge—the knowledge of the living
                        present especially—is (for we have really not talked of this at all yet)
                        turned into culture. Mere acquaintance with facts will not do it; mere
                        experience of facts will not do it. A woman, for instance may have had all
                        kinds of experience—society, sorrow, love, travel, remorse, distraction—and
                        yet she may not be cultivated. She may have gone through everything only
                        half consciously. She may never have recognised what her life has been. What
                        is needed to teach her—to turn this raw material into culture? Here, Lady
                        Ambrose, we come to our friends the books again—not, however to such books
                        as histories, but to books of art, to poetry, and books akin to poetry. The
                        former do but enlarge our own common experience. The latter are an
                        experience in themselves, and an experience that interprets all former
                        experiences. The mind, if I may borrow an illustration from photography, is
                        a sensitised plate, always ready to receive the images made by experience on
                        it. Poetry is the developing solution, which first makes these images
                        visible. Or, to put it in another way, if some books are the telescopes with
                        which we look at distant facts, poetry—I use the word in its widest sense—is
                        a magic mirror which shows us the facts about us reflected in it as no
                        telescope or microscope could show them to us. Let a person of experience
                        look into this, and experience then becomes culture. For in that magic
                        mirror we see our life surrounded with issues viewless to the common eye. We
                        see it compassed about with chariots of fire and with horses of fire. Then
                        we know the real aspect of our joys and sorrows. We see the lineaments, we
                        look into the eyes of thoughts, and desires, and associations, which had
                        been before unseen and scarcely suspected presences—dim swarms clustering
                        around our every action. Then how all kinds of objects and of feelings begin
                        to cling together in our minds! A single sense or a single memory is
                        touched, and a thrill runs through countless others. The smell of autumn
                        woods, the colour of dying fern, may turn by a subtle transubstantiation
                        into pleasures and faces that will never come again—a red sunset and a windy
                        sea-shore into a last farewell, and the regret of a lifetime.’ 
 Laurence had chosen these illustrations of his quite at random; but he was
                        fortunate in the last in a way which he never dreamt of. Lady Ambrose, in
                        her early and unwise days, had actually had a love-affair. She had been
                        engaged to a handsome young Guardsman, with only eleven hundred a year, and
                        no prospects but debts; and though she had successfully exchanged him for
                        Sir George and his million of money, she still sometimes recalled him, and
                        the wild September evening when she had seen her last of him upon Worthing
                        pier. 
 ‘Ah,’ she exclaimed, with some emotion in her voice, ‘I know exactly what
                        you mean now. Why, there have been poems at one time or another of one’s
                        life, that one could really hardly bear to hear repeated. Now, there’s that
                        of Byron’s, “When we two parted.” I don’t even know if it is right to think
                        it a good poem—but still, do you know, there was a time when, just because
                        it was connected with something—it almost made me cry if anyone repeated or
                        sang it—one of my brothers, I know, who had a beautiful voice, was always—’
                        Lady Ambrose here grew conscious that she was showing more feeling than she
                        thought at all becoming. She blushed, she stammered a little, and then,
                        making a rush at another topic, ‘But what is Mr. Rose,’ she exclaimed,
                        ‘saying about the Clock-tower and the Thames Embankment?’ 
 ‘I was merely thinking,’ said Mr. Rose, who had been murmuring to himself at
                        intervals for some time, ‘of a delicious walk I took last week, by the river
                        side, between Charing Cross and Westminster. The great clock struck the
                        chimes of midnight; a cool wind blew; and there went streaming on the wide
                        wild waters with long vistas of reflected lights wavering and quivering in
                        them; and I roamed about for hours, hoping I might see some unfortunate cast
                        herself from the Bridge of Sighs. It was a night I thought well in harmony
                        with despair. Fancy,’ exclaimed Mr. Rose, ‘the infinity of emotions which
                        the sad sudden splash in the dark river would awaken in one’s mind—and all
                        due to that one poem of Hood’s!’ 
 ‘Yes,’ said Laurence, not having listened to Mr. Rose, who spoke, indeed,
                        somewhat low, ‘Yes,’ he said, continuing the same train of thought he had
                        left off with, and looking first at Lady Ambrose and then at Miss Merton,
                        ‘is it not poetry that does all this for the world? I use poetry in its
                        widest sense, and include in it all imaginative literature, and other art as
                        well. Is it not the poet that gives our existence all its deepest colours,
                        or enables us to give them to it ourselves? Is it not—if I may quote a
                        translation of Goethe that I made myself— 
Is’t not the harmony that from his bosom springs, And back
                                into itself the whole world brings? When Nature round her
                                spindle, cold and strong, Winds on and on the endless threads
                                of things; When all existences, a timeless throng,
                                Make discord as with jangling strings, Whose life-breath bids
                                the flux of blind creation Move to a rhythmic music of his
                                own? Who calls each single thing to the common
                                consecration, When rapturously it trembles into tone?
                                Who sets our wild moods and the storms in time? Our sad
                                moods, and the still eve’s crimson glow? Who showers down all
                                the loveliest flowers of June, Where she, the heart’s
                                beloved, will go? Who, of a few green leaves in silly
                                twine, Makes toil’s immortal guerdon, art’s reward,
                                Raises the mortal, draws down the divine?
 And so,’ Laurence went on, ‘if it is to the bard that we owe all
                        these fine things, we need surely not fear that we shall be thought bookish
                        if we say that a society cannot be really good that does not as a body draw
                        a large amount of its nourishment from the bard’s work. Of course in one
                        sense poetry exists unwritten; but in the general run of people this will
                        never properly awake itself, make itself available, but at the spell of
                        written poetry. Nay, this is true even of the poet himself. Why else does he
                        externalise his feelings—give them a body? As I say, however, the general
                        catholic use of poetry is not to make us admire the poetry of poems but
                        discern the poetry of life. I myself,’ Laurence went on, ‘am devoted to
                        literature as literature, to poetry as poetry. I value it not only because
                        it makes me appreciate the originals of the things it deals with, but for
                        itself. I often like the description of a sunset better than I like a
                        sunset; I don’t care two straws about Liberty, but my mind is often set all
                        aglow by a good ode to her. I delight in, I can talk over, I can brood over,
                        the form of a stanza, the music of a line, the turn of a phrase, the flavour
                        of an epithet. Few things give me such pleasure for the moment as an apt
                        quotation from Horace or Shakespeare. But this, I admit, is a hobby—a
                        private hobby—this distinct literary taste, just as a taste for blue china
                        is, and must certainly not be confused with culture in its deeper and wider
                        sense.’ 
 ‘Ah,’ said Mr. Rose earnestly, ‘don’t despise this merely literary culture,
                        as you call it, or the pleasure it is to have at command a beautiful
                        quotation. As I have been lying on the bank here, this afternoon, and
                        looking up into the trees, and watching the blue sky, glancing between the
                        leaves of them—as I have been listening to the hum of the insects, or
                        looking out with half-shut eyes towards the sea across the green rustling
                        shrubs, and the red rose-blossoms, fragments of poetry have been murmuring
                        in my memory like a swarm of bees, and have been carrying my fancy hither
                        and thither in all manner of swift luxurious ways. The “spreading favour,”
                        for instance, of these trees that we sit under, brought just now into my
                        mind those magical words of Virgil’s—     O qui me gelidis in
                                vallibus Haemi What a picture there! What a thrill it
                        sent all through me, like a rush of enchanted wind! In another moment the
                        verse that goes just before, also came to me—        Virginibus
                                bacchata Lacaenis and into the delicious scene now
                        around me —this beautiful modern garden—mixed instantly visions of Greek
                        mountains, and ragged summits, and choirs of Laconian maidens maddened with
                        a divine enthusiasm, and with fair white vesture wildly floating. Again,
                        another line from the same poem, from the same passage, touched my memory,
                        and changed, in a moment, the whole complexion of my feelings—  Felix
                            qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.  Think of that! The spirit
                        is whirled away in a moment of time, and set amongst quite new images, quite
                        other sources of excitement. But again, in an instant, the splash of the
                        fountain caught my ear, and awoke, I scarcely know how, the memory of some
                        lines in one of Petrarch’s Epistles—    Soporifero clausam qui
                                murmure vallem and my imagination, on the wings of the
                        verses, was borne away floating towards Vaucluse. Think, then, within the
                        space of five minutes how many thoughts and sensations, composite and
                        crowded, can, by the agency of mere literature, enrich the mind, and make
                        life intenser.’ 
 ‘And I—’ said Laurence, smiling,—‘do you see that far-away sail out—on the
                        horizon line?—well, I caught myself murmuring over a scrap of Milton, only
                        two minutes ago—  As when afar at sea a fleet descried
                                Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial gales Why, I could
                        go on capping verses with you the whole afternoon, if we had nothing else to
                        do. But besides this, a knowledge of books as books has got another use. How
                        it enriches conversation, by enabling us to talk by hints and allusions, and
                        to convey so many more meanings than our actual words express. I came across
                        an exquisite instance of this the other day, in a book of anecdotes about
                        the poet Rogers, which shows how a familiarity with the scenes even of Greek
                        poetry may give a brilliance to fashionable talk in the nineteenth century.
                        One evening at Miss Lydia White’s—she was a Tory, and well known then in
                        society—a guest who was a Whig, said à propos of the
                        depressed state of his own party at the time, “There is nothing left for us
                        but to sacrifice a Tory virgin.” “Yes,” said Miss Lydia White, “I believe
                        there’s nothing the Whigs wouldn’t do to raise the wind.” But yet, after
                        all, this is not the important thing, and I hope Lady Ambrose
                        will forgive us for having talked so long about it.’ 
 ‘And so one must read a great deal, after all, to be really
                        cultivated,’ said Lady Ambrose, in a disappointed tone. ‘You’ve made culture
                        seem so nice, that I feel positively quite ashamed to think how seldom now I
                        look at a line of poetry, except, of course, when anything new comes out,
                        that everybody must read.’ 
 ‘I don’t think you need be afraid on that score,’ said Leslie. ‘If society
                        is to be cultivated, it must, no doubt, read a good deal, as a body. But all
                        its members need not. With women especially, nothing startles me more than
                        when I find sometimes how very far, if they have had any serious experience
                        of the world and life, a very little poetry will go.’ 
 ‘I expect,’ said Miss Merton, ‘that we are naturally more introspective than
                        men, and so, in what concerns ourselves, a very little will make us
                        cultivated; although we don’t certainly get so easily as men that
                        indifferent way of looking on life as a whole, which I suppose is what you
                        call the dramatic spirit, and which people praise so in Shakespeare. But as
                        to what Mr. Leslie says, I have so often myself noticed the same thing in
                        girls—especially at times when they are passing into womanhood, without
                        having made much of a success of youth. I remember one poor friend of mine,
                        whose whole life seemed to become clear to her through just one line of
                        Tennyson’s—  My life has crept so long on a broken wing.  I
                        suppose it was a sort of magic mirror to her as Mr. Laurence was saying just
                        now.’ 
 ‘I,’ said Leslie, ‘once knew some one at Baden, who spent half her time at
                        the tables, as much the observed of all observers as Worth and her own
                        strange beauty could make her—she liked being stared at—and who was
                        certainly not a woman who gave much of her time to reading. She was very
                        wretched with her husband, and her name was far from being above the reach
                        of gossip. Talking one day to her in a hardish flippant sort of way—a tone
                        of talk which she affected to like—I alluded by some chance to Francesca di
                        Rimini in Dante; and I shall never forget the tone in which she exclaimed,
                        “Poor Francesca!”—its passion and its pathos. I was surprised that she had
                        even looked into Dante: but she had; and that one passage had lit up her
                        whole life for her—that one picture of the two lovers “going for ever on the
                        accursed air.”’ 
 ‘How nice of you, Mr. Leslie,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, ‘to remember my poor
                        verses!’ 
 ‘Let us consider, too,’ said Laurence, ‘that poetry does not only enable us
                        to appreciate what we have already experienced, but it puts us in the way of
                        getting new experiences. This was Wordsworth’s special claim for poetry,
                        that it widened our sympathies—widened them in some new direction—that it
                        was ever giving us, in fact, not new quotations, but new culture.’ 
 ‘Ah, here,’ said Leslie, ‘is a thing that continually occurs to me. Just
                        consider for moment the wonderful social effect of even so partial a thing
                        as the culture that Wordsworth himself gave us. Consider the effect of it on
                        a common worldly woman—let her be girl or matron—who without it would be
                        nothing but a half mechanical creature, living, as far as her interests
                        went, a wretched hand-to-mouth existence of thin distraction, or eager
                        anxious scheming for herself or her daughters. Cultivate her, I say, just in
                        this one direction—give her but this one fragment of culture, a love of
                        Nature—and all the mean landscape of her mind will be lit up with a sudden
                        beauty, as the beam of ideal sunshine breaks across it, with its “light that
                        never was on sea or land.” I don’t say that such a woman will become better
                        for this, but she will become more interesting. In a girl, however pretty,
                        what is there to interest a man if he reads nothing in her face from night
                        to night but that she is getting daily more worn and jaded in the search for
                        a rich husband? Or even, to go a step higher, in the unthinking,
                        uncultivated flirt, so common in every class of society—what is there in her
                        that a man will not soon discover to be insipid and wearying? ’ 
 ‘Surely,’ remonstrated Mrs. Sinclair plaintively, ‘that rather depends on
                        what she is like. I must stand up for my sex.’ 
 ‘But give her,’ Leslie went on, ‘one genuine, one disinterested taste, and
                        all is changed. If I had an audience about me of young ladies, whom it was
                        not too late to advise—girls entering on the world, determined to run the
                        worldly course, and to satisfy all the expectations of the most excellent
                        and lowest-minded of chaperons, I would say this to them:—I have no doubt
                        you are all ignorant; of course you are all vain. That to make a brilliant
                        match is your great object, you all avow. A certain sort of flirting, of
                        which the less said the better, is your most disinterested taste. I know all
                        this (I should say), and I can’t help it; nor do I ask you to alter one of
                        these points for the better. But this I do ask you to do. Try to add
                        something else to them. Try to win for yourselves one taste of a truer and
                        deeper sort. Study Wordsworth, and some parts of Shelley; open out your
                        sympathies, by their aid, in just one direction. Learn to love the sea, and
                        the woods, and the wild flowers, with all their infinite changes of scent,
                        and colour, and sound—the purple moor, the brown mountain stream, the
                        rolling mists, the wild smell of the heather. Let these things grow to
                        “haunt you like a passion,” learn in this way the art of 
                                           desiring You’ll perhaps find it a little dull
                        at first; but go on, and don’t be disheartened; and
                        then—by-and-by—by-and-by, go and look in the looking-glass, and study your
                        own face. Hasn’t some new look, child, come into your eyes, and given them
                        an expression—a something that they wanted before? Smile. Hasn’t your smile
                        some strange meaning in it that it never used to have? You are a little more
                        melancholy, perhaps. But no matter. The melancholy is worth its cost. You
                        are now a mystery. Men can’t see through you at a glance as they did; and
                        so, as Sterne says, “you have their curiosity on your side,” and that
                        alone—even that will have increased your value tenfold in our Babylonian
                        marriage-market.’ 
 ‘Well, Mr. Leslie,’ said Lady Ambrose with severe gravity, ‘if that’s the
                        way you’d talk to young ladies, I should be very careful you never spoke to
                        any that I had anything to do with.’ 
 ‘Many people, I know,’ Leslie went on, passing by the rebuke, ‘think that
                        books and culture are a kind of substitute for life, and that the real
                        masters in the art of living have no need for this poor
                            pis-aller. They only drive four-in-hand, or shoot, or
                        dance, or run away with their friends’ wives. But no mistake can be greater.
                        Culture is not a substitute for life, but the key to it. It is really to the
                        men of culture, to the men who have read and who have thought, that all
                        exercise, all distractions, mental or bodily, moral or immoral, yield their
                        finer keener pleasures. They are the men that husbands dread for their
                        wives, and that fascinating people find fascinating.’ 
 Lady Ambrose much disapproved of the tone of this speech; but none the less,
                        in a certain mysterious way, did it insidiously increase her appreciation of
                        the value of culture; and she felt that with Laurence at any rate she most
                        thoroughly agreed, when he said by way of summing up, 
 ‘And so now I think we see what culture is, and the reason why it is
                        essential to good society. We see that much as it depends on books, life is
                        really the great thing it has to do with. It is the passions, the interests,
                        the relations, the absurdities of life that it fits us to see into, to
                        taste, to discriminate. And I think we see, too, that not only is culture
                        essential to good society, but good society also is essential to culture,
                        and that there was therefore very good reason for the exclusiveness we began
                        with. For in the first place I expect it requires certain natural advantages
                        of position to look at and overlook life in that sympathetic and yet
                        self-possessed way, which alone can give us a complete view of it. And in
                        the next place, the more we discern in life, the more social polish shall we
                        want to do justice to our discernment; and not polish only, but those far
                        subtler things, tone and balance as well. I think it was the late Lord
                        Lytton who remarked in one of his books, what an offensive thing gaiety was
                        sure to be in any woman except one of the most perfect breeding. So too with
                        humour—the greater sense of humour a well-bred man has, the more delightful
                        he is; the greater sense of humour a vulgar man has, the more intolerable he
                        is.’ 
 The measure of Lady Ambrose’s assent was now almost complete. It remained,
                        however, for Mrs. Sinclair to give the finishing touch. 
 ‘I remember,’ she said softly and regretfully, ‘a friend of mine—he was
                        killed afterwards, poor man, in a duel near Dresden—who once, when he was
                        down for some weeks in the country fishing, fell desperately in love with a
                        certain rector’s daughter, who sang, and painted, and read German, and had a
                        beautiful figure as well. The mother at once saw what was in the wind, and
                        asked him directly to come and lunch at the rectory. And there three things
                        happened. First, the mother began telling him what very superior society
                        there was in the neighbouring local town; “In fact, its tone,” she said, “is
                            almost like that of a cathedral town.” Then the lovely
                        daughter asked him if he was partial to boiled chicken; and
                        then, a little later on—it was this that quite finished him, for the two
                        first shocks he said he might have got over—in answer to some little common
                        joke or other that he made, she told him, with a sort of arch smile—what do
                        you think? why, that he was saucy.’ 
 ‘I confess,’ said Miss Merton, laughing, ‘that it would take a
                        very great deal of charm of some sort to make one get over that. At any
                        rate, it’s a comfort to think that the young ladies in our new Republic
                        won’t call their admirers “saucy.”’ 
 ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘and so we have got thus far—we have made our ideal
                        society as highly bred, as highly educated, as polished, as sparkling, as
                        graceful, as easy, as dignified, as we can possibly imagine it. And now,
                        what next?’ 
 There was a moment’s pause. 
 ‘What I should want in a Utopia,’ Allen broke in abruptly, ‘would be
                        something definite for the people to do, each in his own walk of life. What
                        I should want would be some honest, definite, straightforward, religious
                        belief that we might all live by, and that would connect what we did and
                        went through here with something more important elsewhere. Without this, to
                        start with,’ he said, half sadly and half coldly, ‘all life seems to me a
                        mockery.’ 
 ‘And are you quite sure,’ said Laurence, with a slight sigh, ‘that it is not
                        a mockery?’ 
 Mr. Luke here saw an opening for which he had long been waiting.
