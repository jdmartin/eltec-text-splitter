CHAPTER I
It was a rich, warm night, at the beginning of August, when a gentleman enveloped in a
      cloak, for he was in evening dress, emerged from a club-house at the top of St. James’ Street,
      and descended that celebrated eminence. He had not proceeded more than half way down the
      street when, encountering a friend, he stopped with some abruptness.
“I have been looking for you everywhere,” he said.
“What is it?”
“We can hardly talk about it here.”
“Shall we go to White’s?”
“I have just left it, and, between ourselves, I would rather we should be more alone. ‘Tis
      as warm as noon. Let us cross the street and get into St. James’ Place. That is always my idea
      of solitude.”
So they crossed the street, and, at the corner of St. James’ Place, met several gentlemen
      who had just come out of Brookes’ Club-house. These saluted the companions as they passed, and
      said, “Capital account from Chiswick—Lord Howard says the chief will be in Downing Street on
      Monday.”
“It is of Chiswick that I am going to speak to you,” said the gentleman in the cloak,
      putting his arm in that of his companion as they walked on. “What I am about to tell you is
      known only to three persons, and is the most sacred of secrets. Nothing but our friendship
      could authorise me to impart it to you.”
“I hope it is something to your advantage,” said his companion.
“Nothing of that sort; it is of yourself that I am thinking. Since our political
      estrangement, I have never had a contented moment. From Christ Church, until that unhappy
      paralytic stroke, which broke up a government that had lasted fifteen years, and might have
      continued fifteen more, we seemed always to have been working together. That we should again
      unite is my dearest wish. A crisis is at hand. I want you to use it to your advantage. Know
      then, that what they were just saying about Chiswick is moonshine. His case is hopeless, and
      it has been communicated to the King.”
“Hopeless!”
“Rely upon it; it came direct from the Cottage to my friend.”
“I thought he had a mission?” said his companion, with emotion; “and men with missions do
      not disappear till they have fulfilled them.”
“But why did you think so? How often have I asked you for your grounds for such a
      conviction! There are none. The man of the age is clearly the Duke, the saviour of Europe, in
      the perfection of manhood, and with an iron constitution.”
“The salvation of Europe is the affair of a past generation,” said his companion. “We want
      something else now. The salvation of England should be the subject rather of our present
      thoughts.”
“England! why when were things more sound? Except the split among our own men, which will be
      now cured, there is not a cause of disquietude.”
“I have much,” said his friend.
“You never used to have any, Sidney. What extraordinary revelations can have been made to
      you during three months of office under a semi-Whig Ministry?”
“Your taunt is fair, though it pains me. And I confess to you that when I resolved to follow
      Canning and join his new allies, I had many a twinge. I was bred in the Tory camp; the Tories
      put me in Parliament and gave me office; I lived with them and liked them; we dined and voted
      together, and together pasquinaded our opponents. And yet, after Castlereagh’s death, to whom
      like yourself I was much attached, I had great misgivings as to the position of our party, and
      the future of the country. I tried to drive them from my mind, and at last took refuge in
      Canning, who seemed just the man appointed for an age of transition.”
“But a transition to what?”
“Well, his foreign policy was Liberal.”
“The same as the Duke’s; the same as poor dear Castlereagh’s. Nothing more unjust than the
      affected belief that there was any difference between them—a ruse of the Whigs to foster
      discord in our ranks. And as for domestic affairs, no one is stouter against Parliamentary
      Reform, while he is for the Church and no surrender, though he may make a harmless speech now
      and then, as many of us do, in favour of the Catholic claims.”
“Well, we will not now pursue this old controversy, my dear Ferrars, particularly if it be
      true, as you say, that Mr. Canning now lies upon his deathbed.”
“If! I tell you at this very moment it may be all over.”
“I am shaken to my very centre.”
“It is doubtless a great blow to you,” rejoined Mr. Ferrars, “and I wish to alleviate it.
      That is why I was looking for you. The King will, of course, send for the Duke, but I can tell
      you there will be a disposition to draw back our friends that left us, at least the younger
      ones of promise. If you are awake, there is no reason why you should not retain your
      office.”
“I am not so sure the King will send for the Duke.”
“It is certain.”
“Well,” said his companion musingly, “it may be fancy, but I cannot resist the feeling that
      this country, and the world generally, are on the eve of a great change—and I do not think the
      Duke is the man for the epoch.”
“I see no reason why there should be any great change; certainly not in this country,” said
      Mr. Ferrars. “Here we have changed everything that was required. Peel has settled the criminal
      law, and Huskisson the currency, and though I am prepared myself still further to reduce the
      duties on foreign imports, no one can deny that on this subject the Government is in advance
      of public opinion.”
“The whole affair rests on too contracted a basis,” said his companion. “We are habituated
      to its exclusiveness, and, no doubt, custom in England is a power; but let some event suddenly
      occur which makes a nation feel or think, and the whole thing might vanish like a dream.”
“What can happen? Such affairs as the Luddites do not occur twice in a century, and as for
      Spafields riots, they are impossible now with Peel’s new police. The country is employed and
      prosperous, and were it not so, the landed interest would always keep things straight.”
“It is powerful, and has been powerful for a long time; but there are other interests
      besides the landed interest now.”
“Well, there is the colonial interest, and the shipping interest,” said Mr. Ferrars, “and
      both of them thoroughly with us.”
“I was not thinking of them,” said his companion. “It is the increase of population, and of
      a population not employed in the cultivation of the soil, and all the consequences of such
      circumstances that were passing over my mind.”
“Don’t you be too doctrinaire, my dear Sidney; you and I are practical men. We must deal
      with the existing, the urgent; and there is nothing more pressing at this moment than the
      formation of a new government. What I want is to see you as a member of it.”
“Ah!” said his companion with a sigh, “do you really think it so near as that?”
“Why, what have we been talking of all this time, my dear Sidney? Clear your head of all
      doubt, and, if possible, of all regrets; we must deal with the facts, and we must deal with
      them to-morrow.”
“I still think he had a mission,” said Sidney with a sigh, “if it were only to bring hope to
      a people.”
“Well, I do not see he could have done anything more,” said Mr. Ferrars, “nor do I believe
      his government would have lasted during the session. However, I must now say good-night, for I
      must look in at the Square. Think well of what I have said, and let me hear from you as soon
      as you can.”
