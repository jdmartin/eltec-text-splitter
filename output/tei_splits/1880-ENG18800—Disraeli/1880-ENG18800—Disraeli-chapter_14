CHAPTER XIV
Eighteen hundred and thirty-two, the darkest and most distressing year in the life of Mr.
      Ferrars, closed in comparative calm and apparent content. He was himself greatly altered, both
      in manner and appearance. He was kind and gentle, but he was silent and rarely smiled. His
      hair was grizzled, and he began to stoop. But he was always employed, and was interested in
      his labours.
His sanguine wife bore up against their misfortunes with far more animation. She was at
      first amused with her new life, and when she was accustomed to it, she found a never-failing
      resource in her conviction of a coming reaction. Mrs. Ferrars possessed most feminine
      qualities, and many of them in excess. She could not reason, but her intuition was remarkable.
      She was of opinion that “these people never could go on,” and that they must necessarily be
      succeeded by William and his friends. In vain her husband, when she pressed her views and
      convictions on him, would shake his head over the unprecedented majority of the government,
      and sigh while he acknowledged that the Tories absolutely did not now command one fifth of the
      House of Commons; his shakes and sighs were equally disregarded by her, and she persisted in
      her dreams of riding upon elephants.
After all Mrs. Ferrars was right. There is nothing more remarkable in political history than
      the sudden break-up of the Whig party after their successful revolution of 1832. It is one of
      the most striking instances on record of all the elements of political power being useless
      without a commanding individual will. During the second year of their exile in the Berkshire
      hills, affairs looked so black that it seemed no change could occur except further and more
      calamitous revolution. Zenobia went to Vienna that she might breathe the atmosphere of law and
      order, and hinted to Mrs. Ferrars that probably she should never return—at least not until
      Parliament met, when she trusted the House of Lords, if they were not abolished in the
      interval, would save the country. And yet at the commencement of the following year an old
      colleague of Mr. Ferrars apprised him, in the darkest and deepest confidence, that “there was
      a screw loose,” and he must “look out for squalls.”
In the meantime Mr. Ferrars increased and established his claims on his party, if they ever
      did rally, by his masterly articles in their great Review, which circumstances favoured and
      which kept up that increasing feeling of terror and despair which then was deemed necessary
      for the advancement of Conservative opinions.
At home a year or more had elapsed without change. The occasional appearance of Nigel
      Penruddock was the only event. It was to all a pleasing, and to some of the family a deeply
      interesting one. Nigel, though a student and devoted to the holy profession for which he was
      destined, was also a sportsman. His Christianity was muscular, and Endymion, to whom he had
      taken a fancy, became the companion of his pastimes. All the shooting of the estate was at
      Nigel’s command, but as there were no keepers, it was of course very rough work. Still it was
      a novel and animating life for Endymion; and though the sport was slight, the pursuit was
      keen. Then Nigel was a great fisherman, and here their efforts had a surer return, for they
      dwelt in a land of trout streams, and in their vicinity was a not inconsiderable river. It was
      an adventure of delight to pursue some of these streams to their source, throwing, as they
      rambled on, the fly in the rippling waters. Myra, too, took some pleasure in these fishing
      expeditions, carrying their luncheon and a German book in her wallet, and sitting quietly on
      the bank for hours, when they had fixed upon some favoured pool for a prolonged campaign.
Every time that Nigel returned home, a difference, and a striking difference, was observed
      in him. His person, of course, became more manly, his manner more assured, his dress more
      modish. It was impossible to deny that he was extremely good-looking, interesting in his
      discourse, and distinguished in his appearance. Endymion idolised him. Nigel was his model. He
      imitated his manner, caught the tone of his voice, and began to give opinions on subjects,
      sacred and profane.
After a hard morning’s march, one day, as they were lolling on the turf amid the old beeches
      and the juniper, Nigel said—
“What does Mr. Ferrars mean you to be, Endymion?”
“I do not know,” said Endymion, looking perplexed.
“But I suppose you are to be something?”
“Yes; I suppose I must be something; because papa has lost his fortune.”
“And what would you like to be?”
“I never thought about it,” said Endymion.
“In my opinion there is only one thing for a man to be in this age,” said Nigel
      peremptorily; “he should go into the Church.”
“The Church!” said Endymion.
“There will soon be nothing else left,” said Nigel. “The Church must last for ever. It is
      built upon a rock. It was founded by God; all other governments have been founded by men. When
      they are destroyed, and the process of destruction seems rapid, there will be nothing left to
      govern mankind except the Church.”
“Indeed!” said Endymion; “papa is very much in favour of the Church, and, I know, is writing
      something about it.”
“Yes, but Mr. Ferrars is an Erastian,” said Nigel; “you need not tell him I said so, but he
      is one. He wants the Church to be the servant of the State, and all that sort of thing, but
      that will not do any longer. This destruction of the Irish bishoprics has brought affairs to a
      crisis. No human power has the right to destroy a bishopric. It is a divinely-ordained office,
      and when a diocese is once established, it is eternal.”
“I see,” said Endymion, much interested.
“I wish,” continued Nigel, “you were two or three years older, and Mr. Ferrars could send
      you to Oxford. That is the place to understand these things, and they will soon be the only
      things to understand. The rector knows nothing about them. My father is thoroughly high and
      dry, and has not the slightest idea of Church principles.”
“Indeed!” said Endymion.
“It is quite a new set even at Oxford,” continued Nigel; “but their principles are as old as
      the Apostles, and come down from them, straight.”
“That is a long time ago,” said Endymion.
“I have a great fancy,” continued Nigel, without apparently attending to him, “to give you a
      thorough Church education. It would be the making of you. You would then have a purpose in
      life, and never be in doubt or perplexity on any subject. We ought to move heaven and earth to
      induce Mr. Ferrars to send you to Oxford.”
“I will speak to Myra about it,” said Endymion.
“I said something of this to your sister the other day,” said Nigel, “but I fear she is
      terribly Erastian. However, I will give you something to read. It is not very long, but you
      can read it at your leisure, and then we will talk over it afterwards, and perhaps I may give
      you something else.”
Endymion did not fail to give a report of this conversation and similar ones to his sister,
      for he was in the habit of telling her everything. She listened with attention, but not with
      interest, to his story. Her expression was kind, but hardly serious. Her wondrous eyes gave
      him a glance of blended mockery and affection. “Dear darling,” she said, “if you are to be a
      clergyman, I should like you to be a cardinal.”
