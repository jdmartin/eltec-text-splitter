CHAPTER XXI
It was only ten o’clock when Endymion returned to Warwick Street, and for the first time in
      his life used a pass-key, with which Mr. Rodney had furnished him in the morning, and
      re-entered his new home. He thought he had used it very quietly, and was lighting his candle
      and about to steal up to his lofty heights, when from the door of the parlour, which opened
      into the passage, emerged Miss Imogene, who took the candlestick from his hand and insisted on
      waiting upon him.
“I thought I heard something,” she said; “you must let me light you up, for you can hardly
      yet know your way. I must see too if all is right; you may want something.”
So she tripped up lightly before him, showing, doubtless without premeditation, as
      well-turned an ankle and as pretty a foot as could fall to a damsel’s fortunate lot. “My
      sister and Mr. Rodney have gone to the play,” she said, “but they left strict instructions
      with me to see that you were comfortable, and that you wanted for nothing that we could
      supply.”
“You are too kind,” said Endymion, as she lighted the candles on his dressing-table, “and,
      to tell you the truth, these are luxuries I am not accustomed to, and to which I am not
      entitled.”
“And yet,” she said, with a glance of blended admiration and pity, “they tell me time was
      when gold was not good enough for you, and I do not think it could be.”
“Such kindness as this,” said Endymion, “is more precious than gold.”
“I hope you will find your things well arranged. All your clothes are in these two drawers;
      the coats in the bottom one, and your linen in those above. You will not perhaps be able to
      find your pocket-handkerchiefs at first. They are in this sachet; my sister made it herself.
      Mr. Rodney says you are to be called at eight o’clock and breakfast at nine. I think
      everything is right. Good-night, Mr. Endymion.”
The Rodney household was rather a strange one. The first two floors, as we have mentioned,
      were let, and at expensive rates, for the apartments were capacious and capitally furnished,
      and the situation, if not distinguished, was extremely convenient—quiet from not being a
      thoroughfare, and in the heart of civilisation. They only kept a couple of servants, but their
      principal lodgers had their personal attendants. And yet after sunset the sisters appeared and
      presided at their tea-table, always exquisitely dressed; seldom alone, for Mr. Rodney had many
      friends, and lived in a capacious apartment, rather finely furnished, with a round table
      covered with gaudy print-books, a mantelpiece crowded with vases of mock Dresden, and a
      cottage piano, on which Imogene could accompany her more than pleasing voice.
Somehow or other, the process is difficult to trace, Endymion not unfrequently found himself
      at Mrs. Rodney’s tea-table. On the first occasion or so, he felt himself a little shy and
      embarrassed, but it soon became natural to him, and he would often escape from the symposia at
      Joe’s, and, instead of the Divan, find in Warwick Street a more congenial scene. There were
      generally some young men there, who seemed delighted with the ladies, listened with enthusiasm
      to Imogene’s singing, and were allowed to smoke. They were evidently gentlemen, and indeed Mr.
      Rodney casually mentioned to Endymion that one of the most frequent guests might some day even
      be a peer of the realm. Sometimes there was a rubber of whist, and, if wanted, Mrs. Rodney
      took a hand in it; Endymion sitting apart and conversing with her sister, who amused him by
      her lively observations, indicating even flashes of culture; but always addressed him without
      the slightest pretence and with the utmost naturalness. This was not the case with Mr. Rodney;
      pretence with him was ingrained, and he was at first somewhat embarrassed by the presence of
      Endymion, as he could hardly maintain before his late patron’s son his favourite character of
      the aristocratic victim of revolution. And yet this drawback was more than counterbalanced by
      the gratification of his vanity in finding a Ferrars his habitual guest. Such a luxury seemed
      a dangerous indulgence, but he could not resist it, and the moth was always flying round the
      candle. There was no danger, however, and that Mr. Rodney soon found out. Endymion was born
      with tact, and it came to him as much from goodness of heart as fineness of taste. Mr. Rodney,
      therefore, soon resumed his anecdotes of great men and his personal experience of their
      sayings, manners, and customs, with which he was in the habit of enlivening or ornamenting the
      whist table; occasionally introducing Endymion to the notice of the table by mentioning in a
      low tone, “That is Mr. Ferrars, in a certain sense under my care; his father is a privy
      councillor, and had it not been for the revolution—for I maintain, and always will, the Reform
      Bill was neither more nor less than a revolution—would probably have been Prime Minister. He
      was my earliest and my best friend.”
When there were cards, there was always a little supper: a lobster and a roasted potato and
      that sort of easy thing, and curious drinks, which the sisters mixed and made, and which no
      one else, at least all said so, could mix and make. On fitting occasions a bottle of champagne
      appeared, and then the person for whom the wine was produced was sure with wonderment to say,
      “Where did you get this champagne, Rodney? Could you get me some?” Mr. Rodney shook his head
      and scarcely gave a hope, but subsequently, when the praise in consequence had continued and
      increased, would observe, “Do you really want some? I cannot promise, but I will try. Of
      course they will ask a high figure.”
“Anything they like, my dear Rodney.”
And in about a week’s time the gentleman was so fortunate as to get his champagne.
There was one subject in which Mr. Rodney appeared to be particularly interested, and that
      was racing. The turf at that time had not developed into that vast institution of national
      demoralisation which it now exhibits. That disastrous character may be mainly attributed to
      the determination of our legislators to put down gaming-houses, which, practically speaking,
      substituted for the pernicious folly of a comparatively limited class the ruinous madness of
      the community. There were many influences by which in the highest classes persons might be
      discouraged or deterred from play under a roof; and in the great majority of cases such a
      habit was difficult, not to say impossible, to indulge. But in shutting up gaming-houses, we
      brought the gaming-table into the street, and its practices became the pursuit of those who
      would otherwise have never witnessed or even thought of them. No doubt Crockford’s had its
      tragedies, but all its disasters and calamities together would hardly equal a lustre of the
      ruthless havoc which has ensued from its suppression.
Nevertheless, in 1835 men made books, and Mr. Rodney was not inexpert in a composition which
      requires no ordinary qualities of character and intelligence; method, judgment,
      self-restraint, not too much imagination, perception of character, and powers of calculation.
      All these qualities were now in active demand and exercise; for the Derby was at hand, and the
      Rodney family, deeply interested in the result, were to attend the celebrated festival.
One of the young gentlemen, who sometimes smoked a cigar and sometimes tasted a lobster in
      their parlour, and who seemed alike and equally devoted to Mrs. Rodney and her sister,
      insisted upon taking them to Epsom in his drag, and they themselves were to select the party
      to accompany them. That was not difficult, for they were naturally all friends of their
      munificent host with one exception. Imogene stipulated that Endymion should be asked, and Mr.
      Rodney supported the suggestion. “He is the son of the privy councillor the Right Hon. William
      Pitt Ferrars, my earliest and my best friend, and in a certain sense is under my care.”
The drive to the Derby was not then shorn of its humours and glories. It was the Carnival of
      England, with equipages as numerous and various, and with banter not less quick and witty. It
      was a bright day—a day, no doubt, of wild hopes and terrible fears, but yet, on the whole, of
      joy and exultation. And no one was happier and prouder than pretty Mrs. Rodney, exquisitely
      dressed and sitting on the box of a patrician drag, beside its noble owner. On the seat behind
      them was Imogene, with Endymion on one side, and on the other the individual “who might one
      day be a peer.” Mr. Rodney and some others, including Mr. Vigo, faced a couple of grooms, who
      sat with folded arms and unmoved countenances, fastidiously stolid amid all the fun, and grave
      even when they opened the champagne.
The right horse won. Mr. Rodney and his friends pocketed a good stake, and they demolished
      their luncheon of luxuries with frantic gaiety.
“It is almost as happy as our little suppers in Warwick Street,” whispered their noble
      driver to his companion.
“Oh! much more than anything you can find there,” simpered Mrs. Rodney.
“I declare to you, some of the happiest hours of my life have been passed in Warwick
      Street,” gravely murmured her friend.
“I wish I could believe that,” said Mrs. Rodney.
As for Endymion, he enjoyed himself amazingly. The whole scene was new to him—he had never
      been at a race before, and this was the most famous of races. He did not know he had betted,
      but he found he too had won a little money, Mr. Rodney having put him on something, though
      what that meant he had not the remotest idea. Imogene, however, assured him it was all
      right—Mr. Rodney constantly put her on something. He enjoyed the luncheon too; the cold
      chicken, and the French pies, the wondrous salads, and the iced champagne. It seemed that
      Imogene was always taking care that his plate or his glass should be filled. Everything was
      delightful, and his noble host, who, always courteous, had hitherto been reserved, called him
      “Ferrars.”
What with the fineness of the weather, the inspirations of the excited and countless
      multitude, the divine stimulus of the luncheon, the kindness of his charming companions, and
      the general feeling of enjoyment and success that seemed to pervade his being, Endymion felt
      as he were almost acting a distinguished part in some grand triumph of antiquity, as returning
      home, the four splendid dark chestnuts swept along, two of their gay company playing bugles,
      and the grooms sitting with folded arms of haughty indifference.
Just at this moment his eye fell upon an omnibus full, inside and out, of clerks in his
      office. There was a momentary stoppage, and while he returned the salute of several of them,
      his quick eye could not avoid recognising the slightly surprised glance of Trenchard, the
      curious amazement of Seymour Hicks, and the indignant astonishment of St. Barbe.
“Our friend Ferrars seems in tiptop company,” said Trenchard.
“That may have been a countess on the box,” said Seymour Hicks, “for I observed an earl’s
      coronet on the drag. I cannot make out who it is.”
“There is no more advantage in going with four horses than with two,” said St. Barbe;
      “indeed, I believe you go slower. It is mere pride; puffed-up vanity. I should like to send
      those two grooms with their folded arms to the galleys—I hate those fellows. For my part, I
      never was behind four horses except in a stage-coach. No peer of the realm ever took me on his
      drag. However, a day of reckoning will come; the people won’t stand this much longer.”
Jawett was not there, for he disapproved of races.
