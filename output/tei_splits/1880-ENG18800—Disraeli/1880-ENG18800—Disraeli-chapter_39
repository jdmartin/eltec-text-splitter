CHAPTER XXXIX
The Earl of Roehampton was the strongest member of the government, except, of course, the
      premier himself. He was the man from whose combined force and flexibility of character the
      country had confidence that in all their councils there would be no lack of courage, yet
      tempered with adroit discretion. Lord Roehampton, though an Englishman, was an Irish peer, and
      was resolved to remain so, for he fully appreciated the position, which united social
      distinction with the power of a seat in the House of Commons. He was a very ambitious, and, as
      it was thought, worldly man, deemed even by many to be unscrupulous, and yet he was romantic.
      A great favourite in society, and especially with the softer sex, somewhat late in life, he
      had married suddenly a beautiful woman, who was without fortune, and not a member of the
      enchanted circle in which he flourished. The union had been successful, for Lord Roehampton
      was gifted with a sweet temper, and, though people said he had no heart, with a winning
      tenderness of disposition, or at least of manner, which at the same time charmed and soothed.
      He had been a widower for two years, and the world was of opinion that he ought to marry
      again, and form this time a becoming alliance. In addition to his many recommendations he had
      now the inestimable reputation, which no one had ever contemplated for him, of having been a
      good husband.
Berengaria, Countess of Montfort, was a great friend of Lord Roehampton. She was accustomed
      to describe herself as “the last of his conquests,” and though Lord Roehampton read characters
      and purposes with a glance, and was too sagacious to be deceived by any one, even by himself,
      his gratified taste, for he scarcely had vanity, cherished the bright illusion of which he was
      conscious, and he responded to Lady Montfort half sportively, half seriously, with an air of
      flattered devotion. Lord Roehampton had inherited an ample estate, and he had generally been
      in office; for he served his apprenticeship under Perceval and Liverpool, and changed his
      party just in time to become a member of the Cabinet of 1831. Yet with all these advantages,
      whether it were the habit of his life, which was ever profuse, or that neglect of his private
      interests which almost inevitably accompanies the absorbing duties of public life, his affairs
      were always somewhat confused, and Lady Montfort, who wished to place him on a pinnacle, had
      resolved that he should marry an heiress. After long observation and careful inquiry and
      prolonged reflection, the lady she had fixed upon was Miss Neuchatel; and she it was who had
      made Lord Roehampton cross the room and address Adriana after her song.
“He is not young,” reasoned Lady Montfort to herself, “but his mind and manner are young,
      and that is everything. I am sure I meet youth every day who, compared with Lord Roehampton,
      could have no chance with my sex—men who can neither feel, nor think, nor converse. And then
      he is famous, and powerful, and fashionable, and knows how to talk to women. And this must all
      tell with a banker’s daughter, dying, of course, to be a grande dame. It will do. He
      may not be young, but he is irresistible. And the father will like it, for he told me in
      confidence, at dinner, that he wished Lord Roehampton to be prime minister; and with this
      alliance he will be.”
The plot being devised by a fertile brain never wanting in expedients, its development was
      skilfully managed, and its accomplishment anticipated with confidence. It was remarkable with
      what dexterity the Neuchatel family and Lord Roehampton were brought together. Berengaria’s
      lord and master was in the country, which he said he would not quit; but this did not prevent
      her giving delightful little dinners and holding select assemblies on nights when there was no
      dreadful House of Commons, and Lord Roehampton could be present. On most occasions, and
      especially on these latter ones, Lady Montfort could not endure existence without her dear
      Adriana. Mr. Neuchatel, who was a little in the plot, who at least smiled when Berengaria
      alluded to her enterprise, was not wanting in his contributions to its success. He hardly ever
      gave one of his famous banquets to which Lord Roehampton was not invited, and, strange to say,
      Lord Roehampton, who had the reputation of being somewhat difficult on this head, always
      accepted the invitations. The crowning social incident, however, was when Lord Roehampton
      opened his own house for the first time since his widowhood, and received the Neuchatels at a
      banquet not inferior to their own. This was a great triumph for Lady Montfort, who thought the
      end was at hand.
“Life is short,” she said to Lord Roehampton that evening. “Why not settle it to-night?”
“Well,” said Lord Roehampton, “you know I never like anything precipitate. Besides, why
      should the citadel surrender when I have hardly entered on my first parallel?”
“Ah! those are old-fashioned tactics,” said Lady Montfort.
“Well, I suppose I am an old-fashioned man.”
“Be serious, now. I want it settled before Easter. I must go down to my lord then, and even
      before; and I should like to see this settled before we separate.”
“Why does not Montfort come up to town?” said Lord Roehampton. “He is wanted.”
“Well,” said Lady Montfort, with half a sigh, “it is no use talking about it. He will not
      come. Our society bores him, and he must be amused. I write to him every day, and sometimes
      twice a day, and pass my life in collecting things to interest him. I would never leave him
      for a moment, only I know then that he would get wearied of me; and he thinks now—at least, he
      once said so—that he has never had a dull moment in my company.”
“How can he find amusement in the country?” said Lord Roehampton. “There is no sport now,
      and a man cannot always be reading French novels.”
“Well, I send amusing people down to him,” said Berengaria. “It is difficult to arrange, for
      he does not like toadies, which is so unreasonable, for I know many toadies who are very
      pleasant. Treeby is with him now, and that is excellent, for Treeby contradicts him, and is
      scientific as well as fashionable, and gives him the last news of the Sun as well as of
      White’s. I want to get this great African traveller to go down to him; but one can hardly send
      a perfect stranger as a guest. I wanted Treeby to take him, but Treeby refused—men are so
      selfish. Treeby could have left him there, and the traveller might have remained a week, told
      all he had seen, and as much more as he liked. My lord cannot stand Treeby more than two days,
      and Treeby cannot stand my lord for a longer period, and that is why they are such
      friends.”
“A sound basis of agreement,” said Lord Roehampton. “I believe absence is often a great
      element of charm.”
“But, a nos moutons,” resumed Lady Montfort. “You see now why I am so anxious for a
      conclusion of our affair. I think it is ripe?”
“Why do you?” said Lord Roehampton.
“Well, she must be very much in love with you.”
“Has she told you so?”
“No; but she looks in love.”
“She has never told me so,” said Lord Roehampton.
“Have you told her?”
“Well, I have not,” said her companion. “I like the family—all of them. I like Neuchatel
      particularly. I like his house and style of living. You always meet nice people there, and
      hear the last thing that has been said or done all over the world. It is a house where you are
      sure not to be dull.”
“You have described a perfect home,” said Lady Montfort, “and it awaits you.”
“Well, I do not know,” said Lord Roehampton. “Perhaps I am fastidious, perhaps I am content;
      to be noticed sometimes by a Lady Montfort should, I think, satisfy any man.”
“Well, that is gallant, but it is not business, my dear lord. You can count on my devotion
      even when you are married; but I want to see you on a pinnacle, so that if anything happens
      there shall be no question who is to be the first man in this country.”
