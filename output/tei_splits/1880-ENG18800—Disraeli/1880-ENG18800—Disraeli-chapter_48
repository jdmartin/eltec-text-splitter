CHAPTER XLVIII
This considerable rise in the life of Endymion, after the first excitement occasioned by its
      announcement to him had somewhat subsided, was not contemplated by him with unmixed feelings
      of satisfaction. It seemed to terminate many relations of life, the value of which he had
      always appreciated, but which now, with their impending conclusion, he felt, and felt keenly,
      had absolutely contributed to his happiness. There was no great pang in quitting his
      fellow-clerks, except Trenchard, whom he greatly esteemed. But poor little Warwick Street had
      been to him a real home, if unvarying kindness, and sedulous attention, and the affection of
      the eyes and heart, as well as of the mouth, can make a hearth. He hoped he might preserve the
      friendship of Waldershare, which their joint intimacy with the prince would favour; but still
      he could hardly flatter himself that the delightful familiarity of their past lives could
      subsist. Endymion sighed, and then he sighed again. He felt sad. Because he was leaving the
      humble harbour of refuge, the entrance to which, even in the darkest hour of his fallen
      fortunes, was thought somewhat of an indignity, and was about to assume a position which would
      not have altogether misbecome the earliest expectations of his life? That seems unreasonable;
      but mankind, fortunately, are not always governed by reason, but by sentiment, and often by
      very tender sentiment.
When Endymion, sitting in his little room, analysed his feelings, he came to the conclusion
      that his sadness was occasioned by his having to part from Imogene. It often requires an event
      in life, and an unexpected one, to make us clearly aware of the existence of feelings which
      have long influenced us. Never having been in a position in which the possibility of uniting
      his fate to another could cross his mind for a moment, he had been content with the good
      fortune which permitted a large portion of his life to be passed in the society of a woman
      who, unconsciously both to him and to herself, had fascinated him. The graceful child who,
      four or five years ago, had first lit him to his garret, without losing any of her rare and
      simple ingenuousness, had developed into a beautiful and accomplished woman. There was a
      strong resemblance between Imogene and her sister, but Imogene was a brunette. Her countenance
      indicated far more intellect and character than that of Sylvia. Her brow was delicately
      pencilled and finely arched, and her large dark eyes gleamed with a softness and sweetness of
      expression, which were irresistibly attractive, and seemed to indicate sympathy with
      everything that was good and beautiful. Her features were not so regular as her sister’s; but
      when she smiled, her face was captivating.
Endymion had often listened, half with fondness and half with scepticism, to Waldershare
      dilating, according to his wont, on the high character and qualities of Imogene, whom he
      persisted in believing he was preparing for a great career. “How it will come about I cannot
      say,” he would remark; “but it will come. If my legitimate sovereign were on the throne, and I
      in the possession of my estates, which were graciously presented by the usurper to the
      sausage-makers, or some other choice middle-class corporation, I would marry her myself. But
      that is impossible. That would only be asking her to share my ruin. I want her to live in
      palaces, and perhaps, in my decline of life, make me her librarian, like Casanova. I should be
      content to dine in her hall every day beneath the salt, and see her enter with her state, amid
      the flourish of trumpets.” And now, strange to say, Endymion was speculating on the fate of
      Imogene, and, as he thought, in a more practical spirit. Six hundred a year, he thought, was
      not a very large income; but it was an income, and one which a year ago he never contemplated
      possessing until getting grey in the public service. Why not realise perfect happiness at
      once? He could conceive no bliss greater than living with Imogene in one of those little
      villas, even if semi-detached, which now are numbered by tens of thousands, and which were
      then beginning to shoot out their suburban antennae in every direction of our huge metropolis.
      He saw her in his mind’s eye in a garden of perpetual sunshine, breathing of mignonette and
      bright with roses, and waiting for him as he came down from town and his daily labours, in the
      cheap and convenient omnibus. What a delightful companion to welcome him! How much to tell
      her, and how much to listen to! And then their evenings with a delicious book or some
      delightful music! What holidays, too, of romantic adventure! The vine-clad Rhine, perhaps
      Switzerland; at any rate, the quaint old cities of Flanders, and the winding valley of the
      Meuse. They could live extremely well on six hundred a year, yes, with all the real
      refinements of existence. And all their genuine happiness was to be sacrificed for utterly
      fantastic and imaginary gratifications, which, if analysed, would be found only to be efforts
      to amuse and astonish others.
It did not yet occur to Endymion that his garden could not always be sunshiny; that cares
      crop up in villas, even semi-detached, as well as joys; that he would have children, and
      perhaps too many; that they would be sick, and that doctors’ bills would soon put a stop to
      romantic excursions; that his wife would become exhausted with nursing and clothing and
      teaching them; that she herself would become an invalid, and moped to death; that his
      resources would every day bear a less proportion to his expenditure; and that wanting money,
      he would return too often from town a harassed husband to a jaded wife!
Mr. Rodney and Sylvia were at Conington on a visit to Lord Beaumaris, hunting. It was
      astonishing how Sylvia had ridden to the hounds, mounted on the choicest steeds, and in a
      scarlet habit which had been presented to her by Mr. Vigo. She had created quite an enthusiasm
      in the field, and Lord Beaumaris was proud of his guests. When Endymion parted with his sister
      at the Albany, where they had been examining his rooms, he had repaired to Warwick Street,
      with some expectation that the Rodneys would have returned from Conington, and he intended to
      break to his host the impending change in his life. The Rodneys, however, had not arrived, and
      so he ascended to his room, where he had been employed in arranging his books and papers, and
      indulging in the reverie which we have indicated. When he came downstairs, wishing to inquire
      about the probable arrival of his landlord, Endymion knocked at the door of the parlour where
      they used to assemble, and on entering, found Imogene writing.
“How do you do, Mr. Ferrars?” she said, rising. “I am writing to Sylvia. They are not
      returning as soon as they intended, and I am to go down to Conington by an early train
      to-morrow.”
“I want to see Mr. Rodney,” said Endymion moodily.
“Can I write anything to him, or tell him anything?” said Imogene.
“No,” continued Endymion in a melancholy tone. “I can tell you what I wanted to say. But you
      must be occupied now, going away, and unexpectedly, to-morrow. It seems to me that every one
      is going away.”
“Well, we have lost the prince, certainly,” said Imogene, “and I doubt whether his rooms
      will be ever let again.”
“Indeed!” said Endymion.
“Well, I only know what Mr. Waldershare tells me. He says that Mr. Rodney and Mr. Vigo have
      made a great speculation, and gained a great deal of money; but Mr. Rodney never speaks to me
      of such matters, nor indeed does Sylvia. I am myself very sorry that the prince has gone, for
      he interested me much.”
“Well, I should think Mr. Rodney would not be very sorry to get rid of me then,” said
      Endymion.
“O Mr. Ferrars! why should you say or think such things! I am sure that my brother and
      sister, and indeed every one in this house, always consider your comfort and welfare before
      any other object.”
“Yes,” said Endymion, “you have all been most kind to me, and that makes me more wretched at
      the prospect of leaving you.”
“But there is no prospect of that?”
“A certainty, Imogene; there is going to be a change in my life,” and then he told her
      all.
“Well,” said Imogene, “it would be selfish not to be happy at what I hear; but though I hope
      I am happy, I need not be joyful. I never used to be nervous, but I am afraid I am getting so.
      All these great changes rather shake me. This adventure of the prince—as Mr. Waldershare says,
      it is history. Then Miss Myra’s great marriage, and your promotion—although they are exactly
      what we used to dream about, and wished a fairy would accomplish, and somehow felt that,
      somehow or other, they must happen—yet now they have occurred, one is almost as astounded as
      delighted. We certainly have been very happy in Warwick Street, at least I have been, all
      living as it were together. But where shall we be this time next year? All scattered, and
      perhaps not even the Rodneys under this roof. I know not how it is, but I dread leaving the
      roof where one has been happy.”
“Oh! you know you must leave it one day or other, Imogene. You are sure to marry; that you
      cannot avoid.”
“Well, I am not by any means sure about that,” said Imogene. “Mr. Waldershare, in educating
      me, as he says, as a princess, has made me really neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, nor even that
      coarser but popular delicacy never forgotten. I could not unite my life with a being who was
      not refined in mind and in manners, and the men of my class in life, who are the only ones
      after all who might care to marry me, shock my taste, I am ashamed to say so. I am not sure it
      is not wicked to think it even; but so it is.”
“Why do you not marry Waldershare?” said Endymion.
“That would be madness! I do not know any alliance that could prove more unfortunate. Mr.
      Waldershare must never marry. All people of imagination, they say, are difficult to live with;
      but a person who consists solely of imagination, like Mr. Waldershare, who has indeed no other
      attribute—before a year was past, married, he would fly to the desert or to La Trappe, commit
      terrible scandals from mere weariness of feeling, write pasquinades against the wife of his
      bosom, and hold us both up to the fierce laughter of the world. No, no; he is the best, the
      dearest, and the most romantic of friends; tender as a father, and sometimes as wise, for
      genius can be everything. He is going to rise early to-morrow, which he particularly dislikes,
      because he will not let me go to the station alone; though I tell him, as I often tell him,
      those are the becoming manners of my class.”
“But you might meet a person of the refinement you require,” said Endymion, “with a moderate
      and yet a sufficient income, who would not be unworthy of you.”
“I doubt it,” said Imogene.
“But, do not doubt it, dear Imogene,” said Endymion, advancing; “such charms as yours, both
      of body and of mind, such a companion in life, so refined, so accomplished, and yet endowed
      with such clear sense, and such a sweet disposition—believe me”——
But at this moment a splendid equipage drove up to the door, with powdered footmen and long
      canes behind, and then a terrible rap, like the tattoo of a field-marshal.
“Good gracious! what is all this?” exclaimed Imogene.
“It is my sister,” said Endymion, blushing; “it is Lady Roehampton.”
“I must go to her myself,” said Imogene; “I cannot have the servant attend upon your
      sister.”
Endymion remained silent and confused. Imogene was some little time at the carriage-door,
      for Lady Roehampton had inquiries to make after Sylvia and other courteous things to say, and
      then Imogene returned, and said to Endymion, “Lady Roehampton wishes you to go with her
      directly on some particular business.”
