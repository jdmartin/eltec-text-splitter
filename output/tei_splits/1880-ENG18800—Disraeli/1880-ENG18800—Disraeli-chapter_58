CHAPTER LVIII
What was most remarkable, and most interesting, in the character of Berengaria was her
      energy. She had the power of exciting others to action in a degree rarely possessed. She had
      always some considerable object in contemplation, occasionally more than one, and never
      foresaw difficulties. Her character was, however, singularly feminine; she never affected to
      be a superior woman. She never reasoned, did not read much, though her literary taste was fine
      and fastidious. Though she required constant admiration and consequently encouraged it, she
      was not a heartless coquette. Her sensibility was too quick, and as the reign of her
      favourites was sometimes brief, she was looked upon as capricious. The truth is, what seemed
      whimsical in her affections was occasioned by the subtlety of her taste, which was not always
      satisfied by the increased experience of intimacy. Whenever she made a friend not unworthy of
      her, she was constant and entirely devoted.
At present, Berengaria had two great objects; one was to sustain the Whig government in its
      troubles, and the other was to accomplish an unprecedented feat in modern manners, and that
      was no less than to hold a tournament, a real tournament, in the autumn, at the famous castle
      of her lord in the North of England.
The lord-lieutenant had not been in his county for two years; he had even omitted to
      celebrate Christmas at his castle, which had shocked everybody, for its revelry was looked
      upon almost as the tenure by which the Montforts held their estates. His plea of ill health,
      industriously circulated by all his agents, obtained neither sympathy nor credence. His county
      was rather a weak point with Lord Montfort, for though he could not bear his home, he was fond
      of power, and power depended on his territorial influence. The representation of his county by
      his family, and authority in the local parliamentary boroughs, were the compensations held out
      to him for the abolition of his normal seats. His wife dexterously availed herself of this
      state of affairs to obtain his assent to her great project, which, it would appear, might not
      only amuse him, but, in its unprecedented magnificence and novelty, must sweep away all
      discontents, and gratify every class.
Lord Montfort had placed unlimited resources at the disposal of Berengaria for the
      fulfilment of her purpose, and at times even showed some not inconsiderable though fitful
      interest in her progress. He turned over the drawings of the various costumes and armour with
      a gracious smile, and, having picked up on such subjects a great deal of knowledge,
      occasionally made suggestions which were useful and sometimes embarrassing. The heralds were
      all called into council, and Garter himself deigned to regulate the order of proceedings. Some
      of the finest gentlemen in London, of both parties in the state, passed the greater part of
      their spring mornings in jousting, and in practising all the manoeuvres of the lists. Lady
      Montfort herself was to be the Queen of the Tournament, and she had prevailed on Lady
      Roehampton to accept the supreme office of Queen of Beauty.
It was the early part of May, and Zenobia held one of her great assemblies. Being in high
      good humour, sanguine and prophetic of power, she had asked all the great Whig ladies, and,
      the times being critical, they had come. Berengaria seemed absorbed by the details of her
      tournament. She met many of her knights, and she conferred with them all; the Knight of the
      Bleeding Heart, the Knight of Roses, the Knight of the Crystal Shield.
Endymion, who was not to be a knight, but a gentleman-at-arms in attendance on the Queen of
      the Tournament, mentioned that Prince Florestan much wished to be a jouster; he had heard this
      from the Duke of St. Angelo, and Lady Montfort, though she did not immediately sanction, did
      not absolutely refuse, the request.
Past midnight, there was a sudden stir in the saloons. The House of Commons had broken up
      and many members were entering. There had been a division on the Jamaica question, and the
      ministers had only a majority of five. The leader of the House of Commons had intimated, not
      to say announced, their consequent resignation.
“Have you heard what they say?” said Endymion anxiously to Lady Montfort.
“Yes, I heard; but do not look so grave.”
“Do I look grave?”
“As if it were the last day.”
“I fear it is.”
“I am not so sure. I doubt whether Sir Robert thinks it ripe enough; and after all, we are
      not in a minority. I do not see why we should have resigned. I wish I could see Lord
      Roehampton.”
Affairs did not proceed so rapidly as the triumphant Zenobia expected. They were out, no
      question about that; but it was not so certain who was in. A day passed and another day, and
      even Zenobia, who knew everything before anybody, remained in the dark. The suspense became
      protracted and even more mysterious. Almost a week had elapsed; noble lords and right
      honourable gentlemen were calling on Sir Robert every morning, according to the newspapers,
      but no one could hear from any authority of any appointments being really made. At last, there
      was a whisper very late one night at Crockford’s, which was always better informed on these
      matters than the political clubs, and people looked amazed, and stared incredulously in each
      other’s face. But it was true; there was a hitch, and in four-and-twenty hours the cause of
      the hitch was known. It seemed that the ministry really had resigned, but Berengaria, Countess
      of Montfort, had not followed their example.
What a dangerous woman! even wicked! Zenobia was for sending her to the Tower at once. “It
      was clearly impossible,” she declared, “for Sir Robert to carry on affairs with such a
      Duchesse de Longueville always at the ear of our young Queen, under the pretence forsooth of
      being the friend of Her Majesty’s youth.”
This was the famous Bed-Chamber Plot, in which the Conservative leaders, as is now generally
      admitted, were decidedly in error, and which terminated in the return of the Whigs to
      office.
“But we must reconstruct,” said Lady Montfort to the prime minister. “Sidney Wilton must be
      Secretary of State. And you,” she said to Endymion, when she communicated to him the
      successful result of her interference, “you will go with him. It is a great thing at your age
      to be private secretary to a Secretary of State.”
