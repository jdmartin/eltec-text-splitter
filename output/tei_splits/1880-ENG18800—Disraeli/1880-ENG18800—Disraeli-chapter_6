CHAPTER VI
Mr. Ferrars did not become a cabinet minister, but this was a vexation rather than a
      disappointment, and transient. The unexpected vacancies were filled by unexpected personages.
      So great a change in the frame of the ministry, without any promotion for himself, was on the
      first impression not agreeable, but reflection and the sanguine wisdom of Zenobia soon
      convinced him that all was for the best, that the thought of such rapid preferment was
      unreasonable, and that time and the due season must inevitably bring all that he could desire,
      especially as any term to the duration of the ministry was not now to be foreseen: scarcely
      indeed possible. In short, it was shown to him that the Tory party, renovated and restored,
      had entered upon a new lease of authority, which would stamp its character on the remainder of
      the nineteenth century, as Mr. Pitt and his school had marked its earlier and memorable
      years.
And yet this very reconstruction of the government necessarily led to an incident which, in
      its consequences, changed the whole character of English politics, and commenced a series of
      revolutions which has not yet closed.
One of the new ministers who had been preferred to a place which Mr. Ferrars might have
      filled was an Irish gentleman, and a member for one of the most considerable counties in his
      country. He was a good speaker, and the government was deficient in debating power in the
      House of Commons; he was popular and influential.
The return of a cabinet minister by a large constituency was more appreciated in the days of
      close boroughs than at present. There was a rumour that the new minister was to be opposed,
      but Zenobia laughed the rumour to scorn. As she irresistibly remarked at one of her evening
      gatherings, “Every landowner in the county is in his favour; therefore it is impossible.” The
      statistics of Zenobia were quite correct, yet the result was different from what she
      anticipated. An Irish lawyer, a professional agitator, himself a Roman Catholic and therefore
      ineligible, announced himself as a candidate in opposition to the new minister, and on the day
      of election, thirty thousand peasants, setting at defiance all the landowners of the county,
      returned O’Connell at the head of the poll, and placed among not the least memorable of
      historical events—the Clare election.
This event did not, however, occur until the end of the year 1828, for the state of the law
      then prevented the writ from being moved until that time, and during the whole of that year
      the Ferrars family had pursued a course of unflagging display. Courage, expenditure, and tact
      combined, had realised almost the height of that social ambition to which Mrs. Ferrars soared.
      Even in the limited and exclusive circle which then prevailed, she began to be counted among
      the great dames. As for the twins, they seemed quite worthy of their beautiful and luxurious
      mother. Proud, wilful, and selfish, they had one redeeming quality, an intense affection for
      each other. The sister seemed to have the commanding spirit, for Endymion was calm, but if he
      were ruled by his sister, she was ever willing to be his slave, and to sacrifice every
      consideration to his caprice and his convenience.
The year 1829 was eventful, but to Ferrars more agitating than anxious. When it was first
      known that the head of the cabinet, whose colleague had been defeated at Clare, was himself
      about to propose the emancipation of the Roman Catholics, there was a thrill throughout the
      country; but after a time the success of the operation was not doubted, and was anticipated as
      a fresh proof of the irresistible fortunes of the heroic statesman. There was some popular
      discontent in the country at the proposal, but it was mainly organised and stimulated by the
      Dissenters, and that section of Churchmen who most resembled them. The High Church party, the
      descendants of the old connection which had rallied round Sacheverell, had subsided into
      formalism, and shrank from any very active co-operation with their evangelical brethren.
The English Church had no competent leaders among the clergy. The spirit that has animated
      and disturbed our latter times seemed quite dead, and no one anticipated its resurrection. The
      bishops had been selected from college dons, men profoundly ignorant of the condition and the
      wants of the country. To have edited a Greek play with second-rate success, or to have been
      the tutor of some considerable patrician, was the qualification then deemed desirable and
      sufficient for an office, which at this day is at least reserved for eloquence and energy. The
      social influence of the episcopal bench was nothing. A prelate was rarely seen in the saloons
      of Zenobia. It is since the depths of religious thought have been probed, and the influence of
      woman in the spread and sustenance of religious feeling has again been recognised, that
      fascinating and fashionable prelates have become favoured guests in the refined saloons of the
      mighty, and, while apparently indulging in the vanities of the hour, have re-established the
      influence which in old days guided a Matilda or the mother of Constantine.
The end of the year 1829, however, brought a private event of moment to the Ferrars family.
      The elder Mr. Ferrars died. The world observed at the time how deeply affected his son was at
      this event. The relations between father and son had always been commendable, but the world
      was hardly prepared for Mr. Ferrars, junior, being so entirely overwhelmed. It would seem that
      nothing but the duties of public life could have restored him to his friends, and even these
      duties he relinquished for an unusual time. The world was curious to know the amount of his
      inheritance, but the proof of the will was unusually delayed, and public events soon occurred
      which alike consigned the will and the will-maker to oblivion.
