CHAPTER XXVII
There are very few temperaments that can resist an universal and unceasing festival in a
      vast and beautiful metropolis. It is inebriating, and the most wonderful of all its accidents
      is how the population can ever calm and recur to the monotony of ordinary life. When all this
      happens, too, in a capital blessed with purple skies, where the moonlight is equal to our
      sunshine, and where half the population sleep in the open air and wish for no roof but the
      heavens, existence is a dream of phantasy and perpetual loveliness, and one is at last forced
      to believe that there is some miraculous and supernatural agency that provides the
      ever-enduring excitement and ceaseless incidents of grace and beauty.
After the great ceremony of the morrow in the cathedral, and when Myra, kneeling at the
      altar with her husband, received, under a canopy of silver brocade, the blessings of a
      cardinal and her people, day followed day with court balls and municipal banquets, state
      visits to operas, and reviews of sumptuous troops. At length the end of all this pageantry and
      enthusiasm approached, and amid a blaze of fireworks, the picturesque population of this
      fascinating city tried to return to ordinary feeling and to common sense.
If amid this graceful hubbub and this glittering riot any one could have found time to
      remark the carriage and conduct of an individual, one might have observed, and perhaps been
      surprised at, the change in those of Miss Neuchatel. That air of pensive resignation which
      distinguished her seemed to have vanished. She never wore that doleful look for which she was
      too remarkable in London saloons, and which marred a countenance favoured by nature and a form
      intended for gaiety and grace. Perhaps it was the influence of the climate, perhaps the
      excitement of the scene, perhaps some rapture with the wondrous fortunes of the friend whom
      she adored, but Adriana seemed suddenly to sympathise with everybody and to appreciate
      everything; her face was radiant, she was in every dance, and visited churches and museums,
      and palaces and galleries, with keen delight. With many charms, the intimate friend of their
      sovereign, and herself known to be noble and immensely rich, Adriana became the fashion, and a
      crowd of princes were ever watching her smiles, and sometimes offering her their sighs.
“I think you enjoy our visit more than any one of us,” said Endymion to her one day, with
      some feeling of surprise.
“Well, one cannot mope for ever,” said Miss Neuchatel; “I have passed my life in thinking of
      one subject, and I feel now it made me very stupid.”
Endymion felt embarrassed, and, though generally ready, had no repartee at command. Lord
      Waldershare, however, came to his relief, and claimed Adriana for the impending dance.
This wondrous marriage was a grand subject for “our own correspondents,” and they abounded.
      Among them were Jawett and St. Barbe. St. Barbe hated Jawett, as indeed he did all his
      brethren, but his appointment in this instance he denounced as an infamous job. “Merely to
      allow him to travel in foreign parts, which he has never done, without a single qualification
      for the office! However, it will ruin his paper, that is some consolation. Fancy sending here
      a man who has never used his pen except about those dismal statistics, and what he calls first
      principles! I hate his style, so neat and frigid. No colour, sir. I hate his short sentences,
      like a dog barking; we want a word-painter here, sir. My description of the wedding sold one
      hundred and fifty thousand, and it is selling now. If the proprietors were gentlemen, they
      would have sent me an unlimited credit, instead of their paltry fifty pounds a day and my
      expenses; but you never meet a liberal man now,—no such animal known. What I want you to do
      for me, Lord Waldershare, is to get me invited to the Villa Aurea when the court moves there.
      It will be private life there, and that is the article the British public want now. They are
      satiated with ceremonies and festivals. They want to know what the royal pair have for dinner
      when they are alone, how they pass their evenings, and whether the queen drives ponies.”
“So far as I am concerned,” said Waldershare, “they shall remain state secrets.”
“I have received no special favours here,” rejoined St. Barbe, “though, with my claims, I
      might have counted on the uttermost. However, it is always so. I must depend on my own
      resources. I have a retainer, I can tell you, my lord, from the ‘Rigdum Funidos,’ in my
      pocket, and it is in my power to keep up such a crackling of jokes and sarcasms that a very
      different view would soon be entertained in Europe of what is going on here than is now the
      fashion. The ‘Rigdum Funidos’ is on the breakfast-table of all England, and sells thousands in
      every capital of the world. You do not appreciate its power; you will now feel it.”
“I also am a subscriber to the ‘Rigdum Funidos,’” said Waldershare, “and tell you frankly,
      Mr. St. Barbe, that if I see in its columns the slightest allusion to any persons or incident
      in this country, I will take care that you be instantly consigned to the galleys; and, this
      being a liberal government, I can do that without even the ceremony of a primary inquiry.”
“You do not mean that?” said St. Barbe; “of course, I was only jesting. It is not likely
      that I should say or do anything disagreeable to those whom I look upon as my patrons—I may
      say friends—through life. It makes me almost weep when I remember my early connection with Mr.
      Ferrars, now an under-secretary of state, and who will mount higher. I never had a chance of
      being a minister, though I suppose I am not more incapable than others who get the silver
      spoon into their mouths. And then his divine sister! Quite an heroic character! I never had a
      sister, and so I never had even a chance of being nearly related to royalty. But so it has
      been throughout my life. No luck, my lord; no luck. And then they say one is misanthropical.
      Hang it! who can help being misanthropical when he finds everybody getting on in life except
      himself?”
The court moved to their favourite summer residence, a Palladian palace on a blue lake, its
      banks clothed with forests abounding with every species of game, and beyond them loftier
      mountains. The king was devoted to sport, and Endymion was always among his companions.
      Waldershare rather attached himself to the ladies, who made gay parties floating in gondolas,
      and refreshed themselves with picnics in sylvan retreats. It was supposed Lord Waldershare was
      a great admirer of the Princess of Montserrat, who in return referred to him as that “lovable
      eccentricity.” As the autumn advanced, parties of guests of high distinction, carefully
      arranged, periodically arrived. Now, there was more ceremony, and every evening the circle was
      formed, while the king and queen exchanged words, and sometimes ideas, with those who were so
      fortunate as to be under their roof. Frequently there were dramatic performances, and
      sometimes a dance. The Princess of Montserrat was invaluable in these scenes; vivacious,
      imaginative, a consummate mimic, her countenance, though not beautiful, was full of charm.
      What was strange, Adriana took a great fancy to her Highness, and they were seldom separated.
      The only cloud for Endymion in this happy life was, that every day the necessity of his return
      to England was more urgent, and every day the days vanished more quickly. That return to
      England, once counted by weeks, would soon be counted by hours. He had conferred once or twice
      with Waldershare on the subject, who always turned the conversation; at last Endymion reminded
      him that the time of his departure was at hand, and that, originally, it had been agreed they
      should return together.
“Yes, my dear Ferrars, we did so agree, but the agreement was permissive, not compulsory. My
      views are changed. Perhaps I shall never return to England again; I think of being naturalised
      here.”
The queen was depressed at the prospect of being separated from her brother. Sometimes she
      remonstrated with him for his devotion to sport which deprived her of his society; frequently
      in a morning she sent for him to her boudoir, that they might talk together as in old times.
      “The king has invited Lord and Lady Beaumaris to pay us a visit, and they are coming at once.
      I had hoped the dear Hainaults might have visited us here. I think she would have liked it.
      However, they will certainly pass the winter with us. It is some consolation to me not to lose
      Adriana.”
“The greatest,” said Endymion, “and she seems so happy here. She seems quite changed.”
“I hope she is happier,” said the queen, “but I trust she is not changed. I think her nearly
      perfection. So pure, even so exalted a mind, joined with so sweet a temper, I have never met.
      And she is very much admired too, I can tell you. The Prince of Arragon would be on his knees
      to her to-morrow, if she would only give a single smile. But she smiles enough with the
      Princess of Montserrat. I heard her the other day absolutely in uncontrollable laughter. That
      is a strange friendship; it amuses me.”
“The princess has immense resource.”
The queen suddenly rose from her seat; her countenance was disturbed.
“Why do we talk of her, or of any other trifler of the court, when there hangs over us so
      great a sorrow, Endymion, as our separation? Endymion, my best beloved,” and she threw her
      arms round his neck, “my heart! my life! Is it possible that you can leave me, and so
      miserable as I am?”
“Miserable!”
“Yes! miserable when I think of your position—and even my own. Mine own has risen like a
      palace in a dream, and may vanish like one. But that would not be a calamity if you were safe.
      If I quitted this world to-morrow, where would you be? It gives me sleepless nights and
      anxious days. If you really loved me as you say, you would save me this. I am haunted with the
      perpetual thought that all this glittering prosperity will vanish as it did with our father.
      God forbid that, under any circumstances, it should lead to such an end—but who knows? Fate is
      terribly stern; ironically just. O Endymion! if you really love me, your twin, half of your
      blood and life, who have laboured for you so much, and thought for you so much, and prayed for
      you so much—and yet I sometimes feel have done so little—O Endymion! my adored, my own
      Endymion, if you wish to preserve my life—if you wish me not only to live, but really to be
      happy as I ought to be and could be, but for one dark thought, help me, aid me, save me—you
      can, and by one single act.”
“One single act!”
“Yes! marry Adriana.”
“Ah!” and he sighed.
“Yes, Adriana, to whom we both of us owe everything. Were it not for Adriana, you would not
      be here, you would be nothing,” and she whispered some words which made him start, and
      alternately blush and look pale.
“Is it possible?” he exclaimed. “My sister, my beloved sister, I have tried to keep my brain
      cool in many trials. But I feel, as it were, as if life were too much for me. You counsel me
      to that which we should all repent.”
“Yes, I know it; you may for a moment think it a sacrifice, but believe me, that is all
      phantasy. I know you think your heart belongs to another. I will grant everything, willingly
      grant everything you could say of her. Yes, I admit, she is beautiful, she has many charms,
      has been to you a faithful friend, you delight in her society; such things have happened
      before to many men, to every man they say they happen, but that has not prevented them from
      being wise, and very happy too. Your present position, if you persist in it, is one most
      perilous. You have no root in the country; but for an accident you could not maintain the
      public position you have nobly gained. As for the great crowning consummation of your life,
      which we dreamed over at unhappy Hurstley, which I have sometimes dared to prophesy, that must
      be surrendered. The country at the best will look upon you only as a reputable adventurer to
      be endured, even trusted and supported, in some secondary post, but nothing more. I touch on
      this, for I see it is useless to speak of myself and my own fate and feelings; only remember,
      Endymion, I have never deceived you. I cannot endure any longer this state of affairs. When in
      a few days we part, we shall never meet again. And all the devotion of Myra will end in your
      destroying her.”
“My own, my beloved Myra, do with me what you like. If ——”
At this moment there was a gentle tap at the door, and the king entered.
“My angel,” he said, “and you too, my dear Endymion. I have some news from England which I
      fear may distress you. Lord Montfort is dead.”
