CHAPTER XIII.

"Lenore fuhr am Morgenroth
Empor aus schweren Träumen."
This is all the consolation with which she wakes next morning and exchanges the
      shadowy muddle of her discomfortable visions for the not less discomfortable reality. She had
      slept—to her own surprise—through the earlier part of the night; but in May-time day and night
      faint into each other; and though the light is broad and universal, yet the hour is a small
      one when she awakes, with that hopeless decidedness, that irrevocable bursting of the chains
      of slumber, which tells its unhappy victim that all juggling efforts to overtake the flown
       blessing will be of no avail. She lies on her uneasy bed for as long as she can
      bear it; then, since the hour is still far too early to ring for her hot water, and so make
      public an abnormal condition of mind and body, she rises, and throwing on her dressing- gown,
      sits down by the open window and watches the strides of the morning, stepping, clean and young
      and lucent, across the old and dirty earth. Even the ugly Bohemian Railway Station and the
      stucco houses come in for a portion of his kindness. How much more the little hoary garden
      plat and the dew-pearled tulips!
It has been an open question since the world began, whether the loveliness of nature
      assuages or aggravates the misery of humanity in its more miserable moods. Belinda would
      subscribe to the latter opinion. It seems to her that she could better bear the look of the
      day—that it would not make her so angry—if slant rain were slashing the earth, or if it were
      locked in a prison of frost, or wound in a shroud of snow.

The splendour of the transparent air; the trees, just lightly wagging their heads in the
      early wind; even the short-tailed starlings, cheerfully walking about while the sun touches up
      their apparently sombre feathers, and brings out little rainbow colours in them; each—each has
      a separate stab for her. There were starlings at Moritzburg; there were tulips in the inn
      garden at Lohmen: can she set her eyes upon any one common object that does not bring a memory
      with it? She has never been of a very bright or hopeful temperament with regard to her own
      future; not one of those happy young ones to whom the long life ahead seems swathed in a
      golden mist. The deep conviction of her own paucity of powers of attraction, a conviction
      which has been with her as long as she can remember anything—as long as the far-away days of
      short frocks and coming down to dessert, when strangers used to pull Sarah's long curls and
      laugh at her smart answers—a conviction that for a bright interval has been shaken, now
       settles down in its cold and humbling certainty again in her heart.
"He was not telegraphed for," she says to herself, in a tone of surpassing bitterness; "he
      had no ill news; but he was right to go. I am not of the stuff of which the women that men
      love are made! Let me try not to forget it again."
The clocks one after another, in their different voices, have just struck eight. Cramped
      with long sitting in one position, which she has forgotten to change, she rises, and is
      beginning to walk up and down the little room when a knock comes, a quick, loud, rattling
      knock, which, in its lively energy, partakes of the nature of the person who has executed it,
      and who adds to it an urgent calling:
"Belinda! Belinda! are you awake?"
Awake!—is she awake? She smiles grimly to herself.
"Yes, I am awake," she answers in an unwilling voice, that she in vain tries to make sound
      sleepy.
"Then why do not you open the door?"
       cries the voice impatiently, accompanying the question by a long and noisier
      rattling of the handle.
But Belinda takes no step towards complying. She wishes for no one's company, not even
      Sarah's—perhaps Sarah's least of all; for is not she the one person from whom she has been
      unable to hide her humiliation?
"What do you want?" she asks morosely.
"If you do not open the door at once," replies Sarah, desisting for a moment from her
      rattling, so that her voice may be the more penetratingly heard, "I warn you that I shall open
      your note and read it myself!"
Her note ! In one bound Belinda is across the room, has turned the key, and is
      palely facing her sister.
"Who was right?" cries Sarah, strutting in, dishevelled, dressing-gowned, triumphant, and
      holding in her hand a letter, which the other silently snatches. "I was so certain that he
      must have written, that I
       sent Tommy round to his lodgings the first thing this morning; and sure enough
      they unearthed this, which they had entirely forgotten, and which we ought to have received
      yesterday afternoon. Come it is not a bill this time!"
Belinda has opened the envelope, and is staring strainingly at the paper.
"How stupid!" she says, passing her hand across her eyes. "Somehow I cannot see it."
"Is it possible that this is his handwriting?" cries Sarah, coming to her aid, and examining
      with surprise the superscription. "What a shocking hand he writes!"
"Yes; it is his," says Belinda, again passing her hand across her eyes; "but it is very
      shaky. Something has happened to alter it very much. I think you must read it, please."
"There does not appear to be any beginning," replies Sarah, complying with some alacrity.
      "'I cannot come to meet you this afternoon. Oh, forgive me!'
       (Then comes a prodigious blot—mixed tears and ink, I expect.) 'I have been
      telegraphed for home.' (I told you so; then there is something scratched out; what is it?"
      looking at the paper aslant and half shutting one eye.) "'A f-r-ight-ful cat'—(what, cat? what
      is it likely to be?— catastrophe —that is it, of course; he has put long legs and
      loops to all the short letters, but I can quite make it out, in spite of that)—'a frightful
      catastrophe'— (scored through, you know). 'I do not know what I am saying. God bless you!'
      (Then more blots.)—'D. R.' That is all!"
"All!" cries Belinda, stretching out her trembling hand for the note. "Are you sure that
      there is nothing over the page?"
"Not a syllable!"
There is a silence. Belinda's eyes are riveted on the few scrawled words—so few—on which all
      her future is to be built. Among them is there one which will support the weight of a
      legitimate hope?
"It would have been more to the
       purpose," says Sarah, in a tone of wounded common sense, "if he had given us a
      hint as to what the catastrophe was, instead of wasting so much ingenuity in making all those
      unnatural legs and arms to his 'a' s' and 'c' s' and 's' s.' "
"You think that there is one really? that something has happened? that he
       was telegraphed for?" asks Belinda, appealing in wistful fever to her cool, shrewd
      junior.
"Of course he was; of course there has!" replies Sarah decidedly. "I must say," with a
      rather satirical look, "that you have a high opinion of your admirer; he ought to be flattered
      by your confidence. No! reassure yourself," striking the untidy blurred page with her
      forefinger; "anyone with pretension to be even an indifferent liar would have been ashamed of
      this."
"A catastrophe!" repeats Belinda, as though speaking to herself, and still looking at the
      note; "what sort of a catastrophe? I think—I fear—that it must in some way concern his
      father."

"Well, anyhow, the poor boy's character is cleared up," says Sarah gaily, sweeping in her
      long peignoir to the window, and standing blithely looking out at the tulips and the
      starlings—as brightly pretty as the former, as robustly cheerful as the latter. "After all, he
      has not been driven away by your unladylike warmth, as you had quite made up your mind last
      night; and as to his father, if it is he, our grief must be chastened by the thought that we
      have never set eyes upon him. Well, I suppose I must not spend the day in my dressing- gown,"
      walking to the door.
Neither must Belinda; and yet, for long after her sister has left her, she sits, still
      poring over the meagre sheet that is her first love-letter. She laughs derisively. Will it be
      her last, too? At that thought she sets herself to weary calculations. It is, without
      stopping—he will, of course, stop nowhere between Dresden and London—a thirty-six hours'
      journey. Probably five or six hours more will be occupied in getting on to Yorkshire. It is a
       four days' post from England to Dresden. Even if he write to her immediately on
      arriving—a most unlikely hypothesis—it cannot be much less than a week before she hears. There
      must be five or six absolutely void black days, that yet will have the same complement of
      hours in them as the day at Moritzburg or the day at Wesenstein. She lays her hot forehead on
      the cool wooden chair-back. Oh, if they could but be slept through!
But at this moment the entrance of her maid, with the usual paraphernalia of her toilet,
      sufficiently reminds her that they cannot. They cannot be slept through! They must be dressed
      through, talked through, eaten through, made expeditions through, joked through. Worst of all,
      his departure, its cause, his probable or improbable return, he himself, must be continually
      discussed and worn threadbare in her hearing.
This, indeed, is an evil from which she suffers for only two days. After that, he being
      gone, and never having sought to
       make himself specially acceptable to any member of the little society save one,
      he slips from their talk and their thoughts.
She is deeply thankful when their chatter about him ceases, and yet angry with them for so
      soon forgetting him. And meanwhile the days in summer procession pace stately by, full of sap
      and growth and laughter. The date of the Churchill departure is now fixed for the 5th of June;
      and as that period approaches, a freezing panic fear begins to clutch Belinda more and more
      tightly in its hold—the fear that her own going may antedate the arrival of his letter; that
      he may write to her here, and the letter not be forwarded. The many tales she has heard of
      lives dismally wrecked upon some such small accident throng her memory.
The house is full of signs of an approaching déménagement ; full of packing,
      disarranging, bustling. It is mostly full also of German officers, who, being aware that their
      time for enjoying the society and the wit of their love-worthy Sarah is all
       too quickly passing, are resolved to have nothing to reproach themselves with in
      the way of not having availed themselves of it while they were able. Some of them are not
      unwilling to extend their endearments to the elder sister, seeing her no longer monopolized by
      her surly fellow-country- man; but she has received their compliments so blankly, that,
      ashamed of their brief infidelity, they have clanked hastily back to their first love, who
      sees them go and return with the same joyous indifference.
Belinda has been innocent of the least intention to snub them, but how can one receive
      pretty speeches—any speeches intelligently, when one is continually doing a sum in one's
      head—36 and 5, 4I; I day from 4 days; 1 day from 3 days, etc.?
The packing is not of so wholly occupying a nature as to exclude incidental amusements. It
      does not even forbid a farewell excursion to Tharandt; an excursion planned by Sarah and her
      rout of
       Uhlans; with some necessary padding of a lenient chaperon, and compliant
      girls.
Belinda has believed herself equal to sharing it. Tharandt is rendered agonizing by no
      associations. She has never visited Tharandt in his company, but, at the last moment, a trifle
      robs her of her fortitude— the sight of her cobwebby Wesenstein gown, extended with
      unconscious tactless cruelty by her maid on the bed. She throws herself down, ungovernably
      sobbing, beside it. It seems like the husk of her lost happiness. By-and-by they are all gone,
      and the house is left to her and to silence. It is deserted even by the dogs, who have been
      taken out driving by Mrs. Churchill; Slutty, supinely indifferent to view and air, curled at
      the carriage-bottom, and Punch standing up on his hind-legs, with his forepaws on the
      carriage-side, like an unsteady heraldic lion.
Belinda laughs a little at the thought of him as she returns to the salon, which is
      beginning to wear a desolate look, reduced to its own lodging-house furniture and
       shorn of the graces bestowed upon it by the Churchills' Indian rugs and Turkish
      chair-backs. Its new ugliness, meeting her eye, seems' to add to the vexation of her spirit.
      The sunlight on the street vexes her too. She wanders for a while aimlessly about the room,
      and then drops as aimlessly into a chair. To an observer it would seem that she were quite
      without occupation. But it is not so. She is still at work upon that sum. She has just
      finished it, or rather she has just begun it afresh, when an unexpected interruption drives
      it, not away—nothing, alas! could do that—but into the background of her mind.
The summer afternoon is at its drowsiest, even the flies buzz inertly along the pane, when
      the room-door opens and Professor Forth looks in.
"I beg your pardon," he says formally, "but I think your page must have been misinformed; he
      tells me that Sarah is not at home."
At the sound of his voice, separated by
       how many seas and continents from her thoughts, Belinda starts to her feet;
      then, conjuring suddenly up a civil smile, says gently:
"But I am afraid he is not misinformed. I am afraid she is out. Did you expect to
      find her?"
He has entered the room now in his hard and graceless academic black, which somehow looks
      out of character with the light-coloured room and the blazing day.
"Naturally I expected to find her," he replies sharply, "since it is by her own appointment
      that I am here. After evading on various trivial pretexts every meeting proposed by me for the
      past week, she herself gave me a distinct and definitive rendezvous for this hour and day.
       I am punctual to the moment!" glancing angrily at the Dresden clock.
"I am sadly afraid that she has forgotten all about it," replies Belinda, bursting into a
      helpless laugh; but indeed there is no greater fallacy than that one may not laugh heartily,
      violently, and not hysterically,
       when one's heart is breaking; "she has gone out upon an expedition."
"She is always going out upon expeditions," retorts he snappishly.
Belinda sighs; her mirth vanished as quickly as it came. She has no energy to take up the
      cudgels for Sarah, of whose conduct no one can think worse than she does, and of whose
      meditated villainy she is guiltily aware.
"She is young," she says lamely.
"I cannot see that that is any valid apology for a systematic neglect of all the more
      serious duties of life," he replies fretfully.
He has walked to the window, where he now stands drowned in a bath of golden radiance. Never
      has he looked less lovable; ill-humour rendering yet more pinched and captious his pinched
      pedant face; and never has Belinda felt so charitably towards him. "He is not amiable; Heaven
      knows that he is not attractive," she says to herself; "so much the worse for him. But he is
      unhappy;
       what better claim could he have upon my sympathy?"
"Do you want her for anything special?" she asks not unkindly, going up and standing beside
      him in the rain of sunbeams in her large young beauty; "anything in which I can help you?"
It is obvious that the idea had never occurred to him that in her he should find either the
      ability or the willingness to aid him.
"You are very good," he answers stiffly; "the fact is, I wanted to throw together a few
      thoughts upon the Idea of Colour among the Athenians," glancing at a bundle of notes and
      papers in his hands, "and I entirely depended upon Sarah to be my secretary. She is perfectly
      aware," with a revived and extreme exasperation of tone, "of the affection in my eyes which
      precludes the possibility of my writing more than a certain number of hours a day, and which
      keeps me here in the middle of term, unavoidably absent from my post and Oxbridge."

"She is very provoking!" assents Belinda soothingly. "But as far as the writing goes, I
      write a much better hand than Sarah. She never would learn, when we were children. She was
      always playing monkey-tricks upon the master all through the lesson. Cannot I be your
      secretary?" As she speaks, she lifts to his her large serious eyes, full of a compassion that
      is none the less sincere for being slightly tinged with contempt.
"You are very good!" he repeats ceremoniously. "I am aware that I have no right to trespass
      upon your valuable time."
"There is no one else to trespass upon it," she answers, stifling a sigh. "On the contrary,
      I am obliged to anyone who will help me to get through it." As she speaks she walks towards
      the writing-table, and quickly and methodically arranging the writing materials, seats
      herself, and in a few moments is penning her first sentence from his dictation.
She has undertaken the office out of
       pure good-nature, and at first fulfils it quite mechanically. Gradually,
      however, as the meaning of the words she is writing penetrates through her ears into her
      understanding, a slight interest in the subject in hand awakens in her. She asks a question or
      two. By-and-by there comes a Greek word.
"May it be written in English letters?" she asks, glancing up. "No? Well, then I am afraid I
      must leave it for you to insert."
"You do not know the Greek character?" he asks, with a slight touch of regret in his
      tone.
She shakes her head.
"I am afraid I must ask you," smiling a little, "not to question me too closely as to what I
      know."
"I offered to teach it to Sarah," he says aggrievedly.
"And she refused, of course."
"It is not the want of knowledge," he says, beginning to pace gloomily up and down the room,
      "that is the irremediable
       evil. It is the total lack of all desire for knowledge—that is what I deplore in
      Sarah."
Belinda has paused in her writing, her elbow leant on the table, and idly brushing with the
      feather of the pen the red curve of her lips.
"I have never known an instance," continues he, still pursuing his irritated walk, "of a
      young person whose character had undergone so radical a change in so comparatively short a
      period of time."
"Do you think so?" cries Belinda, surprised. "She has always been exactly the same as long
      as I can remember her!"
"When first I made her acquaintance," he goes on, not heeding the interruption, "I of course
      became at once aware of her ignorance— that is patent; but she appeared to me to be
      not lacking in intellectual force, nor in a rather remarkable desire for self-improvement. On
      the very first evening I met her, she deplored to me the deficiency of her education, and
      asked me
       in so many words to aid her in the formation of her mind."
Belinda drops the pen. It is not a nearly large enough shield to hide the convulsive mirth
      that this revelation of her sister's hideous hypocrisy has called forth.
"I still cherish the hope," continues he, fortunately unaware of the character of his
      auditor's emotion, "that this may be only a phase; that on her return to her home and her more
      regular occupations, freer from these senseless distractions," with an exaggerated
      emphasis,"her mind may resume that soberer bias which, from my first impression of her, I
      cannot but believe to be its natural one."
Belinda, still unable to speak, contents herself with a gentle head-shake, as commentary and
      gloss upon which there comes, at the same moment, the sound of a scampering step on the stone
      stairs, of a loudly singing voice, waking to life again the dead dumb house. In a moment the
      door flies open, and the person whose mind is
       expected so soon to resume its soberer bias stands before them, her hat a good
      deal on one side, from the weight of the flowering may-bough stuck rakishly in it— the
      may-bough whose strong and almost pungent perfume comes rushing into the room with her.
"Are not you delighted to welcome me back so unexpectedly early?" cries she joyously. "But
      it was so hot, and my soldiers were all so cross and low at the prospect of losing me, and Von
      Breiden-bach had a toothache, and so—Mr. Forth!" suddenly catching sight of him. "Ah!" with an
      abrupt change and refrigeration of tone, "of course you came about that essay of yours; and,
      equally of course, I forgot all about it. Well, I dare say there is no great hurry! Happily,
      the Greeks will keep; they will not run away."
There is an ominous silence. Then—
"It is unfortunate, "begins the Professor, in a voice trembling with indignation, while the
      puckers of anger that Belinda's mild hand has been smoothing away, again
       form their network over his face, "that, considering the position in which we
      stand relatively to each other, our views of life and its significance should be so
      diametrically—"
Belinda leaves the room.
