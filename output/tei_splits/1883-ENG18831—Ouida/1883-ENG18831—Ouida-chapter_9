CHAPTER V.
THAT long dry summer was followed by an autumn of drought and scarcity.
The prayers of the priests and peoples failed to bring down rain. The wooden Christs gazed
      all day long on parching lands and panting cattle. Even the broad deep rivers shrank and left
      their banks to bake and stink in the long drought.
The orchards sickened for lack of moisture, and the peasants went about with feverish faces,
      ague‐stricken limbs, and trembling hearts. The corn yielded ill in the hard scorched ground,
      and when the winter came it was a time of dire scarcity and distress.
Claudis Flamma and a few others like him alone prospered.
The mill‐house at Yprès served many purposes. It was a granary, a market, a baker’s shop, an
      usurer’s den, all in one.
It looked a simple and innocent place. In the summer time it was peaceful and lovely, green
      and dark and still, with the blue sky above it, and the songs of birds all around; with its
      old black timbers, and its many‐coloured orchards, and its pretty leafy gardens, and its grey
      walls
       washed by the hurrying stream. But in the winter it was
      very dreary, utterly lonely. The water roared, and the leafless trees groaned in the wind, and
      the great leaden clouds of rain or fog enveloped it duskily.
To the starving, wet, and woe‐begone peasants who would go to it with aching bones and
      aching hearts, it seemed desolate and terrible. They dreaded with a great dread the sharp
      voice of its master—the hardest and the shrewdest and the closest fisted Norman of them
      all.
For they were most of them his debtors, and so were in a bitter subjugation to him, and had
      to pay those debts as best they might with their labour or their suffering; with the best of
      all their wool, or oil, or fruit; often with the last bit of silver that had been an heirloom
      for five centuries, or with the last bit of money buried away in an old pitcher under their
      apple tree to be the nest egg of their little pet daughter’s dowry.
And yet Claudis Flamma was respected among them; for he could outwit them, and was believed
      to be very wealthy, and was a man who stood well with the good saints and with holy Church:—a
      wise man, in a word, with whom these northern folks had the kinship of mutual industry and
      avarice.
For the most part the population around Yprès was thrifty and thriving in a cautious,
      patient, certain way of well‐doing; and, by this portion of it, the silent old miser was much
      honoured as man laborious and penurious, who chose to live on a leek and a rye loaf, but who
      must have, it was well known, put by large gains in the thatch of his roof or under the bricks
      of his kitchen.
By the smaller section of it—poor, unthrifty, loose‐handed fools—who belied the province of
      their birth so far as to be quick to spend and slow to save, and who therefore fell into want
      and famine and had to borrow of others their children’s bread, the old miller was hated with a
      hate deeper and stronger because forced to be mute, and to submit, to cringe, and to be trod
      upon, in the miserable servitude of the hopeless debtor.
In the hard winter which followed on that sickly autumn these and their like fell farther in
      the mire of poverty than ever, and had to come and beg of Flamma loans of the commonest
      necessaries of their bare living. They knew
       that they would have to pay a hundredfold in horrible
      extortion when the spring and summer should bring them work, and give them fruit on their
      trees and crops on their little fields; but they could do no better.
It had been for many years the custom to go to Flamma in such need; and being never quit of
      his hold, his debtors never could try for aid elsewhere.
The weather towards the season of Noel became frightfully severe; the mill stream never
      stopped, but all around it was frozen, and the swamped pastures were sheets of ice. The birds
      died by thousands in the open country, and several of the sheep perished in snow storms on the
      higher lands.
There was dire want in many of the hovels and homesteads, and the bare harvests of a
      district, usually so opulent in the riches of the soil, brought trouble and dearth in their
      train.
Sickness prevailed because the old people and the children in their hunger ate berries and
      roots unfit for human food; the waters swelled, the ice melted, and many homes were flooded,
      and some even swept away.
Old Pitchou and Claudis Flamma alone were content; the mill wheel never stopped work, and
      famine prices could be asked for in this extremity.
Folle‐Farine worked all that winter, day after day, month after month, with scarcely a word
      being spoken to her, or scarcely an hour being left her that she could claim as her own.
She looked against the snow as strangely as a scarlet rose blossoming in frost there could
      have done; but the people that came to and fro, even the young men amongst them, were too used
      to that dark vivid silent face of hers, and those lithe brown limbs that had the supple play
      and the golden glow of the East in them, to notice them as any loveliness; and if they did
      note them on some rare time, thought of them only as the marks of a vagrant and accursed
      race.
She was so unlike to themselves that the northern peasantry never dreamed of seeing beauty
      in her; they turned their heads away when she went by, striding after her mule or bearing her
      pitcher from the well with the free and vigorous grace of a mountain or desert‐born
      creature.

The sheepskin girt about her loins, the red kerchief knotted to her head, the loose lithe
      movements of her beautiful limbs, the sullen fire and fierce dreams in her musing eyes,—all
      these were so unlike themselves that they saw nothing in them except what was awful or
      unlovely.
Half the winter went by without a kind word to her from any one except such as in that time
      of suffering and scarcity Marcellin spoke to her. So had every winter gone since she had come
      there—a time so long ago that the memory of Phratos had become so dim to her that she often
      doubted if he also were not a mere shadow of a dream like all the rest.
Half the winter she fared hardly and ate sparingly, and did the work of the mule and the
      bullocks: indifferent and knowing no better, and only staring at the stars when they throbbed
      in the black skies on a frosty night, and wondering if she would ever go to them, or if they
      would ever come to her—those splendid and familiar yet unknown things that looked on all the
      misery of the earth, and shone on tranquilly and did not seem to care.
Time came close on to the new year, and the distress and the cold were together at their
      height. The weather was terrible; and the poor suffered immeasurably.
A score of times a‐day she heard them ask bread at the mill, and a score of time saw them
      given a stone; she saw them come in the raw fog, pinched and shivering, and sick with ague,
      and she saw her grandsire deny them with a grating sarcasm or two, or take from them fifty
      times its value for some niggard grant of food.
“Why should I think of it, why should I care?” she said to herself; and yet she did both,
      and could not help it.
There was among the sufferers one old and poor, who lived not far from the mill, by name
      Manon Dax.
She was a little old hardy brown woman, shrivelled and bent, yet strong, with bright eyes
      like a robin’s, and a tough frame, eighty years old.
She had been southern born, and the wife of a stone cutter; he had been dead fifty years,
      and she had seen all her sons and daughters and their offspring die too; and had now, left on
      her hand to rear, four young great‐grandchildren, almost infants, who were always crying to
      her for food as new‐born birds cry in their nests.

She washed a little, when she could get any linen to wash, and she span, and she picked up
      the acorns and the nuts, and she tilled a small plot of ground that belonged to her hut, and
      she grew cabbages and potatoes and herbs on it, and so kept a roof over her head, and fed her
      four nestlings, and trotted to and fro in her wooden shoes all day long, and worked in hail
      and rain, in drought and tempest, and never complained, but said that God was good to her.
She was anxious about the children, knowing she could not live long—that was all. But then
      she felt sure that the Mother of God would take care of them, and so was cheerful; and did
      what the day brought her to do, and was content.
Now on Manon Dax, as on thousands of others, the unusual severity of the winter fell like a
      knife.
She was only one amongst thousands. Nobody noticed her; still it was hard.
All the springs near her dwelling were frozen for many weeks; there was no well nearer than
      half a league; and half a league out and half a league back every other day over ground sharp
      and slippery with ice, with two heavy pails to carry, is not a little when one is over eighty,
      and has only a wisp of woollen serge between the wind and one’s withered limbs.
The acorns and horse‐chestnuts had all been disputed with her fiercely by boys rough and
      swift, who foresaw a time coming in which their pigs would be ill‐fed. The roots in her little
      garden plot were all black and killed by the cold. The nettles had been all gathered and
      stewed and eaten.
The snow drove in through a big hole in her roof. The woods were ransacked for every bramble
      and broken bough by reivers younger and more agile than herself; she had nothing to eat,
      nothing to burn.
The children lay in their little beds of hay and cried all day long for food, and she had
      none to give them.
“If it were only myself!” she thought, stopping her ears not to hear them; if it had been
      only herself it would have been so easy to creep away into the corner among the dry grass, and
      to lie still till the cold froze the pains of hunger and made them quiet; and to feel numb and
      tired,
       and yet glad that it was all over, and to murmur that God
      was good, and so to let death come—content.
But it was not only herself.
The poor are seldom so fortunate—they themselves would say so unhappy—as to be alone in
      their homes.
There were the four small lives left to her by the poor dead foolish things she had
      loved,—small lives that had been rosy even on so much hunger, and blithe even amidst so much
      cold; that had been mirthful even at the flooding of the snowdrift, and happy even over a meal
      of mouldy crusts, or of hips and haws from the hedges. Had been—until now, when even so much
      as this could not be got, and when their beds of hay were soaked through with snow‐water;
      now—when they were quite silent, except when they sobbed out a cry for bread.
“I am eighty‐two years old, and I have never since I was born asked man or woman for help,
      or owed man or woman a copper coin,” she thought, sitting by her black hearth, across which
      the howling wind drove, and stopping her ears to shut out the children’s cries.
She had often known severe winters, scanty food, bitter living,—she had scores of times in
      her long years been as famished as this, and as cold, and her house had been as desolate.
Yet she had borne it all and never asked for an alms, being strong and ignorant, and being
      also in fear of the world, and holding a debt a great shame.
But now she knew that she must do it, or let those children perish; being herself old and
      past work, and having seen all her sons die out in their strength before her.
The struggle was long and hard with her.
She would have to die soon, she knew, and she had striven all her lifetime so to live that
      she might die saying, “I have asked nothing of any man.”
This perhaps, she thought sadly, had been only a pride after all; a feeling foolish and
      wicked, that the good God sought now to chasten.
Any way she knew that she must yield it up and go and ask for something; or else those four
      small things, that were like a cluster of red berries on a leafless tree, must suffer and must
      perish.

“It is bitter, but I must do it,” she thought. “Sure it is strange that the good God cares
      to take any of us to himself through so sharp a way as hunger. It seems, if I saw His face
      now, I should say, ‘Not heaven for me, Monseigneur: only bread and a little wood.’”
And she rose up on her bent stiff limbs, and went to the pile of hay on which the children
      were lying, pale and thin, but trying to smile, all of them, because they saw the tears on her
      cheeks.
“Be still, my treasures,” she said to them, striving to speak cheerily, and laying her hands
      on the curls of the eldest born; “I go away for a little while to try and get you food. Be
      good, Bernardou, and take care of them till I come back.”
Bernardou promised, being four years old himself; and she crept out of the little black door
      of the hut into the white road and the rushing winds.
“I will go to Flamma,” she said to herself.
It was three in the afternoon, nearly dark at the season of midwinter. The business of the
      day was done.
The people had come and gone, favoured or denied, according to such sureties as they could
      offer.
The great wheel worked on in the seething water; the master of the mill sat against the
      casement to catch the falling light, adding up the sums in his ledger—crooked little signs
      such as he had taught himself to understand, though he could form neither numerals nor letters
      with his pen.
All around him in the storehouses there were corn, wood, wool, stores of every sort of food.
      All around him, in the room he lived in, there were hung the salt meats, the sweet herbs, and
      the dried fruits, that he had saved from the profusion of other and healthier years. It
      pleased him to know that he held all that, and also withheld it.
It moved him with a certain saturnine glee to see the hungry wistful eyes of the peasants
      stare longingly at all those riches, whilst their white lips faltered out an entreaty—which he
      denied. It was what he liked; to sit there and count his gains after his fashion, and look at
      his stores and listen to the howling wind and driving hail, and to chuckle to think how lean
      and cold and sick they were outside—those fools who had mocked him because his saint had been
      a gipsy’s leman.

To be prayed to for bread, and give the stone of a bitter denial; to be implored with tears
      of supplication, and to answer with a grim jest; to see a woman come with children dying for
      food, and to point out to her the big brass pans full of milk, and say to her, “All that makes
      butter for Paris,” and then to see her go away wailing and moaning that her child would die,
      and tottering feebly through the snow—all this was sweet to him.
Before his daughter had gone from him, he had been, though a hard man, yet honest, and had
      been, though severe, not cruel; but since he had been aware of the shame of the creature whom
      he had believed in as an angel, every fibre in him had been embittered and salted sharp with
      the poignancy of an acrid hate towards all living things. To hurt and to wound, and to see
      what he thus struck bleed and suffer, was the only pleasure life had left for him. He had all
      his manhood walked justly, according to his light, and trusted in the God to whom he prayed;
      and his God and his trust had denied and betrayed him, and his heart had turned to gall.
The old woman toiled slowly through the roads which lay between her hut and the
      water‐mill.
They were roads which passed through meadows and along corn‐fields, beside streamlets, and
      amongst little belts of woodland, lanes and paths green and pleasant in the summer, but now a
      slough of frozen mud, and whistled through by north‐east winds. She held on her way steadily,
      stumbling often, and often slipping and going slowly, for she was very feeble from long lack
      of food, and the intensity of the cold drove through and through her frame.
Still she held on, bravely, in the teeth of the rough winds and of the coming darkness,
      though the weather was so wild that the poplar trees were bent to the earth, and the little
      light in the Calvary lamp by the river blew to and fro, and at last died out. Still she held
      on, a little dark tottering figure, with a prayer on her lips and a hope in her heart.
The snow was falling, the clouds were driving, the waters were roaring in the twilight: she
      was only a little black speck in the vast grey waste of the earth and the sky, and the furious
      air tossed her at times to and fro like a withered leaf. But she would not let it beat her;
      she groped her
       way with infinite difficulty, grasping a bough for
      strength, or waiting under a tree for breath a moment, and thus at last reached the
      mill‐house.
Such light as there was left showed her the kitchen within, the stores of wood, the strings
      of food; it looked to her as it had looked to Phratos, a place of comfort and of plenty; a
      strong safe shelter from the inclement night.
She lifted the latch and crept in, and went straight to Claudis Flamma, who was still busy
      beneath the window with those rude signs which represented to him his earthly wealth.
She stood before him white from the falling snow, with her brown face working with a strong
      emotion, her eyes clear and honest, and full of an intense anxiety of appeal.
“Flamma,” she said simply to him, “we have been neighbours fifty years and more—thou and I,
      and many have borrowed of thee to their hurt and shame, but I never. I am eighty‐two, and I
      never in my days asked anything of man or woman or child. But I come to‐night to ask bread of
      you,—bread for the four little children at home. I have heard them cry three days, and have
      had nothing to give them save a berry or two off the trees. I cannot bear it any more. So I
      have come to you.”
He shut his ledger, and looked at her. They had been neighbours, as she had said, half a
      century and more; and had often knelt down before the same altar, side by side.
“What dost want?” he asked simply.
“Food,” she made answer; “food and fuel. They are so cold—the little ones.”
“What canst pay for them?” he asked.
“Nothing—nothing now. There is not a thing in the house except the last hay the children
      sleep on. But if thou wilt let me have a little—just a little—while the weather is so hard, I
      will find means to pay when the weather breaks. There is my garden; and I can wash and spin. I
      will pay faithfully. Thou knowest I never owed a brass coin to any man. But I am so old, and
      the children are so young—”
Claudis Flamma got up and walked to the other side of the kitchen. Her eyes followed him
      with wistful, hungry longing.
Where he went there stood pans of new milk, baskets of
       eggs, rolls of bread, piles of faggots. Her feeble heart
      beat thickly with eager hope, her dim eyes glowed with pleasure and with thankfulness.
He came back and brought to her a few sharp rods, plucked from a thorn tree.
“Give these to thy children’s children,” he said, with a dark smile. “For these—and for no
      more—will they recompense thee when they shall grow to maturity.”
She looked at him startled and disquieted, yet thinking that he meant but a stern jest.
“Good Flamma, you mock me,” she murmured, trembling; “the babes are little and good. Ah,
      give me food quickly, for God’s sake! A jest is well in season, but to an empty body and a
      bitter heart it is like a stripe.”
He smiled, and answered her in this harsh grating voice,
“I give thee the only thing given without payment in this world—advice. Take it or leave
      it.”
She reeled a little as if he had struck her a blow with his fist, and her face changed
      terribly, whilst her eyes stared without light or sense in them.
“You jest, Flamma! You only jest!” she muttered. “The little children starve, I tell you.
      You will give me bread for them? Just a little bread? I will pay as soon as the weather
      breaks.”
“I can give nothing. I am poor, very poor,” he answered her, with the habitual lie of the
      miser; and he opened his ledger again, and went on counting up the dots and crosses by which
      he kept his books.
His servant Pitchou sat spinning by the hearth: she did not cease her work, nor intercede by
      a word.
The poor can be better to the poor than any princes; but the poor can also be more cruel to
      the poor than any slave drivers.
The old woman’s head dropped on her breast, she turned feebly, and felt her way, as though
      she were blind, out of the house and into the air.
It was already dark with the darkness of descending night.
The snow was falling fast. Her hope was gone: all was cold—cold as death.
She shivered and gasped, and strove to totter on: the children were alone. The winds blew
      and drove the snow
       flakes in a white cloud against her face; the bending trees
      creaked and groaned as though in pain; the roar of the mill‐water filled the air.
There was now no light: the day was gone, and the moon was hidden; beneath her feet the
      frozen earth cracked and slipped and gave way.
She fell down; being so old and so weakly she could not rise again, but lay still with one
      limb broken under her, and the winds and the storm beating together upon her.
“The children! the children!” she moaned feebly, and then was still: she was so cold, and
      the snow fell so fast; she could not lift herself nor see what was around her; she thought
      that she was in her bed at home, and felt as though she would soon sleep.
Through the dense gloom around her there came a swiftly moving shape, that flew as silently
      and as quickly as a night bird, and paused as though on wings beside her.
A voice that was at one timid and fierce, tender and savage, spoke to her through the clouds
      of driven snow spray.
“Hush, it is I! I—Folle‐Farine. I have brought you my food. It is not much—they never give
      me much. Still it will help a little. I heard what you said—I was in the loft. Flamma must not
      know; he might make you pay. But it is all mine, truly mine, take it.”
“Food—for the children!”
The blessed word aroused her from her lethargy; she raised herself a little on one arm, and
      tried to see whence the voice came that spoke to her. But the effort exhausted her; she fell
      again to the ground with a groan—her limb was broken.
Folle‐Farine stood above her; her dark eyes gleaming like a hawk’s through the gloom, and
      full of a curious, startled pity.
“You cannot get up; you are old,” she said, abruptly. “See—let me carry you home. The
      children! yes, the children can have it. It is not much; but it will serve.”
She spoke hastily and roughly; she was ashamed of her own compassion. What was it to her,
      whether any of these people lived or died? They had always mocked and hated her.
“If I did right, I should let them rot, and spit on their
       corpses,” she thought, with the ferocity of vengeance that
      ran in her oriental blood.
Yet she had come out in the storm, and had brought away her food for strangers, though she
      had been at work all day long, and was chilled to the bone, and was devoured with a ravenous
      hunger.
Why did she do it?
She did not know. She scorned herself. But she was sorry for this woman, so poor and brave,
      with her eighty‐two years, and so bitterly denied in her extremity.
Manon Dax dimly caught the muttered words, and feebly strove to answer them, whilst the
      winds roared and the snow beat upon her fallen body.
“I cannot rise,” she murmured; “my leg is broken, I think. But it is no matter. Go you to
      the little ones; whoever you are, you are good, and have pity. Go to them, go. It is no matter
      for me. I have lived my life—any way. It will soon be over. I am not in pain—indeed.”
Folle‐Farine stood in silence a moment, then she stooped and lifted the old creature in her
      strong young arms, and with that heavy burden set out on her way in the teeth of the
      storm.
She had known the woman, and the little ones, by sight and name long and well.
Once or twice when she had passed by them, the grandam, tender of heart, but narrow of
      brain, and believing all the tales of her neighbours, had drawn the children closer to her,
      under the wing of her serge cloak, lest the evil eye that had bewitched the tanner’s youngest
      born, should fall on them, and harm them in like manner.
Nevertheless the evil eyes gleamed on her with a wistful sorrow, as Folle‐Farine bore her
      with easy strength and a sure step, through the frozen woodland ways, as she would have borne
      the load of wood, or the sack of corn, which she was so well used to carry to and fro like a
      packhorse.
Manon Dax did not stir, she did not even strive to speak again; she was vaguely sensible of
      a slow, buoyant, painless movement, of a close soft pressure that sheltered her from the force
      of the winds, of a subtle warmth that stole through her emaciated aching frame, and made her
      drowsy and forgetful, and content to be still.

She could do no more. Her day for struggle and for work was done.
Once she moved a little. Her bearer paused and stopped and listened.
“Did you speak?”
Manon Dax gave a soft troubled sigh.
“God is good,” she muttered, like one speaking in a dream.
Folle‐Farine held on her way, as before her Phratos had once held on his; fiercely blown,
      blinded by the snow, pierced by the blasts of the hurricane, but sure of foot on the ice as a
      reindeer, and sure of eye in the dark as a night‐hawk.
“Are you in pain?” she asked once of the burden she carried.
There was no answer.
“She is asleep,” she thought; and went onward.
The distance of the road was nothing to her, fleet and firm of step, and inured to all
      hardships of the weather; yet it cost her an hour to travel it, heavily weighted as she was,
      soaked with snow‐water, blown back continually by the opposing winds, and forced to stagger
      and to pause by the fury of the storm.
At last she reached the hut.
The wind had driven open the door. The wailing cries of the children echoed sorrowfully on
      the stillness, answered by the bleating of sheep, cold and hungry in their distant folds. The
      snow had drifted in unchecked; all was quite dark.
She felt her way within over the heaps of the snow, and being used by long custom to see in
      the gloom, as the night‐haunting beasts and birds can see, she found the bed of hay, and laid
      her burden gently down on it.
The children ceased their wailing; the two eldest ones crept up close to their grandmother;
      and pressed their cheeks to hers, and whispered to her eagerly, with their little famished
      lips:
“Where is the food, where is the food?”
But there was still no answer.
The clouds drifted a little from the moon which had been so long obscured; it shone for a
      moment through the vapour of the heavy sky; the whitened ground threw back the rays
       increased tenfold; the pale gleam reached the old still
      face of Manon Dax.
There was a feeble smile upon it—the smile with which her last words had been spoken in the
      darkness; “God is good!”
She was quite dead.
