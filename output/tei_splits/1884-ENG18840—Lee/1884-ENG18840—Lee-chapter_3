CHAPTER III.
WHEN breakfast was over, and she had made the children fold up their napkins, the
      nurse took what remained of figs, bread, and milk to lock up in the kitchen. Mildred, the
      eldest of the little Perrys, sidled up to Hamlin, as he stood on the doorstep leading into the
      vineyard, lighting a cigarette, and asked whether he would not like to see her garden.
Hamlin looked down upon the innocent‐looking little fiend with a sort of disgust and
      contempt. “Thank you,” he said; “gardens aren’t much in my line.”
The little thing scowled at this rebuff of her fascinations. But a sudden thought struck
      Hamlin. “Yes, by the way,” he said, “I do take an interest in gardens sometimes. Come and show
      me yours.”

Mildred slipped her arm through his—a long‐legged, fair‐haired, pre‐Raphaelite child, in
      much‐darned stockings and patched pinafore—Winnie, the second, a rounder, more comfortable,
      cherubic beauty, seized his hand. He let himself be led along, among the prattle of the little
      one and the assumed shyness of the elder, through the vineyard, where the tall, red‐tipped
      sorghum brooms stood among the trailing pumpkins and the tufts of fennel, to a small grove
      behind the house, in whose shade were four little raked‐up spaces, with drooping marigolds and
      zinnias stuck into the earth, and small box sprigs.
“This is my garden!” cried Winnie, dragging him along, and pointing to the melancholy little
      patch. “I have marigolds, and sunflowers, and red beans and potatoes.”
“And this is mine,” said Mildred, raising her big blue eyes. “I call it the garden of
      Acrasia; because mamma told us once about Sir Guyon—”
“Won’t you give us anything to buy seeds
       with; we want tomato seeds,” clamoured Winnie.
“Hush, Winnie! I wonder you’re not ashamed!” cried Mildred.
“They are very good sort of gardens,” said Hamlin, fishing in his waistcoat for loose
      silver, while the children looked at him with beaming eyes; “here—I hope your tomatoes may
      prosper and prove eatable.”
Then he suddenly turned to Mildred. “Come here,” he ordered, “I want to speak to you ;” and
      he sat down on a stone bench under a plane‐tree, in which the cicala was sawing away with all
      his might.
Mildred stood in front of him, wondering, half hoping for the usual request that she should
      sit for an angel or a fairy.
“Look here,” said Hamlin, quietly; “I want to know how you would feel if your papa had been
      in the habit of drinking too much acquavite, and had shot
      himself after trying to murder your mamma, and some nasty little girl blurted it all out at
      breakfast to a perfect stranger?”

The child flushed with surprise and anger; she looked as if she would have scratched
      Hamlin’s eyes out. But he looked steadily in her face, and he was a stranger, a gentleman, a
      man, and not her papa; circumstances which entirely overawed her. She recovered her composure
      marvellously, and answered after a moment’s reflection, “My papa is a gentleman, and Annina’s
      papa was a common man —a mascalzone,”—with considerable
      triumph at her dignified argument.
“Your papa is a gentleman,” replied Hamlin, sternly; “I have known him long
      before you were born. But remember, if you say cruel things which hurt people’s feelings,
      whether they be gentle people or servants, however much your papa may be a gentleman,
       you won’t be a lady.”
And Hamlin left the little Perrys to muse upon this moral truth. He felt quite excited; and
      when the excitement had subsided, he felt quite astonished at himself. He could scarcely
      realise that he himself had actually been
       meddling in other people’s affairs, had been reading a
      lesson to other people’s children, all about a little girl saying offensive things to her
      nurse. It was so strange that it quite humiliated him: he had first pushed his company on to a
      nursemaid, and then, unasked, fought the nursemaid’s battle. This confounded Perry household!
      Was it going to turn him also into a ridiculous caricature? He went up‐stairs and wrote some
      business letters, and corrected a lot of proof of his new book. Then he thought it would be
      pleasanter to correct the remainder in the garden; so he brought down his writing‐case, and
      established himself on the grass behind the house. The first‐floor balcony and the roof
      projected a deep shade; and on the high grass flickered shadows of plane‐trees and laurels, as
      through their branches there flickered the pale‐blue sky. The swifts flew round the eaves with
      sharp noise, the cicalas sawed in the trees; all was profoundly peaceable. But suddenly, from
      the first‐floor windows came a vague sound of
       childish sobbing, a confused murmur as if of consolation.
      Then a pause, after which a well‐known voice arose shrill in glib Italian.
“Annina, how dare you distress the signorina Mildred? How dare you say cruel things to my
      poor, poor sensitive child?”
“I have said nothing cruel to the signorina Mildred,” answered a deep, quiet voice; “the
      signorina Mildred went to show her garden to Mr Hamlin, and then came back crying. I asked her
      what had happened, but she refused to tell me. I have nothing to do with her tears.”
“How dare you tell such an untruth?” shrieked Mrs Perry. “The signorina Mildred said
      something about your father at breakfast, and you, like a little viper, turned round upon the
      poor little darling. She is nearly in hysterics! You little serpent!”
“It is one of Miss Mildred’s usual lies,” answered the other voice calmly—“una delle solite
      bugíe.”
Hamlin had been admitted too much into
       confidence. He took up his writing things hastily, and
      removed to the furthest end of the garden, out of reach of the dispute.
This was the pretty result of his interference! He had merely got this poor devil of a
      nursemaid into a scrape. It was the fit punishment for his folly in going out of his way to
      meddle with other folk. He was very much annoyed; he had been dragged into a sordid woman’s
      squabble; Mrs Perry’s scolding had seemed addressed to him. At the same time, he did feel
      indignant that the girl should be treated in this fashion: such a splendid, queenly creature
      slanged by a sentimental, æsthetic fishwife, as he defined his hostess to himself.
The return of Melton Perry interrupted his reflections. Perry was quite astonished to find
      him up, and extremely distressed at his having had no regular breakfast.
“You see,” he said, “Mrs Perry is very delicate—in short, scarcely fit for any kind of
      household bother,—so that—”

“Oh,” answered Hamlin, “I had a capital breakfast with your children.”
Then they fell to talking of old times; and little by little there emerged from out of the
      overworked, henpecked Melton Perry of the present, the resemblance of the proud and brilliant
      Melton Perry of the past.
“Of course,” said Perry, as they sat smoking in the sheltered studio—“of course I’m very
      happy, and that sort of thing. My wife—well, she’s a little impetuous, and I don’t always
      agree about her way of bringing up the children—but there’s no saying that she isn’t an
      immensely superior kind of woman. I don’t always agree with her, mind you; but she has the
      true poetic temperament, and”—here he made an evident effort—“she keeps me up to the mark with
      my work. I was always a lazy hound, you know, and all that. In short, I know I’m quite a
      singularly fortunate man. Nevertheless,—well, I tell you my frank opinion about matrimony:
      never do it; the odds
       are too great. My own belief is, that, especially for an
      artist, it’s a fellow’s ruin. Mine, you see, is an exceptional position. But if you take my
      advice, old man, never marry.”
“I don’t think there is the faintest chance,” answered Hamlin. “Women have got to bore me
      long ago: all that in my poems is mere recollections of the past—descriptions of a myself
      which has long come to an end.”
“I’m glad of it,” replied Perry. “It is a foolish thing to get tied to a woman.”
“Foolish indeed!” thought Hamlin, looking from his shabby, depressed old comrade, to the
      blazing sunsets and green moonlights on the easels about them.
