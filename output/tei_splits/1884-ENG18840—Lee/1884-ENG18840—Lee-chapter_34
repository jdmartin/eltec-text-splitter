CHAPTER VI.
As the summer changed into autumn, the guests at Wotton Hall were gradually renewed. Chough
      remained, and at Anne’s particular desire sent for his two little girls, sad, strange, Cockney
      creatures, to whom the large house, the garden, the country walks and country sights, were as
      things of another world. But the Spencers, Dennistoun, and O’Reilly departed; and in their
      place arrived the two Leigh girls and Edmund Lewis. The last‐named gentleman did not by any
      means strike Anne as a fascinating being. He was a stumpy, high‐shouldered, thick‐set little
      man, always very slackly dressed, with small, rather handsome features, and a profusion of
      curly reddish hair and beard, which made his face
       look even more like unbaked dough than it might otherwise
      have done. Some people considered him very handsome, and it was obvious that he himself felt
      as if he were tall; for he stumped and slouched in and out of rooms with his hands in his
      pockets, and dropped on to chairs and sofas with the heavy importance of gait of a Hercules.
      Nothing could be more comic than the contrast between this lumbering and solemn redhaired
      dwarf and Cosmo Chough, black, fierce, alert, courteous, and grandiloquent. Lewis was silent;
      but when he spoke he fixed his handsome eyes searchingly upon one, and either trailed his
      voice along with slow emphasis, or answered in monosyllables, which left in you an
      uncomfortable feeling of having made some inappropriate or impertinent remark. He had,
      moreover, lips of the colour of the very best sealing‐wax; a peculiarity which, while
      decidedly adding to the pictorial value of a red‐haired man, has a something quite
      particularly repulsive to certain people, among
       whom Anne Brown must be counted. However, she tried to like
      Mr Lewis. In some respects he was a more genuine personality than Chough, or Dennistoun, or
      almost any other of Hamlin’s æsthetic friends. He did not make himself up—manner, appearance,
      ideas, or words—to look like anything which he was not, or at all events which he did not
      thoroughly believe himself to be; and he was, moreover, much more in the way of will and
      definite tendencies, and felt himself (however mistakenly) to be much more in the way of
      power, character, and importance, than any other man whom Anne had ever come across, except
      her cousin Richard, between whom and Edmund Lewis there existed, despite a thousand
      differences, a certain resemblance. And perhaps it was exactly this resemblance to Richard
      Brown,—a man whom Anne did not exactly like, nay, who even occasionally repelled her a little,
      but of whose power and truthfulness and generosity Anne could not doubt,—perhaps it was this
      resemblance, however
       vague it might be, which made Anne for some time believe
      that Edmund Lewis, little as he pleased her, might be a remarkable sort of man, and treat
      Chough’s insinuations against him as merely another instance of that childish unreasonableness
      of likings and dislikings, which, together with vanity and weakness of will, she had got to
      associate with a poetic endowment. Over Hamlin, at all events, Edmund Lewis had an undeniable
      influence; an influence which he himself avowedly attributed to his magnetic powers, which he
      would exert, or imagine that he exerted, sitting lazily opposite his friends or victims,
      staring vaguely at them and speaking in his slow, important voice. He was a painter, in an
      irregular sort of way, himself, and took much more interest in Hamlin’s art than in his
      poetry; so that Hamlin, who was sick of versifying for the moment, had a fit of painting once
      more, and spent hours locked up in his studio with Lewis, while poor Cosmo Chough was more and
      more thrown upon Anne and her friends.
       But the girls had got to understand Chough, and the fund of
      kindness and self‐sacrificing gentleness which was hidden beneath the little man’s poetical
      thin‐skinnedness and the queer poetical veneer of mystic wickedness which he himself did not
      understand. He could not by any possibility be broken of his tendency to talk overmuch about
      Messalina, Lucretia Borgia, and La Belle Heaulmière; but by this time it was quite obvious
      that he had not the smallest experience of ladies of any such character, still less the
      faintest thought of giving offence by his allusions to them. To Anne he was utterly devoted:
      he was fascinated by her beauty, afraid of its tragic earnestness, afraid of her downright,
      quiet manner, afraid of her silent contemptuousness, of her uncompromising censoriousness; but
      if ever a person appreciated Anne’s kindness, her energy, her imperious desire of helping
      others, it was Chough. Anne had often spoken to him about the neglected education of his
      little girls; not reproachfully, for she knew but too well on
       what it depended, but trying to stir him up to resist the
      sort of fatality which seemed to hang over his family concerns. And now she insisted on taking
      the children’s education into her own hands, until Chough should be able to afford sending
      them to a proper school. Perhaps the thought of that neglected, unconsciously corrupted,
      terribly responsible little heathen girl, who had done so much mischief in Wotton Hall fifteen
      years before, had something to do with Anne’s energetic behaviour towards the little
      Choughs—to whom, every morning regularly, she gave a two hours’ lesson in grammar and writing
      and history, as complete as if she had been a schoolmistress and they her pupils; until their
      father, astonished at their unexpected development of human faculties, took it in his head to
      turn them into first‐rate musicians, and actually got up at six in the morning to teach them
      the piano, while Hamlin and Lewis were still asleep.
Marjory Leigh, who had considered Anne
       in the light of an irresponsible but decidedly
      objectionable æsthetic villain on her departure from London, looked on in puzzled amazement.
      She could not understand how any one so beautiful, so versed in useless literature and useless
      art, any one whom her foolish elder sister foolishly adored, could be anxious and able to make
      herself of use in the world. And even Mary Leigh, in her gentle, ironical way, was astonished
      at Anne’s new vocation, and adored her all the more enthusiastically for it. Mrs Macgregor
      hinted, in her affectionate cynical manner, that Anne was mistaking for a desire to be useful
      to Chough’s children the mere imperious necessity of caring for some one, which was the
      vicarious form of love; and prophesied archly that, once married, Anne would soon be satisfied
      with uselessness. Anne smiled contemptuously at Mrs Macgregor’s theories. Yet she was as
      unaware as was Mrs Macgregor herself, that there was indeed an imperious necessity in her
      nature—a necessity more personal, more selfish, and more
       terrible than her mere desire to be of use. In these four
      months Anne had gradually, and hitherto unconsciously, ceased to love Hamlin as she had
      formerly loved him. Like many of the most powerful and passionate natures, Anne had a fatal
      tendency to love ideally and love the ideal; not so much to invest with unreal qualities the
      object of her passion, but to conceive a passion for an impersonal creation of her own, an
      amalgamation of her own ardent and confused aspirations after an unknown excellence; and then
      to identify the object of this strange intellectual and moral passion with the first real
      person who struck her as excellent and noble and beautiful, or who appealed strongly to her
      sympathies and her gratitude. Of love in the ordinary sense, such a nature is wellnigh
      incapable; and the devotion due to real imperfect creatures, pity and sympathy with weakness,
      the devotion due to a sense of duty, although it may be intense and tender in such people,
      comes only on later, when the first
       splendid idol has been shattered, and whatever passion
      there is must be given, in humbleness or sorrow, to the unsatisfying realities of this world.
      With such a nature and such tendencies, Anne had been met, when young, ignorant, and
      friendless, by an indistinct yet real personality—by Hamlin, who had done for her more than
      any other man had ever done for a woman; and in this vaguely seen Hamlin, known at first only
      as a servant knows the brilliant guest of the house, a model the painter to whom she is
      sitting—and then known at a distance, in letters which were the unreal efflorescence of a
      poet’s mind,—in this vaguely seen Hamlin, to whom she owed her new life, and who was
      surrounded by all the beautiful things and ideas which that new life represented, Anne Brown
      had incarnated the ideal of good and beauty towards which her simple, self‐unconscious,
      energetic soul so strenuously aspired. Such a love as this must be transformed into something
      less exalted, or must die out unsatisfied, whatever the person who
       feels it or the person with whom it is connected: the real,
      however excellent, can never satisfy the craving after the ideal; a living individual can
      never quiet desires which have no individual object, which are mere dumb and violent
      activities of a too powerful soul. But Anne was not the kind of woman in whom simpler and less
      exacting instincts, in whom ordinary love, can gradually supplant such an ideal passion; and
      what was worse, Hamlin was not the man who could substitute for an impossible and
      unapproachable creature of the imagination, a less perfect, but more appealing, more
      attaching, more lovable creature of reality.
No man that ever breathed could have satisfied cravings which were in reality not after a
      man, but after a higher life, a more complete activity, a nobler aim; but Hamlin fell short
      not merely of Anne’s ideal, but also, in many things, even of the reality of Anne herself, and
      of all she could understand and sympathise with. The ecstatic devotion
       had speedily given way in her to a more sober kind of
      admiration and affection; but now, little by little, that also was being invaded, transformed
      piecemeal here and there, by doubt, contempt, and disgust. Anne’s eyes had gradually opened to
      the fact that Hamlin was vain, thin‐skinned, professionally jealous, and afraid of the
      judgment, as he was avid of the praise, of his own inferiors; and that, in the negative line,
      he was without strong likings, enthusiasms, or aspirations; and the negative qualities
      affected her more than the positive ones: to her the coldness of Hamlin’s sympathies was more
      painful than the weakness of his nature. Vaguely and gradually these things had dawned upon
      Anne; and she could no more deny their existence than she could persuade herself that a grey
      English autumn day was brilliant as an Italian summer morning. But of late things had
      happened, like that incident of the suppressed “Ballad of the Fens,” and of the
      self‐slandering sonnets which Hamlin looked upon with such
       complacency, which had given her glimpses into something
      worse than she could well believe in, worse than she had the heart to look into. These she
      cast behind her, thinking of them as little as possible, trying to consider them as
      hallucinations, or at all events, gross exaggerations of her own: she must have misunderstood;
      such things could not be. She tried to settle her love of Hamlin on a real and more solid
      basis. She fully admitted to herself that Hamlin had weaknesses,—the weaknesses which she
      remarked in so many of the men around him,—weaknesses going together with the fine qualities
      of the poet’s nature,—weaknesses which, Anne was beginning to suspect, every one had
      (forgetting that she had not), or at least something equivalent thereunto. She admitted to
      herself that Hamlin was weak; nay, to do so was a sort of relief. That Hamlin should come of a
      family infirm of will and often vicious, that he should have been brought up surrounded by
      vice and violence engendered by weakness; this notion,
       due partly to her own observations, and confirmed by Mrs
      Macgregor’s confidences, explained so much away, and left room for so much: it explained all
      the wretched part of his nature, it left room for all the good, for the gentleness, the
      generosity, the chivalric spirit which had made Anne what she was; and it let her hope, every
      now and then, that better might be in store. For since the evil was merely negative and the
      good so thorough and so positive, surely the good would vanquish the evil. And, looking at the
      people who surrounded Hamlin,—at these vain, weak, unreal poets and artists, at this whole
      school of people who, whatever their private life, affected to live only for selfish enjoyment
      of beauty and selfish interest in sin,—Anne used often to think that Hamlin was in the
      position of a sort of Rinaldo, the noblest of all heroes, degraded into mean sloth by the
      Armida of æstheticism, but requiring only the shrill of the trumpet and the clash of arms from
      the real living world to be redeemed and to show
       himself in his real nobility. She would even exaggerate her
      aversion or contempt for Hamlin’s companions and for his school; the worse they were, the more
      excuse for him; and she would often sit dreaming of the way in which he might be gradually got
      from under their influence, and brought in contact with those stronger, more healthy, or more
      terrible realities, which Anne’s nature, by a kind of occult sympathy, felt in the world all
      round, as the birds and insects will feel the storm which is still invisible beyond the hills,
      but which is coming to purify, and shake, and revive.
And so Anne went on loving and hoping, and believing herself to be happy. But there began to
      be a strange restlessness about her; a desire to be useful, to be perpetually active in
      something, to be always trying to understand, and sympathise, and help—an imperious necessity
      not to be left to her own thoughts (those thoughts which had once been like a
       paradise, in which solitude was the highest bliss). For,
      alone with her own thoughts, Anne was beginning to experience an intolerable sense of
      isolation, and intolerable sense of impotence.
