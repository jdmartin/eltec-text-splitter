CHAPTER III.
ANNE had forgotten all about the séance, when,
      about a week later, Mary Leigh arrived at Hammersmith in a state of extreme excitement.
“What is the matter, Mary?” asked Anne, wondering at her flushed face, which was usually so
      quiet.
“Nothing—nothing,” said Mary Leigh, looking impatiently at some visitors who were present.
      “I spoilt two copper plates this morning, and shall have no etchings worth exhibiting. I
      suppose that has put me out of sorts.”
But the visitors had scarcely turned their backs, when Mary Leigh turned suddenly towards
      Miss Brown.

“Oh Anne dear, a dreadful, shameful thing has happened! and I have come to you to know what
      it means, because I can’t help thinking that Mr Hamlin has had something to do with it, and
      poor Marjory is so miserable.”
“What is it?” asked Anne, a vague terror coming over her.
“Why, Marjory got this letter to‐day from Harry Collett; he has been staying with his mother
      at Wotton for the last week. Read it, and you will understand.”
Miss Brown took the letter, evidently much pulled about and read and re‐read, from Mary
      Leigh, and smoothed it out and read it slowly; while her friend sat by, looking anxiously at
      her face.
The letter was from Marjory’s intended. Harry Collett told her, with a dignity and
      gentleness, a desire not to hurt the one who had hurt him, and an incapacity of hiding his
      great pain, which nearly made Anne cry, that his eyes had at length been opened to the
      undesirableness of a marriage
       which, however much wished for by him, could not satisfy all
      the claims of a nature llke Marjory’s.
“Much as I have looked forward to our marriage,” wrote poor Harry, “I could not possibly be
      happy if I suspected that it did not give you everything which you have a right to require
      from life. I thank God for having sent me a warning in time, for having let me understand what
      your generosity and my infatuation would have hidden to me—namely, that your thoughts have,
      despite your will, turned elsewhere; that your nature requires a life of greater cheerfulness
      and variety than I could hope to give it. And, indeed, I am beginning also to understand that
      I was trying to reconcile the irreconcilable—that a man who has elected a life among the poor,
      has no right to share its privations with any one, much less with any one dear to him; and I
      see that I was on the verge of committing the sin of sacrificing your happiness to my
      vocation, or rather to my unmanly desire to
       have the hardness of my vocation sweetened at your expense.
      Please do not fancy that I think at all badly of you; I think badly only of my own
      blindness.”
But the poor curate’s angelic nature could not resist the temptation of a fling at his
      supposed rival.
“I am only surprised—but my surprise may be due to my ignorance,” he added, “at the person
      who engrosses your thoughts. I should never have thought you could seriously care for a
      shallow creature like O’Reilly. I wish you to be happy, but I fear you will not be solidly
      happy with him.”
“Do you understand?” cried Mary Leigh, impatiently; “some one has written to Harry some
      horrid lies about Marjory and Thaddy O’Reilly. Oh, I think it is too shameful! Marjory, who
      has not seen Thaddy O’Reilly more than twice in the last six months; and,” added Mary Leigh,
      with an agony in her voice, “I fear—oh, I fear—Anne, that it must have been Mr Hamlin who did
      it.”

Anne did not look up from the letter. She was very white, and her face full of shame.
“I fear it must,” she answered, half audibly.
“But what is the meaning of it?” cried Mary. “What can Mr Hamlin know about the matter? Why,
      he scarcely ever sees Marjory. I don’t believe he had seen her for nearly six weeks before
      that party at Madame Elaguine’s. Oh, Anne, do you think it is Madame Elaguine, that horrid
      little Russian, who did it?”
“Oh no,” answered Anne, quickly, “I know Sacha Elaguine has not done it; I don’t believe she
      is capable of doing it.”
“Then you think? . . .”
“I fear—I fear Mr Hamlin did it.”
There was a dead silence. Poor Mary Leigh was torn by her indignation for her sister, and
      her pain at the shame cast upon her admired Hamlin, and through him upon her adored Anne.
“What can I do? If only I knew the grounds of the accusation,” she said desperately
      , “I know I could explain them away to Harry. I know that
      Marjory could, but she won’t.”
“Has Marjory not answered Mr Collett?”
Mary Leigh shook her head.
“Marjory is too proud and self‐willed. She is disgusted with Harry. She won’t hear his name
      mentioned; it is useless. Oh, it is dreadful to see people who care for each other so much
      separated in this way, by a mere vile groundless calumny, which one cannot even refute.”
Anne passed her hand across her forehead.
“Mr Hamlin has done it,” she said slowly, and with an effort, “and he must undo it.”
“How can one make him undo such a thing?” cried Mary, hopelessly.
“I will tell him that he was wrong, and make him write to Harry Collett.”
“Oh Annie dear, you are good”—and Mary Leigh threw herself on Anne’s neck—“for I know how
      dreadful, how terrible it must be for you to tell him that he has acted badly.”

“It is not the first time,” answered Anne, mournfully. “Leave me the letter, will you, Mary
      dear?”
Mary Leigh left the letter with Miss Brown; and that evening, as Anne was sitting with
      Hamlin after dinner, she suddenly dashed into the subject.
“Do you remember saying, the other night, at your cousin’s, that you would write to Harry
      Collett about the flirtation which you took it upon yourself to imagine between Marjory Leigh
      and Mr O’Reilly?” asked Anne.
Hamlin looked puzzled.
“I remember something or other,” he said evasively.
“Did you write to Harry Collett?”
“I had occasion to write to Collett about some books I had left at Wotton, and which I
      wanted him to bring up to town on his return.”
“But did you mention about Marjory and Mr O’Reilly?”

“I may have”—Hamlin spoke absently—“yes, I suppose I did. What of it?”
“What of it?” cried Anne, indignantly; “why, this much, that you have made two people
      perfectly miserable, and that Marjory’s marriage with Mr Collett is broken off,” and she
      handed him the letter.
Hamlin looked at it with an air of puzzled indifference.
“I don’t understand what it’s all about,” he said, coolly and serenely, returning the letter
      to Anne.
“Then you did not say anything about Marjory to Mr Collett?”
“Yes—I did—I certainly think I did. I can’t exactly remember what it was. You know how one
      writes letters; one forgets the next day.”
Anne looked at him with wonder. So after having, momentarily at least, made two people as
      unhappy as was well possible, this was how he took the revelation of the results of his
      doings.

“Mr Hamlin,” said Anne, sternly, “you know that you never believed that Marjory Leigh was
      really flirting with O’Reilly; and you know that you wrote to Harry Collett, and made him
      believe that she cared for another man.”
“I don’t know anything about Miss Leigh’s doings. I remember noticing her talking very
      assiduously that evening with Thaddy. Perhaps it was all fancy of mine; I have no doubt it
      was. I just mentioned it to Collett as I might mention anything else. I never dreamed that it
      would annoy him.”
“You thought it would merely annoy her?” asked Anne, reproachfully.
“I really know nothing about the matter. I’m not responsible for what I may have thought or
      written a week ago, much less for all these complications, which I never dreamed of.”
“Did you suppose, then, that Harry Collett would be utterly indifferent to being given to
      understand that Marjory cared for another
       man, and was not the fit wife for an East End curate, as you
      expressed it?”
“I don’t know. I wrote, and thought no more about it. If they have gone and quarrelled about
      it, I’m very sorry—and that’s all I can say.”
Hamlin’s tone was bored and slightly impatient. He had evidently not the smallest shame or
      regret for what he had done.
“Since you are sorry—since you did write that to Collett,” said Anne, trying to
      speak as gently as possible—“you will, I trust, do what you can to repair this mischief.
      Marjory Leigh is too indignant with Harry to answer him at all. Will you write to him and tell
      him that it was all a mistake—all owing to your having been annoyed with Marjory on account of
      that laurel crown business—and that there was no foundation for all you said? You will make
      amends, won’t you? Do write at once.”
Hamlin had risen from his seat, and his face had taken a curious obstinate look.

“I’m very sorry I can’t obey you, Miss Brown,” he said, “but it appears to me that you wish
      me to write myself down a liar. If these people choose to fall out because of a word of mine,
      I see no reason to apologise. It is their concern, not mine.”
“Was it your concern to write to Collett, then? Was it your concern to take such a
      responsibility?”
“Every one may write whatever passes through his head. I thought Miss Leigh a flirt last
      week; I don’t now. As to responsibilities, I repudiate such things.”
“No one can repudiate such things,” cried Anne. “You have done mischief, and with a few
      strokes of the pen you can repair it. Oh, you must write, Mr Hamlin—you must.”
“If I write,” answered Hamlin, hotly, “I shall just tell Collett that I do
      think Miss Leigh a flirt. I cannot refuse to write, but I refuse to eat my words. Have you
      paper and a pen?”

He had gone to Anne’s writing‐table. Anne put her arm over it.
“You have told a falsehood once, you shall not tell it twice,” she said.
“I said that merely to show you how impossible your request was. After all, my dear Miss
      Brown, a man does owe something to himself and to his name, and there is such a thing as
      proper pride.”
“Is there?” answered Anne, and the words were like drops of freezing water. “I thought,” she
      added, the remembrance of what he had answered when she had entreated him not to slander
      himself in those sonnets “Desire,” “that your school considered it legitimate for a man to say
      that he had committed no matter what baseness, even those which he had not. But I see,” and
      Anne’s indignation blazed up, “that you want sometimes to be considered wicked, but that you
      succeed only in being mean.”
“I think that is a little hard upon me,” he answered mournfully and bitterly, and left the
       room. He was thinking of all he had done for Anne—all that
      he had done and left undone.
Anne remained seated, looking into the fire, for some moments. Then she went to her desk and
      took paper and an envelope.
“DEAR MR COLLETT,” she wrote slowly, “Mary Leigh has just shown me your letter to Marjory,
      which has greatly shocked and grieved me. As I know that the person who misled you about
      Marjory and Mr O’Reilly, between whom there has never been a shadow of a flirtation, is Mr
      Hamlin, I feel bound to tell you, not only that to my knowledge Marjory has not seen Mr
      O’Reilly except once since your departure; but also, as having been present on the occasion of
      the supposed flirtation, that Mr Hamlin imagined the flirtation, and wrote to you about it
      merely because he was in an ill temper, and because Marjory had annoyed him that evening by
      detecting a fraud in the spiritualistic séance in which we
      were engaged. Mr Hamlin has himself just told me that he
       does not any longer believe in the flirtation, and had no
      notion of creating any mischief. So, as he is not writing to you himself, I feel bound to tell
      you the real state of affairs, and I trust you will immediately let Marjory know that your
      suspicions were groundless, as she is very unhappy, and indignant with your letter.—Believe
      me, dear Mr Collett, yours sincerely, ANNE BROWN.”
Anne stopped several times in course of writing, and read and re‐read her letter. Hamlin had
      refused to make amends; well, she must make them for him: the matter was simple, and it was
      Anne’s character, whenever she saw the right course, to take it without hesitation, however
      painful to her. Like many very honest and firm people, she had something destructive in her
      temper; she could, as Sacha Elaguine had said, sacrifice herself and others with a sort of
      sullen savage satisfaction. It was a humiliation for Hamlin, but he had deserved it; it was a
      bitter humiliation for herself, but her
       debt of gratitude towards Hamlin forced her to take the
      consequences of the bad that was in him as well as the good. To admit that Hamlin had, from
      mere womanish ill‐temper, calumniated a friend, wantonly and thoughtlessly made two loving
      natures mistrust each other, and that he had then refused to repair the mischief of his own
      making,—this was intolerably bitter to Anne; still it had to be done. She put the letter on
      the hall table, and bade the servant post it without delay. Then she felt the full ignominy of
      the matter; and her whole nature recoiled from Hamlin’s. Nay, it did not recoil; there was no
      reality to shrink from. Anne no longer felt horror as she had done when he had given her that
      poem about Cold Fremley; she rccognised that his fault was negative, that his moral evil was
      moral nullity—the utter incapacity in this man, who had acted so chivalrously towards her, of
      perceiving when he was doing a mean thing. And the thought that she would be chained for ever
      to the side of a man whose whole
       nature was merely æsthetic, who was wholly without moral
      nerves or moral muscles, filled her with despair.
The next day, Hamlin sent word that he had to go and see some pictures at Oxford, and would
      be away for two days. Anne felt a vague hope that he was ashamed of himself. Madame Elaguine
      called, and with her came Cosmo Chough. The conversation, to Miss Brown’s annoyance, turned
      upon the spiritualistic séance of the previous week.
“What a fool Walter is!” exclaimed Sacha. “Fancy his moping in a corner because the spirits
      crowned him with paper laurels! I can’t understand a man not having more brass, not putting a
      better face on things. But Walter is a curious creature: in many respects he is not a man but
      a child. He has seen a great deal of life, and yet in many things he is like a girl of
      fifteen.”
“Mr Hamlin,” said Anne, evasively, “has an essentially artistic nature; the realities of the
      world don’t appeal much to him.”

“Unless an artist feel the realities of the world,” said Madame Elaguine, eating some of the
      petals of the roses that were at her elbow, “his art will be very thin. Life must stain the
      artist with its colours, or his art will be tintless.”
Anne had often said those same words to herself; yet somehow she knew that in Sacha
      Elaguine’s mouth they had a different meaning; and she felt it, when, with her curious,
      half‐childlike, and yet infinitely conscious smile, she turned to Chough.
“Don’t you think so, Signor Cosmo?”
Cosmo Chough pretended that he understood, as he always did, whenever he thought that
      passion and the Eternal Feminine were in question; he tightened his black moustachioed lips
      into a long grimace, and bowed in deferential agreement.
“Of course,” said the little man, sticking his single eye‐glass in his eye, “we all know
      that our friend Hamlin will never get out of life all that perfume, that narcotic and
      bitter‐sweet
       fiavour, which some other men taste, to be poisoned for
      ever, with their first mouthful of honey. Hamlin is, in some respects, a little more and a
      little less than a man.”
“A goose, in short,” laughed Sacha.
“He is, purely and simply, an artist. Passions, senses, all the things which belong to other
      men’s personality, belong to him only as factors of his art. And this is perhaps not to be
      regretted, but to be rejoiced in. There is terrible danger of the artist being swallowed up by
      the man. Of the poets whom God sends on earth, two‐thirds are lost to mankind: their passions,
      which should be merely so many means of communication between their soul and the universe, eat
      them up; or rather they feed themselves on what should become the world’s honey. And even of
      those who are not lost entirely, how many are there not whose lives are engulfed by passions;
      to whom, alas! what they sing is but the wretched shadow of what they feel!” And Chough
      sighed, and fixed his eyes on his
       lacquered boot‐tips, as much as to intimate that he, who
      lived on mutton‐chops and spent his life nursing an epileptic wife, was of that Caliph Vathek
      kind.
Madame Elaguine laughed; but Chough thought it was at Hamlin, and frowned.
“Herein lies Hamlin’s advantage; he is the pure artist. And, mark me,” he said, looking
      fiercely around him, “he is none the worse for that. No, rather the better. I know no man to
      compare with Hamlin as a mere person; to compare with him not merely in genius, but in
      kindliness of temper, in purity of soul, in delicacy of thoughts. He is not merely a great
      artist, but a work of art; he is like a picture of Sir Galahad vivified, or like a sonnet of
      Dante turned into flesh—and I think Miss Brown will agree with me.”
“Mr Hamlin,” said Anne, slowly, “is a very generous man and a very chivalric man, and,” she
      added, feeling as if Madame Elaguine were looking into her soul, and as if she must read
      ingratitude written in it, “I feel that I am
       indebted to him not merely for all he has done for me, but
      for the way in which he has done it—”
“Oh no, no!” exclaimed the polite little poet, to whom Anne was quite the goddess, “don’t
      say that, Miss Brown; you can never owe anything to any one. Whatever a man can do, is a
      tribute which his nature forces him to lay down at your shrine.”
“Yes,” mused Madame Elaguine, following out the pattern of the carpet with her parasol
      “indebted—that is how one must feel towards Walter—indebted for the pleasure, etc.,
      etc., of so charming an acquaintance; but love—one can’t love where there is only artistic
      instinct to meet one—”
“I know nothing about such matters,” said Anne, quietly.
“But, perhaps—Hamlin may be a sort of child of genius, and the man, the man who feels may
      come later,” finished the Russian.
“When people don’t feel, they don’t feel,” said Anne, sternly; “I mean—morally.”

“By the way,” exclaimed Chough, “I am reading such a delightful book—have you ever read it,
      Madame Elaguine?—The Letters of Mademoiselle Aïssé—”
“Who was Mademoiselle Aïssé?” asked Anne absently, forgetting that experience had taught her
      that it was safer not to inquire too curiously into Mr Chough’s heroines.
“I suppose she was some improper lady or other—all your poetic ladies were, weren’t they?”
      asked Madame Elaguine. “Something like your Belle Heaulmière, whom you insisted on talking
      about at poor Lady Brady’s party, although I kept making signs to you the whole time.”
“Improper?” exclaimed Chough. “Mademoiselle Aïssé was the soul of virtue—the purest woman—of
      the eighteenth century.”
“Tell us about this purest woman of—the eighteenth century,” laughed Sacha.
“She was the daughter of kings; her name was originally Ayesha, like the wife of the
      Prophet—but she became a slave, and was sold as
       a child to M. de Ferréol—I think that was his name—who was
      ambassador at Constantinople. M. de Ferréol sent her to his sister‐in‐law in Paris to educate.
      Aïssé grew up the most refined and accomplished woman,—you should read her letters—perfect
      gems!—and marvellously beautiful. Life was just opening to her, and love also, when M. de
      Ferréol returned from Constantinople, and said to this exquisite, proud, and pure‐minded
      creature: ‘You are my slave; I bought you, I educated you; now love me.’”
Chough paused and looked round him to watch the effect of his eloquence. But his eyes fell
      upon Anne. She was very white.
“Well—and what did Aïssé answer?” asked Madame Elaguine.
“Aïssé answered—let me see, what did Aïssé answer?—oh, I should spoil your pleasure were I
      to tell it you. I will bring you the book, dear Madame Elaguine, and you shall tell me what
      you think of it.”

Anne felt that she had betrayed herself. To Sacha, she hoped, she believed not—but to
      Chough. The little poet, in his trumpery way, was really attached to Anne, whom he considered
      as his guardian angel; and perhaps his affection had made him understand.
“What became of Mademoiselle Aïssé?” asked Anne, some time later, as she stood by the piano
      where Chough was playing.
Chough looked up. “Oh—why—she—in short—afterwards—she died.”
“Would you like to see the book?” asked Madame Elaguine; “I have some others on hand at
      present. Mr Chough shall send it to you—”
“Oh no, thank you,” answered Anne, “I have a heap of books to get through; and—I don’t care
      what happened to Mademoiselle Aïssé.”
“You are very hard‐hearted, Anne.”
“She would not have objected to M. de Ferréol if she had remained a mere little Turkish
      slave‐girl; she would have thought
       him a sort of God. She had no business to let her education
      make her squeamish.”
“A nasty old ambassador!” said Madame Elaguine. “I think it was awfully hard
      upon her, poor thing! And was she in love with some one else, Mr Chough?”
