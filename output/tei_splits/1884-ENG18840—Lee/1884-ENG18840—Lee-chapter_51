CHAPTER II.
ON recovering from that long delirium, during which she had raved only about the
      past and the future, about Miss Curzon, the Perrys, the Villa Arnolfini, Cousin Dick, Girton
      College, and political economy, but never—by some singular obliviousness of the present—about
      Hamlin and Sacha,—the first persons that Anne Brown recognised about her were the Leigh girls.
      Marjory had postponed her marriage in order to help her sister in nursing Miss Brown; and Mrs
      Macgregor had gladly accepted their proposal to settle for the time being in the house at
      Hammersmith, she herself being far too unpractical to be of any use. Anne’s impressions were
      vague, diffuse; the ideas aud sensations, the slight amount of life
       of one day of early convalescence being, so to speak,
      diluted into what were really days and weeks, day and night succeeding each other confusedly
      to the girl, but feebly awake and for ever falling asleep. It was a dream, but a pleasant one,
      consisting of veiled misty impressions, separated by tracts of lethargy: impressions of the
      kind faces and voices of Mary and Marjory, of the gleams of sunshine on the carpet, of the
      waving of treetops outside the window, of the whistle of the steamboat on the Thames; the song
      of the canary in the housekeeper’s room—the cry of the milkman; of the bunches of big red and
      yellow roses put down upon the sheet before her; of the broth and jelly and tea feebly
      refused, and yet greedily swallowed,—trifles, nothings, but transformed by the haze of mixed
      weakness and relief into things possessing a charm, and never to be forgotten.
The mere sense of rest and renovation constituted a sort of happiness, with which mingled
      the consciousness of the kindness of those
       round her,—of the Leigh girls and Mrs Macgregor, who were
      in her room nearly all day; of Mrs Spencer, who came from the other end of London every
      afternoon; of Chough and Cousin Dick, who came to make inquiries; even of Hamlin, whose
      magnificent bundles and baskets of flowers and fruit arrived regularly, together with the
      bunch of sweet‐peas and pinks which Chough had bought at the greengrocer’s, or the sprigs of
      laburnum which he had stolen in the park. Everything in the world seemed so good and simple;
      all worries and doubts had gone with the dreadful visions of the delirious nights. Anne had
      never in her life felt so simply, completely happy; perhaps because, with her tense and tragic
      character, perfect happiness was possible only in weakness and vagueness.
Little by little the past became concrete once more; but it became concrete as the past, all
      her doubts and difficulties remaining far distant behind her, like the Alps which the
      traveller has arduously crossed, and looks back
       upon from the warm Lombard plain. She took up her position
      and feelings where she had left them: she felt herself free. At first she could scarcely tell
      why, as we sometimes can scarcely account to ourselves for something which has happened the
      previous day, and which, though forgotten, fills us with vague pleasure or pain on awakening.
      Then she began to understand once more, and to add to her recollections what she could make
      out of the present. She noticed that the Leighs scarcely ever spoke of Hamlin; that they
      brought in his flowers, books, and messages with a certain constraint, even, she thought, with
      an occasional look of disgust and indignation. And they never, never once mentioned Madame
      EIaguine.
“What has become of Sacha Elaguine?” she asked one day, rolling her head, with face even
      paler than before, and black crisp hair just beginning to cluster after cropping short, on the
      pillows. “Has she gone out of town? You have never spoken about her, Mary.”

Mary Leigh, who was seated, holding Anne’s thin white hand, did not raise her head; and
      Marjory, who was pouring out the tea hard by, flushed scarlet.
“Haven’t I? Oh yes, I must,” answered Mary Leigh, still keeping her eyes on the pattern of
      the carpet. “Madame Elaguine? Oh, she’s just as usual.”
“Odious little brute,” scowled Marjory.
Mary raised her head sharply, and gave her sister a look of reproof.
Anne asked no more. She had understood: during her illness Sacha had tightened her hold on
      Hamlin; the Leighs had seen it, or been told, and Mary was afraid lest her sister should let
      out to the invalid what she imagined to be a heart‐breaking secret.
“I am free!” thought Anne; and repeated these words to herself every time that one of the
      Leighs spoke coldly of Hamlin, or looked savage when he was mentioned. And sometimes she
      fancied that she could distinguish in the face and manner of the true‐hearted Mary,
       of the indignant Marjory, the pain and perplexity of
      foreseeing that they possessed a terrible secret, that they must make a terrible revelation.
      Once, she felt sure, Mary’s heart had almost burst for her silence. Miss Leigh had brought in
      Hamlin’s usual gift of flowers, a bunch of beautiful white roses and jasmine; she was going to
      hand it to Anne, when her face suddenly contracted, and she stuffed the flowers roughly into a
      jar.
“Won’t you let me smell Mr Hamlin’s flowers, Mary?” asked Anne from her bed.
Mary Leigh gave her a long strange look.
“They aren’t fit for you, Anne,” said Mary, in a hoarse voice; “they’re horrible, morbid
      sort of things—they’ll just make your head ache.”
“My head is much stronger than you think,” said Anne; “let me have them—they are lovely. The
      jasmine doesn’t smell like ordinary jasmine. What is it?—it smells like the incense that Sacha
      Elaguine burns in her boudoir; it’s nice, but too strong. I
       wonder whether they have been in her boudoir to catch it.
      It’s very kind of Mr Hamlin to bring them to me, especially as”—Anne looked up with a smile
      which frightened Mary Leigh out of her wits—“he doesn’t care a bit about me any longer, you
      know.”
Mary Leigh threw herself on her knees before Anne’s bed, and drawing her head to her, kissed
      her.
“Oh, Annie, Annie, my darling!” she cried.
“You are good,” answered Anne—“you are good to love me so. But Mr Hamlin is also very good,
      although he doesn’t love me. I am very happy—so happy, Mary dear.”
“She is mad,” thought Mary, in terror, as Anne threw her head back, smiling, her onyx‐grey
      eyes beaming, on the pillow. And she resolved that, as long as she could help, Anne Brown
      should not know what she knew, and what, every time that Hamlin’s name was mentioned, sickened
      her heart.
Some days later Miss Brown was sufficiently well to exchange her bed for a couch in the
       drawing‐room down‐stairs; and then Hamlin asked whether he
      might be admitted to see her for a few minutes. He seemed painfully impressed at the sight of
      Anne, whom he was accustomed to see looking the embodiment of physical strength, a sort of
      primeval warrior‐woman, stretched out on the sofa, so thin and hollow‐checked, so pale, with a
      pallor quite different from the natural opaque ivory pallor of her complexion; so weak of
      voice and gesture, so wholly despoiled, it seemed to him, of her usual sombre haughtiness:
      resigned, and with the gentleness of a sick child. He was silent and depressed, as a man might
      be who knew her to be more seriously ill than she thought; and yet, as Anne was well aware, it
      was most obvious to him and to every one that she was entirely out of danger, and rapidly
      recovering. Miss Brown understood: he was weighed down, but with a worse conscience than Mary
      Leigh,—by the thought that this woman was unaware of the sort of treachery which was being
      committed behind her back.
       Anne, on the other hand, felt more really pleased to see
      him than she had done this long time past; it seemed as if, now that the bond which tied her
      to him was loosened, she could see once more all that was amiable and noble in him,—that she
      could like him again, feel towards him simply, naturally, as towards a friend and benefactor.
      And she felt sorry for his depression, for what she imagined to be his self‐reproach; desirous
      of telling him almost, then and there, that he need not make himself unhappy, that he was free
      to love his cousin.
Miss Brown was still unfit for much conversation; and Hamlin seemed glad to cut short the
      interview. She asked him to raise one of the blinds; and when the light streamed upon his
      face, she thought she saw in it something unusual, something beyond his mere usual melancholy,
      a lassitude and look of being worried; again she felt sorry for him.
“How is your cousin Sacha?” she asked.
“She is well,” he answered briefly, “and
       —sends you many messages. I don’t let her come, because she
      would excite you. Goodbye.”
Every afternoon Hamlin returned for a short time. Anne’s first impression was merely
      strengthened; Hamlin was extraordinarily depressed, worried‐looking, taciturn. Anne felt
      really sorry for him; he was evidently, she thought, eating his heart out in doubts and
      self‐reproach; he had gone too far with Sacha to retreat, and yet his engagement to Miss Brown
      forbade his taking a decisive step. After all, he was truer and nobler than she had thought,
      more of her real Hamlin of former days; she reflected that this hostility of temperament and
      aims between them, this long and sickening endurance of a bond which suited neither, had made
      her unjust and bitter towards him, prone to seek for only his worse sides, neglectful of his
      good ones. She felt that it was not the least benefit of her release that she could now be
      perfectly grateful once more; that she could give to this man the
       affection which he really deserved, and which she really
      felt, now that the terrible debt of love was cancelled. She was sorry, very sorry for him, and
      determined that, since he had not the heart, it was for her to speak. But invariably, and as
      if warned by a secret intuition, he had interrupted the conversation, and gone away whenever
      she had been on the point of speaking. The bare name of Madame Elaguine seemed enough to send
      him away; and yet, whenever Anne succeeded in making him speak of his cousin, he had spoken of
      her with a strange bitterness, and almost disgust.
“He is mean, after all,” thought Anne; “he is angry with poor Sacha for being the cause of
      his finding himself in a false position.” And she determined that she would speak, not to him
      but to Madame Elaguine; she felt that she could not endure the way in which he would assuredly
      seek to whitewash himself at his cousin’s expense. Mean, very mean; nay, something more than
      mean. What irritation or hypocrisy could induce him to speak
       of the woman whom he loved with a sort of constant
      innuendo, a constant sort of undercurrent of disgust?
And again she began to despise and dislike him. Another thing soon struck her. There was
      something unusual about Hamlin’s appearance. Somewhat effeminate he had always been in his
      aristocratic refinement; but now it seemed to her as if there were in his face a something,
      half physical, half spiritual, a vague, helpless, half‐stupefied look, which made her think of
      that hysterical tippling little poet Dennistoun, whom she disliked so much. Her mind reverted
      to what she had heard about Edmund Lewis having, at one period, induced Hamlin to take
      opium.
“Is Mr Lewis back?” she asked.
Hamlin flushed all over.
“Lewis is not likely to return,” he answered briefly.
What was the meaning of it all? Hamlin was also, she noticed, no longer as careful in his
      dress as he had formerly been; there was
       something vaguely rowdy about him. And once, as he stooped
      over her to rearrange the cushions under her head, it seemed to her—was it true or not?—that
      she felt a sickening whiff, like those which she well remembered since her childhood, when her
      father had come in from drinking and taken her on his knees.
Was it possible that Hamlin, weak as he was, and feeling himself cornered in a false
      position, had taken to drinking—to drinking, which had been the fatal vice of his family, of
      his brother, father, and of his uncles, in order to rid himself of his worries?
She must speak to Madame Elaguine. She must let them know that they were free.
