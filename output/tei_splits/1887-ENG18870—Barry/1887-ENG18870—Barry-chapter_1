CHAPTER I A JOURNEY TOWARDS THE SUNSET
The train had been rushing westward for hours, and the genius of the steam-kettle
      who drove it along was plainly intent neither on the landscapes that in momentary glimpses
      might be seen from the carriage-windows, nor on the babble of conversation which, in fitful
      gusts, rose and fell among the company it was bearing to their several destinies. All that the
      scientific, yet not time-keeping, demon cared for was to reach his last station by the
      shortest route. Nevertheless, glimpses of scenery caught in this way from the train have an
      extraordinary fascination, sometimes giving a whole country-side in one vivid sheet of
      lightning, where every line is fixed as in a daguerreotype and can never be forgotten. And
      what confessional or ear of Dionysius can gather up such confidences as may be heard among
      chance people in railway travelling? It would seem that the silent Briton, fenced round about
      with reserve as with Arctic icebergs,
       fancies himself stranded on a desert island with the companion who has got into his
      compartment at Basingstoke or Rugby. Certain it is that he is apt, after exhibiting the most
      profound indifference for his vis-à-vis , to unbosom himself under such
      circumstances, as Robinson Crusoe would have done to the first Englishman landing on Juan
      Fernandez. And, as it fell out, the spirit of the steam, or any other, might have witnessed a
      scene of this kind, had he crept into a certain first-class carriage and lain snug in a corner
      thereof, watching until a couple of young men who were its occupants should awake from their
      slumbers.
Each had taken his ticket at the same ticket-office; each had made for the same compartment,
      and had established himself in a corner diagonally as regarded the other. Each had veiled his
      features behind a newspaper, and tried his best to imagine that the impudent fellow who shared
      his solitude did not exist. And each hoped to see the other take himself off when the train
      stopped. But in vain; it was not to be. One station after another was left behind; the country
      grew more countrified; the towns became of less account; the clouds began to move slowly
      towards the west, as though summoned to attend the last moments of a dying king who would
      shroud his head in their splendours; the hours drew out to twice their length, as they will do
      in travelling, and still no sign appeared of these unwilling companions parting from one
      another. When they had studied their fill of the daily wisdom purchased at the London
      bookstall,
       each glared out of his window, noted what seemed notable along the line, fixed his eyes
      steadily —upon nothing, and at last, drawing back his head, fell into uneasy sleep. And the
      train rushed on. Its genius might have fallen asleep too, and have been travelling in his
      dreams, for all the tokens of life in this compartment. Then the sun's light came more
      slanting, and the train seemed to be moving ever more and more into its pathway, as if in time
      it would leave the solid earth behind and on its wings of white vapour float into the sunset
      and be there transfigured among the cloud-splendours. And as the light filled their
      compartment, both young men woke up. That one of them who had been sitting by the dark windows
      of the carriage, away from the sun, changed his corner, and came and sat opposite the other.
      He was desirous, apparently, of catching a glimpse of the sea, which for more then an hour the
      train had been nearing, as the dull thunder of waves on a shingly beach, somewhere below, had
      testified. Being in such close neighbourhood, with only a foot or so of space between them, it
      would have been incumbent on any except British railway-travellers to exchange some civil
      speeches. Perhaps that may have been the reason why one of them, who did not look entirely
      English, at last, after some hesitation, opened his lips and said (but still with the haughty
      indifference which young Englishmen assume towards those to whom they have not been
      introduced), 'Is the next station Yalden?'

'No; the next but one,' answered his vis-à-vis , sinking thereupon into stony or,
      as a Greek might express it, adamantine silence.
The next station appeared, paused a moment, vanished, and a reach of wild country came
      flying at the carriage-windows. The first speaker looked at his watch, and began again. 'The
      train is due at Yalden now,' he said; 'we are late.'
'Yes,' said the other, 'nearly half an hour late; trains always are on this part of the
      line.'
The ice was broken, or rather, part of the iceberg gave way. A remark about Bradshaw,
      another to the effect that the tide was coming in, a third suggesting that it would be a
      stormy night to judge by the clouds, led to the first speaker's asking, as he looked once more
      out of the carriage-window, 'Do you know whether Trelingham Court is far from Yalden?' Now was
      the time for any hidden, curiosity-loving sprite in the down train to prick up his ears and
      listen.
'Trelingham Court?' said the other in an inquiring tone. 'Why, about six miles if one is a
      stranger; under six, a good deal, taking the short cut by St. Mirian.'
And as he looked across at his companion with more attention than before an idea seemed to
      strike him as possible, which in a moment or two must have grown from possible to probable,
      for he said:
'Excuse me, sir, perhaps you are going to Trelingham.'

'Yes,' answered the other; 'that is my journey's end.'
'And mine,' said his questioner. 'How very odd!' He added, after a pause, and with
      considerable diffidence, 'I am very likely going to ask an absurd question, but I happened to
      see a portrait in this year's Academy of which you strongly remind me, and my cousin pointed
      it out as—'
The first speaker interrupted him courteously. 'My name,' he said, 'is Rupert Glanville, and
      a portrait of me there certainly was, hung rather too near the sky-line, on those
      much-enduring walls. But you must have observed it closely to see a likeness between it and a
      chance traveller on the railway.'
'I was about to remark,' said the other, 'that my cousin pointed it out as that of the
      artist who was coming down to Trelingham to paint the Great Hall. Else, I know so little of
      art matters that I should hardly have remembered it.'
'Your cousin said so, did he?' asked Mr. Glanville with an accent of surprise. 'I thought no
      one—'
'It was not he,' said the other, laughing; 'it was she. Not my cousin, Lord Trelingham, but
      his daughter, Lady May, who was inspecting the pictures that afternoon with other young
      ladies, and made some of us fellows walk in her train.'
'Ah,' said Mr. Glanville, 'I have never met Lady May Davenant; and I thought, I imagined,
      that only Lord Trelingham knew what was proposed. Until I
       have seen the Great Hall, and heard his plans more in detail, I cannot tell whether
      anything will come of it, so far as I am concerned. That is why I am now on my way to
      Trelingham Court.'
'Oh,' said the Earl's cousin, or Lady May's cousin,—but I think Lady May's cousin sounds the
      prettier, the more sentimental, as introducing this young gentleman (he seemed about twenty),
      who should of course, were mine not a story of real life, be our first or second lover, and
      devoted to the Earl's daughter,—'my cousin made no secret of it, and I suppose her father made
      none. And though I am such an ignoramus that I don't know one style of painting from another,
      I remembered your portrait all the more because a great deal was said about you
       manner —isn't that the word? If I understood Lady May, it is quite unlike what they
      supposed Lord Trelingham would have chosen. They were all loud in its praise; but they seemed
      to agree, or all except Lady May, that you,—that, in short, there was a deal of Paganism in
      your pictures. Is that so?'
'Quite, I should fancy,' said Mr. Glanville, much amused at the courteous bluntness, or
      blunt courtesy, of this young man, to whom painting was clearly a far-off mystery, like
      Chinese chess. 'Paganism would be the word for it in the Earl's entourage . For he
      himself is by no means a Pagan.'
'I should think not ,' said the other emphatically; 'not at all a pagan, unless
      Ritualists are Pagans. But that was the wonder. For, of course, he will not
       want painting all round him in which he cannot believe.'
'That is just it,' replied Mr. Glanville; 'you have hit the nail on the head. Lord
      Trelingham does not want pictures in which he cannot believe. He is no artist; but of all the
      men I have come across he has the finest sense of what is genuine art and what is mere make-up
      and pretence. He went to certain well-known masters and asked them how they would paint the
      Epic of king Arthur; and they designed, every man of them, and impossible boudoir idyll, a
      medieval dream, in the style of Tennyson. He looked round for some one that professed, at all
      events, to paint realities; and I know how astonished he was on finding the "paganism" of my
      canvases more real than the "dim rich" Christianity of Launcelot and Guinevere in the
      Laureate's blank verse. So we are going to make trial whether I can paint the Arthurian
      history as it must have happened, if it happened at all.'
To this learned speech the Earl's cousin made no reply, perhaps because he did not
      understand it. About epics, classical or medieval, Homeric or Arthurian, he never had troubled
      himself since he left school; and there he cared only for the fighting in the Iliad, in which
      he would have liked to join. Poetry meant less to him even than painting; but he did not lack
      brains, and he said by and by:
'Lord Trelingham is fond of art, but I always fancied he mixed it up with religion. He is
      ever so
       High Church, and such a Tory that I heard him say once there were none left but
      himself and Lord Hallamshire. Shall you put all that into your King Arthur? For unless you do,
      he will not know what to make of it.'
'I may,' said Mr. Glanville; 'who knows?' And he laughed as if the suggestion had roused his
      fancy. 'King Arthur was certainly High Church, and the Round Table a brotherhood of Tory
      knights. But Lord Trelingham is many things besides a Ritualist. He is an excellent
      art-critic; and when he came to my studio he talked much of colouring and gradation of tone,
      without a syllable of religion.'
'He is certainly, as you remark,' said the other, 'not one man, but several—half a dozen,
      perhaps. For instance, when you see him at home, you will take him by his dress for—what do
      you think?' Mr. Glanville could not say.
'No, of course, no one could guess. But with his long velvet coat reaching below his knees,
      his skullcap, and flowing white beard, he might very well pass in a play for some sort of
      astrologer. And the curious thing, as you will find, is that he has been given that way, and
      practises now occasionally.'
'Astrology and Ritualism,—a strange mixture!' said Mr. Glanville; 'how does he reconcile
      them?'
'Beyond me to say,' replied the Earl's cousin; 'but he does. He will probably draw your
      horoscope if you can tell him the day, hour, and minute when you were born, and whether the
      room in which
       you first saw the light, as he calls it, looked east or west.'
Mr. Glanville's lip curled scornfully. 'He will not draw my horoscope,' he said; 'has he
      drawn yours?'
'I believe so,' answered the other; 'but what is to befall the unlucky Tom Davenant nobody
      knows, for it is apparently something too terrible, and my cousin has locked up the prediction
      and never speaks of it.'
A pity if anything should befall him, let me tell the reader, for Tom Davenant, as he sat
      there with the fun breaking out at the corners of his mouth, was a marvellously good-looking
      fellow, well-made in every limb, tall and broad-shouldered, with a face so clear and open that
      to see him was to like him. The artist, since their conversation began, had been scanning with
      his practised eye the almost too delicate features of this young English Apollo, meaning
      hereafter to translate him into his own realm of paganism, putting a little more mind into the
      great blue eyes (there was enough in the mobile lips), and surrounding him with the graceful
      Hellenic forms to which, in spite of his modern garb, he was manifestly akin.
'An Apollo,' said Mr. Glanville to himself, 'much exercised at the silver bow—that is to
      say, in slaying birds and beasts, fox-hunting and hare-hunting, but destitute of lute and
      learning, and very shy of the Muses.' And he went on with his mental portraiture.
I wonder what Tom Davenant would have made
       of these reflections had his companion uttered them. He was not conscious in the
      least of the beauty Nature had given him, and thought fishing, hunting, and boating were the
      only business a man had in life, with smoking for a relaxation. He was a perfectly beautiful,
      healthy, guileless, and good-tempered youth, fond of every beast he did not kill. But as for
      Apollo and his lute, he preferred a good fowlingpiece to all the lutes in the world. And he
      was not exactly shy of the Muses, if Mr. Glanville meant thereby feminine society; but he
      thought them uninteresting. Whether he cared for Lady May the uneven tenor of this chronicle
      must show.
The train was stopping at Yalden, a steep, scrambling, irregular village that came stumbling
      down the red sandstone cliff as though it had meant, in a frenzied or heroic mood, to plunge
      straight into the sea, but had been pulled up at the last moment and was now unable to get
      back again. But the sea dealt kindly with it, not suffering trees to grow indeed, and often
      sending great sheets of spray high up into its face, yet tempering the air and encouraging the
      fuchsias and rhododendrons to flourish plenteously in the open, so that when our travellers
      arrived the village was all colour, fragrance, freshness, its houses embowered in the
      exquisite long creeping plants which knew how to shield themselves from the sea-wind, and the
      red sandstone glowing, as the rays of sunset kindled it, like a heavy purple cloak flung
      carelessly on the ground. The
       waters were restless under a freshening breeze, thin lines of foam stretching
      themselves along and curling back as they touched the sands, which at this point make a
      shelly, narrow, and undulating beach. A little way beyond the village, where the sandstone
      yielded to some harder and more primitive rock, might be seen a tiny creek hemmed in by huge
      cliffs, under which, brawling and defiant, rushed one of those short, swift rivers that
      delight in quarrelling with every stone they meet and fall into the sea all foam and trouble.
      It was the Yale, from which Yalden takes its name; and its brief journey began on the moor
      above. There, too, the railway paused, shareholders not being in love with steep gradients and
      preferring to economise their resources, while the one or two small inns of Yalden added to
      theirs by sending flys to meet passengers on alighting.
Mr. Tom Davenant had telegraphed that he might be looked for by such a train, and as he and
      Mr. Glanville leaped on the platform they saw the Earl's brougham awaiting them. With windows
      down and the carriage going at a good pace over the moor, it was a pleasant evening drive;
      though Tom Davenant would have preferred riding, which was to him, as to an Usbeg Tartar, the
      natural way of getting from one place to another. He had talked a great deal for him, being of
      a silent and self-contained disposition, in the last half-hour of their journey; and he was
      not sorry that Mr. Glanville left him to his thoughts as they drove along. The artist, indeed,
       was no more inclined to speak than the hunting-man by his side. He was all eye,
      gazing out upon the rolling moor which unfolded itself before them, now up, now down,
      seemingly boundless, except in one direction where the sky bent over it to the western waters,
      fringing it in this light with a golden line that never wavered, while on the wide waste there
      lay a stillness, intensified by the dying murmur of the sea they were leaving behind. And here
      again the red sandstone glowed purple, the heather looked glorious as the rain of sunshine
      fell upon it, the clouds grew more solemn and appeared to be drawing together, trailing after
      them fiery streamers, and leaving wide spaces of tender pale green vapour, which would melt
      later on into the dark blue of the evening sky and make room for the stars. Strange, too, it
      was to see the lonely boulders, each like a ghost standing in his place on the moor, brought
      thither in the long past time when a river of ice travelled over it, one knows not how, one
      cannot reckon when, grinding its slow way onward till it slipped into the ocean, leaving these
      tokens that once it had been. There were dips full of verdure and flowering shrubs, reaches of
      bare sand, and, as the road bent down and away from the sea, a dark copse or two, sheltered,
      as on a lee shore, by the higher ground, to whose sides they clung timorously. As the carriage
      turned a steep corner and began to ascend again, Glanville perceived that they were entering a
      narrow valley, which widened as it went up to the moor by easy steps,
       and was clothed to the right with underwood which the sun had now ceased to
      illuminate, while to the left all was heath and furze. They were entering the Park. They
      passed one gate and then another; above the trees, which here found no difficulty in growing,
      came out the turrets of a great house. A few more minutes brought the carriage to the broad
      gravel sweep of a terrace facing south-west, along which ran the massive undecorated front of
      Trelingham Court; and the Earl himself, who was walking to and fro as if in expectation of his
      guests, came forward to meet them. He gave each a hand, and bade the artist welcome.
Lord Trelingham certainly bore out his cousin's half-mocking description of him as 'an
      astrologer in a play'; neither white beard, nor velvet gown, nor skull-cap was wanting. He
      wore on his little finger an amethyst inscribed with Solomon's seal; and his wrinkled, tawny
      face, dim eyes, and lean, tremulous figure heightened the effect, making him altogether like a
      man who had stepped down out of a picture and was taking his evening walk, regardless of the
      fact that he had been buried and his portrait counted among the family heirlooms for a couple
      of centuries. He was not so tall as his young cousin, but had an air of dignity which softened
      to the utmost good-nature when the shyness or embarrassment of others called it forth. As he
      stood on the terrace, enjoying the prospect and pointing out the way they had come to
      Glanville, the artist could not help admiring the
       beautiful old man, and asking himself whether immense wealth and high rank always
      did spoil human goodness, as is commonly said. Here was an unspoiled rich man, one of the
      great ones of the earth, yet so gentle and unaffected that to live with him would imply
      neither time-serving nor ceremonious posture-making. It might, however, involve superstitious
      practices, if the Earl were bent on winning disciples to astrology. And Glanville, who had a
      lively fancy, began to smile at a Burke's Peerage recorded in the stars.
They went in, passing through the Great Hall which was to be the scene of Glanville's
      achievements. It was a magnificent room, opening straight on the terrace, and designed for the
      solemn banquets of former days, when a man feasted his tenants and neighbours at the same
      tables and counted his guests by the hundred. It was lighted from above, but at the farther
      end an immense window reaching from floor to ceiling gave a view of the inner court, with its
      lawn and fountain now in shadow, and a screen of dark foliage, the beginning of an extensive
      plantation. Trelingham Court was built in collegiate fashion, sheltering its woods from the
      sea, and sheltered by then in turn from the north-east. 'In half an hour.' said the Earl; 'we
      shall dine, but in a less formal dining-room;' and he left Glanville in the butler's charge.
      That stately gentleman, it is needless to observe,was though perfectly well-bred, much more
      ceremonious than his master. He perpetuated
       in a lower sphere what one has heard of the manners of la vieille cour ,
      that Versailles the graces of which must have been hopelessly lost during the French
      Revolution but for such fortunate survivals. In this diginfied way Glanville was shown to an
      apartment overlooking the front terrace, and giving views of the broken and rock-strewn line
      of coast, beyond which the waters spread out in a golden sheet. The sun was sinking, clear and
      ruddy, on their extreme edge. It was an hour to muse or write verses rather than to dine. But
      the great British evenign sacrifice called for its votary, and Glanville proceeded to attire
      himself in the garb of blackness appropriate thereto.
