CHAPTER VII IN A VAIN SHADOW
There was no need to wait long. By some magic stroke in the heavens a ray of
      sunlight, piercing the sullen clouds, darted in at the door and rested on the sleeper's face.
      It vanished as quickly as it came, but the instantaneous change in the light seemed to have
      dispersed the old man's slumber. Yes, he was unmistakably an old man that now opened his eyes
      and fixed them calmly on Glanville standing by the entrance and watching his motions. He shook
      himself, came forward, and with an easy air inquired of the artist whether he had found him
      sleeping, and how long he had been there. Glanville told him what had really happened; and the
      stranger, thanking him for his courtesy, added that old bones were soon tired, and began to
      look out in silence at the scene before them. It had changed again. The lower clouds, melting
      in rain, were nearly gone; and high above them a livid, unbroken mass of
       vapour stretched over the sky, making a sort of roof that seemed, at the horizon,
      to bend down and rest on a heavy ridge of purple tinged with white. The boiling sea which
      occupied the intervening space was desolate as when Glanville last looked across it, save for
      one object which he did not think to have viewed so nearly. In the midst of the tumbling waves
      he beheld the same vessel which had been visible less than an hour before. It was not so large
      as he thought. With bare poles it had been scudding before the gale, but now it was giving a
      tremendous lurch every moment; and as it turned a broadside towards him there were to be seen
      figures on deck moving about in great confusion. They seemed in evil plight. So intent was
      Glanville on the spectacle that he cried out involuntarily when a red flash from the ship told
      him that a gun had been discharged. 'What is that for?' he said to his companion, not meaning
      to speak aloud. A dull boom came upon his ear as the stranger answered, 'It is a signal of
      distress; she is likely to founder.'
'Good God!' exclaimed Glanville, 'do you mean to tell me she will be wrecked?'
'I think so,' said the other, as if it was a foregone conclusion which did not concern him.
      'See, they are signalling again. They will never get into harbour; if she stands in she will
      go to pieces on the bar. It is a good dozen miles to the next place where she could run in.
      But that is only a roadstead.'
'But the lifeboat,' cried Glanville, in much distress; 'is there no lifeboat on the
      coast?'

'What lifeboat would venture on such a sea?' inquired the stranger. 'It would be merely
      adding to the number of drowned men. Ah, she signals again! It is no use; we shall see her
      heel over in a few minutes.'
'Oh, horrible, horrible!' said the artist. 'To look on, and be so helpless. If we could but
      do something,' and he moved to and fro restlessly, looking round in the hope that help of some
      sort might be putting off from the land. But he could see only the tall vessel staggering
      along and the waves rising over it.
'You never saw a ship go down, I suppose?' said the old man, eyeing him in a way that
      implied some pity and a great deal of scorn. Glanville, struck by the harsh ring in the
      stranger's voice, stopped in his walk and looked, as seeking for an explanation, straight
      across at him. 'What makes you ask?' he said; 'have you? You seem not to mind it much.'
'What difference can it make whether I mind it or no?' retorted the old man. 'It will not
      save one of them from drowning. The play must be played out. Do you think of rushing on the
      stage and rescuing Hamlet or Lear from his fate because you pity him? No, you sit there
      quietly and enjoy your sentimental illusions and your exquisite weeping. This is but a larger
      stage. You can't interfere; be miserable if you must, or if you wish to indulge in the luxury.
      It is all one to the men in that sinking ship. Ha, what a lurch! She cannot stand much more of
      it.'

'Why,' said Glanville, 'you talk as if you had not the heart of a man. What hideous
      nonsense! and at such a time! You are not, you cannot be serious.' The words of the old man
      seemed to him almost as horrible as the shipwreck he was gazing on.
The other answered with astonishing calm. 'When I was your age,' he said, 'I felt as you do.
      I have learnt since not to lament the things I cannot help. We must bear them. The time will
      come, if you live long enough, when you will have witnessed many a ship go down, and be as
      helpless to save them as you are at this moment. Perhaps it is the deepest pity that sheds no
      tears.'
The vessel was again out of sight; but they heard the signal-guns from minute to minute; and
      in Glanville's heart, at least, they excited a sickening sensation, which took away all desire
      of speech. But he thought he must reply.
'Pardon me, sir,' he said, 'if I did not quite understand you. This dreadful scene,—it is
      too much.' He stopped abruptly and turned away. The signal came again, but fainter. His next
      glance seaward showed the horizon one sheet of lightning, and there came crashing down upon
      them a roar of thunder which appeared to be sounding from every quarter of the heavens.
'You will hear no more signal-guns,' said his companion when the tumult ceased; 'that was
      probably the last which came before this overwhelming clap of thunder. Nothing can live when
       sky and sea are gone mad in such fashion. To-morrow planks and spars will be
      thrown up along the coast, and we shall have to lay in this nook, which holds too many
      already, the bodies that may be cast ashore. Well, it is all over now; when the play comes to
      an end the tragedy is out.'
Glanville kept silence. He could not trust himself to speak. The stranger, as though
      thinking aloud, went on in a lower tone: 'The worst is if the curtain should draw up a second
      time. To be wrecked is unpleasant, but the waves close over you, and you sink to sleep as on
      velvet cushions. I remember the keen sense of anticipation. That cuts deep into a man. But
      afterwards is nothing in comparison. No,' he said, rousing himself and speaking to Glanville,
      who was beginning to listen, 'it is coming back to life that I regret, not seeing it slip away
      into the ocean.'
'Were you ever in a shipwreck, then?' asked the young man, softening.
'Once, many years since,' he replied.
'And you escaped easily?'
'I was brought back to life when I had been dead, so far as any one could tell, several
      hours.'
'Were you unconscious all that time?' the artist inquired.
'Utterly so,' he answered; 'and coming back to consciousness was far more dreadful than the
      pangs of drowning. I left half my vitality—the best half, I think—behind me.'

Glanville hastily spoke what was in his mind: 'Is that why you feel so unconcerned?'
'No,' said the other, who seemed incapable of taking offence; 'I think life itself is the
      great shipwreck. Existence is made up of pain. It is always and everywhere pitiable. And we
      are but spectators till our own turn comes to wear the burning crown and be racked and torn.
      You cannot help me, and I cannot help you if you stand in need of help. But the sky is
      clearing now the brave vessel has gone down. Let me wish you good afternoon.'
He stepped out of the porch, and, at the same moment, a gust of wind took his hat and blew
      it some distance. He ran after it bareheaded, stooped, and caught it up again. As he turned
      about, Glanville, who had run to his assistance, perceived with strong amazement that the
      stranger's bare forehead was disfigured with an irrgular seam, the evident trace of a
      sword-stroke. He almost staggered back. It was utterly improbably that here, in this
      churchyard, a casual visitant should be marked like the hero of the tale he had heard in the
      morning. It must be Colonel Valence. He pronounced the name aloud, and was answered instantly.
      'Colonel Valence? What do you want with him? He is here at your service.'
Glanville blushed and stammered. He could not inform Colonel Valence that in the last four
      and twenty hours he had learned to know him intimately, though unacquainted with his name
      before; that he
       had read a most confidential letter written by him over thirty years ago, and
      knew the history of the Madonna of San Lucar. Should he tell Valence of the morning's accident
      to that picture? No, he would tell him nothing. The Colonel saw that a struggle was going on
      in the young man's mind; and as Glanville hesitated to reply, he said, 'Have I had the honour
      of meeting you at any time, sir?'
'Never, to my knowledge,' said the artist; 'but —but I have heard your name,—something, too,
      of your history, of your having fought in Spain when a young man. You lived in this
      neighbourhood once, did you not?'
'I live here still,' answered the Colonel briefly; 'and now, since you appear to be well
      acquainted with my name, may I ask the favour of yours?'
'My name is Rupert Glanville,' the young man replied.
'Rupert Glanville!' repeated his questioner, surprised in turn; 'Glanville the artist?'
'An artist, certainly,' said the modest painter.
Colonel Valence seemed for a while lost in thought. 'Are you staying at the town younder?'
      he inquired, pointing away to the cliff which hid Yalden from them.
'I am staying at Trelingham Court.'
'Oh, at Trelingham Court!' echoed Valence, without moving a muscle. 'Then I wish you
      good-day, sir!' And, as if not a word more was to be said, he turned deliberately towards the
      ascent, and with slow but not feeble steps began his journey homeward, as
       it should seem, for he faced away from Yalden and Trelingham, both of which lay
      on the same side of the country.
Glanville looked after him. There was something, he acknowledged, of the stately grace and
      resolute daring of King Arthur about the man; but what a harsh cynic! how little resembling
      the idea that, in his own mind, the artist had formed while reading the epistle from San
      Lucar! Heroic he might be, and doubtless was; his bearing showed it. But every particle of
      feeling seemed extinguished by the stern and pitiless philosophy that, in the name of pity,
      would not suffer him to care for the calamities which overtook his fellows. And so that was
      Colonel Valence! He was still living, still in the neighbour-hood of Trelingham Court. And
      Lady Alice was dead. In what relation did the two families stand towards each other? He longed
      to know more of the strange story. The thought quickened his pace as he walked up the hill.
      But he was cold and tired; the road appeared steeper than ever, and not until some time after
      the dinner-hour did he reach the front terrace of the Court. As he did so two men wrapped up
      as for a night expedition, and with lanterns in their hands, ran against him. They stopped and
      explained that, in pursuance of the Earl's directions, they were just setting forth in quest
      of him, for his long absence, combined with the fearful storm by which he must have been
      overtaken, had given rise to great anxiety. 'We should have started sooner,
       one of them subjoined, 'but for the accident to Mr. Davenant.'
Glanville was shocked to such a degree that he forgot to thank them for going after himself.
      'What accident?' he hastily inquired.
'One that might have been very serious. Mr. Davenant had been out in the lifeboat and had
      nearly been drowned. He was brought home as soon as men could be spared from attending on the
      wreck.'
'Ah, there was a wreck!' cried Glanville, and he had begun to question them as they arrived
      at the entrance, when, catching sight of Lady May crossing the hall, he ran up to her, and
      begged to know whether her cousin was in any kind of danger.
'I do not think so,' she answered; 'we were beginning to feel more anxious on your account
      than his. The doctor at Yalden ascertained that there was no fracture, but the shoulder has
      received a severe strain. My cousin laughs at the notion that he shall not be about the house
      to-morrow morning. However, we have written to Mrs. Davenant in town. He has been ordered to
      keep his bed, and we must see that he obeys. He takes any mishap to himself very lightly—too
      lightly indeed.'
'And was he out with the lifeboat?' inquired Glanville, feeling very kindly towards the
      young man, and silently contrasting him with Colonel Valence, not to the latter's
      advantage.
'Why, it was all Cousin Tom's doing,' said Lady May. 'You shall hear the story at dinner,
      for'—
       interrupting herself to look at his weather-beaten state —'you must change at
      once, Mr. Glanville, and come down as soon as you are ready. Dinner is late, owing to my
      cousin's accident.' She rang, and instructed the housekeeper to see that Mr. Glanville was
      treated as an invalid. 'It is the only way to keep you from becoming so,' she added. Under
      such gracious care did the artist appear at dinner. He looked pale and tired; with a paleness,
      however, which set off his bright hair and intellectual features to exceeding advantage. He
      was not so good-looking as Tom Davenant; but 'he was well enough.'
They were a small party. Mr. Truscombe and Lord Hallamshire had gone down to the wreck; and
      the Earl, who was very fond of his cousin, could not be induced to quit his bedside until that
      young man was satisfactorily asleep. The only remaining gentleman besides Glanville was an
      elderly squire, who lived a long way across the moor and had come to enjoy a few days fishing
      at Trelingham. He was a good-natured, silent creature, not easily roused to express sentiment
      of any kind, good or bad; and while he made you comfortable in his presence (which some silent
      men are far from doing), you could not expect him even to ask a question. But Glanville was
      ready to ask a thousand; and Lady May and the Countess were only too willing to satisfy
      him.
He could ask questions, but he could neither eat nor drink. The light and warmth of the
      dining-room were grateful to him physically, and took away the
       chill sense of desolation which so many hours in the churchyard, under the
      pelting storm, had inflicted; but his memory was full of the dreadful sight, and yet more
      dreadful imagination, which had mastered him while gazing at the tossing ship. He could not
      choose but think of it again and again, and, though he knew not one of the human beings she
      carried, it would prove an intense relief should any, by the gallant exertions of Tom
      Davenant, have escaped destruction. 'How came Mr. Davenant to be at Yalden?' he asked.
The Countess, who exhibited a curious mixture of excited gaiety and sudden relapses into the
      terror which had laid hold of her that afternoon, answered plaintively, 'It was partly my
      doing that he went. For I knew that this week there was to be a salmon-hunt in the Yale; and I
      have never seen one; and I thought I would get Cousin Tom to instruct me a little beforehand;
      and so I persuaded him to ride to Yalden for some tackle, because I was to have a lesson in
      fly-fishing to-morrow. It was all just to understand what fishing is like. Of course I
      couldn't join in the salmon-hunt, much as I might long for it. But I never thought Cousin Tom
      would persuade the men to go out in a lifeboat. Oh, May,' she cried, with a piteousness in her
      voice that Glanville could not laugh at, although he felt there was a comic element some-where
      in it, 'are you quite sure that Tom will not be hurt for life?'
'The doctor is quite sure,' answered Lady May;
       'don't distress yourself, Karina. Tom will be himself in a day or two, if he
      keeps quiet,—and if you do,' she added somewhat mockingly.
'For, you see, Mr. Glanville,' the Countess went on, 'he really did put himself into the
      greatest danger. The men told us that brought him. He would insist on getting alone into the
      lifeboat and taking it across the bar, as they call it, and—'
'My dear Karina, we shall hardly understand the story if you tell it in that way,' said Lady
      May. 'Cousin Tom was brave enough, but he was not out of his mind. The fact seems to have
      been,' she continued, looking towards Glanville, 'that when my cousin was choosing the
      fishing-tackle for the Countess, in a shop not far from the promenade, he saw people running
      down to the waterside and heard them shouting that a vessel was standing-in, showing signals
      of distress. He thought he had heard a minute-gun discharged; but there was so much thunder
      that he had not dwelt on the notion. Following the crowd, he arrived on the beach at the same
      moment with half a dozen fishermen, well known to him, who were passing the wet afternoon in a
      tavern close at hand. The air was so full of mist that even with glasses little more of the
      vessel could be made out than her size, which seemed considerable, and the direction in which
      she appeared to be going; for she was not standing-in to Yalden, but making for the roadstead
      to the north.'
'I saw her at that point, I am sure,' said Glanville;
       and he described how she had repeatedly fired minuteguns and received no
      answer.
'You could not have heard the answer,' said Lady May, 'had any been given, with the high
      cliff between you and Yalden beach. But, in fact, there were no signal rockets; and the
      sailors had only their fowling-pieces. About the rockets there has been, my cousin says, some
      extraordinary mistake. But to go on with the story. You heard, I make no doubt, an unusually
      violent peal of thunder, which seemed to finish the worst part of the storm?' Glanville nodded
      assent. It was when Colonel Valence had given the vessel up for lost, and when she had, in
      fact, disappeared from their view.
'Well, no sooner had the awful sound died away than the ship came swiftly round the edge of
      the cliff, as though driven by a hurricane, and made straight for the bar, over which the
      waves were breaking with the utmost fury. The excitement on shore became intolerable. My
      cousin had persuaded the fishermen to get out the lifeboat and make her ready for sea; and
      thus far they were willing, although not one of them but assured him that it could never be
      launched. By dint of coaxing and commanding, however, launched it was; a crew was brought
      together, and with immense difficulty they had got her a few yards from land, when she was
      flung on shore again and stranded. My cousin implored them to try once more; they refused; and
      it was then that he told them, in a desperate sort of way he sometimes has,
       that he would venture alone rather than see a shipful of helpless beings perish
      before his eyes. That shamed them; and, for the second time, as the vessel was rounding the
      High Cliff, they managed, with Tom for their captain, to launch the boat and get it as close
      to the bar as they dared. Further it was impossible to go; indeed, they hardly knew how to
      keep the lifeboat afloat, when the vessel struck on the bar, and its crew of four or five and
      twenty—I cannot tell the exact number—was seen struggling in the waves. It must have been
      heartrending to look on. The lifeboat did wonders. Ropes were thrown out, and nine or ten poor
      creatures rescued; while, as the sea was now slightly calmer, the rest, who had clung to what
      they could, were able, all except three or four, to keep floating till a second boat went out.
      Poor Cousin Tom, however, who had been so active and undaunted all through, was not to come
      off scatheless. The heavy sea carried the lifeboat a long distance from the point they
      endeavoured to make. It was driven inshore unexpectedly; and as it touched, a projecting piece
      of timber struck Cousin Tom on the shoulder, knocking him off deck into the shallows. It is a
      marvel that he escaped being crushed. He was carried some distance by the returning wave; and
      but for a young fisher-lad who instantly plunged in and brought him out—Poor dear Tom!' said
      Lady May, stopping in her narrative as the thought of his peril came home to her; 'what a
      brave fellow he is! and how could we have borne to lose him!'

Karina, who had for some time been listening with her hands clasped, was crying like a
      child, and could not speak for tears. She looked very pretty and innocent so, like a white
      rose upon which the rain is falling in heavy drops, while the sun lights them up.
Glanville, who felt himself liking Tom Davenant more and more, said, when the silence was
      becoming rather painful, 'Your cousin behaved nobly. I hope he was not left long without
      proper attention.'
'He was much shaken,' replied Lady May, 'and confused for a while, but not, he tell me,
      unconscious. They took him to a little cottage on shore, but he insisted on walking to the
      doctor's, and when he arrived there fainted. The doctor happened to be at home; he had to
      decide in a moment whether to leave my cousin or to examine his hurt before going down to the
      wreck. However, he gave it in Tom's favour, saying that but for him there would have been no
      other patients to attend to. He declares that there is only a strain, which will go off, and
      that nothing is displaced or broken. A carriage was got ready, and came on slowly with my
      cousin, while one of the men very kindly ran on before, to inform us of what had happened.
      There was much gentle feeling shown on all sides.'
Again Glanville's thoughts reverted to Colonel Valence. But he would not speak of him. 'Is
      it certain that any are lost?' was his next question.
'We shall not know till to-morrow, when Lord
       Hallamshire returns. But I fear that some were lost at the moment of
      foundering,' said Lady May.
'Do you think their bodies will be recovered? Would they be buried in Trelingham cemetery,
      if they were?' he asked.
'Yes,' she replied; 'it is the only place at hand. You may have observed, if the storm
      allowed you to walk about the churchyard, how many graves there are of persons drowned.
      Shipwrecks are common on this terrible coast.'
'There were not five minutes of clear weather,' he replied, 'while I was in the porch. But I
      can imagine it is so.'
He would not mention Colonel Valence. Glanville, spending much of his time alone, and
      keeping his own confidence because he had none to share it, had fallen into a habit of
      reserve, which often induced him to be silent when he was, as now, living in a domestic
      circle. What harm could there be in saying that he had come across a man whose name, since he
      lived in their neighbourhood, must often be heard at Trelingham? However, he did not choose to
      repeat his disagreeable adventure; and he was spared the temptation, thanks to the Countess
      Karina, who, in her vivacious manner, was perpetually recurring to the event of the
      afternoon—admiring, fearing, and hoping by turns as the thought of Tom Davenant's heroism, of
      his danger, and the many perils he had escaped already on the hunting-field and the river,
      came uppermost. All this, from the peculiar lightness
       of accent which distinguished the fair lady, and the impossibility of a cloud
      resting long on her transparent brow and sparkling eyes, seemed to Glanville like a fantastic
      interlude weaving itself up with the horror of the shipwreck and the simple manliness of
      Cousin Tom. He laughed inwardly, tired and depressed as he felt, at the naïve affection which
      would not let the Countess be silent. Was she engaged to her cousin? It did not seem so. She
      was not more than his age, if so much; but there was a tone about her that implied the
      enjoyment of more freedom than is usual in young unmarried ladies, even when engaged. That she
      was exceedingly interested in Mr. Tom Davenant no one with eyes in his head could help seeing;
      not even the placid sportsman, Glanville supposed, who had looked and listened in silence
      imperturbable during the whole of the narrative, only remarking, when it was concluded, that
      he knew the man whose stack of timber that was nigh which Mr. Tom had come to grief. He was a
      sawyer named Frampton, and ought to have taken it away a good week ago to his yard at
      Plymouth.
'I wish he had, then,' cried Karina. 'Don't you think, May,' she observed next moment, 'that
      we ought to send up and ask how Cousin Tom is now?'
'Papa will join us in the drawing-room,' answered Lady May, 'and he will tell us.' On which
      hint the other lady rose, and Glanville was left to the company of Squire Huffington. The
      squire drank his wine
       quietly, in moderation, and as with a conscience void of offence; although in
      the course of ten minutes he did but open his lips once for the purpose of conversation, and
      then merely to emphasise the delinquency of sawyer Frampton, on which he had before
      animadverted. 'He ought to have taken that stack away a good week ago,' he said. Glanville
      could not but agree with him; and after this brilliant dialogue they joined the ladies, just
      as Lord Trelingham came from his cousin's room. He gave a reassuring account of Mr. Tom,
      except that he could not sleep long together because of the pain. But a good deal of pain, the
      nurse said, was better than insensibility at that stage; and the patient took it all as a
      matter of course, and was very obedient to orders. While the Earl spoke he glanced uneasily at
      Lady May, who neither avoided nor sought his observation. The Countess he patted on the head,
      but otherwise gave her no great share of attention. Glanville went to bed saying, 'I wonder
      which of them is engaged to Cousin Tom?' But he was too cold and wretched to pursue the
      subject, and he spent a miserable night, feeling more feverish than he liked to own.
