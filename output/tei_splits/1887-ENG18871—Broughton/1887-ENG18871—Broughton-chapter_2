CHAPTER II.
"JACK and I got in our last hayload to-day, without a drop of rain; the first bit of good
     luck that has come to us, I don't know when. If we had any land, I should imagine that we must
     have a bit of consecrated ground among it, to account for our ill-fortune; but as we have not
     of our own enough to pasture a goose upon, that cannot be it. Such an odd thing happened
     to-day—Robert Brandon proposed to me: it is the first offer I ever had, though I was seventeen
     last month. If it is never a more pleasant process than it was to-day, I hope sincerely it may
     be the last. I said 'Yes,' too; at least, a species of Yes after half-a-dozen Noes; I cannot
     imagine why, for I certainly did not
      feel Yes. I suppose I must have been pleased at any one
     wishing for my company during the term of his natural life."
The name on the fly-leaf of this journal-book is Esther Craven, Glan-yr-Afon, and the date
      July 10, 186—. July is very often a rather wet month—not so this year; all
     through its one-and-thirty days the sky was like brass, as it looked to Elijah (the Seer's)
     eyes on the top of Carmel, when, by his faith, he brought up the tarrying rain from the sea's
     chambers. London is pouring out her noble army of haberdashers and greengrocers into Ramsgate
     and Margate, and Scarborough and Llandudno. The John Gilpins of to-day are not satisfied with a
     modest outing to the "Bell" at Edmonton, "all in a chaise and pair."
Armies of schoolboys are devouring arid sandwiches and prime old buns in railway refreshment
     rooms—schoolboys emptied out of every school and seminary and college all over the country.
     Highly paid instructors of youth are stretching their cramped legs up the steep sides of
     Helvellyn and Mont Blanc, and surveying the "frozen hurricane" of the glaciers through their
     academic spectacles. And young Craven's (of Glan-yr-Afon) last hayload is safely stacked, as
     you heard from his sister's diary. This morning the highest lying of the upland fields was
     hilly with haycocks: to-night it is as flat as Salisbury Plain. All day long the waggons have
     gone grinding and crunching up and down the rocky mountain road between field and rick-yard.
     All day long Evan and Hugh and Roppert (sic) with their waistcoats open and their
     brown arms bared, aided and abetted by various Cambrian matrons, with bonnets standing upright
     on their heads, and pitchforks in their lily hands, have been tossing the scented
     bundles—sweeter in death than in life, like a good man's fame—into the carts; loading them till
     of the shaft horse nought but ears and nose and forelegs appeared, save to the eye of faith.
     All day long
      Esther has been sitting under a haycock, as one might fancy
     Solomon's wise woman doing, "looking well to the ways of her household." The hay
     moulds itself pliably into a soft arm-chair for her young, slight figure, and the big
     hay-spiders walk up her back at their leisure, and explore the virgin forests of her thick dusk
     hair. She has had her luncheon brought out to her there—bread and milk in a white bowl. It is
     unsocial, surly work, eating alone; one feels reduced to the level of a dog, cracking bones,
     and lapping up gravy out of his trencher, all by himself, with tail well down, like a pump
     handle, and a growl and a snap for any brother dog who may approach to share his feast.
The haymakers were much cheerier—"couched at ease" under the nutty hedgerow,
     bringing slices of unnaturally fat bacon out of blue and white spotted pocket-handkerchiefs,
     gabbling to one another in the Welsh tongue, which, to one who occupies the room of the
     unlearned, has always a querulous, quarrelsome, interrogative sound, and digging their clasp
     knives into the ground to clean them, when their services were no longer required. Jack is out
     for the day, and the place feels stupid without him. There is not much melody in "I paddle my
     own canoe," but one misses it when one is accustomed to hear it echoing gaily over the crofts
     and through the farm-yard and orchard. It would be impossible to talk more dog-Welsh than Jack
     does to his workmen; but even the mellifluous tongue of the Cymri, with its three or four
     consonants standing together, undissevered by any vowel, is made harmonious, enunciated by a
     young, clear voice, that sounds as if it had never been the vehicle for sorrowful words. 
"The village seems asleep or dead,
Now Lubin is away,"
 and Esther, though she has entered upon her eighteenth year (an age which a century
     ago would have been rather
      overripe—Chloe and Cynthia and Phyllis being considered in
     their prime at fifteen, and toasted accordingly), has as yet no Lubin but her brother. Now and
     again, Gwen the cook, and Sarah the housemaid, came panting up the hill in lilac cotton gowns
     and trim white aprons, bearing beer in every jug and mug and tin pipkin that Glan-yr-Afon
     affords, as Evangeline brought the nut-brown ale to the reapers of the village of Grand Pré.
     And the haymakers drink insatiably, and wipe the thirsty mouth upon the convenient sleeve as
     artless Nature bids. By-and-by artless Nature makes them rather unsteady on their legs. As they
     lead the heavy-laden cart to the last remaining haycock, the one on which their mistress sits
     enthroned, I am not at all sure that they do not see two haycocks, two wide-leaved white hats,
     two Esthers. Perceiving their condition, though too old an inhabitant of Wales to be in any
     degree surprised at what is, after all, the normal condition of the Welsh, Miss Craven rises
     precipitately. Driven from her fortress, she picks up her needles and threads, and Jack's
     shirt, from which, as usual, the frequent button is missing, and runs lightly down the mountain
     path in her strong country boots, which bid defiance to the sharp stones that crop out at every
     step through the limestone soil. At the hall door—a little arched door like a church's, with a
     trellised porch and benches, such as one sees Dutch boors sitting on with their beer and
     schnapps, in Teniers' pictures—Sarah meets her. Sarah is an Englishwoman.
"Mr. Brandon is in the parlour, 'm."
"Parlour! My good Sarah, how many times shall I adjure you, by all you hold most sacred, to
     say drawing-room?"
"He has been there best part of half-an-hour, 'm."
"Poor man! how lively for him! why on earth didn't you come and call me?"

"He said as he wasn't in no partikler hurry, and he'd as lieve as not wait till you come in.
     Stop a bit, Miss Esther, you have got some hay on your frock behind."
"People of seventeen wear gowns, not frocks, Sarah. Oh! there, that will do. If I had a
     haystack disposed about my person, he would never be a bit the wiser."
Half-an-hour passes, and Mr. Brandon is still in the "parlour." It is seven o'clock, and
     dinner-time. Would you so long in saying, and whether it is anything likely to reconcile Miss
     Craven to the loss of her dinner? A little room that looks towards the sun-setting; a little
     room full of evening sunshine and the smell of tea-roses; a light paper, with small, bright
     flower-bunches on the walls; white muslin curtains; a general air of crisp freshness, as of a
     room that there are no climbing, crawling, sticky-fingered children to crumple and rumple. A
     young woman, rather red in the face, standing in one corner. She has been driven thither
     apparently by a young man, who is standing before her, and who is still redder. At a rough
     calculation, you would say that the young man was seven feet high; but put him with his back
     against the wall, with his heels together, and his chin in, and you will find that he is
     exactly six feet four; that is, four inches taller than any man who wishes to do work in the
     world, and find horses to carry him, ought to be. His clothes are rather shabby, and he looks
     poor; but, from the crown of his close-clipped head to the sole of his big feet, a gentleman,
     every inch of him, though he has no "gude braid claith" to help to make him so.
     His features may be Apollo's or Apollyon's, for all you can see of them, so thickly are they
     planted out with a forest of yellow hair; but tears do not seem to be at any immense distance
     from eyes blue as the sky between storm clouds, fearless as a three-years' child's.

"Don't you think that we do very well as we are?" says the young woman, suggestively.
"I don't know about you, I'm sure. I know I've lost a stone and a half within the last year,"
     replies the young man, very ruefully.
Esther laughs. "There is some little of you left still," she says, with rather a mischievous
     glance up at the two yards and a half of enamoured manhood before her.
This is what has been over-roasting the mutton. He has been asking her to take his heart, his
     large hand, and the half of one hundred and twenty pounds a year (the exorbitant pay of a
     lieutenant in Her Majesty's infantry), of an old hunting watch, and a curly retriever dog; and
     she has been declining these tempting offers, one and all. The minute hand of the gilt clock,
     on which Minerva sits in a helmet and a very tight gown, with her legs dangling down, has
     travelled from 6.30 to 7.5, and within these five-and-thirty minutes Miss Craven has refused
     three proposals, all made by the same person: the first, very stoutly and mercilessly, from
     Jack's arm-chair, where she had originally taken up her position; the second, decisively still,
     but with less cruelty, from the music-stool, to which she had next retired; and the third, in a
     hasty and wavering manner, from the corner, in which she has taken final refuge, in a strong,
     fortified entrenchment behind the writing-table.
"But—but—" says Esther, her rebellious mouth giving little twitches every now and then as at
     some lurking thought of the ridiculous—"it's—it's such a very odd idea! I don't think
     I ever was more surprised in my life. When Sarah told me that you were here, I thought that, of
     course, you had come to say something about that bone-dust. Why, you never said anything at all
     tending this way before."
"Didn't I?" answers the young giant, with a crestfallen look. "I tried several times, but I
     don't think that you
      could have understood what I meant, for you always began to
     laugh."
"I always do laugh at civil speeches," answers the girl simply. "I don't know how else to
     take them: I suppose it is because I have had so few addressed to me; they always sound to me
     so niais."
"I'm not a bit surprised at your not liking me," he says, with humility. "I don't see how any
     one could at first. I know that I'm ugly and awkward, and don't understand things quick—"
"I don't dis-like you," interrupts Esther, with magnanimity, quite affected by her
     lover's description of his own undesirability. "Why should I? There is nothing in you to
     dislike; you are very good-natured, I'm sure," damning with faint praise, in the laudable
     effort not to be unqualifiedly uncomplimentary.
"I know what an unequal exchange it is that I am offering," says Brandon, too humble to
     resent, and yet with a dim sense of mortification at the quantity and quality of praise
     bestowed upon him. "I know of how much more value you are than I!"
She does not contradict him; her own heart echoes his words. "I am of more value than he; I
     shall find it out practically some day."
"That was why I was in such a hurry to speak," he says eagerly. "I felt sure that if I did
     not, you would be snapped up directly by some one else."
She laughs rather grimly. "You might have laid aside your alarms on that head, I think. I
     don't know who there is about here to snap me up."
Silence for a few minutes: Esther takes up a penwiper, fashioned into a remote resemblance to
     a chimney sweep, and studies its anatomy attentively. "Shall I upset the writing-table and make
     a rush past him? No, the ink
      would spoil the carpet, and he would only come again
     to-morrow, and hunt me into the other corner. Poor fellow! I hope he is not going to cry, or go
     down on his knees!"
Whether mindful or not of the fate of Gibbon the historian, who, having thrown himself on his
     knees before his lady-love, was unable, through extreme fat, to get up again, Brandon does not
     indulge in either of the demonstrations that Esther apprehended. He stands quiet, cramming half
     a yard of yellow beard into his mouth, and says presently:
"Well, I suppose I must not worry you any more; it is not good manners, is it? A man ought to
     be satisfied with one No; I have given you the trouble of saying three."
"It's very disagreeable, I'm sure," says Esther, wrinkling up her forehead in an embarrassed
     fashion, "and I hate saying No to any one: I don't mean in this way, because nobody ever asked
     me before, but about anything; but what can I do?"
"Try me!" he says very eagerly, stretching out his hand across the narrow table (all but
     upsetting the standish en route). "I don't want to threaten
     you, saying that I should go to the dogs if you threw me over, for I should not; that always
     seemed to me a cowardly sort of thing to do; and, besides, I should have my mother left to live
     for if the worst came to the worst; but you must see that it is everything in the world to a
     fellow to have one great hope in it to keep him straight."
Soft music in the distance; some one whistling "I paddle my own canoe" somewhere about the
     house; Esther, in an agony between the fear of subversing the table, and the hundredfold worse
     fear of being discovered by Jack in an unequivocally sentimental position, of which she would
     never hear the last. "Very well, very well, I'll—I'll think about it; could you be so
     very kind as to loose my hand?"
He complies reluctantly, and she, that there may be no
      further discussion about it, hides it discreetly away in her
     jacket pocket. "I paddle my own canoe" dies away in the distance; apparently it was on its way
     to dress for dinner. Esther draws a sigh of relief. "I thought that some one was coming."
"And if they had?"
"Why, I did not relish the idea of being found driven into a corner, like a child at a dame's
     school, and you, like the dame, standing over me," answers she, abandoning the struggle with
     the corners of her mouth, and bubbling over with the facile laughter of seventeen. Utterly
     unable to join in her merriment, he stands leaning in awkward misery against the wall; all
     other griefs are at least respectable; love-sorrows, alone, are only ludicrous.
"It really is so silly," says Esther, presently, compassionate but impatient. "Do try and get
     the better of it!"
"Easier said than done," he answers ruefully. "I might as well advise you to get the better
     of your affection for Jack."
"I don't see the parallel," rejoined she, coldly, feeling as if there was sacrilege in the
     comparison. "My love for Jack is a natural instinct, built too upon the foundation of lifelong
     obligations, endless benefits, countless kindnesses. What kindness have I ever shown you? I
     sewed a button on your glove once, and once I pinned a rose on your coat."
"I have the rose still."
She says "Pshaw!" pettishly, and turns away her head.
"Perhaps you are afraid of marrying on small means?" suggests Brandon, diffidently, after a
     while.
The gentle clatter and click of dishes carried into the dining-room enters faintly through
     the shut door. Esther's heart sinks within her. Is he going to begin all over again?—round and
     round, like a thunderstorm among hills?

"I am afraid of marrying on any means," she says, comprehensively. "I particularly
     dislike the idea; marriage seems to me the end of everything, and I am at the beginning."
"But I don't want you to marry me now," cries Robert, stammering.
"Don't you? You told me just now that you did."
"For pity's sake, Esther, don't laugh! it may be play to you, but it is death to me."
"I'm not laughing."
"Perhaps some day you will feel what I am feeling now."
"Perhaps" (doubtfully).
"And you will find then that it is no laughing matter."
"Perhaps" (still more doubtfully).
The clamour of a fresh cohort of plates shaking noisily upon a tray warns Brandon that his
     time is short.
"Esther!" with a sort of despair in his voice, clashing the ridiculous with the pathetic—they
     are always twin sisters —"I could live upon such a little hope."
"What would you have me say?" she cries, standing with fluttering colour, tapping feet, and
     irritated eyes. "I have told you the plain truth, and it does not please you; must I dress up
     some pretty falsehood, and tell you that I fell in love with you at first sight, or that after
     all I find that you are the only man in the world that can make me really happy?"
"Say nothing of the kind!" he answers, wincing under her irony. "I have not much to recommend
     me, we all know that, and I start with the disadvantage of your thinking me rather a bore than
     otherwise; but other men have overcome even greater obstacles; why should not I? Give me at
     least a trial!"
She is silent.

"Say that you will try to like me; there need be no untruth in that."
"But if I fail!" says Esther, wavering—partly in sheer weariness of the contest, partly in
     womanly pity for sufferings which owe their rise to the excess of her own charms.
"If you fail you will not have to tell me so; I shall find it out for myself, and—and I shall
     bear it, I suppose." He ends with a heavy sigh at that too probable possibility.
"And you will console yourself by telling all your friends what a flirt I am, and how ill I
     treated you." Apparently he does not think this suggestion worthy of refutation; at least he
     does not refute it. "Or, if you don't, your mother will."
"Not she" (indignantly).
"Or, if she does not, your sisters will."
"Not they" (less indignantly).
"And if—if—after a long while—a very long while—I succeed in liking you a little—mind, I
     don't say that I shall; on contrary, I think it far more probable that I shall not—but if I do,
     you won't expect me to marry you?"
He smiles, despite himself. "I can hardly promise that."
"I mean not for many years, till Jack is married, and I am quite, quite
     old—five-and-twenty or so?"
"It shall be as you wish."
"And if, as is most likely, I continue not to care about you, and am obliged to tell you so,
     you will not think the worse of me."
" No."
"You are certain?"
"Certain. Whatever you do, I shall love you to-day, and to-morrow, and always," says the
     young fellow, very solemnly; and his eyes go away past her, through the window, and up to the
     blue sky overhead, as if calling on
      the great pale vault to be witness between him and her.
As for her, her prosaic soul has wandered back to the mutton; she takes the opportunity of
     his eyes being averted to steal a glance at the clock. Apparently, however, he has eyes in the
     back of his head, for he says hastily, with rather a pained smile: "You are longing for me to
     go."
" No—o."
"I ought not to have come at this time of night. I ought to have waited till to-morrow, I
     know."
"It is rather late."
"But to-morrow seemed such a long time off, that I thought I must know the worst or the best
     before the sun came up again. I don't quite know which it is now; which is it, Esther?" 
"It's neither the one nor the other; it's the second best," she answers, all smiles again at
     seeing some prospect of her admirer's departure, and forgetting, with youthful heedlessness,
     the price at which that departure has been bought. "It is that I really am very much obliged,
     though, all the same I wish you would think better of it, and that I'll try; I will, really;
     don't look as if you did not believe me."
So with this half-loaf he goes, passes away through the little wooden porch, that is so low
     it looks as if it were going to knock his tall head, past the stables, and through the oak
     woods, home
