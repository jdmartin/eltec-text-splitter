CHAPTER XXI.
SO the blinds are drawn down; a sort of notice that people put in their windows, saying, "Do
     not look in, or you will see Death!" and the few neighbours round drive up and inquire how Miss
     Craven is, and are informed that she is pretty well. And the servants each do the other's work;
     and there is a general interesting bouleversement in the
     household, and much chattering and crying and a stream of visitors in the kitchen. And Brandon
     goes hither and thither, taking upon himself all the drear work of arranging Jack's final
     departure from his home among the mountains, and keeping at bay his mothers and sisters, who,
     armed with bibles, hymnals, and " Reflections for a Mourner," are prepared to sally forth in
     proselytising ardour upon the conquest of Esther's soul. And Esther herself is, for the time,
     soulless as the fair marble mask in the quiet room up stairs. 
 "His lips are very mild and meek;
Though one should smite him on the cheek,
Or on the mouth, he will not speak."

If ary one were to smite her on lip or cheek, neither would she resent it or complain; she
     sits in an armchair, in the drawing-room, with her hands folded in her lap, and the servants
     bring her tea every half-hour (incessant tea being supposed to be the necessary accompaniment
     of great grief), and request her to "keep up." So she sits in the armchair all day long-trying
     to be sorry, trying to weep. She has had Sarah in, and has made her tell her all the
     particulars of her brother's last hours; has listened attentively while the woman—the easy
     tears streaming down her cheeks—relates how "Mr. Brandon was with poor master all along, from
     the very first, and if he had been his own born brother, he could not have been kinder," and
     how he lifted him up in his arms, and laid his head on his shoulder—" Master could breathe
     easier so, poor dear young gentleman!—and he (master) had been so pleasant-spoken to
     the last, and had said, said he, 'God bless you, old fellow! I'd have done as much for you, if
     I had had the chance;' and how, about seven o'clock, he had asked what o'clock it was—we all
     knew what that meant—and had then seemed to fall asleep in Mr. Brandon's arms, and just as the
     clock struck eight, he gave a sigh—like that—and a sort of pleasant bit of a smile, and was
     gone all in a minute!" It is very touching, but it does not touch Esther. She rises and walks
     into the hall, and looks at his greatcoat and his hat, and kisses his gloves, that seem to
     retain somewhat of the shape of the kind hands that once filled them. She thinks resolutely of
     how he has been her one friend throughout life; thinks of the presents he gave her, and of how
     seldom he went to any town without bringing her some little remembrance back from it; thinks of
     that last five-pound note, so hardly spared, and yet so very gladly given; thinks of how poor
     he was, how slight, how young. But it is all no good; it seems to her like some pathetic tale
     about a
      stranger that she is telling herself. And the days pass, and
     she grows weak from inanition, but refuses all food. If she can be unnatural, horrible enough
     to feel hunger and thirst now Jack is dead, at all events she will not indulge her low nature;
     and so she eats not, and her pulse grows feeble, 
"And all the wheels of being slow!"  So it comes to pass that she
     falls sick and is carried up to bed, and lies there half in sleep, half in insensibility. And
     the mornings and the evenings go by, and Jack's burial-day comes. They had hoped that it would
     have passed without her knowing, but it was not so. Now that he is leaving his home for this
     last time, he does not go light-springing down the stairs, as at other times, but with much
     tramping of strange feet, with purposed muffling of strange voices. How can she fail to hear, 
"The steps of the bearers heavy and slow?" 
Through all her trance it breaks; from her little latticed window, with her sick limbs
     trembling beneath her, and her miserable eyes nailed to the gaoler coffin, in whose strait
     custody her dead lies prisoned, she sees the drooped pall and the black-scarfed mourners. These
     mourners are but few, for Jack—though now awfuller than any absolutest monarch—was, in life,
     poor and of little consequence: the gap made by the extinction of that one young life is but
     narrow. Standing there, she feels a pang of bitter regret and anguish that there are not more
     people to be sorry for Jack. And so, being weak, the fountains of her soul are broken up within
     her, and she falls to weeping mightily; and, but for that weeping, she would, perchance, have
     died, some say; but I think not—for why should grief, being our natural element, kill us any
     more than water the fish, or air the bird?
