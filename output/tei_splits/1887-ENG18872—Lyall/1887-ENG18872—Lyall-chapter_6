MY SIXTH STAGE
But whispering tongues can poison truth.Coleridge.
London in early September is a somewhat trying place.  Mark Shrewsbury found it less pleasing
     in reality than in his visions during the dinner-party at Dulminster.  True, his chambers were
     comfortable, and his type-writer was as invaluable a machine as ever, and his novel was drawing
     to a successful conclusion; but though all these things were calculated to cheer him, he was
     nevertheless depressed.  Town was dull, the heat was trying, and he had never in his life found
     it so difficult to settle down to work.  He began to agree with the Preacher, that “of making
     many books there is no end,” and that, in spite of his favourite “Remington’s perfected No. 2,”
     novel-writing was a weariness to the flesh.  Soon he drifted into a sort of vague idleness,
     which was not a good, honest holiday, but just a lazy waste of time and brains.  I was pleased
     to observe this, and was not slow to take advantage of it.  Had he stayed in Pump Court he
     might have forgotten me altogether in his work, but in the soft luxury of his Club life I found
     that I had a very fair chance of being passed on to some one else.
One hot afternoon, on waking from a comfortable nap in the depths of an armchair at the Club,
     Shrewsbury was greeted by one of his friends.
“I thought you were in Switzerland, old fellow!” he exclaimed, yawning and stretching
     himself.
“Came back yesterday—awfully bad season—confoundedly dull,” returned the other.  “Where have
     you been?”
“Down with Warren near Dulminster.  Deathly dull hole.”
“Do for your next novel.  Eh?” said the other with a laugh.
Mark Shrewsbury smiled good-naturedly.
“Talking of novels,” he observed, with another yawn, “I heard such a story down there!”
“Did you?  Let’s hear it.  A nice little scandal would do instead of a pick-me-up.”
“It’s not a scandal.  Don’t raise your expectations.  It’s the story of a successful
     scoundrel.”
And then I came out again in full vigour—nay, with vastly increased powers; for though Mark
     Shrewsbury did not add very much to me, or alter my appearance, yet his graphic words made me
     much more impressive than I had been under the management of Mrs. Selldon.
“H’m! that’s a queer story,” said the limp-looking young man from Switzerland.  “I say, have
     a game of billiards, will you?”
Shrewsbury, with prodigious yawn, dragged himself up out of his chair, and the two went off
     together.  As they left the room the only other man present looked up from his newspaper,
     following them with his eyes.
“Shrewsbury the novelist,” he thought to himself.  “A sterling fellow!  And he heard it from
     an Archdeacon’s wife.  Confound it all! the thing must be true then.  I’ll write and make full
     inquiries about this Zaluski before consenting to the engagement.”
And, being a prompt, business-like man, Gertrude Morley’s uncle sat down and wrote the
     following letter to a Russian friend of his who lived at St. Petersburg, and who might very
     likely be able to give some account of Zaluski:—
Dear Leonoff,—Some very queer stories are afloat about a young Polish merchant, by
      name Sigismund Zaluski, the head of the London branch of the firm of Zaluski and Zernoff, at
      St. Petersburg.  Will you kindly make inquiries for me as to his true character and history? 
      I would not trouble you with this affair, but the fact is Zaluski has made an offer of
      marriage to one of my wards, and before consenting to any betrothal I must know what sort of
      man he really is.  I take it for granted that “there is no smoke without fire,” and that there
      must be something in the very strange tale which I have just heard on the best authority.  It
      is said that this Sigismund Zaluski left St. Petersburg in March 1881, after the assassination
      of the late Czar, in which he was seriously compromised.  He is said to be an out-and-out
      Nihilist, an atheist, and, in short, a dangerous, disreputable fellow.  Will you sift the
      matter for me?  I don’t wish to dismiss the fellow without good reason, but of course I could
      not think of permitting him to be engaged to my niece until these charges are entirely
      disproved.With kind remembrances to your father,I am, yours faithfully Henry
       Crichton-Morley.
