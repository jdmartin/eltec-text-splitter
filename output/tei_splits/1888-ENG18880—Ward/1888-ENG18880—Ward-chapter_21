CHAPTER XXI
Meanwhile the poor poisoned folk at Mile End lived and apparently throve, in defiance of all
      the laws of the universe. Robert, as soon as he found that radical measures were for the time
      hopeless, had applied himself with redoubled energy to making the people use such palliatives
      as were within their reach, and had preached boiled water and the removal of filth till, as he
      declared to Catherine, his dreams were one long sanitary nightmare. But he was not confiding
      enough to believe that the people paid much heed, and he hoped more from a dry hard winter
      than from any exertion either of his or theirs.
But, alas! with the end of November a season of furious rain set in.
Then Robert began to watch Mile End with anxiety, for so far every outbreak of illness there
      had followed upon unusual damp. But the rains passed, leaving behind them no worse results
      than the usual winter crop of lung ailments and rheumatism, and he breathed again.
Christmas came and went, and with the end of December the
       wet weather returned. Day after day rolling masses of south-west cloud came up from
      the Atlantic and wrapped the whole country in rain, which reminded Catherine of her
      Westmoreland rain more than any she had yet seen in the South. Robert accused her of liking it
      for that reason, but she shook her head with a sigh, declaring that it was 'nothing without
      the becks.'
One afternoon she was shutting the door of the school behind her, and stepping out on the
      road skirting the green—the bedabbled wintry green—when she saw Robert emerging from the Mile
      End lane. She crossed over to him, wondering as she neared him that he seemed to take no
      notice of her. He was striding along, his wideawake over his eyes, and so absorbed that she
      had almost touched him before he saw her.
'Darling, is that you? Don't stop me, I am going to take the pony-carriage in for Meyrick. I
      have just come back from that accursed place; three cases of diphtheria in one house,
      Sharland's wife—and two others down with fever.'
She made a horrified exclamation.
'It will spread,' he said gloomily, 'I know it will. I never saw the children look such a
      ghastly crew before. Well, I must go for Meyrick and a nurse, and we must isolate and make a
      fight for it.'
In a few days the diphtheria epidemic in the hamlet had reached terrible proportions. There
      had been one death, others were expected, and soon Robert in his brief hours at home could
      find no relief in anything, so heavy was the oppression of the day's memories. At first
      Catherine for the child's sake kept away; but the little Mary was weaned, had a good Scotch
      nurse, was in every way thriving, and after a day or two Catherine's craving to help, to be
      with Robert in his trouble, was too strong to be withstood. But she dared not go backwards and
      forwards between her baby and the diphtheritic children. So she bethought herself of Mrs.
      Elsmere's servant, old Martha, who was still inhabiting Mrs. Elsmere's cottage till a tenant
      could be found for it, and doing good service meanwhile as an occasional parish nurse. The
      baby and its nurse went over to the cottage. Catherine carried the child there, wrapped close
      in maternal arms, and leaving her on old Martha's lap, went back to Robert.
Then she and he devoted themselves to a hand-to-hand fight with the epidemic. At the climax
      of it there were about twenty children down with it in different stages, and seven cases of
      fever. They had two hospital nurses; one of the better cottages, turned into a sanatorium,
      accommodated the worst cases under the nurses, and Robert and Catherine, directed by them and
      the doctors, took the responsibility of the rest, he helping to nurse the boys and she the
      girls. Of the fever cases Sharland's wife was the worst. A feeble creature at all times, it
      seemed almost impossible she could weather through. But day after day passed, and by dint of
      incessant nursing she still
       lived. A youth of twenty, the main support of a mother and five or six younger
      children was also desperately ill. Robert hardly ever had him out of his thoughts, and the
      boy's dog-like affection for the rector, struggling with his deathly weakness, was like a
      perpetual exemplification of Ahriman and Ormuzd—the power of life struggling with the power of
      death.
It was a fierce fight. Presently it seemed to the husband and wife as though the few daily
      hours spent at the rectory were mere halts between successive acts of battle with the
      plague-fiend—a more real and grim Grendel of the Marshes—for the lives of children. Catherine
      could always sleep in these intervals, quietly and dreamlessly; Robert very soon could only
      sleep by the help of some prescription of old Meyrick's. On all occasions of strain since his
      boyhood there had been signs in him of a certain lack of constitutional hardness which his
      mother knew very well, but which his wife was only just beginning to recognise. However, he
      laughed to scorn any attempt to restrain his constant goings and comings, or those hours of
      night-nursing, in which, as the hospital nurses were the first to admit, no one was so
      successful as the rector. And when he stood up on Sundays to preach in Murewell Church, the
      worn and spiritual look of the man, and the knowledge warm at each heart of those before him
      of how the rector not only talked but lived, carried every word home.
This strain upon all the moral and physical forces, however, strangely enough, came to
      Robert as a kind of relief. It broke through a tension of brain which of late had become an
      oppression. And for both him and Catherine these dark times had moments of intensest joy,
      points of white light illuminating heaven and earth. There were cloudy nights—wet, stormy
      January nights—when sometimes it happened to them to come back both together from the hamlet,
      Robert carrying a lantern, Catherine clothed in waterproof from head to foot, walking beside
      him, the rays flashing now on her face, now on the wooded sides of the lane, while the wind
      howled through the dark vault of branches overhead. And then, as they talked or were silent,
      suddenly a sense of the intense blessedness of this comradeship of theirs would rise like a
      flood in the man's heart, and he would fling his free arm round her, forcing her to stand a
      moment in the January night and storm while he said to her words of passionate gratitude, of
      faith in an immortal union reaching beyond change or death, lost in a kiss which was a
      sacrament. Then there were the moments when they saw their child, held high in Martha's arms
      at the window, and leaping towards her mother; the moments when one pallid sickly being after
      another was pronounced out of danger; and by the help of them the weeks passed away.
Nor were they left without help from outside. Lady Helen Varley no sooner heard the news
      than she hurried over. Robert, on his way one morning from one cottage to another, saw her
       pony-carriage in the lane. He hastened up to her before she could dismount.
'No, Lady Helen, you mustn't come here,' he said to her peremptorily, as she held out her
      hand.
'Oh, Mr. Elsmere, let me. My boy is in town with his grandmother. Let me just go through, at
      any rate, and see what I can send you.'
Robert shook his head, smiling. A common friend of theirs and hers had once described this
      little lady to Elsmere by a French sentence which originally applied to the Duchesse de
      Choiseul. 'Une charmante petite fée sortie d'un œuf enchanté!'—so it ran. Certainly, as
      Elsmere looked down upon her now, fresh from those squalid death-stricken hovels behind him,
      he was brought more abruptly than ever upon the contrasts of life. Lady Helen wore a green
      velvet and fur mantle, in the production of which even Worth had felt some pride; a little
      green velvet bonnet perched on her fair hair; one tiny hand, ungloved, seemed ablaze with
      diamonds; there were opals and diamonds somewhere at her throat, gleaming among her sables.
      But she wore her jewels as carelessly as she wore her high birth, her quaint irregular
      prettiness, or the one or two brilliant gifts which made her sought after wherever she went.
      She loved her opals as she loved all bright things; if it pleased her to wear them in the
      morning, she wore them; and in five minutes she was capable of making the sourest puritan
      forget to frown on her and them. To Robert she always seemed the quintessence of breeding, of
      aristocracy at their best. All her freaks, her sallies, her absurdities even, were graceful.
      At her freest and gayest there were things in her—restraints, reticences, perceptions—which
      implied behind her generations of rich, happy, important people, with ample leisure to
      cultivate all the more delicate niceties of social feeling and relation. Robert was often
      struck by the curious differences between her and Rose. Rose was far the handsomer; she was at
      least as clever; and she had a strong imperious will where Lady Helen had only impulses and
      sympathies and engouements. But Rose belonged to the class which struggles, where
      each individual depends on himself and knows it. Lady Helen had never struggled for
      anything—all the best things of the world were hers so easily that she hardly gave them a
      thought; or rather, what she had gathered without pain she held so lightly, she dispensed so
      lavishly, that men's eyes followed her, fluttering through life, with much the same feeling as
      was struck from Clough's radical hero by the peerless Lady Maria—

'Live, be lovely, forget us, be beautiful, even to proudness,
Even for their poor sakes whose happiness is to behold you;
Live, be uncaring, be joyous, be sumptuous; only be lovely!'

'Uncaring,' however, little Lady Helen never was. If she
       was a fairy, she was a fairy all heart, all frank foolish smiles and tears.
'No, Lady Helen—no,' Robert said again. 'This is no place for you, and we are getting on
      capitally.'
She pouted a little.
'I believe you and Mrs. Elsmere are just killing yourselves all in a corner, with no one to
      see,' she said indignantly. 'If you won't let me see, I shall send Sir Harry. But who'—and her
      brown fawn's eyes ran startled over the cottages before her—'who, Mr. Elsmere, does this
       dreadful place belong to?'
'Mr. Wendover,' said Robert shortly.
'Impossible!' she cried incredulously. 'Why, I wouldn't ask one of my dogs to sleep there,'
      and she pointed to the nearest hovel, whereof the walls were tottering outwards, the thatch
      was falling to pieces, and the windows were mended with anything that came handy—rags, paper,
      or the crown of an old hat.
'No, you would be ill advised,' said Robert, looking with a bitter little smile at the sleek
      dachshund that sat blinking beside its mistress.
'But what is the agent about?'
Then Robert told her the story, not mincing his words. Since the epidemic had begun, all
      that sense of imaginative attraction which had been reviving in him towards the squire had
      been simply blotted out by a fierce heat of indignation. When he thought of Mr. Wendover now,
      he thought of him as the man to whom in strict truth it was owing that helpless children died
      in choking torture. All that agony of wrath and pity he had gone through in the last ten days
      sprang to his lips now as he talked to Lady Helen, and poured itself into his words.
'Old Meyrick and I have taken things into our own hands now,' he said at last briefly. 'We
      have already made two cottages fairly habitable. To-morrow the inspector comes. I told the
      people yesterday I wouldn't be bound by my promise a day longer. He must put the screw on
      Henslowe, and if Henslowe dawdles, why we shall just drain and repair and sink for a well
      ourselves. I can find the money somehow. At present we get all our water from one of the farms
      on the brow.'
'Money!' said Lady Helen impulsively, her looks warm with sympathy for the pale harassed
      young rector. 'Sir Harry shall send you as much as you want. And anything
      else—blankets—coals?'
Out came her note-book, and Robert was drawn into a list. Then, full of joyfulness at being
      allowed to help, she gathered up her reins, she nodded her pretty little head at him, and was
      just starting off her ponies at full speed, equally eager 'to tell Harry' and to ransack
      Churton for the stores required, when it occurred to her to pull up again.
'Oh, Mr. Elsmere, my aunt, Lady Charlotte, does nothing
       but talk about your sister-in-law. Why did you keep her all to yourself?
      Is it kind, is it neighbourly, to have such a wonder to stay with you and let nobody
      share?'
'A wonder?' said Robert, amused. 'Rose plays the violin very well, but——'
'As if relations ever saw one in proper perspective!' exclaimed Lady Helen. 'My aunt wants
      to be allowed to have her in town next season if you will all let her. I think she would find
      it fun. Aunt Charlotte knows all the world and his wife. And if I'm there, and Miss Leyburn
      will let me make friends with her, why, you know, I can just protect her a little
      from Aunt Charlotte!'
The little laughing face bent forward again; Robert, smiling, raised his hat, and the ponies
      whirled her off. In anybody else Elsmere would have thought all this effusion insincere or
      patronising. But Lady Helen was the most spontaneous of mortals, and the only high-born woman
      he had ever met who was really, and not only apparently, free from the 'nonsense of rank.'
      Robert shrewdly suspected Lady Charlotte's social tolerance to be a mere varnish. But this
      little person, and her favourite brother Hugh, to judge from the accounts of him, must always
      have found life too romantic, too wildly and delightfully interesting from top to bottom, to
      be measured by any but romantic standards.
Next day Sir Harry Varley, a great burly country squire, who adored his wife, kept the
      hounds, owned a model estate, and thanked God every morning that he was an Englishman, rode
      over to Mile End. Robert, who had just been round the place with the inspector and was dead
      tired, had only energy to show him a few of the worst enormities. Sir Harry, leaving a cheque
      behind him, rode off with a discharge of strong language, at which Robert, clergyman as he
      was, only grimly smiled.
A few days later Mr. Wendover's crimes as a landowner, his agent's brutality, young
      Elsmere's devotion, and the horrors of the Mile End outbreak, were in everybody's mouths. The
      county was roused. The Radical newspaper came out on the Saturday with a flaming article;
      Robert, much to his annoyance, found himself the local hero; and money began to come in to him
      freely.
On the Monday morning Henslowe appeared on the scene with an army of workmen. A racy
      communication from the inspector had reached him two days before, so had a copy of the
       Churton Advertiser. He had spent Sunday in a drinking bout, turning over all
      possible plans of vengeance and evasion. Towards the evening, however, his wife, a gaunt
      clever Scotchwoman, who saw ruin before them, and had on occasion an even sharper tongue than
      her husband, managed to capture the supplies of brandy in the house and effectually conceal
      them. Then she waited for the moment of collapse which came on towards morning, and with her
      hands on her hips she poured
       into him a volley of home-truths which not even Sir Harry Varley could have
      bettered. Henslowe's nerve gave way. He went out at daybreak, white and sullen, to look for
      workmen.
Robert, standing on the step of a cottage, watched him give his orders, and took vigilant
      note of their substance. They embodied the inspector's directions, and the rector was
      satisfied. Henslowe was obliged to pass him on his way to another group of houses. At first he
      affected not to see the rector, then suddenly Elsmere was conscious that the man's bloodshot
      eyes were on him. Such a look! If hate could have killed, Elsmere would have fallen where he
      stood. Yet the man's hand mechanically moved to his hat, as though the spell of his wife's
      harangue were still potent over his shaking muscles.
Robert took no notice whatever of the salutation. He stood calmly watching till Henslowe
      disappeared into the last house. Then he called one of the agent's train, heard what was to be
      done, gave a sharp nod of assent, and turned on his heel. So far so good: the servant had been
      made to feel, but he wished it had been the master. Oh, those three little emaciated creatures
      whose eyes he had closed, whose clammy hands he had held to the last!—what reckoning should be
      asked for their undeserved torments when the Great Account came to be made up?
Meanwhile not a sound apparently of all this reached the squire in the sublime solitude of
      Murewell. A fortnight had passed. Henslowe had been conquered, the county had rushed to
      Elsmere's help, and neither he nor Mrs. Darcy had made a sign. Their life was so abnormal that
      it was perfectly possible they had heard nothing. Elsmere wondered when they would
      hear.
The rector's chief help and support all through had been old Meyrick. The parish doctor had
      been in bed with rheumatism when the epidemic broke out, and Robert, feeling it a comfort to
      be rid of him, had thrown the whole business into the hands of Meyrick and his son. This son
      was nominally his father's junior partner, but as he was, besides, a young and brilliant M.D.
      fresh from a great hospital, and his father was just a poor old general practitioner, with the
      barest qualification, and only forty years' experience to recommend him, it will easily be
      imagined that the subordination was purely nominal. Indeed young Meyrick was fast ousting his
      father in all directions, and the neighbourhood, which had so far found itself unable either
      to enter or to quit this mortal scene without old Meyrick's assistance, was beginning to send
      notes to the house in Churton High Street, whereon the superscription 'Dr. Edward
      Meyrick' was underlined with ungrateful emphasis. The father took his deposition very quietly.
      Only on Murewell Hall would he allow no trespassing, and so long as his son left him
      undisturbed there, he took his effacement in other quarters with perfect meekness.


Young Elsmere's behaviour to him, however, at a time when all the rest of the Churton world
      was beginning to hold him cheap and let him see it, had touched the old man's heart, and he
      was the rector's slave in this Mile End business. Edward Meyrick would come whirling in and
      out of the hamlet once a day. Robert was seldom sorry to see the back of him. His attainments,
      of course, were useful, but his cocksureness was irritating, and his manner to his father
      abominable. The father, on the other hand, came over in the shabby pony-cart he had driven for
      the last forty years, and having himself no press of business, would spend hours with the
      rector over the cases, giving them an infinity of patient watching, and amusing Robert by the
      cautious hostility he would allow himself every now and then towards his son's new-fangled
      devices.
At first Meyrick showed himself fidgety as to the squire. Had he been seen, been heard from?
      He received Robert's sharp negatives with long sighs, but Robert clearly saw that, like the
      rest of the world, he was too much afraid of Mr. Wendover to go and beard him. Some months
      before, as it happened, Elsmere had told him the story of his encounter with the squire, and
      had been a good deal moved and surprised by the old man's concern.
One day, about three weeks from the beginning of the outbreak, when the state of things in
      the hamlet was beginning decidedly to mend, Meyrick arrived for his morning round, much
      preoccupied. He hurried his work a little, and after it was done asked Robert to walk up the
      road with him.
'I have seen the squire, sir,' he said, turning on his companion with a certain
      excitement.
Robert flushed.
'Have you?' he replied with his hands behind him, and a world of expression in his sarcastic
      voice.
'You misjudge him! You misjudge him, Mr. Elsmere!' the old man said tremulously. 'I told you
      he could know nothing of this business—and he didn't! He has been in town part of the time,
      and down here—how is he to know anything? He sees nobody. That man Henslowe, sir, must be a
      real bad fellow.'
'Don't abuse the man,' said Robert, looking up. 'It's not worth while, when you can say your
      mind of the master.'
Old Meyrick sighed.
'Well,' said Robert, after a moment, his lip drawn and quivering, 'you told him the story, I
      suppose? Seven deaths, is it, by now? Well, what sort of impression did these unfortunate
      accidents'—and he smiled—'produce?'
'He talked of sending money,' said Meyrick doubtfully; 'he said he would have Henslowe up
      and inquire. He seemed put about and annoyed. Oh, Mr. Elsmere, you think too hardly of the
      squire, that you do!'
They strolled on together in silence. Robert was not inclined
       to discuss the matter. But old Meyrick seemed to be labouring under some suppressed
      emotion, and presently he began upon his own experiences as a doctor of the Wendover family.
      He had already broached the subject more or less vaguely with Robert. Now, however, he threw
      his medical reserve, generally his strongest characteristic, to the winds. He insisted on
      telling his companion, who listened reluctantly, the whole miserable and ghastly story of the
      old squire's suicide. He described the heir's summons, his arrival just in time for the last
      scene with all its horrors, and that mysterious condition of the squire for some months
      afterwards, when no one, not even Mrs. Darcy, had been admitted to the Hall, and old Meyrick,
      directed at intervals by a great London doctor, had been the only spectator of Roger
      Wendover's physical and mental breakdown, the only witness of that dark consciousness of
      inherited fatality which at that period of his life not even the squire's iron will had been
      able wholly to conceal.
Robert, whose attention was inevitably roused after a while, found himself with some
      curiosity realising the squire from another man's totally different point of view. Evidently
      Meyrick had seen him at such moments as wring from the harshest nature whatever grains of
      tenderness, of pity, or of natural human weakness may be in it. And it was clear, too, that
      the squire, conscious perhaps of a shared secret, and feeling a certain soothing influence in
      the naïveté and simplicity of the old man's sympathy, had allowed himself at times,
      in the years succeeding that illness of his, an amount of unbending in Meyrick's presence,
      such as probably no other mortal had ever witnessed in him since his earliest youth.
And yet how childish the old man's whole mental image of the squire was after all! What
      small account it made of the subtleties, the gnarled intricacies and contradictions of such a
      character! Horror at his father's end, and dread of a like fate for himself! Robert did not
      know very much of the squire, but he knew enough to feel sure that this confiding indulgent
      theory of Meyrick's was ludicrously far from the mark as an adequate explanation of Mr.
      Wendover's later life.
Presently Meyrick became aware of the sort of tacit resistance which his companion's mind
      was opposing to his own. He dropped the wandering narrative he was busy upon with a sigh.
'Ah well, I daresay it's hard, it's hard,' he said with patient acquiescence in his voice,
      'to believe a man can't help himself. I daresay we doctors get to muddle up right and wrong.
      But if ever there was a man sick in mind—for all his book-learning they talk about—and sick in
      soul, that man is the squire.'
Robert looked at him with a softer expression. There was a new dignity about the simple old
      man. The old-fashioned deference, which had never let him forget in speaking to Robert that he
      was speaking to a man of family, and which showed
       itself in all sorts of antiquated locutions which were a torment to his son, had
      given way to something still more deeply ingrained. His gaunt figure, with the stoop, and the
      spectacles and the long straight hair—like the figure of a superannuated schoolmaster—assumed,
      as he turned again to his younger companion, something of authority, something almost of
      stateliness.
'Ah, Mr. Elsmere,' he said, laying his shrunk hand on the younger man's sleeve and speaking
      with emotion, 'you're very good to the poor. We're all proud of you—you and your good lady.
      But when you were coming, and I heard tell all about you, I thought of my poor squire, and I
      said to myself, "That young man'll be good to him. The squire will make friends with
      him, and Mr. Elsmere will have a good wife—and there'll be children born to him—and the squire
      will take an interest—and—and—maybe——'"
The old man paused. Robert grasped his hand silently.
'And there was something in the way between you,' the speaker went on, sighing. 'I daresay
      you were quite right—quite right. I can't judge. Only there are ways of doing a thing. And it
      was a last chance; and now its missed—it's missed. Ah! it's no good talking; he has a heart—he
      has! Many's the kind thing he's done in old days for me and mine—I'll never forget them! But
      all these last few years—oh, I know, I know. You can't go and shut your heart up, and fly in
      the face of all the duties the Lord laid on you, without losing yourself and setting the Lord
      against you. But it is pitiful, Mr. Elsmere, it's pitiful!'
It seemed to Robert suddenly as though there was a Divine breath passing through the wintry
      lane and through the shaking voice of the old man. Beside the spirit looking out of those
      wrinkled eyes, his own hot youth, its justest resentments, its most righteous angers, seemed
      crude, harsh, inexcusable.
'Thank you, Meyrick, thank you, and God bless you! Don't imagine I will forget a word you
      have said to me.'
The rector shook the hand he held warmly twice over, a gentle smile passed over Meyrick's
      ageing face, and they parted.
That night it fell to Robert to sit up after midnight with John Allwood, the youth of twenty
      whose case had been a severer tax on the powers of the little nursing staff than perhaps any
      other. Mother and neighbours were worn out, and it was difficult to spare a hospital nurse for
      long together from the diphtheria cases. Robert, therefore, had insisted during the preceding
      week on taking alternate nights with one of the nurses. During the first hours before midnight
      he slept soundly on a bed made up in the ground-floor room of the little sanatorium. Then at
      twelve the nurse called him, and he went out, his eyes still heavy with sleep, into a still
      frosty winter's night.
After so much rain, so much restlessness of wind and cloud, the silence and the starry calm
      of it were infinitely welcome. The sharp cold air cleared his brain and braced his nerves, and
       by the time he reached the cottage whither he was bound, he was broad awake. He
      opened the door softly, passed through the lower room, crowded with sleeping children, climbed
      the narrow stairs as noiselessly as possible, and found himself in a garret, faintly lit, a
      bed in one corner and a woman sitting beside it. The woman glided away, the rector looked
      carefully at the table of instructions hanging over the bed, assured himself that wine and
      milk and beef essence and medicines were ready to his hand, put out his watch on the wooden
      table near the bed, and sat him down to his task. The boy was sleeping the sleep of weakness.
      Food was to be given every half-hour, and in this perpetual impulse to the system lay his only
      chance.
The rector had his Greek Testament with him, and could just read it by the help of the dim
      light. But after a while, as the still hours passed on, it dropped on to his knee, and he sat
      thinking—endlessly thinking. The young labourer lay motionless beside him, the lines of the
      long emaciated frame showing through the bed-clothes. The night-light flickered on the broken
      discoloured ceiling; every now and then a mouse scratched in the plaster; the mother's heavy
      breathing came from the next room; sometimes a dog barked or an owl cried outside. Otherwise
      deep silence, such silence as drives the soul back upon itself.
Elsmere was conscious of a strange sense of moral expansion. The stern judgments, the
      passionate condemnations which his nature housed so painfully, seemed lifted from it. The soul
      breathed an 'ampler æther, a diviner air.' Oh! the mysteries of life and character, the subtle
      inexhaustible claims of pity! The problems which hang upon our being here; its mixture of
      elements; the pressure of its inexorable physical environment; the relations of mind to body,
      of man's poor will to this tangled tyrannous life—it was along these old, old lines his
      thought went painfully groping; and always at intervals it came back to the squire, pondering,
      seeking to understand, a new soberness, a new humility and patience entering in.
And yet it was not Meyrick's facts exactly that had brought this about. Robert thought them
      imperfect, only half true. Rather was it the spirit of love, of infinite forbearance in which
      the simpler, duller nature had declared itself that had appealed to him, nay, reproached
      him.
Then these thoughts led him on farther and farther from man to God, from human defect to the
      Eternal Perfectness. Never once during those hours did Elsmere's hand fail to perform its
      needed service to the faint sleeper beside him, and yet that night was one long dream and
      strangeness to him, nothing real anywhere but consciousness, and God its source; the soul
      attacked every now and then by phantom stabs of doubt, of bitter brief misgiving, as the
      barriers of sense between it and the eternal enigma grew more and more transparent, wrestling
      awhile, and then prevailing. And each golden moment of cer
      tainty, of conquering faith, seemed to Robert in some sort a gift from Catherine's
      hand. It was she who led him through the shades; it was her voice murmuring in his ear.
When the first gray dawn began to creep in slowly perceptible waves into the room, Elsmere
      felt as though not hours but years of experience lay between him and the beginnings of his
      watch.
'It is by these moments we should date our lives,' he murmured to himself as he rose; 'they
      are the only real landmarks.'
It was eight o'clock, and the nurse who was to relieve him had come. The results of the
      night for his charge were good: the strength had been maintained, the pulse was firmer, the
      temperature lower. The boy, throwing off his drowsiness, lay watching the rector's face as he
      talked in an undertone to the nurse, his haggard eyes full of a dumb friendly wistfulness.
      When Robert bent over him to say good-bye, this expression brightened into something more
      positive, and Robert left him, feeling at last that there was a promise of life in his look
      and touch.
In another moment he had stepped out into the January morning. It was clear and still as the
      night had been. In the east there was a pale promise of sun; the reddish-brown trunks of the
      fir woods had just caught it, and rose faintly glowing in endless vistas and colonnades one
      behind the other. The flooded river itself rushed through the bridge as full and turbid as
      before, but all the other water surfaces had gleaming films of ice. The whole ruinous place
      had a clean, almost a festal air under the touch of the frost, while on the side of the hill
      leading to Murewell, tree rose above tree, the delicate network of their wintry twigs and
      branches set against stretches of frost-whitened grass, till finally they climbed into the
      pale all-completing blue. In a copse close at hand there were woodcutters at work, and piles
      of gleaming laths shining through the underwood. Robins hopped along the frosty road, and as
      he walked on through the houses towards the bridge, Robert's quick ear distinguished that most
      wintry of all sounds—the cry of a flock of fieldfares passing overhead.
As he neared the bridge he suddenly caught sight of a figure upon it, the figure of a man
      wrapped in a large Inverness cloak, leaning against the stone parapet. With a start he
      recognised the squire.
He went up to him without an instant's slackening of his steady step. The squire heard the
      sound of some one coming, turned, and saw the rector.
'I am glad to see you here, Mr. Wendover,' said Robert, stopping and holding out his hand.
      'I meant to have come to talk to you about this place this morning. I ought to have come
      before.'
He spoke gently, and quite simply, almost as if they had parted the day before. The squire
      touched his hand for an instant.


'You may not, perhaps, be aware, Mr. Elsmere,' he said, endeavouring to speak with all his
      old hauteur, while his heavy lips twitched nervously, 'that, for one reason and another, I
      knew nothing of the epidemic here till yesterday, when Meyrick told me.'
'I heard from Mr. Meyrick that it was so. As you are here now, Mr. Wendover, and I am in no
      great hurry to get home, may I take you through and show you the people?'
The squire at last looked at him straight—at the face worn and pale, yet still so
      extraordinarily youthful, in which something of the solemnity and high emotion of the night
      seemed to be still lingering.
'Are you just come?' he said abruptly, 'or are you going back?'
'I have been here through the night, sitting up with one of the fever cases. It's hard work
      for the nurses, and the relations sometimes, without help.'
The squire moved on mechanically towards the village, and Robert moved beside him.
'And Mrs. Elsmere?'
'Mrs. Elsmere was here most of yesterday. She used to stay the night when the diphtheria was
      at its worst; but there are only four anxious cases left—the rest all convalescent.'
The squire said no more, and they turned into the lane, where the ice lay thick in the deep
      ruts, and on either hand curls of smoke rose into the clear cold sky. The squire looked about
      him with eyes which no detail escaped. Robert, without a word of comment, pointed out this
      feature and that, showed where Henslowe had begun repairs, where the new well was to be, what
      the water supply had been till now, drew the squire's attention to the roofs, the pigstyes,
      the drainage, or rather complete absence of drainage, and all in the dry voice of some one
      going through a catalogue. Word had already fled like wildfire through the hamlet that the
      squire was there. Children and adults, a pale emaciated crew, poured out into the wintry air
      to look. The squire knit his brows with annoyance as the little crowd in the lane grew. Robert
      took no notice.
Presently he pushed open the door of the house where he had spent the night. In the kitchen
      a girl of sixteen was clearing away the various nondescript heaps on which the family had
      slept, and was preparing breakfast. The squire looked at the floor.
'I thought I understood from Henslowe,' he muttered, as though to himself, 'that there were
      no mud floors left on the estate——'
'There are only three houses in Mile End without them,' said Robert, catching what he
      said.
They went upstairs, and the mother stood open-eyed while the squire's restless look gathered
      in the details of the room, the youth's face, as he lay back on his pillows, whiter than they,
       exhausted and yet refreshed by the sponging with vinegar and water which the mother
      had just been administering to him; the bed, the gaps in the worm-eaten boards, the spots in
      the roof where the plaster bulged inward, as though a snake would bring it down; the coarse
      china shepherdesses on the mantel-shelf, and the flowers which Catherine had put there the day
      before. He asked a few questions, said an abrupt word or two to the mother, and they tramped
      downstairs again and into the street. Then Robert took him across to the little improvised
      hospital, saying to him on the threshold, with a moment's hesitation,—
'As you know, for adults there is not much risk, but there is always some risk——'
A peremptory movement of the squire's hand stopped him, and they went in. In the downstairs
      room were half-a-dozen convalescents, pale, shadowy creatures, four of them under ten, sitting
      up in their little cots, each of them with a red flannel jacket drawn from Lady Helen's
      stores, and enjoying the breakfast which a nurse in white cap and apron had just brought them.
      Upstairs, in a room from which a lath-and-plaster partition had been removed, and which had
      been adapted, warmed and ventilated by various contrivances to which Robert and Meyrick had
      devoted their practical minds, were the 'four anxious cases.' One of them, a little creature
      of six, one of Sharland's black-eyed children, was sitting up, supported by the nurse, and
      coughing its little life away. As soon as he saw it, Robert's step quickened. He forgot the
      squire altogether. He came and stood by the bedside, rigidly still, for he could do nothing,
      but his whole soul absorbed in that horrible struggle for air. How often he had seen it now,
      and never without the same wild sense of revolt and protest! At last the hideous membrane was
      loosened, the child got relief, and lay back white and corpse-like, but with a pitiful
      momentary relaxation of the drawn lines on its little brow. Robert stooped and kissed the damp
      tiny hand. The child's eyes remained shut, but the fingers made a feeble effort to close on
      his.
'Mr. Elsmere,' said the nurse, a motherly body, looking at him with friendly admonition, 'if
      you don't go home and rest you'll be ill too, and I'd like to know who'll be the better for
      that?'
'How many deaths?' asked the squire abruptly, touching Elsmere's arm, and so reminding
      Robert of his existence. 'Meyrick spoke of deaths.'
He stood near the door, but his eyes were fixed on the little bed, on the half-swooning
      child.
'Seven,' said Robert, turning upon him. 'Five of diphtheria, two of fever. That little one
      will go too.'
'Horrible!' said the squire under his breath, and then moved to the door.
The two men went downstairs in perfect silence. Below, in
       the convalescent room, the children were capable of smiles, and of quick coquettish
      beckonings to the rector to come and make game with them as usual. But he could only kiss his
      hand to them and escape, for there was more to do.
He took the squire through all the remaining fever cases, and into several of the worst
      cottages—Milsom's among them—and when it was all over they emerged into the lane again, near
      the bridge. There was still a crowd of children and women hanging about, watching eagerly for
      the squire, whom many of them had never seen at all, and about whom various myths had
      gradually formed themselves in the countryside. The squire walked away from them hurriedly,
      followed by Robert, and again they halted on the centre of the bridge. A horse led by a groom
      was being walked up and down on a flat piece of road just beyond.
It was an awkward moment. Robert never forgot the thrill of it, or the association of wintry
      sunshine streaming down upon a sparkling world of ice and delicate woodland and foam-flecked
      river.
The squire turned towards him irresolutely; his sharply-cut wrinkled lips opening and
      closing again. Then he held out his hand: 'Mr. Elsmere, I did you a wrong—I did this place and
      its people a wrong. In my view, regret for the past is useless. Much of what has occurred here
      is plainly irreparable; I will think what can be done for the future. As for my relation to
      you, it rests with you to say whether it can be amended. I recognise that you have just cause
      of complaint.'
What invincible pride there was in the man's very surrender! But Elsmere was not repelled by
      it. He knew that in their hour together the squire had felt. His soul had lost its
      bitterness. The dead and their wrong were with God.
He took the squire's outstretched hand, grasping it cordially, a pure unworldly dignity in
      his whole look and bearing.
'Let us be friends, Mr. Wendover. It will be a great comfort to us—my wife and me. Will you
      remember us both very kindly to Mrs. Darcy?'
Commonplace words, but words that made an epoch in the life of both. In another minute the
      squire, on horseback, was trotting along the side road leading to the Hall, and Robert was
      speeding home to Catherine as fast as his long legs could carry him.
She was waiting for him on the steps, shading her eyes against the unwonted sun. He kissed
      her with the spirits of a boy and told her all his news.
Catherine listened bewildered, not knowing what to say or how all at once to forgive, to
      join Robert in forgetting. But that strange spiritual glow about him was not to be withstood.
      She threw her arms about him at last with a half sob,—
'Oh, Robert—yes! Dear Robert—thank God!'
'Never think any more,' he said at last, leading her in from
       the little hall, 'of what has been, only of what shall be! Oh, Catherine, give me
      some tea; and never did I see anything so tempting as that armchair.'
He sank down into it, and when she put his breakfast beside him she saw with a start that he
      was fast asleep. The wife stood and watched him, the signs of fatigue round eyes and mouth,
      the placid expression, and her face was soft with tenderness and joy. 'Of course—of course,
      even that hard man must love him. Who could help it? My Robert!'
And so now in this disguise, now in that, the supreme hour of Catherine's life stole on and
      on towards her.
