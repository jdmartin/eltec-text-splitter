CHAPTER XXXIX
It was the afternoon of Good Friday. Catherine had been to church at St. Paul's, and Robert,
      though not without some inward struggle, had accompanied her. Their midday meal was over, and
      Robert had been devoting himself to Mary, who had been tottering round the room in his wake,
      clutching one finger tight with her chubby hand. In particular, he had been coaxing her into
      friendship with a wooden Japanese dragon which wound itself in awful yet most seductive coils
      round the cabinet at the end of the room. It was Mary's weekly task to embrace this horror,
      and the performance went by the name of 'kissing
       the Jabberwock.' It had been triumphantly achieved, and, as the reward of bravery,
      Mary was being carried round the room on her father's shoulder, holding on mercilessly to his
      curls, her shining blue eyes darting scorn at the defeated monster.
At last Robert deposited her on the rug beside a fascinating farmyard which lay there spread
      out for her, and stood looking, not at the child, but at his wife.
'Catherine, I feel so much as Mary did three minutes ago!'
She looked up startled. The tone was light, but the sadness, the emotion of the eyes,
      contradicted it.
'I want courage,' he went on—'courage to tell you something that may hurt you. And yet I
      ought to tell it.'
Her face took the shrinking expression which was so painful to him. But she waited quietly
      for what he had to say.
'You know, I think,' he said, looking away from her to the gray Museum outside, 'that my
      work in R—— hasn't been religious as yet at all. Oh, of course, I have said things here and
      there, but I haven't delivered myself in any way. Now there has come an opening.'
And he described to her—while she shivered a little and drew herself together—the
      provocations which were leading him into a tussle with the North R—— Club.
'They have given me a very civil invitation. They are the sort of men after all whom it pays
      to get hold of, if one can. Among their fellows, they are the men who think. One longs to help
      them to think to a little more purpose.'
'What have you to give them, Robert?' asked Catherine after a pause, her eyes bent on the
      child's stocking she was knitting. Her heart was full enough already, poor soul. Oh, the
      bitterness of this Passion week! He had been at her side often in church, but through all his
      tender silence and consideration she had divined the constant struggle in him between love and
      intellectual honesty, and it had filled her with a dumb irritation and misery indescribable.
      Do what she would, wrestle with herself as she would, there was constantly emerging in her now
      a note of anger, not with Robert, but, as it were, with those malign forces of which he was
      the prey.
'What have I to give them?' he repeated sadly. 'Very little, Catherine, as it seems to me
      to-night. But come and see.'
His tone had a melancholy which went to her heart. In reality he was in that state of
      depression which often precedes a great effort. But she was startled by his suggestion.
'Come with you, Robert? To the meeting of a secularist club!'
'Why not? I shall be there to protest against outrage to what both you and I hold dear. And
      the men are decent fellows. There will be no disturbance.'
'What are you going to do?' she asked in a low voice.


'I have been trying to think it out,' he said with difficulty. 'I want simply, if I can, to
      transfer to their minds that image of Jesus of Nazareth which thought, and love, and reading
      have left upon my own. I want to make them realise for themselves the historical character, so
      far as it can be realised—to make them see for themselves the real figure, as it went in and
      out amongst men—so far as our eyes can now discern it.'
The words came quicker towards the end, while the voice sank—took the vibrating
      characteristic note the wife knew so well.
'How can that help them?' she said abruptly. 'Your historical Christ, Robert, will never win
      souls. If he was God, every word you speak will insult him. If he was man, he was not a good
      man!'
'Come and see,' was all he said, holding out his hand to her. It was in some sort a renewal
      of the scene at Les Avants, the inevitable renewal of an offer he felt bound to make, and she
      felt bound to resist.
She let her knitting fall and placed her hand in his. The baby on the rug was alternately
      caressing and scourging a woolly baa-lamb, which was the fetish of her childish worship. Her
      broken incessant baby-talk, and the ringing kisses with which she atoned to the baa-lamb for
      each successive outrage, made a running accompaniment to the moved undertones of the
      parents.
'Don't ask me, Robert, don't ask me! Do you want me to come and sit thinking of last year's
      Easter Eve?'
'Heaven knows I was miserable enough last Easter Eve,' he said slowly.
'And now,' she exclaimed, looking at him with a sudden agitation of every feature, 'now you
      are not miserable? You are quite confident and sure? You are going to devote your life to
      attacking the few remnants of faith that still remain in the world?'
Never in her married life had she spoken to him with this accent of bitterness and
      hostility. He started and withdrew his hand, and there was a silence.
'I held once a wife in my arms,' he said presently with a voice hardly audible, 'who said to
      me that she would never persecute her husband. But what is persecution if it is not the
      determination not to understand?'
She buried her face in her hands. 'I could not understand,' she said sombrely.
'And rather than try,' he insisted, 'you will go on believing that I am a man without faith,
      seeking only to destroy.'
'I know you think you have faith,' she answered, 'but how can it seem faith to me? "He that
      will not confess Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in heaven."
      Your unbelief seems to me more dangerous than these horrible things which shock you. For you
      can make it attractive,
       you can make it loved, as you once made the faith of Christ loved.'
He was silent. She raised her face presently, whereon were the traces of some of those quiet
      difficult tears which were characteristic of her, and went softly out of the room.
He stood a while leaning against the mantelpiece, deaf to little Mary's clamour, and to her
      occasional clutches at his knees, as she tried to raise herself on her tiny tottering feet. A
      sense as though of some fresh disaster was upon him. His heart was sinking, sinking within
      him. And yet none knew better than he that there was nothing fresh. It was merely that the
      scene had recalled to him anew some of those unpalatable truths which the optimist is always
      much too ready to forget.
Heredity, the moulding force of circumstance, the iron hold of the past upon the present—a
      man like Elsmere realises the working of these things in other men's lives with a singular
      subtlety and clearness, and is for ever overlooking them, running his head against them, in
      his own.
He turned and laid his arms on the chimneypiece, burying his head on them. Suddenly he felt
      a touch on his knee, and, looking down, saw Mary peering up, her masses of dark hair streaming
      back from the straining little face, the grave open mouth, and alarmed eyes.
'Fader, tiss! fader, tiss!' she said imperatively.
He lifted her up and covered the little brown cheeks with kisses. But the touch of the child
      only woke in him a fresh dread—the like of something he had often divined of late in
      Catherine. Was she actually afraid now that he might feel himself bound in future to take her
      child spiritually from her? The suspicion of such a fear in her woke in him a fresh anguish;
      it seemed a measure of the distance they had travelled from that old perfect unity.
'She thinks I could even become in time her tyrant and torturer,' he said to himself with
      measureless pain, 'and who knows—who can answer for himself? Oh, the puzzle of living!'
When she came back into the room, pale and quiet, Catherine said nothing, and Robert went to
      his letters. But after a while she opened his study door.
'Robert, will you tell me what your stories are to be next week, and let me put out the
      pictures?'
It was the first time she had made any such offer. He sprang up with a flash in his gray
      eyes, and brought her a slip of paper with a list. She took it without looking at him. But he
      caught her in his arms, and for a moment in that embrace the soreness of both hearts passed
      away.
But if Catherine would not go, Elsmere was not left on this critical occasion without
      auditors from his own immediate circle. On the evening of Good Friday Flaxman had found his
      way to
       Bedford Square, and, as Catherine was out, was shown into Elsmere's study.
'I have come,' he announced, 'to try and persuade you and Mrs. Elsmere to go down with me to
      Greenlaws to-morrow. My Easter party has come to grief, and it would be a real charity on your
      part to come and resuscitate it. Do! You look abominably fagged, and as if some country would
      do you good.'
'But I thought——' began Robert, taken aback.
'You thought,' repeated Flaxman coolly, 'that your two sisters-in-law were going down there
      with Lady Helen, to meet some musical folk. Well, they are not coming. Miss Leyburn thinks
      your mother-in-law not very well to-day, and doesn't like to come. And your younger sister
      prefers also to stay in town. Helen is much disappointed, so am I. But——' And he shrugged his
      shoulders.
Robert found it difficult to make a suitable remark. His sisters-in-law were certainly
      inscrutable young women. This Easter party at Greenlaws, Mr. Flaxman's country house, had been
      planned, he knew, for weeks. And certainly nothing could be very wrong with Mrs. Leyburn, or
      Catherine would have been warned.
'I am afraid your plans must be greatly put out,' he said, with some embarrassment.
'Of course they are,' replied Flaxman, with a dry smile. He stood opposite Elsmere, his
      hands in his pockets.
'Will you have a confidence?' the bright eyes seemed to say. 'I am quite ready. Claim it if
      you like.'
But Elsmere had no intention of claiming it. The position of all Rose's kindred, indeed, at
      the present moment was not easy. None of them had the least knowledge of Rose's mind. Had she
      forgotten Langham? Had she lost her heart afresh to Flaxman? No one knew. Flaxman's absorption
      in her was clear enough. But his love-making, if it was such, was not of an ordinary kind, and
      did not always explain itself. And, moreover, his wealth and social position were elements in
      the situation calculated to make people like the Elsmeres particularly diffident and discreet.
      Impossible for them, much as they liked him, to make any of the advances!
No, Robert wanted no confidences. He was not prepared to take the responsibility of them.
      So, letting Rose alone, he took up his visitor's invitation to themselves, and explained the
      engagement for Easter Eve, which tied them to London.
'Whew!' said Hugh Flaxman, 'but that will be a shindy worth seeing. I must come!'
'Nonsense!' said Robert, smiling. 'Go down to Greenlaws, and go to church. That will be much
      more in your line.'
'As for church,' said Flaxman meditatively, 'if I put off my party altogether, and stay in
      town, there will be this further advantage, that, after hearing you on Saturday night, I can,
      with a blameless impartiality, spend the following day in St.
       Andrew's, Well Street. Yes! I telegraph to Helen—she knows my ways—and I come down
      to protect you against an atheistical mob to-morrow night!'
Robert tried to dissuade him. He did not want Flaxman. Flaxman's Epicureanism, the easy
      tolerance with which, now that the effervescence of his youth had subsided, the man harboured
      and dallied with a dozen contradictory beliefs, were at times peculiarly antipathetic to
      Elsmere. They were so now, just as heart and soul were nerved to an effort which could not be
      made at all without the nobler sort of self-confidence.
But Flaxman was determined.
'No,' he said; 'this one day we'll give—to heresy. Don't look so forbidding! In the first
      place, you won't see me; in the next, if you did, you would feel me as wax in your hands. I am
      like the man in Sophocles—always the possession of the last speaker! One day I am all for the
      church. A certain number of chances in the hundred there still are, you will admit, that she
      is in the right of it. And if so, why should I cut myself off from a whole host of beautiful
      things not to be got outside her? But the next day—vive Elsmere and the Revolution!
      If only Elsmere could persuade me intellectually! But I never yet came across a religious
      novelty that seemed to me to have a leg of logic to stand on!'
He laid his hand on Robert's shoulder, his eyes twinkling with a sudden energy. Robert made
      no answer. He stood erect, frowning a little, his hands thrust far into the pockets of his
      light gray coat. He was in no mood to disclose himself to Flaxman. The inner vision was fixed
      with extraordinary intensity on quite another sort of antagonist, with whom the mind was
      continuously grappling.
'Ah, well—till to-morrow!' said Flaxman, with a smile, shook hands, and went.
Outside he hailed a cab and drove off to Lady Charlotte's.
He found his aunt and Mr. Wynnstay in the drawing-room alone, one on either side of the
      fire. Lady Charlotte was reading the latest political biography with an apparent profundity of
      attention; Mr. Wynnstay was lounging and caressing the cat. But both his aunt's absorption and
      Mr. Wynnstay's nonchalance seemed to Flaxman overdone. He suspected a domestic breeze.
Lady Charlotte made him effusively welcome. He had come to propose that she should accompany
      him the following evening to hear Elsmere lecture.
'I advise you to come,' he said. 'Elsmere will deliver his soul, and the amount of soul he
      has to deliver in these dull days is astounding. A dowdy dress and a veil, of course. I will
      go down beforehand and see some one on the spot, in case there should be difficulties about
      getting in. Perhaps Miss Leyburn, too, might like to hear her brother-in-law?'
'Really, Hugh,' cried Lady Charlotte impatiently, 'I think
       you might take your snubbing with dignity. Her refusal this morning to go to
      Greenlaws was brusqueness itself. To my mind that young person gives herself airs!' And the
      Duke of Sedbergh's sister drew herself up with a rustle of all her ample frame.
'Yes, I was snubbed,' said Flaxman, unperturbed; 'that, however, is no reason why she
      shouldn't find it attractive to go to-morrow night.'
'And you will let her see that, just because you couldn't get hold of her, you have given up
      your Easter party and left your sister in the lurch?'
'I never had excessive notions of dignity,' he replied composedly. 'You may make up any
      story you please. The real fact is that I want to hear Elsmere.'
'You had better go, my dear!' said her husband sardonically. 'I cannot imagine anything more
      piquant than an atheistic slum on Easter Eve.'
'Nor can I!' she replied, her combativeness rousing at once. 'Much obliged to you, Hugh. I
      will borrow my housekeeper's dress, and be ready to leave here at half-past seven.'
Nothing more was said of Rose, but Flaxman knew that she would be asked, and let it
      alone.
'Will his wife be there?' asked Lady Charlotte.
'Who? Elsmere's? My dear aunt, when you happen to be the orthodox wife of a rising heretic,
      your husband's opinions are not exactly the spectacular performance they are to you and me. I
      should think it most unlikely.'
'Oh, she persecutes him, does she?'
'She wouldn't be a woman if she didn't!' observed Mr. Wynnstay, sotto voce. The
      small dark man was lost in a great armchair, his delicate painter's hands playing with the fur
      of a huge Persian cat. Lady Charlotte threw him an eagle glance, and he subsided—for the
      moment.
Flaxman, however, was perfectly right. There had been a breeze. It had been just announced
      to the master of the house by his spouse that certain Socialist celebrities—who might any day
      be expected to make acquaintance with the police—were coming to dine at his table, to finger
      his spoons, and mix their diatribes with his champagne, on the following Tuesday. Overt
      rebellion had never served him yet, and he knew perfectly well that when it came to the point
      he should smile more or less affably upon these gentry, as he had smiled upon others of the
      same sort before. But it had not yet come to the point, and his intermediate state was
      explosive in the extreme.
Mr. Flaxman dexterously continued the subject of the Elsmeres. Dropping his bantering tone,
      he delivered himself of a very delicate critical analysis of Catherine Elsmere's temperament
      and position, as in the course of several months his intimacy with her husband had revealed
      them to him. He did it well, with acuteness and philosophical relish. The situation presented
       itself to him as an extremely refined and yet tragic phase of the religious
      difficulty, and it gave him intellectual pleasure to draw it out in words.
Lady Charlotte sat listening, enjoying her nephew's crisp phrases, but also gradually
      gaining a perception of the human reality behind this word-play of Hugh's. That 'good heart'
      of hers was touched; the large imperious face began to frown.
'Dear me!' she said, with a little sigh. 'Don't go on, Hugh! I suppose it's because we all
      of us believe so little that the poor thing's point of view seems to one so unreal. All the
      same, however,' she added, regaining her usual rôle of magisterial common-sense, 'a woman, in
      my opinion, ought to go with her husband in religious matters.'
'Provided, of course, she sets him at nought in all others,' put in Mr. Wynnstay, rising and
      daintily depositing the cat. 'Many men, however, my dear, might be willing to compromise it
      differently. Granted a certain modicum of worldly conformity, they would not be at
      all indisposed to a conscience clause.'
He lounged out of the room, while Lady Charlotte shrugged her shoulders with a look at her
      nephew in which there was an irrepressible twinkle. Mr. Flaxman neither heard nor saw. Life
      would have ceased to be worth having long ago had he ever taken sides in the smallest degree
      in this ménage.
Flaxman walked home again, not particularly satisfied with himself and his manœuvres. Very
      likely it was quite unwise of him to have devised another meeting between himself and Rose
      Leyburn so soon. Certainly she had snubbed him—there could be no doubt of that. Nor was he in
      much perplexity as to the reason. He had been forgetting himself, forgetting his rôle and the
      whole lie of the situation, and if a man will be an idiot he must suffer for it. He had
      distinctly been put back a move.
The facts were very simple. It was now nearly three months since Langham's disappearance.
      During that time Rose Leyburn had been, to Flaxman's mind, enchantingly dependent on him. He
      had played his part so well, and the beautiful high-spirited child had suited herself so
      naïvely to his acting! Evidently she had said to herself that his age, his former marriage,
      his relation to Lady Helen, his constant kindness to her and her sister, made it natural that
      she should trust him, make him her friend, and allow him an intimacy she allowed to no other
      male friend. And when once the situation had been so defined in her mind, how the girl's true
      self had come out!—what delightful moments that intimacy had contained for him!
He remembered how on one occasion he had been reading some Browning to her and Helen, in
      Helen's crowded belittered drawing-room, which seemed all piano and photographs and lilies of
      the valley. He never could exactly trace the connection between the passage he had been
      reading and what happened. Probably it was merely Browning's poignant passionate note that had
      affected her. In spite of all her proud bright reserve,
       both he and Helen often felt through these weeks that just below this surface there
      was a heart which quivered at the least touch.
He finished the lines and laid down the book. Lady Helen heard her three-year-old boy crying
      upstairs, and ran up to see what was the matter. He and Rose were left alone in the scented
      fire-lit room. And a jet of flame suddenly showed him the girl's face turned away, convulsed
      with a momentary struggle for self-control. She raised a hand an instant to her eyes, not
      dreaming evidently that she could be seen in the dimness; and her gloves dropped from her
      lap.
He moved forward, stooped on one knee, and as she held out her hand for the gloves, he
      kissed the hand very gently, detaining it afterwards as a brother might. There was not a
      thought of himself in his mind. Simply he could not bear that so bright a creature should ever
      be sorry. It seemed to him intolerable, against the nature of things. If he could have
      procured for her at that moment a coerced and transformed Langham, a Langham fitted to make
      her happy, he could almost have done it; and, short of such radical consolation, the very
      least he could do was to go on his knee to her, and comfort her in tender brotherly
      fashion.
She did not say anything; she let her hand stay a moment, and then she got up, put on her
      veil, left a quiet message for Lady Helen, and departed. But as he put her into a hansom her
      whole manner to him was full of a shy shrinking sweetness. And when Rose was shy and shrinking
      she was adorable.
Well, and now he had never again gone nearly so far as to kiss her hand, and yet because of
      an indiscreet moment everything was changed between them; she had turned resentful stand-off,
      nay, as nearly rude as a girl under the restraints of modern manners can manage to be. He
      almost laughed as he recalled Helen's report of her interview with Rose that morning, in which
      she had tried to persuade a young person outrageously on her dignity to keep an engagement she
      had herself spontaneously made.
'I am very sorry, Lady Helen,' Rose had said, her slim figure drawn up so stiffly that the
      small Lady Helen felt herself totally effaced beside her. 'But I had rather not leave London
      this week. I think I will stay with mamma and Agnes.'
And nothing Lady Helen could say moved her, or modified her formula of refusal.
'What have you been doing, Hugh?' his sister asked him, half dismayed, half
      provoked.
Flaxman shrugged his shoulders and vowed he had been doing nothing. But, in truth, he knew
      very well that the day before he had overstepped the line. There had been a little scene
      between them, a quick passage of speech, a rash look and gesture on his part, which had been
      quite unpremeditated, but which had nevertheless transformed their relation. Rose had flushed
       up, had said a few incoherent words, which he had understood to be words of
      reproach, had left Lady Helen's as quickly as possible, and next morning his Greenlaws party
      had fallen through.
'Check, certainly,' said Flaxman to himself ruefully, as he pondered these
      circumstances—'not mate, I hope, if one can but find out how not to be a fool in future.'
And over his solitary fire he meditated far into the night.
Next day, at half-past seven in the evening, he entered Lady Charlotte's drawing-room,
      gayer, brisker, more alert than ever.
Rose started visibly at the sight of him, and shot a quick glance at the unblushing Lady
      Charlotte.
'I thought you were at Greenlaws,' she could not help saying to him, as she coldly offered
      him her hand. Why had Lady Charlotte never told her he was to escort them? Her
      irritation rose anew.
'What can one do,' he said lightly, 'if Elsmere will fix such a performance for Easter Eve?
      My party was at its last gasp too; it only wanted a telegram to Helen to give it its coup
       de grâce.'
Rose flushed up, but he turned on his heel at once, and began to banter his aunt on the
      housekeeper's bonnet and veil in which she had a little too obviously disguised herself.
And certainly, in the drive to the East End, Rose had no reason to complain of importunity
      on his part. Most of the way he was deep in talk with Lady Charlotte as to a certain loan
      exhibition in the East End, to which he and a good many of his friends were sending pictures;
      apparently his time and thoughts were entirely occupied with it. Rose, leaning back silent in
      her corner, was presently seized with a little shock of surprise that there should be so many
      interests and relations in his life of which she knew nothing. He was talking now as the man
      of possessions and influence. She saw a glimpse of him as he was in his public aspect, and the
      kindness, the disinterestedness, the quiet sense, and the humour of his talk insensibly
      affected her as she sat listening. The mental image of him which had been dominant in her mind
      altered a little. Nay, she grew a little hot over it. She asked herself scornfully whether she
      were not as ready as any bread-and-butter miss of her acquaintance to imagine every man she
      knew in love with her.
Very likely he had meant what he said quite differently, and she—oh! humiliation—had flown
      into a passion with him for no reasonable cause. Supposing he had meant, two days
      ago, that if they were to go on being friends she must let him be her lover too, it would of
      course have been unpardonable. How could she let any one talk to her of love
      yet—especially Mr. Flaxman, who guessed, as she was quite sure, what had happened to her? He
      must despise her to have imagined it. His outburst had filled her with the oddest and most
      petulant
       resentment. Were all men self-seeking? Did all men think women shallow and fickle?
      Could a man and a woman never be honestly and simply friends? If he had made love to
      her, he could not possibly—and there was the sting of it—feel towards her maiden dignity that
      romantic respect which she herself cherished towards it. For it was incredible that any
      delicate-minded girl should go through such a crisis as she had gone through, and then fall
      calmly into another lover's arms a few weeks later as though nothing had happened.
How we all attitudinise to ourselves! The whole of life often seems one long dramatic
      performance, in which one half of us is for ever posing to the other half.
But had he really made love to her?—had he meant what she had assumed him to mean? The girl
      lost herself in a torment of memory and conjecture, and meanwhile Mr. Flaxman sat opposite,
      talking away, and looking certainly as little love-sick as any man can well look. As the lamps
      flashed into the carriage her attention was often caught by his profile and finely-balanced
      head, by the hand lying on his knee, or the little gestures, full of life and freedom, with
      which he met some raid of Lady Charlotte's on his opinions, or opened a corresponding one on
      hers. There was certainly power in the man, a bright human sort of power, which inevitably
      attracted her. And that he was good too she had special grounds for knowing.
But what an aristocrat he was after all! What an over-prosperous exclusive set he belonged
      to! She lashed herself into anger as the other two chatted and sparred, with all these names
      of wealthy cousins and relations, with their parks and their pedigrees and their pictures! The
      aunt and nephew were debating how they could best bleed the family, in its various branches,
      of the art treasures belonging to it for the benefit of the East-Enders; therefore the names
      were inevitable. But Rose curled her delicate lip over them. And was it the best breeding, she
      wondered, to leave a third person so ostentatiously outside the conversation?
'Miss Leyburn, why are you coughing?' said Lady Charlotte suddenly.
'There is a great draught,' said Rose, shivering a little.
'So there is!' cried Lady Charlotte. 'Why, we have got both the windows open. Hugh, draw up
      Miss Leyburn's.'
He moved over to her and drew it up.
'I thought you liked a tornado,' he said to her, smiling. 'Will you have a shawl?—there is
      one behind me.'
'No, thank you,' she replied rather stiffly, and he was silent—retaining his place opposite
      to her, however.
'Have we reached Mr. Elsmere's part of the world yet?' asked Lady Charlotte, looking
      out.
'Yes, we are not far off—the river is to our right. We shall pass St. Wilfrid's soon.'
The coachman turned into a street where an open-air market
       was going on. The roadway and pavements were swarming; the carriage could barely
      pick its way through the masses of human beings. Flaming gas-jets threw it all into strong
      satanic light and shade. At the corner of a dingy alley Rose could see a fight going on; the
      begrimed ragged children, regardless of the April rain, swooped backwards and forwards under
      the very hoofs of the horses, or flattened their noses against the windows whenever the horses
      were forced into a walk.
The young girl-figure in gray, with the gray feathered hat, seemed specially to excite their
      notice. The glare of the street brought out the lines of the face, the gold of the hair. The
      Arabs outside made loutishly flattering remarks once or twice, and Rose, colouring, drew back
      as far as she could into the carriage. Mr. Flaxman seemed not to hear; his aunt, with that
      obtrusive thirst for information which is so fashionable now among all women of position, was
      cross-questioning him as to the trades and population of the district, and he was drily
      responding. In reality his mind was full of a whirl of feeling, of a wild longing to break
      down a futile barrier and trample on a baffling resistance, to take that beautiful tameless
      creature in strong coercing arms, scold her, crush her, love her! Why does she make happiness
      so difficult? What right has she to hold devotion so cheap? He too grows angry. 'She was
       not in love with that spectral creature,' the inner self declares with energy—'I
      will vow she never was. But she is like all the rest—a slave to the merest forms and trappings
      of sentiment. Because he ought to have loved her, and didn't, because she
       fancied she loved him, and didn't, my love is to be an offence to her!
      Monstrous—unjust!'
Suddenly they sped past St. Wilfrid's, resplendent with lights, the jewelled windows of the
      choir rising above the squalid walls and roofs into the rainy darkness, as the mystical chapel
      of the Graal, with its 'torches glimmering fair,' flashed out of the mountain storm and
      solitude on to Galahad's seeking eyes.
Rose bent forward involuntarily. 'What angel singing!' she said, dropping the window again
      to listen to the retreating sounds, her artist's eye kindling. 'Did you hear it? It was the
      last chorus in the St. Matthew Passion music.'
'I did not distinguish it,' he said—'but their music is famous.'
His tone was distant; there was no friendliness in it. It would have been pleasant to her if
      he would have taken up her little remark and let bygones be bygones. But he showed no
      readiness to do so. The subject dropped, and presently he moved back to his former seat and
      Lady Charlotte and he resumed their talk. Rose could not but see that his manner towards her
      was much changed. She herself had compelled it, but all the same she saw him leave her with a
      capricious little pang of regret, and afterwards the drive seemed to her more tedious and the
      dismal streets more dismal than before.


She tried to forget her companions altogether. Oh! what would Robert have to say? She was
      unhappy, restless. In her trouble lately it had often pleased her to go quite alone to strange
      churches, where for a moment the burden of the self had seemed lightened. But the old things
      were not always congenial to her, and there were modern ferments at work in her. No one of her
      family, unless it were Agnes, suspected what was going on. But in truth the rich crude nature
      had been touched at last, as Robert's had been long ago in Mr. Grey's lecture-room, by the
      piercing under-voices of things—the moral message of the world. 'What will he have to say?'
      she asked herself again feverishly, and as she looked across to Mr. Flaxman she felt a
      childish wish to be friends again with him, with everybody. Life was too difficult as it was,
      without quarrels and misunderstandings to make it worse.
