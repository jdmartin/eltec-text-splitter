CHAPTER XL
A long street of warehouses—and at the end of it the horses slackened.
'I saw the president of the club yesterday,' said Flaxman, looking out. 'He is an old friend
      of mine—a most intelligent fanatic—met him on a Mansion House Fund committee last winter. He
      promised we should be looked after. But we shall only get back seats, and you'll have to put
      up with the smoking. They don't want ladies, and we shall only be there on sufferance.'
The carriage stopped. Mr. Flaxman guided his charges with some difficulty through the crowd
      about the steps, who inspected them and their vehicle with a frank and not over-friendly
      curiosity. At the door they found a man who had been sent to look for them, and were
      immediately taken possession of. He ushered them into the back of a large bare hall, glaringly
      lit, lined with white brick, and hung at intervals with political portraits and a few cheap
      engravings of famous men, Jesus of Nazareth taking his turn with Buddha, Socrates, Moses,
      Shakespeare, and Paul of Tarsus.
'Can't put you any forrarder, I'm afraid,' said their guide, with a shrug of the shoulders.
      'The committee don't like strangers coming, and Mr. Collett, he got hauled over the coals for
      letting you in this evening.'
It was a new position for Lady Charlotte to be anywhere on sufferance. However, in the
      presence of three hundred smoking men, who might all of them be political assassins in
      disguise for anything she knew, she accepted her fate with meekness; and she and Rose settled
      themselves into their back seat under a rough sort of gallery, glad of their veils, and nearly
      blinded with the smoke.


The hall was nearly full, and Mr. Flaxman looked curiously round upon its occupants. The
      majority of them were clearly artisans—a spare, stooping, sharp-featured race. Here and there
      were a knot of stalwart dock-labourers, strongly marked out in physique from the watchmakers
      and the potters, or an occasional seaman out of work, ship-steward, boatswain, or what not,
      generally bronzed, quick-eyed, and comely, save where the film of excess had already deadened
      colour and expression. Almost every one had a pot of beer before him, standing on long wooden
      flaps attached to the benches. The room was full of noise, coming apparently from the farther
      end, where some political bravo seemed to be provoking his neighbours. In their own vicinity
      the men scattered about were for the most part tugging silently at their pipes, alternately
      eyeing the clock and the new-comers.
There was a stir of feet round the door.
'There he is,' said Mr. Flaxman, craning round to see, and Robert entered.
He started as he saw them, flashed a smile to Rose, shook his head at Mr. Flaxman, and
      passed up the room.
'He looks pale and nervous,' said Lady Charlotte grimly, pouncing at once on the unpromising
      side of things. 'If he breaks down are you prepared, Hugh, to play Elisha?'
Flaxman was far too much interested in the beginnings of the performance to answer.
Robert was standing forward on the platform, the chairman of the meeting at his side,
      members of the committee sitting behind on either hand. A good many men put down their pipes,
      and the hubbub of talk ceased. Others smoked on stolidly.
The chairman introduced the lecturer. The subject of the address would be, as they already
      knew, 'The Claim of Jesus upon Modern Life.' It was not very likely, he imagined, that Mr.
      Elsmere's opinions would square with those dominant in the club; but, whether or no, he
      claimed for him, as for everybody, a patient hearing, and the Englishman's privilege of fair
      play.
The speaker, a cabinetmaker dressed in a decent brown suit, spoke with fluency, and at the
      same time with that accent of moderation and savoir faire which some Englishmen in
      all classes have obviously inherited from centuries of government by discussion. Lady
      Charlotte, whose Liberalism was the mere varnish of an essentially aristocratic temper, was
      conscious of a certain dismay at the culture of the democracy as the man sat down. Mr.
      Flaxman, glancing to the right, saw a group of men standing, and amongst them a slight
      sharp-featured thread-paper of a man, with a taller companion, whom he identified as the pair
      he had noticed on the night of the story-telling. The little gasfitter was clearly all nervous
      fidget and expectation; the other, large and gaunt in figure, with a square impassive face,
      and close-shut lips that had a perpetual mocking twist in
       the corners, stood beside him like some clumsy modern version, in a commoner clay,
      of Goethe's 'spirit that denies.'
Robert came forward with a roll of papers in his hand.
His first words were hardly audible. Rose felt her colour rising, Lady Charlotte glanced at
      her nephew, the standing group of men cried, 'Speak up!' The voice in the distance rose at
      once, braced by the touch of difficulty, and what it said came firmly down to them.
In after days Flaxman could not often be got to talk of the experience of this evening. When
      he did he would generally say, briefly, that as an intellectual effort he had never
      been inclined to rank this first public utterance very high among Elsmere's performances. The
      speaker's own emotion had stood somewhat in his way. A man argues better, perhaps, when he
      feels less.
'I have often heard him put his case, as I thought, more cogently in conversation,' Flaxman
      would say—though only to his most intimate friends—'but what I never saw before or since was
      such an effect of personality as he produced that night. From that moment, at any
      rate, I loved him, and I understood his secret!'
Elsmere began with a few words of courteous thanks to the club for the hearing they had
      promised him.
Then he passed on to the occasion of his address—the vogue in the district of 'certain
      newspapers which, I understand, are specially relished and patronised by your
      association.'
And he laid down on a table beside him the copies of the Freethinker and of
       Faith and Fools which he had brought with him, and faced his audience again, his
      hands on his sides.
'Well! I am not here to-night to attack those newspapers. I want to reach your sympathies if
      I can in another way. If there is anybody here who takes pleasure in them, who thinks that
      such writing and such witticisms as he gets purveyed to him in these sheets do really help the
      cause of truth and intellectual freedom, I shall not attack his position from the front. I
      shall try to undermine it. I shall aim at rousing in him such a state of feeling as may
      suddenly convince him that what is injured by writing of this sort is not the orthodox
      Christian, or the Church, or Jesus of Nazareth, but always and inevitably the man who writes
      it and the man who loves it! His mind is possessed of an inflaming and hateful image, which
      drives him to mockery and violence. I want to replace it, if I can, by one of calm, of beauty
      and tenderness, which may drive him to humility and sympathy. And this, indeed, is the only
      way in which opinion is ever really altered—by the substitution of one mental picture for
      another.
'But in the first place,' resumed the speaker, after a moment's pause, changing his note a
      little, 'a word about myself. I am not here to-night quite in the position of the casual
      stranger, coming down to your district for the first time. As some of you
       know, I am endeavouring to make what is practically a settlement among you, asking
      you working-men to teach me, if you will, what you have to teach as to the wants and prospects
      of your order, and offering you in return whatever there is in me which may be worth your
      taking. Well, I imagine I should look at a man who preferred a claim of that sort with some
      closeness! You may well ask me for "antecedents," and I should like, if I may, to give them to
      you very shortly.
'Well, then, though I came down to this place under the wing of Mr. Edwardes' (some
      cheering) 'who is so greatly liked and respected here, I am not a Unitarian, nor am I an
      English Churchman. A year ago I was the vicar of an English country parish, where I should
      have been proud, so far as personal happiness went, to spend my life. Last autumn I left it
      and resigned my orders because I could no longer accept the creed of the English Church.'
      Unconsciously the thin dignified figure drew itself up, the voice took a certain dryness. All
      this was distasteful, but the orator's instinct was imperious.
As he spoke about a score of pipes which had till now been active in Flaxman's neighbourhood
      went down. The silence in the room became suddenly of a perceptibly different quality.
'Since then I have joined no other religious association. But it is not—God forbid!—because
      there is nothing left me to believe, but because in this transition England it is well for a
      man who has broken with the old things, to be very patient. No good can come of
      forcing opinion or agreement prematurely. A generation, nay, more, may have to spend itself in
      mere waiting and preparing for those new leaders and those new forms of corporate action which
      any great revolution of opinion, such as that we are now living through, has always produced
      in the past, and will, we are justified in believing, produce again. But the hour and the men
      will come, and "they also serve who only stand and wait!"'
Voice and look had kindled into fire. The consciousness of his audience was passing from
      him—the world of ideas was growing clearer.
'So much, then, for personalities of one sort. There are some of another, however, which I
      must touch upon for a moment. I am to speak to you to-night of the Jesus of history, but not
      only as an historian. History is good, but religion is better!—and if Jesus of Nazareth
      concerned me, and, in my belief, concerned you, only as an historical figure, I should not be
      here to-night.
'But if I am to talk religion to you, and I have begun by telling you I am not this and not
      that, it seems to me that for mere clearness' sake, for the sake of that round and whole image
      of thought which I want to present to you, you must let me run through a preliminary
      confession of faith—as short and simple as I can make it. You must let me describe certain
      views of the universe and of man's place in it, which make the frame
      work, as it were, into which I shall ask you to fit the picture of Jesus which will
      come after.'
Robert stood a moment considering. An instant's nervousness, a momentary sign of
      self-consciousness, would have broken the spell and set the room against him. He showed
      neither.
'My friends,' he said at last, speaking to the crowded benches of London workmen with the
      same simplicity he would have used towards his boys at Murewell, 'the man who is addressing
      you to-night believes in God; and in Conscience, which is God's witness in
      the soul; and in Experience, which is at once the record and the instrument of man's
      education at God's hands. He places his whole trust, for life and death, "in God the
       Father Almighty"—in that force at the root of things which is revealed to us whenever a
      man helps his neighbour, or a mother denies herself for her child; whenever a soldier dies
      without a murmur for his country, or a sailor puts out in the darkness to rescue the
      perishing; whenever a workman throws mind and conscience into his work, or a statesman labours
      not for his own gain but for that of the State! He believes in an Eternal Goodness—and an
      Eternal Mind—of which Nature and Man are the continuous and the only revelation....'
The room grew absolutely still. And into the silence there fell, one by one, the short terse
      sentences, in which the seer, the believer, struggled to express what God has been, is, and
      will ever be to the soul which trusts Him. In them the whole effort of the speaker was really
      to restrain, to moderate, to depersonalise the voice of faith. But the intensity of each word
      burnt it into the hearer as it was spoken. Even Lady Charlotte turned a little pale—the tears
      stood in her eyes.
Then, from the witness of God in the soul, and in the history of man's moral life, Elsmere
      turned to the glorification of Experience, 'of that unvarying and rational order of
      the world which has been the appointed instrument of man's training since life and thought
      began.'
'There,' he said slowly, 'in the unbroken sequences of nature, in the physical
      history of the world, in the long history of man, physical, intellectual, moral—there
      lies the revelation of God. There is no other, my friends!'
Then, while the room hung on his words, he entered on a brief exposition of the text,
       'Miracles do not happen,' restating Hume's old argument, and adding to it some of
      the most cogent of those modern arguments drawn from literature, from history, from the
      comparative study of religions and religious evidence, which were not practically at Hume's
      disposal, but which are now affecting the popular mind as Hume's reasoning could never have
      affected it.
'We are now able to show how miracle, or the belief in it, which is the same thing, comes
      into being. The study of miracle in all nations, and under all conditions, yields every
      where the same results. Miracle may be the child of imagination, of love, nay, of a
      passionate sincerity, but invariably it lives with ignorance and is withered by
      knowledge!'
And then, with lightning unexpectedness, he turned upon his audience, as though the ardent
      soul reacted at once against a strain of mere negation.
'But do not let yourselves imagine for an instant that, because in a rational view of
      history there is no place for a Resurrection and Ascension, therefore you may profitably allow
      yourself a mean and miserable mirth of this sort over the past!'—and his outstretched
      hand struck the newspapers beside him with passion, 'Do not imagine for an instant that what
      is binding, adorable, beautiful in that past is done away with when miracle is given up! No,
      thank God! We still "live by admiration, hope, and love." God only draws closer, great men
      become greater, human life more wonderful as miracle disappears. Woe to you if you cannot see
      it!—it is the testing truth of our day.
'And besides—do you suppose that mere violence, mere invective, and savage mockery ever
      accomplished anything—nay, what is more to the point, ever destroyed anything in
      human history? No—an idea cannot be killed from without—it can only be supplanted,
      transformed, by another idea, and that one of equal virtue and magic. Strange paradox! In the
      moral world you cannot pull down except by gentleness—you cannot revolutionise except by
      sympathy. Jesus only superseded Judaism by absorbing and recreating all that was best in it.
      There are no inexplicable gaps and breaks in the story of humanity. The religion of to-day,
      with all its faults and mistakes, will go on unshaken so long as there is nothing else of
      equal loveliness and potency to put in its place. The Jesus of the churches will remain
      paramount so long as the man of to-day imagines himself dispensed by any increase of knowledge
      from loving the Jesus of history.
'But why? you will ask me. What does the Jesus of history matter to me?'
And so he was brought to the place of great men in the development of mankind—to the part
      played in the human story by those lives in which men have seen all their noblest thoughts of
      God, of duty, and of law embodied, realised before them with a shining and incomparable
      beauty.
' ... You think—because it is becoming plain to the modern eye that the ignorant love of his
      first followers wreathed his life in legend, that therefore you can escape from Jesus of
      Nazareth, you can put him aside as though he had never been? Folly! Do what you will, you
      cannot escape him. His life and death underlie our institutions as the alphabet underlies our
      literature. Just as the lives of Buddha and of Mohammed are wrought ineffaceably into the
      civilisation of Africa and Asia, so the life of Jesus is wrought ineffaceably into the higher
      civilisation, the
       nobler social conceptions of Europe. It is wrought into your being and into mine.
      We are what we are to-night, as Englishmen and as citizens, largely because a Galilean peasant
      was born and grew to manhood, and preached, and loved, and died. And you think that a fact so
      tremendous can be just scoffed away—that we can get rid of it, and of our share in it, by a
      ribald paragraph and a caricature!
'No. Your hatred and your ridicule are powerless. And thank God they are powerless. There is
      no wanton waste in the moral world, any more than in the material. There is only fruitful
      change and beneficent transformation. Granted that the true story of Jesus of Nazareth was
      from the beginning obscured by error and mistake; granted that those errors and mistakes which
      were once the strength of Christianity are now its weakness, and by the slow march and
      sentence of time are now threatening, unless we can clear them away, to lessen the hold of
      Jesus on the love and remembrance of man. What then? The fact is merely a call to you and me,
      who recognise it, to go back to the roots of things, to reconceive the Christ, to bring him
      afresh into our lives, to make the life so freely given for man minister again in new ways to
      man's new needs. Every great religion is, in truth, a concentration of great ideas, capable,
      as all ideas are, of infinite expansion and adaptation. And woe to our human weakness if it
      loose its hold one instant before it must on any of those rare and precious possessions which
      have helped it in the past, and may again inspire it in the future!
'To reconceive the Christ! It is the special task of our age, though in some sort
      and degree it has been the ever-recurring task of Europe since the beginning.'
He paused, and then very simply, and so as to be understood by those who heard him, he gave
      a rapid sketch of that great operation worked by the best intellect of Europe during the last
      half-century—broadly speaking—on the facts and documents of primitive Christianity. From all
      sides and by the help of every conceivable instrument those facts have been investigated, and
      now at last the great result—'the revivified reconceived truth'—seems ready to emerge! Much
      may still be known—much can never be known; but if we will, we may now discern the true
      features of Jesus of Nazareth, as no generation but our own has been able to discern them,
      since those who had seen and handled passed away.
'Let me try, however feebly, and draw it afresh for you, that life of lives, that story of
      stories, as the labour of our own age in particular has patiently revealed it to us. Come back
      with me through the centuries; let us try and see the Christ of Galilee and the Christ of
      Jerusalem as he was, before a credulous love and Jewish tradition and Greek subtlety had at
      once dimmed and glorified the truth. Ah! do what we will, it is so scanty and poor, this
      knowledge of ours, compared with all that we
       yearn to know—but, such as it is, let me, very humbly and very tentatively,
      endeavour to put it before you.'
At this point Flaxman's attention was suddenly distracted by a stir round the door of
      entrance on his left hand. Looking round, he saw a Ritualist priest, in cassock and cloak,
      disputing in hurried undertones with the men about the door. At last he gained his point
      apparently, for the men, with half-angry, half-quizzing looks at each other, allowed him to
      come in, and he found a seat. Flaxman was greatly struck by the face—by its ascetic beauty,
      the stern and yet delicate whiteness and emaciation of it. He sat with both hands resting on
      the stick he held in front of him, intently listening, the perspiration of physical weakness
      on his brow and round his finely curved mouth. Clearly he could hardly see the lecturer, for
      the room had become inconveniently crowded, and the men about him were mostly standing.
'One of the St. Wilfrid's priests, I suppose,' Flaxman said to himself. 'What on earth is he
      doing dans cette galère? Are we to have a disputation? That would be dramatic.'
He had no attention, however, to spare, and the intruder was promptly forgotten. When he
      turned back to the platform he found that Robert, with Mackay's help, had hung on a screen to
      his right, four or five large drawings of Nazareth, of the Lake of Gennesaret, of Jerusalem,
      and the Temple of Herod, of the ruins of that synagogue on the probable site of Capernaum in
      which conceivably Jesus may have stood. They were bold and striking, and filled the bare hall
      at once with suggestions of the East. He had used them often at Murewell. Then, adopting a
      somewhat different tone, he plunged into the life of Jesus. He brought to it all his trained
      historical power, all his story-telling faculty, all his sympathy with the needs of feeling.
      And bit by bit, as the quick nervous sentences issued and struck, each like the touch of a
      chisel, the majestic figure emerged, set against its natural background, instinct with some
      fraction at least of the magic of reality, most human, most persuasive, most tragic. He
      brought out the great words of the new faith, to which, whatever may be their literal origin,
      Jesus, and Jesus only, gave currency and immortal force. He dwelt on the magic, the
      permanence, the expansiveness, of the young Nazarene's central conception—the spiritualised,
      universalised 'Kingdom of God.' Elsmere's thought, indeed, knew nothing of a perfect man, as
      it knew nothing of an incarnate God; he shrank from nothing that he believed true; but every
      limitation, every reserve he allowed himself, did but make the whole more poignantly real, and
      the claim of Jesus more penetrating.
'The world has grown since Jesus preached in Galilee and Judæa. We cannot learn the
       whole of God's lesson from him now—nay, we could not then! But all that is most
      essential to man—all that saves the soul, all that purifies the heart—that
       he has still for you and me, as he had it for the men and women of his own
      time.'
Then he came to the last scenes. His voice sank a little; his notes dropped from his hand;
      and the silence grew oppressive. The dramatic force, the tender passionate insight, the
      fearless modernness with which the story was told, made it almost unbearable. Those listening
      saw the trial, the streets of Jerusalem, that desolate place outside the northern gate; they
      were spectators of the torture, they heard the last cry. No one present had ever so seen, so
      heard before. Rose had hidden her face. Flaxman for the first time forgot to watch the
      audience; the men had forgotten each other; and for the first time that night, in many a cold
      embittered heart, there was born that love of the Son of Man which Nathaniel felt, and John,
      and Mary of Bethany, and which has in it now, as then, the promise of the future.
'"He laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock, and he rolled a stone against
       the door of the tomb." The ashes of Jesus of Nazareth mingled with the earth of
      Palestine—

'"Far hence he lies
In the lorn Syrian town,
And on his grave, with shining eyes,
The Syrian stars look down."'

He stopped. The melancholy cadence of the verse died away. Then a gleam broke over the pale
      exhausted face—a gleam of extraordinary sweetness.
'And in the days and weeks that followed the devout and passionate fancy of a few mourning
      Galileans begat the exquisite fable of the Resurrection. How natural—and amid all its
      falseness—how true, is that naïve and contradictory story! The rapidity with which it spread
      is a measure of many things. It is, above all, a measure of the greatness of Jesus, of the
      force with which he had drawn to himself the hearts and imaginations of men....
'And now, my friends, what of all this? If these things I have been saying to you are true,
      what is the upshot of them for you and me? Simply this, as I conceive it—that instead of
      wasting your time, and degrading your souls, by indulgence in such grime as this'—and he
      pointed to the newspapers—'it is your urgent business and mine—at this moment—to do our very
       utmost to bring this life of Jesus, our precious invaluable possession as a people,
      back into some real and cogent relation with our modern lives and beliefs and hopes. Do not
      answer me that such an effort is a mere dream and futility, conceived in the vague, apart from
      reality—that men must have something to worship, and that if they cannot worship Jesus they
      will not trouble to love him. Is the world desolate with God still in it, and does it rest
      merely with us to love or not to love? Love and revere something we must, if we are
      to be men and
       not beasts. At all times and in all nations, as I have tried to show you, man has
      helped himself by the constant and passionate memory of those great ones of his race who have
      spoken to him most audibly of God and of eternal hope. And for us Europeans and Englishmen, as
      I have also tried to show you, history and inheritance have decided. If we turn away from the
      true Jesus of Nazareth because he has been disfigured and misrepresented by the Churches, we
      turn away from that in which our weak wills and desponding souls are meant to find their most
      obvious and natural help and inspiration—from that symbol of the Divine, which, of necessity,
      means most to us. No! give him back your hearts—be ashamed that you have ever
      forgotten your debt to him! Let combination and brotherhood do for the newer and simpler faith
      what they did once for the old—let them give it a practical shape, a practical grip on human
      life.... Then we too shall have our Easter!—we too shall have the right to say, He is not
       here, he is risen. Not here—in legend, in miracle, in the beautiful outworn forms and
      crystallisations of older thought. He is risen—in a wiser reverence and a more
      reasonable love; risen in new forms of social help inspired by his memory, called afresh by
      his name! Risen—if you and your children will it—in a church or company of the faithful, over
      the gates of which two sayings of man's past, into which man's present has breathed new
      meanings, shall be written:—
'In Thee, O Eternal, have I put my trust:'
and—
'This do in remembrance of Me.'
The rest was soon over. The audience woke from the trance in which it had been held with a
      sudden burst of talk and movement. In the midst of it, and as the majority of the audience
      were filing out into the adjoining rooms, the gasfitter's tall companion Andrews mounted the
      platform, while the gasfitter himself, with an impatient shrug, pushed his way into the
      outgoing crowd. Andrews went slowly and deliberately to work, dealing out his long
      cantankerous sentences with a nasal sang froid which seemed to change in a moment the
      whole aspect and temperature of things. He remarked that Mr. Elsmere had talked of what great
      scholars had done to clear up this matter of Christ and Christianity. Well, he was free to
      maintain that old Tom Paine was as good a scholar as any of 'em, and most of them in that hall
      knew what he thought about it. Tom Paine hadn't anything to say against Jesus Christ,
      and he hadn't. He was a workman and a fine sort of man, and if he'd been alive now he'd have
      been a Socialist, 'as most of us are,' and he'd have made it hot for the rich loafers, and the
      sweaters, and the middlemen, 'as we'd like to make it hot for 'em.' But as for those people
      who got up the Church—Mythologists Tom Paine called 'em—and the miracles, and made an
       uncommonly good thing out of it, pecuniarily speaking, he didn't see what they'd
      got to do with keeping up, or mending, or preserving their precious bit of work. The
      world had found 'em out, and serve 'em right.
And he wound up with a fierce denunciation of priests, not without a harsh savour and
      eloquence, which was much clapped by the small knot of workmen amongst whom he had been
      standing.
Then there followed a Socialist—an eager, ugly, black-bearded little fellow, who preached
      the absolute necessity of doing without 'any cultus whatsoever,' threw scorn on both the
      Christians and the Positivists for refusing so to deny themselves, and appealed earnestly to
      his group of hearers 'to help in bringing religion back from heaven to earth, where it
      belongs.' Mr. Elsmere's new church, if he ever got it, would only be a fresh instrument in the
      hands of the bourgeoisie. And when the people had got their rights and brought down
      the capitalists, they were not going to be such fools as put their necks under the heel of
      what were called 'the educated classes.' The people who wrote the newspapers Mr. Elsmere
      objected to, knew quite enough for the working-man—and people should not be too smooth-spoken;
      what the working class wanted beyond everything just now was grit.
A few other short speeches followed, mostly of the common Secularist type, in defence of the
      newspapers attacked. But the defence, on the whole, was shuffling and curiously half-hearted.
      Robert, sitting by with his head on his hand, felt that there, at any rate, his onslaught had
      told.
He said a few words in reply, in a low husky voice, without a trace of his former passion,
      and the meeting broke up. The room had quickly filled when it was known that he was up again;
      and as he descended the steps of the platform, after shaking hands with the chairman, the
      hundreds present broke into a sudden burst of cheering. Lady Charlotte pressed forward to him
      through the crowd, offering to take him home. 'Come with us, Mr. Elsmere: you look like a
      ghost.' But he shook his head, smiling. 'No, thank you, Lady Charlotte—I must have some air,'
      and he took her out on his arm, while Flaxman followed with Rose.
It once occurred to Flaxman to look round for the priest he had seen come in. But there were
      no signs of him. 'I had an idea he would have spoken,' he thought. 'Just as well, perhaps. We
      should have had a row.'
Lady Charlotte threw herself back in the carriage as they drove off, with a long breath, and
      the inward reflection, 'So his wife wouldn't come and hear him! Must be a woman with a
      character that—a Strafford in petticoats!'
Robert turned up the street to the City, the tall slight figure
       seeming to shrink together as he walked. After his passionate effort, indescribable
      depression had overtaken him.
'Words—words!' he said to himself, striking out his hands in a kind of feverish protest, as
      he strode along, against his own powerlessness, against that weight of the present and the
      actual which seems to the enthusiast alternately light as air, or heavy as the mass of Ætna on
      the breast of Enceladus.
Suddenly, at the corner of a street, a man's figure in a long black robe stopped him and
      laid a hand on his arm.
'Newcome!' cried Robert, standing still.
'I was there,' said the other, bending forward and looking close into his eyes. 'I heard
      almost all. I went to confront, to denounce you!'
By the light of a lamp not far off Robert caught the attenuated whiteness and sharpness of
      the well-known face, to which weeks of fasting and mystical excitement had given a kind of
      unearthly remoteness. He gathered himself together with an inward groan. He felt as though
      there were no force in him at that moment wherewith to meet reproaches, to beat down
      fanaticism. The pressure on nerve and strength seemed unbearable.
Newcome, watching him with eagle eye, saw the sudden shrinking and hesitation. He had often
      in old days felt the same sense of power over the man who yet, in what seemed his weakness,
      had always escaped him in the end.
'I went to denounce,' he continued, in a strange tense voice, 'and the Lord refused it to
      me. He kept me watching for you here. These words are not mine I speak. I waited patiently in
      that room till the Lord should deliver His enemy into my hand. My wrath was hot against the
      deserter that could not even desert in silence—hot against his dupes. Then suddenly words came
      to me—they have come to me before, they burn up the very heart and marrow in me—"Who is he
       that saith, and it cometh to pass, and the Lord commandeth it not?" There they were in
      my ears, written on the walls—the air——'
The hand dropped from Robert's arm. A dull look of defeat, of regret, darkened the gleaming
      eyes. They were standing in a quiet deserted street, but through a side opening the lights,
      the noise, the turbulence of the open-air market came drifting to them through the rainy
      atmosphere which blurred and magnified everything.
'Ay, after days and nights in His most blessed sanctuary,' Newcome resumed slowly, 'I came
      by His commission, as I thought, to fight His battle with a traitor! And at the last moment
      His strength, which was in me, went from me. I sat there dumb; His hand was heavy upon me. His
      will be done!'
The voice sank; the priest drew his thin shaking hand across his eyes, as though the awe of
      a mysterious struggle were still upon him. Then he turned again to Elsmere, his face
      softening, radiating.


'Elsmere, take the sign, the message! I thought it was given to me to declare the Lord's
      wrath. Instead, He sends you once more by me, even now—even fresh from this new defiance of
      His mercy, the tender offer of His grace! He lies at rest to-night, my brother'—what sweetness
      in the low vibrating tones!—'after all the anguish. Let me draw you down on your knees beside
      Him. It is you, you, who have helped to drive in the nails, to embitter the agony! It is you
      who in His loneliness have been robbing Him of the souls that should be His! It is you who
      have been doing your utmost to make His Cross and Passion of no effect. Oh, let it break your
      heart to think of it! Watch by Him to-night, my friend, my brother, and to-morrow let the
      risen Lord reclaim His own!'
Never had Robert seen any mortal face so persuasively beautiful; never surely did saint or
      ascetic plead with a more penetrating gentleness. After the storm of those opening words the
      change was magical. The tears stood in Elsmere's eyes. But his quick insight, in spite of
      himself, divined the subtle natural facts behind the outburst, the strained physical state,
      the irritable brain—all the consequences of a long defiance of physical and mental law. The
      priest repelled him, the man drew him like a magnet.
'What can I say to you, Newcome?' he cried despairingly. 'Let me say nothing, dear old
      friend! I am tired out; so, I expect, are you. I know what this week has been to you. Walk
      with me a little. Leave these great things alone. We cannot agree. Be content—God knows! Tell
      me about the old place and the people. I long for news of them.'
A sort of shudder passed through his companion. Newcome stood wrestling with himself. It was
      like the slow departure of a possessing force. Then he sombrely assented, and they turned
      towards the City. But his answers, as Robert questioned him, were sharp and mechanical, and
      presently it became evident that the demands of the ordinary talk to which Elsmere rigorously
      held him were more than he could bear.
As they reached St. Paul's, towering into the watery moonlight of the clouded sky, he
      stopped abruptly and said good-night.
'You came to me in the spirit of war,' said Robert, with some emotion, as he held his hand;
      'give me instead the grasp of peace!'
The spell of his manner, his presence, prevailed at last. A melancholy quivering smile
      dawned on the priest's delicate lip.
'God bless you—God restore you!' he said sadly, and was gone.
