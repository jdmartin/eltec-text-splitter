CHAPTER VIII
Catherine was much perplexed as to how she was to carry out her resolution; she pondered
      over it through much of the night. She was painfully anxious to make Elsmere understand
      without a scene, without a definite proposal and a definite rejection. It was no use letting
      things drift. Something brusque and marked there must be. She quietly made her
      dispositions.
It was long after the gray vaporous morning stole on the hills before she fell lightly,
      restlessly asleep. To her healthful youth a sleepless night was almost unknown. She wondered
      through the long hours of it, whether now, like other women, she had had her story, passed
      through her one supreme moment, and she thought of one or two worthy old maids she knew in the
      neighbourhood with a new and curious pity. Had any of them, too, gone down into Marrisdale and
      come up widowed indeed?
All through, no doubt, there was a certain melancholy pride in her own spiritual strength.
      'It was not mine,' she would have said with perfect sincerity, 'but God's.' Still, whatever
      its source, it had been there at command, and the reflection carried with it a sad sense of
      security. It was as though a soldier after his first skirmish should congratulate himself on
      being bulletproof.
To be sure, there was an intense trouble and disquiet in the thought that she and Mr.
      Elsmere must meet again, probably many times. The period of his original invitation had been
      warmly extended by the Thornburghs. She believed he meant to stay another week or ten days in
      the valley. But in the spiritual exaltation of the night she felt herself equal to any
      conflict, any endurance, and she fell asleep, the hands clasped on her breast expressing a
      kind of resolute patience, like those of some old sepulchral monument.
The following morning Elsmere examined the clouds and the barometer with abnormal interest.
      The day was sunless and
       lowering, but not raining, and he represented to Mrs. Thornburgh, with a
      hypocritical assumption of the practical man, that with rugs and mackintoshes it was possible
      to picnic on the dampest grass. But he could not make out the vicar's wife. She was all sighs
      and flightiness. She 'supposed they could go,' and 'didn't see what good it would do them';
      she had twenty different views, and all of them more or less mixed up with pettishness, as to
      the best place for a picnic on a gray day; and at last she grew so difficult that Robert
      suspected something desperately wrong with the household, and withdrew lest male guests might
      be in the way. Then she pursued him into the study and thrust a Spectator into his
      hands, begging him to convey it to Burwood. She asked it lugubriously with many sighs, her cap
      much askew. Robert could have kissed her, curls and all, one moment for suggesting the errand,
      and the next could almost have signed her committal to the county lunatic asylum with a clear
      conscience. What an extraordinary person it was!
Off he went, however, with his Spectator under his arm, whistling. Mrs. Thornburgh
      caught the sounds through an open window, and tore the flannel across she was preparing for a
      mothers' meeting with a noise like the rattle of musketry. Whistling! She would like to know
      what grounds he had for it, indeed! She always knew—she always said, and she would go on
      saying—that Catherine Leyburn would die an old maid.
Meanwhile Robert had strolled across to Burwood with the lightest heart. By way of keeping
      all his anticipations within the bounds of strict reason, he told himself that it was
      impossible he should see 'her' in the morning. She was always busy in the morning.
He approached the house as a Catholic might approach a shrine. That was her window, that
      upper casement with the little Banksia rose twining round it. One night, when he and the vicar
      had been out late on the hills, he had seen a light streaming from it across the valley, and
      had thought how the mistress of the maiden solitude within shone 'in a naughty world.'
In the drive he met Mrs. Leyburn, who was strolling about the garden. She at once informed
      him with much languid plaintiveness that Catherine had gone to Whinborough for the day, and
      would not be able to join the picnic.
Elsmere stood still.
'Gone!' he cried. 'But it was all arranged with her yesterday!' Mrs. Leyburn
      shrugged her shoulders. She too was evidently much put out.
'So I told her. But you know, Mr. Elsmere'—and the gentle widow dropped her voice as though
      communicating a secret—'when Catherine's once made up her mind, you may as well try to dig
      away High Fell as move her. She asked me to tell Mrs. Thornburgh—will you, please?—that she
      found it was her day
       for the orphan asylum, and one or two other pieces of business, and she must
      go.'
'Mrs. Thornburgh!' And not a word for him—for him to whom she had given
      her promise? She had gone to Whinborough to avoid him, and she had gone in the brusquest way,
      that it might be unmistakable.
The young man stood with his hands thrust into the pockets of his long coat, hearing with
      half an ear the remarks that Mrs. Leyburn was making to him about the picnic. Was the wretched
      thing to come off after all?
He was too proud and sore to suggest an alternative. But Mrs. Thornburgh managed that for
      him. When he got back, he told the vicar in the hall of Miss Leyburn's flight in the fewest
      possible words, and then his long legs vanished up the stairs in a twinkling, and the door of
      his room shut behind him. A few minutes afterwards Mrs. Thornburgh's shrill voice was heard in
      the hall calling to the servant.
'Sarah, let the hamper alone. Take out the chickens.'
And a minute after the vicar came up to his door.
'Elsmere, Mrs. Thornburgh thinks the day is too uncertain; better put it off.'
To which Elsmere from inside replied with a vigorous assent. The vicar slowly descended to
      tackle his spouse, who seemed to have established herself for the morning in his sanctum,
      though the parish accounts were clamouring to be done, and this morning in the week belonged
      to them by immemorial usage.
But Mrs. Thornburgh was unmanageable. She sat opposite to him with one hand on each knee,
      solemnly demanding of him if he knew what was to be done with young women nowadays,
      because she didn't.
The tormented vicar declined to be drawn into so illimitable a subject, recommended
      patience, declared that it might be all a mistake, and tried hard to absorb himself in the
      consideration of 2s. 8d. plus 2s. 11d. minus 9d.
'And I suppose, William,' said his wife to him at last, with withering sarcasm, 'that you'd
      sit by and see Catherine break that young man's heart, and send him back to his mother no
      better than he came here, in spite of all the beef-tea and jelly Sarah and I have been putting
      into him, and never lift a finger. You'd see his life blasted and you'd do
      nothing—nothing, I suppose.'
And she fixed him with a fiercely interrogative eye.
'Of course,' cried the vicar, roused; 'I should think so. What good did an outsider ever get
      by meddling in a love affair? Take care of yourself, Emma. If the girl doesn't care for him,
      you can't make her.'
The vicar's wife rose, the upturned corners of her mouth saying unutterable things.
'Doesn't care for him!' she echoed in a tone which implied that her husband's headpiece was
      past praying for.


'Yes, doesn't care for him!' said the vicar, nettled. 'What else should make her give him a
      snub like this?'
Mrs. Thornburgh looked at him again with exasperation. Then a curious expression stole into
      her eyes.
'Oh, the Lord only knows!' she said, with a hasty freedom of speech which left the vicar
      feeling decidedly uncomfortable as she shut the door after her.
However, if the Higher Powers alone knew, Mrs. Thornburgh was convinced that she
      could make a very shrewd guess at the causes of Catherine's behaviour. In her opinion it was
      all pure 'cussedness.' Catherine Leyburn had always conducted her life on principles entirely
      different from those of other people. Mrs. Thornburgh wholly denied, as she sat bridling by
      herself, that it was a Christian necessity to make yourself and other people uncomfortable.
      Yet this was what this perverse young woman was always doing. Here was a charming young man
      who had fallen in love with her at first sight, and had done his best to make the fact plain
      to her in the most chivalrous devoted ways. Catherine encourages him, walks with him, talks
      with him, is for a whole three weeks more gay and cheerful and more like other girls than she
      has ever been known to be, and then, at the end of it, just when everybody is breathlessly
      awaiting the natural dénouement, goes off to spend the day that should have been the
      day of her betrothal in pottering about orphan asylums, leaving everybody, but especially the
      poor young man, to look ridiculous! No, Mrs. Thornburgh had no patience with her—none at all.
      It was all because she would not be happy like anybody else, but must needs set herself up to
      be peculiar. Why not live on a pillar, and go into hair-shirts at once? Then the rest of the
      world would know what to be at.
Meanwhile Rose was in no small excitement. While her mother and Elsmere had been talking in
      the garden she had been discreetly waiting in the back behind the angle of the house, and when
      she saw Elsmere walk off she followed him with eager sympathetic eyes.
'Poor fellow!' she said to herself, but this time with the little tone of patronage which a
      girl of eighteen, conscious of graces and good looks, never shrinks from assuming towards an
      elder male, especially a male in love with some one else. 'I wonder whether he thinks he knows
      anything about Catherine.'
But her own feeling to-day was very soft and complex. Yesterday it had been all hot
      rebellion. To-day it was all remorse and wondering curiosity. What had brought Catherine into
      her room, with that white face, and that bewildering change of policy? What had made her do
      this brusque, discourteous thing to-day? Rose, having been delayed by the loss of one of her
      goloshes in a bog, had been once near her and Elsmere during that dripping descent from
      Shanmoor. They had been so clearly absorbed in one another that she had fled on guiltily to
      Agnes, golosh in hand, without waiting to put it on; confident, how
      ever, that neither Elsmere nor Catherine had been aware of her little adventure. And
      at the Shanmoor tea Catherine herself had discussed the picnic, offering, in fact, to guide
      the party to a particular ghyll in High Fell, better known to her than any one else.
'Oh, of course it's our salvation in this world and the next that's in the way,' thought
      Rose, sitting crouched up in a grassy nook in the garden, her shoulders up to her ears, her
      chin in her hands. 'I wish to goodness Catherine wouldn't think so much about mine, at any
      rate. I hate,' added this incorrigible young person—'I hate being the third part of a "moral
      obstacle" against my will. I declare I don't believe we should any of us go to perdition even
      if Catherine did marry. And what a wretch I am to think so after last night! Oh dear, I wish
      she'd let me do something for her; I wish she'd ask me to black her boots for her, or put in
      her tuckers, or tidy her drawers for her, or anything worse still, and I'd do it and
      welcome!'
It was getting uncomfortably serious all round, Rose admitted. But there was one element of
      comedy besides Mrs. Thornburgh, and that was Mrs. Leyburn's unconsciousness.
'Mamma is too good,' thought the girl, with a little ripple of laughter. 'She takes it as a
      matter of course that all the world should admire us, and she'd scorn to believe that anybody
      did it from interested motives.'
Which was perfectly true. Mrs. Leyburn was too devoted to her daughters to feel any fidgety
      interest in their marrying. Of course the most eligible persons would be only too thankful to
      marry them when the moment came. Meanwhile her devotion was in no need of the confirming
      testimony of lovers. It was sufficient in itself, and kept her mind gently occupied from
      morning till night. If it had occurred to her to notice that Robert Elsmere had been paying
      special attentions to any one in the family, she would have suggested with perfect
       naïveté that it was herself. For he had been to her the very pink of courtesy and
      consideration, and she was of opinion that 'poor Richard's views' of the degeneracy of Oxford
      men would have been modified could he have seen this particular specimen.
Later on in the morning Rose had been out giving Bob a run, while Agnes drove with her
      mother. On the way home she overtook Elsmere returning from an errand for the vicar.
'It is not so bad,' she said to him, laughing, pointing to the sky; 'we really might have
      gone.'
'Oh, it would have been cheerless,' he said simply. His look of depression amazed her. She
      felt a quick movement of sympathy, a wild wish to bid him cheer up and fight it out. If she
      could just have shown him Catherine as she looked last night! Why couldn't she talk it out
      with him? Absurd conventions! She had half a mind to try.
But the grave look of the man beside her deterred even her young half-childish audacity.


'Catherine will have a good day for all her business,' she said carelessly.
He assented quietly. Oh, after that hand-shake on the bridge yesterday she could not stand
      it,—she must give him a hint how the land lay.
'I suppose she will spend the afternoon with Aunt Ellen. Mr. Elsmere, what did you think of
      Aunt Ellen?'
Elsmere started, and could not help smiling into the young girl's beautiful eyes, which were
      radiant with fun.
'A most estimable person,' he said. 'Are you on good terms with her, Miss Rose?'
'Oh dear, no!' she said, with a little face. 'I'm not a Leyburn; I wear æsthetic dresses,
      and Aunt Ellen has "special leadings of the spirit" to the effect that the violin is a
      soul-destroying instrument. Oh dear!'—and the girl's mouth twisted—'it's alarming to think, if
      Catherine hadn't been Catherine, how like Aunt Ellen she might have been!'
She flashed a mischievous look at him, and thrilled as she caught the sudden change of
      expression in his face.
'Your sister has the Westmoreland strength in her—one can see that,' he said, evidently
      speaking with some difficulty.
'Strength! Oh yes. Catherine has plenty of strength,' cried Rose, and then was silent a
      moment. 'You know, Mr. Elsmere,' she went on at last, obeying some inward impulse—'or perhaps
      you don't know—that, at home, we are all Catherine's creatures. She does exactly what she
      likes with us. When my father died she was sixteen, Agnes was ten, I was eight. We came here
      to live—we were not very rich of course, and mamma wasn't strong. Well, she did everything:
      she taught us—we have scarcely had any teacher but her since then; she did most of the
      housekeeping; and you can see for yourself what she does for the neighbours and poor folk. She
      is never ill, she is never idle, she always knows her own mind. We owe everything we are,
      almost everything we have, to her. Her nursing has kept mamma alive through one or two
      illnesses. Our lawyer says he never knew any business affairs better managed than ours, and
      Catherine manages them. The one thing she never takes any care or thought for is herself. What
      we should do without her I can't imagine; and yet sometimes I think if it goes on much longer
      none of us three will have any character of our own left. After all, you know, it may be good
      for the weak people to struggle on their own feet, if the strong would only believe it,
      instead of always being carried. The strong people needn't be always trampling on
      themselves,—if they only knew——'
She stopped abruptly, flushing scarlet over her own daring. Her eyes were feverishly bright,
      and her voice vibrated under a strange mixture of feelings—sympathy, reverence, and a
      passionate inner admiration struggling with rebellion and protest.


They had reached the gate of the vicarage. Elsmere stopped and looked at his companion with
      a singular lightening of expression. He saw perfectly that the young impetuous creature
      understood him, that she felt his cause was not prospering, and that she wanted to help him.
      He saw that what she meant by this picture of their common life was that no one need expect
      Catherine Leyburn to be an easy prey; that she wanted to impress on him in her eager way that
      such lives as her sister's were not to be gathered at a touch, without difficulty, from the
      branch that bears them. She was exhorting him to courage,—nay, he caught more than
      exhortation—a sort of secret message from her bright excited looks and incoherent speech that
      made his heart leap. But pride and delicacy forbade him to put his feeling into words.
'You don't hope to persuade me that your sister reckons you among the weak persons
      of the world?' he said, laughing, his hand on the gate. Rose could have blessed him for thus
      turning the conversation. What on earth could she have said next?
She stood bantering a little longer, and then ran off with Bob.
Elsmere passed the rest of the morning wandering meditatively over the cloudy fells. After
      all he was only where he was, before the blessed madness, the upflooding hope, nay, almost
      certainty, of yesterday. His attack had been for the moment repulsed. He gathered from Rose's
      manner that Catherine's action with regard to the picnic had not been unmeaning nor
      accidental, as on second thoughts he had been half-trying to persuade himself. Evidently those
      about her felt it to be ominous. Well, then, at worst, when they met they would meet on a
      different footing, with a sense of something critical between them. Oh, if he did but know a
      little more clearly how he stood! He spent a noonday hour on a gray rock on the side of the
      fell between Whindale and Marrisdale, studying the path opposite, the stepping-stones, the bit
      of white road. The minutes passed in a kind of trance of memory. Oh, that soft child-like
      movement to him, after his speech about her father! that heavenly yielding and
      self-forgetfulness which shone in her every look and movement as she stood balancing on the
      stepping-stones! If after all she should prove cruel to him, would he not have a legitimate
      grievance, a heavy charge to fling against her maiden gentleness? He trampled on the notion.
      Let her do with him as she would, she would be his saint always, unquestioned,
      unarraigned.
But with such a memory in his mind it was impossible that any man, least of all a man of
      Elsmere's temperament, could be very hopeless. Oh yes, he had been rash, foolhardy. Do such
      divine creatures stoop to mortal men as easily as he had dreamt? He recognises all the
      difficulties, he enters into the force of all the ties that bind her—or imagines that he does.
      But he is a man and her lover: and if she loves him, in the end love will conquer—must
      conquer. For his more modern sense, deeply
       Christianised as it is, assumes almost without argument the sacredness of passion
      and its claim—wherein a vast difference between himself and that solitary wrestler in
      Marrisdale.
Meanwhile he kept all his hopes and fears to himself. Mrs. Thornburgh was dying to talk to
      him; but though his mobile, boyish temperament made it impossible for him to disguise his
      change of mood, there was in him a certain natural dignity which life greatly developed, but
      which made it always possible for him to hold his own against curiosity and indiscretion. Mrs.
      Thornburgh had to hold her peace. As for the vicar, he developed what were for him a
      surprising number of new topics of conversation, and in the late afternoon took Elsmere a run
      up the fells to the nearest fragment of the Roman road which runs, with such magnificent
      disregard of the humours of Mother Earth, over the very top of High Street towards Penrith and
      Carlisle.
Next day it looked as though after many waverings the characteristic Westmoreland weather
      had descended upon them in good earnest. From early morn till late evening the valley was
      wrapped in damp clouds or moving rain, which swept down from the west through the great basin
      of the hills, and rolled along the course of the river, wrapping trees and fells and houses in
      the same misty cheerless drizzle. Under the outward pall of rain, indeed, the valley was
      renewing its summer youth; the river was swelling with an impetuous music through all its
      dwindled channels; the crags flung out white waterfalls again, which the heat had almost dried
      away; and by noon the whole green hollow was vocal with the sounds of water—water flashing and
      foaming in the river, water leaping downwards from the rocks, water dripping steadily from the
      larches and sycamores and the slate-eaves of the houses.
Elsmere sat indoors reading up the history of the parish system of Surrey, or pretending to
      do so. He sat in a corner of the study, where he and the vicar protected each other against
      Mrs. Thornburgh. That good woman would open the door once and again in the morning, and put
      her head through in search of prey; but on being confronted with two studious men instead of
      one, each buried up to the ears in folios, she would give vent to an irritable cough and
      retire discomfited. In reality Elsmere was thinking of nothing in the world but what Catherine
      Leyburn might be doing that morning. Judging a North countrywoman by the pusillanimous
      Southern standard, he found himself glorying in the weather. She could not wander far from him
      to-day.
After the early dinner he escaped, just as the vicar's wife was devising an excuse on which
      to convey both him and herself to Burwood, and sallied forth with a mackintosh for a rush down
      the Whinborough road. It was still raining, but the clouds showed a momentary lightening, and
      a few gleams of watery sunshine brought out every now and then that sparkle
       on the trees, that iridescent beauty of distance and atmosphere which goes so far
      to make a sensitive spectator forget the petulant abundance of mountain rain. Elsmere passed
      Burwood with a thrill. Should he or should he not present himself? Let him push on a bit and
      think. So on he swung, measuring his tall frame against the gusts, spirits and masculine
      energy rising higher with every step. At last the passion of his mood had wrestled itself out
      with the weather, and he turned back once more determined to seek and find her, to face his
      fortunes like a man. The warm rain beating from the west struck on his uplifted face. He
      welcomed it as a friend. Rain and storm had opened to him the gates of a spiritual citadel.
      What could ever wholly close it against him any more? He felt so strong, so confident!
      Patience and courage!
Before him the great hollow of High Fell was just coming out from the white mists surging
      round it. A shaft of sunlight lay across its upper end, and he caught a marvellous apparition
      of a sunlit valley hung in air, a pale strip of blue above it, a white thread of stream
      wavering through it, and all around it and below it the rolling rain-clouds.
Suddenly between him and that enchanter's vision he saw a dark slim figure against the
      mists, walking before him along the road. It was Catherine—Catherine just emerged from a
      footpath across the fields, battling with wind and rain, and quite unconscious of any
      spectator. Oh, what a sudden thrill was that! what a leaping together of joy and dread, which
      sent the blood to his heart! Alone—they two alone again—in the wild Westmoreland mists, and
      half a mile at least of winding road between them and Burwood. He flew after her, dreading,
      and yet longing for the moment when he should meet her eyes. Fortune had suddenly given this
      hour into his hands; he felt it open upon him like that mystic valley in the clouds.
Catherine heard the hurrying steps behind her and turned. There was an evident start when
      she caught sight of her pursuer—a quick change of expression. She wore a close-fitting
      waterproof dress and cap. Her hair was lightly loosened, her cheek freshened by the storm. He
      came up with her; he took her hand, his eyes dancing with the joy he could not hide.
'What are you made of, I wonder!' he said gaily. 'Nothing, certainly, that minds
      weather.'
'No Westmoreland native thinks of staying at home for this,' she said with her quiet smile,
      moving on beside him as she spoke.
He looked down upon her with an indescribable mixture of feelings. No stiffness, no coldness
      in her manner—only the even gentleness which always marked her out from others. He felt as
      though yesterday were blotted out, and would not for worlds have recalled it to her or
      reproached her with it. Let it be as though they were but carrying on the scene of the
      stepping-stones.


'Look,' he said, pointing to the west; 'have you been watching that magical break in the
      clouds?'
Her eyes followed his to the delicate picture hung high among the moving mists.
'Ah,' she exclaimed, her face kindling, 'that is one of our loveliest effects, and one of
      the rarest. You are lucky to have seen it.'
'I am conceited enough,' he said joyously, 'to feel as if some enchanter were at work up
      there drawing pictures on the mists for my special benefit. How welcome the rain is! As I am
      afraid you have heard me say before, what new charm it gives to your valley!'
There was something in the buoyancy and force of his mood that seemed to make Catherine
      shrink into herself. She would not pursue the subject of Westmoreland. She asked with a little
      stiffness whether he had good news from Mrs. Elsmere.
'Oh, yes. As usual, she is doing everything for me,' he said, smiling. 'It is disgraceful
      that I should be idling here while she is struggling with carpenters and paperers, and
      puzzling out the decorations of the drawing-room. She writes to me in a fury about the word
      "artistic." She declares even the little upholsterer at Churton hurls it at her every other
      minute, and that if it weren't for me she would select everything as frankly, primevally
      hideous as she could find, just to spite him. As it is, he has so warped her judgment that she
      has left the sitting-room papers till I arrive. For the drawing-room she avows a passionate
      preference for one all cabbage-roses and no stalks; but she admits that it may be
      exasperation. She wants your sister, clearly, to advise her. By the way,' and his voice
      changed, 'the vicar told me last night that Miss Rose is going to Manchester for the winter to
      study. He heard it from Miss Agnes, I think. The news interested me greatly after our
      conversation.'
He looked at her with the most winning interrogative eyes. His whole manner implied that
      everything which touched and concerned her touched and concerned him; and, moreover, that she
      had given him in some sort a right to share her thoughts and difficulties. Catherine struggled
      with herself.
'I trust it may answer,' she said in a low voice.
But she would say no more, and he felt rebuffed. His buoyancy began to desert him.
'It must be a great trial to Mrs. Elsmere,' she said presently with an effort, once more
      steering away from herself and her concerns, 'this going back to her old home.'
'It is. My father's long struggle for life in that house is a very painful memory. I wished
      her to put it off till I could go with her, but she declared she would rather get over the
      first week or two by herself. How I should like you to know my mother, Miss Leyburn!'
At this she could not help meeting his glance and smile,
       and answering them, though with a kind of constraint most unlike her.
'I hope I may some day see Mrs. Elsmere,' she said.
'It is one of my strongest wishes,' he answered hurriedly, 'to bring you together.'
The words were simple enough; the tone was full of emotion. He was fast losing control of
      himself. She felt it through every nerve, and a sort of wild dread seized her of what he might
      say next. Oh, she must, she must prevent it!
'Your mother was with you most of your Oxford life, was she not?' she said, forcing herself
      to speak in her most everyday tones.
He controlled himself with a mighty effort.
'Since I became a Fellow. We have been alone in the world so long. We have never been able
      to do without each other.'
'Isn't it wonderful to you?' said Catherine, after a little electric pause—and her voice was
      steadier and clearer than it had been since the beginning of their conversation—'how little
      the majority of sons and daughters regard their parents when they come to grow up and want to
      live their own lives? The one thought seems to be to get rid of them, to throw off their
      claims, to cut them adrift, to escape them—decently, of course, and under many pretexts, but
      still to escape them. All the long years of devotion and self-sacrifice go for nothing.'
He looked at her quickly—a troubled, questioning look.
'It is so, often; but not, I think, where the parents have truly understood their problem.
      The real difficulty for father and mother is not childhood, but youth; how to get over that
      difficult time when the child passes into the man or woman, and a relation of governor and
      governed should become the purest and closest of friendships. You and I have been lucky.'
'Yes,' she said, looking straight before her, and still speaking with a distinctness which
      caught his ear painfully, 'and so are the greater debtors! There is no excuse, I think, for
      any child, least of all for the child who has had years of understanding love to look back
      upon, if it puts its own claim first; if it insists on satisfying itself, when there is age
      and weakness appealing to it on the other side, when it is still urgently needed to help those
      older, to shield those younger, than itself. Its business first of all is to pay its debt,
      whatever the cost.'
The voice was low, but it had the clear vibrating ring of steel. Robert's face had darkened
      visibly.
'But, surely,' he cried, goaded by a new stinging sense of revolt and pain—'surely the child
      may make a fatal mistake if it imagines that its own happiness counts for nothing in the
      parents' eyes. What parent but must suffer from the starving of the child's nature? What have
      mother and father been working for, after all, but the perfecting of the child's life? Their
      longing is that it should fulfil itself in all directions. New ties, new affections, on the
      child's part, mean the enriching of the
       parent. What a cruel fate for the elder generation, to make it the jailer and
      burden of the younger!'
He spoke with heat and anger, with a sense of dashing himself against an obstacle, and a
      dumb despairing certainty rising at the heart of him.
'Ah, that is what we are so ready to say,' she answered, her breath coming more quickly, and
      her eye meeting his with a kind of antagonism in it; 'but it is all sophistry. The only safety
      lies in following out the plain duty. The parent wants the child's help and care, the child is
      bound to give it; that is all it needs to know. If it forms new ties, it belongs to them, not
      to the old ones; the old ones must come to be forgotten and put aside.'
'So you would make all life a sacrifice to the past?' he cried, quivering under the blow she
      was dealing him.
'No, not all life,' she said, struggling hard to preserve her perfect calm of manner: he
      could not know that she was trembling from head to foot. 'There are many for whom it is easy
      and right to choose their own way; their happiness robs no one. There are others on whom a
      charge has been laid from their childhood, a charge perhaps'—and her voice faltered at
      last—'impressed on them by dying lips, which must govern, possess their lives; which it would
      be baseness, treason, to betray. We are not here only to be happy.'
And she turned to him deadly pale, the faintest, sweetest smile on her lip. He was for the
      moment incapable of speech. He began phrase after phrase, and broke them off. A whirlwind of
      feeling possessed him. The strangeness, the unworldliness of what she had done struck him
      singularly. He realised through every nerve that what she had just said to him she had been
      bracing herself to say to him ever since their last parting. And now he could not tell, or
      rather, blindly could not see, whether she suffered in the saying it. A passionate protest
      rose in him, not so much against her words as against her self-control. The man in him rose up
      against the woman's unlooked-for, unwelcome strength.
But as the hot words she had dared so much in her simplicity to avert from them both were
      bursting from him, they were checked by a sudden physical difficulty. A bit of road was under
      water. A little beck, swollen by the rain, had overflowed, and for a few yards' distance the
      water stood about eight inches deep from hedge to hedge. Robert had splashed through the flood
      half an hour before, but it had risen rapidly since then. He had to apply his mind to the
      practical task of finding a way to the other side.
'You must climb the bank,' he said, 'and get through into the field.'
She assented mutely. He went first, drew her up the bank, forced his way through the loosely
      growing hedge himself, and holding back some young hazel saplings and breaking others,
       made an opening for her through which she scrambled with bent head; then,
      stretching out his hand to her, he made her submit to be helped down the steep bank on the
      other side. Her straight young figure was just above him, her breath almost on his cheek.
'You talk of baseness and treason,' he began passionately, conscious of a hundred wild
      impulses, as perforce she leant her light weight upon his arm. 'Life is not so simple. It is
      so easy to sacrifice others with one's self, to slay all claims in honour of one, instead of
      knitting the new ones to the old. Is life to be allowed no natural expansion? Have you
      forgotten that, in refusing the new bond for the old bond's sake, the child may be simply
      wronging the parents, depriving them of another affection, another support, which ought to
      have been theirs?'
His tone was harsh, almost violent. It seemed to him that she grew suddenly white, and he
      grasped her more firmly still. She reached the level of the field, quickly withdrew her hand,
      and for a moment their eyes met, her pale face raised to his. It seemed an age, so much was
      said in that look. There was appeal on her side, passion on his. Plainly she implored him to
      say no more, to spare her and himself.
'In some cases,' she said, and her voice sounded strained and hoarse to both of them, 'one
      cannot risk the old bond. One dare not trust one's self—or circumstance. The responsibility is
      too great; one can but follow the beaten path, cling to the one thread. But don't let us talk
      of it any more. We must make for that gate, Mr. Elsmere. It will bring us out on the road
      again close by home.'
He was quelled. Speech suddenly became impossible to him. He was struck again with that
      sense of a will firmer and more tenacious than his own, which had visited him in a slight
      passing way on the first evening they ever met, and now filled him with a kind of despair. As
      they pushed silently along the edge of the dripping meadow, he noticed with a pang that the
      stepping-stones lay just below them. The gleam of sun had died away, the aërial valley in the
      clouds had vanished, and a fresh storm of rain brought back the colour to Catherine's cheek.
      On their left hand was the roaring of the river, on their right they could already hear the
      wind moaning and tearing through the trees which sheltered Burwood. The nature which an hour
      ago had seemed to him so full of stimulus and exhilaration had taken to itself a note of gloom
      and mourning; for he was at the age when Nature is the mere docile responsive mirror of the
      spirit, when all her forces and powers are made for us, and are only there to play chorus to
      our story.
They reached the little lane leading to the gate of Burwood. She paused at the foot of
      it.
'You will come in and see my mother, Mr. Elsmere?'
Her look expressed a yearning she could not crush. 'Your pardon, your friendship,' it cried,
      with the usual futility of all
       good women under the circumstances. But as he met it for one passionate instant, he
      recognised fully that there was not a trace of yielding in it. At the bottom of the softness
      there was the iron of resolution.
'No, no; not now,' he said involuntarily: and she never forgot the painful struggle of the
      face; 'good-bye.' He touched her hand without another word, and was gone.
She toiled up to the gate with difficulty, the gray rain-washed road, the wall, the trees,
      swimming before her eyes.
In the hall she came across Agnes, who caught hold of her with a start.
'My dear Cathie! you have been walking yourself to death. You look like a ghost. Come and
      have some tea at once.'
And she dragged her into the drawing-room. Catherine submitted with all her usual outward
      calm, faintly smiling at her sister's onslaught. But she would not let Agnes put her down on
      the sofa. She stood with her hand on the back of a chair.
'The weather is very close and exhausting,' she said, gently lifting her hand to her hat.
      But the hand dropped, and she sank heavily into the chair.
'Cathie, you are faint,' cried Agnes, running to her.
Catherine waved her away, and, with an effort of which none but she would have been capable,
      mastered the physical weakness.
'I have been a long way, dear,' she said, as though in apology, 'and there is no air. Yes, I
      will go upstairs and lie down a minute or two. Oh no, don't come, I will be down for tea
      directly.'
And refusing all help, she guided herself out of the room, her face the colour of the foam
      on the beck outside. Agnes stood dumfoundered. Never in her life before had she seen Catherine
      betray any such signs of physical exhaustion.
Suddenly Rose ran in, shut the door carefully behind her, and rushing up to Agnes put her
      hands on her shoulders.
'He has proposed to her, and she has said no!'
'He? What, Mr. Elsmere? How on earth can you know?'
'I saw them from upstairs come to the bottom of the lane. Then he rushed on, and I have just
      met her on the stairs. It's as plain as the nose on your face.'
Agnes sat down bewildered.
'It is hard on him,' she said at last.
'Yes, it is very hard on him!' cried Rose, pacing the room, her long thin arms
      clasped behind her, her eyes flashing, 'for she loves him!'
'Rose!'
'She does, my dear, she does,' cried the girl, frowning. 'I know it in a hundred ways.'
Agnes ruminated.
'And it's all because of us?' she said at last reflectively.


'Of course! I put it to you, Agnes'—and Rose stood still with a tragic air—'I put it to you,
      whether it isn't too bad that three unoffending women should have such a rôle as this assigned
      them against their will!'
The eloquence of eighteen was irresistible. Agnes buried her head in the sofa cushion, and
      shook with a kind of helpless laughter. Rose meanwhile stood in the window, her thin form
      drawn up to its full height, angry with Agnes, and enraged with all the world.
'It's absurd, it's insulting,' she exclaimed. 'I should imagine that you and I, Agnes, were
      old enough and sane enough to look after mamma, put out the stores, say our prayers, and
      prevent each other from running away with adventurers! I won't be always in leading-strings. I
      won't acknowledge that Catherine is bound to be an old maid to keep me in order. I hate it! It
      is sacrifice run mad.'
And Rose turned to her sister, the defiant head thrown back, a passion of manifold protest
      in the girlish looks.
'It is very easy, my dear, to be judge in one's own case,' replied Agnes calmly, recovering
      herself. 'Suppose you tell Catherine some of these home truths?'
Rose collapsed at once. She sat down despondently, and fell, head drooping, into a moody
      silence. Agnes watched her with a kind of triumph. When it came to the point, she knew
      perfectly well that there was not a will among them that could measure itself with any chance
      of success against that lofty but unwavering will of Catherine's. Rose was violent, and there
      was much reason in her violence. But as for her, she preferred not to dash her head against
      stone walls.
'Well, then, if you won't say them to Catherine, say them to mamma,' she suggested
      presently, but half ironically.
'Mamma is no good,' cried Rose angrily; 'why do you bring her in? Catherine would talk her
      round in ten minutes.'
Long after every one else in Burwood, even the chafing, excited Rose, was asleep, Catherine
      in her dimly lighted room, where the stormy north-west wind beat noisily against her window,
      was sitting in a low chair, her head leaning against her bed, her little well-worn Testament
      open on her knee. But she was not reading. Her eyes were shut; one hand hung down beside her,
      and tears were raining fast and silently over her cheeks. It was the stillest, most restrained
      weeping. She hardly knew why she wept, she only knew that there was something within her which
      must have its way. What did this inner smart and tumult mean, this rebellion of the self
      against the will which had never yet found its mastery fail it? It was as though from her
      childhood till now she had lived in a moral world whereof the aims, the dangers, the joys,
      were all she knew; and now the walls of this world were crumbling round her, and strange
      lights, strange voices, strange colours were breaking through. All the sayings of Christ which
      had lain
       closest to her heart for years, to-night for the first time seem to her no longer
      sayings of comfort or command, but sayings of fire and flame that burn their coercing way
      through life and thought. We recite so glibly, 'He that loseth his life shall save it;' and
      when we come to any of the common crises of experience which are the source and the sanction
      of the words, flesh and blood recoil. This girl amid her mountains had carried religion as far
      as religion can be carried before it meets life in the wrestle appointed it. The calm, simple
      outlines of things are blurring before her eyes; the great placid deeps of the soul are
      breaking up.
To the purest ascetic temper a struggle of this kind is hardly real. Catherine felt a bitter
      surprise at her own pain. Yesterday a sort of mystical exaltation upheld her. What had broken
      it down?
Simply a pair of reproachful eyes, a pale protesting face. What trifles compared to the
      awful necessities of an infinite obedience! And yet they haunt her, till her heart aches for
      misery, till she only yearns to be counselled, to be forgiven, to be at least understood.
'Why, why am I so weak?' she cried in utter abasement of soul, and knew not that in that
      weakness, or rather in the founts of character from which it sprang, lay the innermost
      safeguard of her life.
