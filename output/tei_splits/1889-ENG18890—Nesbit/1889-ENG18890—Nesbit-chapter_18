A MIXED ASSEMBLY
IT was Sunday afternoon. The rather festive look of Petrovitch's room, in which he now sat
     alone, was not, however, due to any desire to specialise the day. He had simply made his home
     as cheerful as possible because he was about to entertain guests.
His table was spread with a snowy cloth, and with the preparations for a tea of a distinctly
     convivial character. There was jam, and more than one kind of cake; and the room was further
     brightened by bunches of chrysanthemums. Chairs were drawn round the fire in an
     inviting-looking circle. The least cheerful object in the room was the owner of it, who sat in
     his usual chair between the fire and the writing-table. He looked pale and weary, for the
     frosty weather had strongly renewed the pain in a wound in his breast—an old wound, and a wound
     that had just missed being a deadly one. Contrary to his usual custom, he was neither reading
     nor writing. The pipe he had been smoking had gone out, and his thoughts were far back in the
     past, among the memories which had re-awakened with that aching in his breast. His thoughts
     went further back than the date of that wound,—went back to the days before he had lost
     friends, home, and country. He saw again in fancy the brilliant gaiety of the winters in St
     Petersburg, he heard again the exquisite music of the concerts  and the opera,—the
     balls where Majesty itself had deigned to be present, with anxious brow and uneasy, restless
     eyes. His memory dwelt longest on a certain torchlight fête on the Neva, when the ice
     had been a yard thick, and when the élite had been shut off from the common herd by
     walls made of blocks of solid ice, between which fir trees were planted; when coloured lamps
     and Chinese lanterns had thrown indescribable magic over the crowd of bright military uniforms
     and the exquisite toilettes of lovely women who had never in all their lives been troubled by
     any thought of what their dresses cost. And even at this distance he could not think without
     half a pang of a certain fair-faced girl, with golden hair, who, in her sapphire velvet and
     swansdown, had been the star of that fête to his boyish eyes. And she had been kind to
     him on this the last evening he had spent near her before his new faiths and duties had
     separated him from her for ever. That was the first loss his creed had cost him. He wondered
     what would be the last—life itself perhaps. Then he fell to thinking how these beliefs of his
     had grown up. How the reading of a certain book—an English book—had done for his mind what a
     successful operation for cataract does for one nearly blind—had shown him the facts of life, no
     longer half hidden in a mist of falsity, but in all their naked truth and ugliness. How for a
     time he had closed his eyes again and had tried hard to live on in the life of luxury, beauty,
     love, and (now he knew) selfishness which had been his by 'right of birth.' He remembered the
     night when, belated miles from his home, and overtaken by a snowstorm, he had sought refuge in
     a peasant's hut, how he had talked to his hosts, how one visit had led to many, and how what he
     had learned from these miserable serfs had forbidden him to forget or to set aside the teaching
     of the great author whose book had first set him thinking. He remembered that time, perhaps the
     happiest in his life, when he first began to  write—when the ideas which had so
     long been seething in his brain had found literary expression. He remembered the joy with which
     he had corrected his first proof, the pride with which he read his first article in a magazine.
     So thoroughly back in the old time was he that he had stretched out his hand towards this very
     magazine, which stood bound on a bookshelf, when a heavy foot sounded on the stairs, and a
     moment after a knock at the door heralded the entrance of Mr Toomey, whom Petrovitch came
     forward to greet with an almost courtly welcome.
'But your wife,' he said; 'can she not come? I trust all is well with her?'
'All's well with her, and thanking you for the question; but all's not well with that young
     woman o' yours.'
'Of mine? I do not happen to possess a young woman, my good Toomey.'
'I suppose you and me and my Mary Jane possesses about equal shares of her, then, for I saved
     her from keeping company with the dead cats and dogs, and you sent her to our place, and now my
     missus is let in for looking arter her.'
'Come to the fire. I hope it's nothing serious.'
'I don't rightly know. My missus told me I should be better out of the way, and I sent the
     doctor in as I came by.'
'I am very sorry,' said Petrovitch, 'but I am sure poor Mrs Litvinoff could not be in better
     hands than those of your good, kind wife.'
It was noticeable that he never spoke of Alice save as Mrs Litvinoff.
'You've a snug little place up here, sir,' said Toomey, looking round him. 'And do you
      really like reading—those sort of books, I mean,' pointing to Hegel's 'Logic,' which
     lay open on the table.
'I like doing better than reading, but one must read much to be able to do little in the line
     of work I am on at present.'

'Your line of work,' said Toomey, glancing admiringly at his host, 'is a thing as I never can
     get to understand. How it's done, I mean. Now, paving is straightforward. When you've got a
     paving-stone you know what it is you've got, and how far it'll go, but words is such shifty
     things, and how you manage to make 'em fit into each other so as to make 'em mean what you mean
     is what gets over me.'
'Perhaps I don't always make them mean what I mean. Judging by the way people misunderstand
     what I say—ah! here is Hirsch,' as the door opened, 'and Pewtress too. How are you? Now we're
     all here but Mr Vernon.'
'He's coming upstairs now,' said Pewtress, the stone-mason with the intellectual forehead,
     who had been at Mrs Quaid's at the last meeting of the Cleon.
Mr Hirsch seemed to be in more genial mood than he had been in any of those brief
     conversations which we hitherto had occasion to report. He had shaved himself—he even appeared
     to have combed his hair—and he shook hands with Toomey quite warmly and cordially.
The host had gone half-way down the stairs to meet his fourth guest—a lame boy, whose
     crutches made it not easy for him to mount to the height of Petrovitch's nest. He now returned
     with him on his arm—and after a general introduction of him to the others they all sat down to
     tea.
Eustace Vernon was a lad of about eighteen, with a pale, highbred-looking face—a rather shy
     but pleasant manner. He was an enthusiastic admirer of Petrovitch, and since his first
     acquaintance with the Socialist had made a point of being present at all the meetings on social
     subjects that he could get to hear of, and could find time to attend. For even the wild
     enthusiasm of the revolutionary in his teens will not go the length of working a Buddhist
     miracle and enabling the youthful devotee to be at more than one meeting at the same time.  Petrovitch was amused and a little touched by the lad's undisguised homage—and
     knowing himself to be responsible for the inflammation of the young man's mind, felt bound to
     keep watch lest he should get into trouble before his newly-kindled fire had had time to burn
     itself down into steadiness.
As the meal went on it was noticeable that Vernon's love of liberty was not inconsistent with
     a child-like devotion to strawberry jam.
Petrovitch might have kept a school of instruction for the benefit of those who are always
     making such desperate efforts to 'annihilate class distinctions'—efforts which usually take
     place on Saturday afternoons, and are mostly the dismallest of failures. Under his influence
     his four guests—born in different parts of the world, and drawn from different social
     grades—talked together with the ease of club acquaintances.
'I had hoped,' said Petrovitch by-and-by, 'to have had a lady here to pour tea out for you,
     but fate has been unpropitious; Mrs Toomey was not able to come.'
'I regret her,' said Hirsch. 'It always does me much pleasure to meet our good friend's good
     wife.'
Toomey looked flattered, but a little uncomfortable under this tribute.
'She would have liked to come,' said he, trying to look straight at the other, but only
     succeeding in fixing one eye on the Austrian, while the other searched the depths of the jam
     pot with an obstinacy which made Vernon, who had the same in hand, simmer with warm
     awkwardness. 'She would have liked to come, but the young woman as lodges with us—that Mrs
     Let-em-off—is ill, and the missus wouldn't leave her.'
'Ah, Mrs Litvinoff, it is you mean. I willed to ask you of her.'
'I beg your pardon,' said Vernon, glad to join in the  conversation, as a means
     of getting away from Toomey's eye. 'Is that any relation of Count Litvinoff? I know him.
     Splendid fellow, isn't he?'
'I don't think as she's a blessed countess,' said Toomey doubtfully, while Hirsch cast a
     significant glance of question at his host.
'Oh,' said Petrovitch, 'there are more Litvinoffs than one. It is not an uncommon name. I
     myself know more than one family of that name.'
'Of course you know the Count,' said Vernon, turning to him. 'What wonderful adventures he
     has had. He seems to be a man of splendid character. It must have cost him something to give up
     his social position and go in for the Revolution.'
'So far as I know Michael Litvinoff, he has never done more than his clear duty.'
'What does he do for the Revolution now?' growled Hirsch.
'Well, he does all that any one can do in England. There's not much else to be done besides
     talking.'
Vernon ended with a sigh, as of one who yearned for the barricades.
'Oh, yes; he'll talk,' said Hirsch discontentedly, and took a large bite of bread
     and butter.
'You are quite right, Mr Vernon,' said Petrovitch. 'He talks, and talks well; and, as you
     say, there is here no other means of helping the cause. And where you have such freedom of
     speech as in England a man's tongue is his best weapon, and ought, under existing
     circumstances, to be his only one.'
'The great reforms,' said Hirsch—'have they been carried by the tongue, or by the pike and
     the musket?'
'In this England enough has been carried by the tongue to leave good hopes for the future,'
     said Petrovitch.
'I am glad to hear you express those opinions,' said Pewtress,  who spoke with
     some deliberation, and chose his words carefully. 'I have noticed that most of the foreigners I
     have had the pleasure of meeting do not quite understand the condition of affairs here.'
'Do not misunderstand me,' said Petrovitch, rising from the table. 'I consider force to be
     the last refuge of the oppressed and the wretched—only to be tried when everything else has
     failed—but then perfectly legitimate.'
'Hear, hear,' cried Vernon enthusiastically, as they all rose; 'that's more like yourself,
     Petrovitch! And as for Count Litvinoff, I can't help admiring him, if it's only for what he's
     gone through.'
'For that,' said Hirsch, who seemed to have grown grumpier and grumpier ever since
     Litvinoff's name had been introduced, 'you, Petrovitch, have had adventures better to hear
     about than any of his. Did Mr Vernon ever hear how you escaped from Tieff?'
'If Mr Vernon has, I have not,' said Pewtress, as they gathered round the fire. 'If our kind
     host will tell us the story, I am sure we shall all follow it with a great deal of
     interest.'
'I am quite willing to tell you about that little affair, but I fancy I've told it once or
     twice before,' said Petrovitch, handing round a box of thick, short Russian cigarettes, to
     which his friends all helped themselves; 'and there is no greater bore than the man who will
     always be telling of his own deeds and adventures.'
'You, at any rate, never speak of yours,' said Vernon, fixing his large eyes on Petrovitch;
     'do tell us, please.'
'I assure you I was not refusing "pour me faire prier," and if we are all
     comfortable I will tell you with pleasure the little there is to tell. Toomey, you have no
     light.'
'All right, sir,' said Toomey, picking up a hot coal in his fingers and lighting his
     cigarette therefrom as his host began.

'During the year or so that I was in the fortress of Petro-Paolovski I never encouraged the
     slightest hopes of escape, for in the first place I, for a long time, suffered from a bad
     gunshot wound, and, secondly, because it is known only too well among us that escape from
     Petro-Paolovski is impossible. When, for some unknown reason, the Government sent me to Tieff,
     my health was improved, and so were my chances of getting away, and from the moment I entered
     the prison doors I never lost an opportunity of making and maturing a plan of escape. Escaping
     from a Russian prison is not quite such a desperate business for one of us as it would be for
     one of you, for you would be like a blind man in a strange house; but those of us who are
     judged to be the most likely subjects for arrest make it a rule to have the plan of every
     prison and fortress at our finger-tips.'
'What a marvellous organisation yours is,' said the stone-mason, more as an excuse for
     escaping a moment from the martyrdom of the unaccustomed cigarette than by way of saying
     anything original.
'Yes, the war is fairly well organised on both sides,' Petrovitch replied; 'but at present
     they have the big battalions.'
'But your plans,' struck in Vernon, impatient of the interruption.
'Yes. Well, my knowledge of Tieff told me that there was one way, and one way only, of
     leaving it, and that was by the way I had come in—by the front gate, and to get to the front
     gate one had to cross the courtyard, and between my cell and the courtyard lay obstacles too
     many to be calculated and dangers too great to be faced.'
'And you at once began to calculate them and to face them,' cried Vernon admiringly.
'Rather to elude them,' Petrovitch went on, ignoring the boy's compliment. 'As I could not
     meet them in detail I thought it better to surmount them in "the lump," as I think I have  heard you call it in England. Now the thing that had given me most hope when I heard
     I was coming to Tieff was that I happened to know that the resident doctor of the prison was,
     not exactly one of us, but one who sympathised with us secretly—there are many such, who are
     unwilling to take an active part in the struggle, but who, short of that, help us in many
     ways—for instance, with money, and especially by hiding those of us who happen to be "wanted."
     We call them the Ukrivatelli—the concealers.'
'I hope there's lots of them sort, sir,' said Toomey, surreptitiously abandoning his
     cigarette in favour of the more familiar but slightly stronger smelling 'cutty.' 'But don't
     they get theirselves into trouble?'
'Yes, if they are found out,' answered Petrovitch; 'but they seldom are. They are a very
     large class, and are often men whose official rank or social position places them beyond
     suspicion. My wound still needed attention, and I soon managed to convey to the doctor a
     suggestion that daily exercise in a prison courtyard was a first-rate specific for gunshot
     wounds. He seemed to think so too, and before the end of the week I was told that I should have
     to walk every day for an hour in the only place where a walk of a dozen consecutive yards was
     possible—in the courtyard.'
'It was no use getting into the courtyard unless I had some prospect of getting out of it,
     and straight into some perfectly safe refuge. This was a matter that took some weeks to
     arrange, and during that time I never turned my eyes to the gate. The doctor, though he was
     willing to help me, was not willing to risk his own safety by carrying too many letters, and a
     whole code of signals had to be arranged. Luck seldom favours the right side; but I think I was
     certainly lucky, for just when I began to take my daily exercise the right wing of the prison
     had to be repaired, and consequently the gates of  the courtyard were open all day
     for the carts of building materials, etc., which had to come in and out. This must have seemed
     tolerably safe to the authorities, as I was the only prisoner who "took exercise," and there
     were two sentries to whom was allotted the pleasing duty of watching me. They had a pretty easy
     time of it for these three weeks, for I used to crawl up and down the yard in a feeble and
     dejected sort of way, as though I had hardly the strength to put one foot before the other. I
     always leaned on a stick, and did my best to appear to be at my last gasp. I was well-nigh
     tired of waiting, so often my escape seemed almost close at hand, and then something happened,
     and all our plans had to be made over again. Innumerable ideas were suggested, but abandoned
     for one reason or another. At last it was definitely settled that at a certain signal I was to
     make for the gate and rush out—that a carriage was to be waiting just outside, and that one or
     two of our friends were to be there promiscuously, to give false information in judicious
     doses, as it might be called for. The gate was almost exactly in the middle of the courtyard,
     and the beat of sentry No. 1 was from the gate to the end of the yard and back, and that of
     sentry No. 2 from the other end of the yard to the gate and back—thus the face of one of them
     was always towards the gate. At length the day came when I might expect the signal—this was to
     be nothing more dramatic and startling than the smallest piece of paper that could well be
     seen—stuck on the shaft of one of the builder's carts. Cart after cart went by, my hour was
     nearly up, and I began to feel pretty sure that either the signal was not to be given that
     morning, or else that it had been given and I had missed seeing it. This last alternative was
     becoming a maddening certainty, when yet another cart came crawling in, and on the shaft,
     luckily on the side to which my walk had now brought me, was lightly stuck a little piece of
     white paper. Once more  luck was my friend, for the sentry on the same side of the
     gate as myself was marching from the gate, and between me and the one walking
      towards the gate was the cart. Had any one not in the secret been watching me from
     one of the prison windows at that moment he would certainly have thought that I was the subject
     of a miraculous cure, for in what seemed to me about half-a-dozen bounds I was at the side of
     the cart, out of the gate, and in one of two carriages which were passing at the time.'
'And what steps did the authorities take?' asked Pewtress, in the perfectly unexcited and
     matter-of-fact tone of a School Board inspector.
'Well,' said Petrovitch, laughing a little, 'I was not there at the time, but my friends told
     me that what followed was well worth seeing. A few seconds after my disappearance the two
     sentries and the whole of the guard from the guard-room inside the prison came swarming into
     the street, and there was a most delightful hue-and-cry and clamour. About a hundred yards away
     to the right a carriage was making off at a mad pace, and after this went the whole
      posse; with the lieutenant of the guard at their head. They must have been immensely
     relieved when they saw it pull up opposite the house of a well-known and irreproachable doctor.
     When, panting and exultant, they surrounded the carriage, they found inside it a surprised and
     indignant gentleman, who had driven in hot haste to fetch Dr. Seroff to his sick daughter, who
     had taken a turn for the worse.'
'And were you under the seat, Mr Peter Hitch?' inquired the interested Toomey.
'Not exactly. I had been driven off in the other carriage, which went at a quiet trot,
     eminently suited to my delicate state of health.'
'The gentleman who went for the doctor, I presume, was "one of you"?' put in Vernon.

'He was of the Ukrivatelli,' said Petrovitch, 'and I am afraid he had a bad time of it for a
     day or two. He was promptly taken where I had come from, and I fear the young lady's sick-room
     was invaded by a corporal's guard, but our friend and his family were so evidently innocent
     that the authorities had nothing left but to put up with their loss, and to grin and bear it,
     as you say.'
'But where did the other carriage take you?'
'Into the next street, to the most orthodox house in the town, the residence of a district
     judge, whence after spending a week I made for the frontier with passport quite in order, a
     clean chin, a strong French accent, and very black eyebrows. So ends the story, which I am
     afraid hasn't been a very exciting one.'
'The quite truth of it is its interest,' said Hirsch; 'to Count Litvinoff must you go for
     pure excitement.'
'You don't seem to like this Count Let-em-off, Mr Hearse,' said Toomey curiously; 'I thought
     he was a rare good 'un.'
'You're right, Toomey. He's done us good service.' This Petrovitch spoke with a certain
     emphasis, and with his eyes not on Toomey, but on Hirsch.
'I don't know whether it's indiscreet to ask,' said Vernon, 'but I wish you would tell us how
     it was you got arrested.'
'Ah! that's a long story,' returned Petrovitch, 'and one which, as it concerns others beside
     myself, I don't feel justified in telling.' Then as the boy coloured and looked embarrassed, he
     added kindly, 'There wasn't the slightest indiscretion in the question, and some other time,
     perhaps, I shall be able to answer it. But, since adventures are the order of the evening, you
     should get Hirsch to tell you some of his. He has had more than Othello.'
The Austrian was beginning to protest that nothing had  ever happened to him,
     when a rustle of silk on the stairs outside silenced him, and the men all looked at each other
     inquiringly in the moment that elapsed before the door was opened and disclosed the velvet
     bonnet and abundant flounces of Mrs Quaid. Mr Quaid was there, too, but he did not take the eye
     or captivate the attention. That was Mrs Quaid's department.
'My dear Mr Petrovitch, how can I apologise enough for our intrusion? The maid gave
     us no idea that you were entertaining. Ah! here's Mr Pewtress. How do you do? And Mr
     Vernon, too. How delightful! Why, we're all among friends. And you won't think me quite an old
     marplot if I stay for a few moments, for I really have something special to say to you.'
'It's very good of you to honour me with a call,' said Petrovitch, wondering intensely what
     had brought her there.
'We have been to see some friends at Regent's Park, and we are going on to dine with the
     Pagets—(you know the Pagets, Mr Petrovitch? No! Ah, I must introduce you; they are such sweet
     people, quite devoted to our side)—and so we thought we would call as we passed to ask
     you if you will come and dine with us on Tuesday. You'll excuse an informal invitation, I know.
     I thought if we came ourselves to ask you we should be more likely to succeed.'
'You are very kind,' said Petrovitch, wondering whether he could find any means of evading an
     acceptance.
'I had hoped to have had your fellow-countryman, Count Litvinoff, there to meet you;
     but I hear he has just gone to Derbyshire; so unfortunate. I suppose he has gone to stay with
     the Stanleys. He saved Mr Stanley's life, you know—Mr Stanley—perhaps you remember his
     daughter, the sweet girl who sat next you at our house.'
It appeared that Petrovitch did remember the lady in question.

The other men had formed a knot at the other side of the fire.
'You know,' said Mrs Quaid, lowering her voice discreetly, as she glanced at them, 'my
     daughter Cora thinks that there will be a match there before long. I do so hope that dear
     interesting Count has not lost all his property. From what I hear he is very well off.'
'Gentlemen of your opinions ought not to marry,' said Mr Quaid, striking in, much to his
     wife's surprise. He did not usually advance independent opinions, being emphatically 'Mrs
     Quaid's husband,' and nothing more.
'Why?' asked Petrovitch, amused.
'Because your lives are so constantly in danger.'
'There's not much danger in Derbyshire,' broke in Hirsch, in spite of Petrovitch's
     restraining eye.
'Ah, well,' said Mrs Quaid, 'I do hope, if anything does come of it, that he will
     settle down quietly in England. There is so much that wants doing here. We want good, brave
     workers to strive to bridge over the terrible gulf between the classes.'
Toomey, suddenly recalled to a sense of the 'gulf'—which he had quite lost sight of under the
     influence of Petrovitch's tact—felt a painfully renewed consciousness of his boots, his hands,
     and his Sunday clothes.
Vernon, who knew Mrs Quaid, and delighted to 'draw' her, would not for the world have missed
     such an opportunity of amusing himself and his friends. By a skilful question or two he led the
     lady on to her favourite subject—that of education. She could discuss this question with
     eloquence, and at any length; but no matter how her discussions began, they always ended by
     placing her and her hearers in a difficulty. She was quite clear that before we could educate
     our children we must be educated ourselves, which, on the face of it,  seemed
     reasonable; but, then, who was there to educate us? To that question no answer could ever be
     found; and in the meantime, what was to become of the rising generation? She had nearly reached
     this point when her husband, who had been present before when she trotted round this circle of
     argument, and for whom the repetition of the performance had no charms, brought the
     conversation back to the world of possibilities by renewing the invitation for Tuesday, which
     Petrovitch, after a little hesitation, accepted.
When the gros grain silk had swept down the uncarpeted stairs, and Petrovitch had accompanied
     it to the front door and received the last nod of farewell from the imposing plume in the
     velvet bonnet, he returned to his room, to find the spirits of his friends visibly higher,
     except those of Vernon, who felt that he had been done out of the cream of his proposed
     joke.
The evening slipped by pleasantly enough, but there were no more adventures told, nor was
     Count Litvinoff mentioned again, until one by one all the guests had departed except
     Hirsch.
He stayed on, smoking in silence, and his host, equally silent, sat on the opposite side of
     the fire, regarding it fixedly.
'Well,' said Hirsch, at last turning his eyes towards the other, 'what of this marriage that
     the large lady speaks of so confidently—this "sweet Clare" who is to be the Countess Litvinoff?
     That also is to be for the cause? With that also you are satisfied? That also is to be
     permitted, sanctioned, what you call approved?'
'No,' said Petrovitch slowly. 'No; that is not to be.'
