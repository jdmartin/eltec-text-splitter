ALL A MISTAKE
IT took Richard Ferrier just three months to decide what course his future life should take.
     He was too old for the Army or Civil Service. The Church was equally out of the question, for a
     reason equally potent. Need we say that his first idea had been to earn his living by
     literature? In these days of extended education and cheap stationery, it always is the very
     first idea of any one whose ordinary source of income is suddenly cut short. Richard had always
     felt at college that he had a decided faculty for writing; but an uninterrupted stream of
     returned MS., 'declined, with thanks' by all sorts and conditions of editors, convinced him in
     less than three months that, if writing indeed were his vocation, it was one that he must
     forego until he could pay for the publishing of his own works, which was not exactly the view
     he had in wishing to adopt it.
He had no interest in the law, and he knew well enough that he had not talent to enable him
     to dispense with interest. Besides, his leanings had never been that way. The medical
     profession inspired him with far more interest. His favourite study had always been biology. He
     had enough money to live on sparingly till the necessary four years should have expired, and it
     seemed to him better to adopt a profession than to go  in for trade in any form or
     shape. He had had enough of trade. He made a round of visits among special chums of his own,
     and during the time so occupied had thought long and seriously about his future, and, of all
     the ideas that came to him, that of being a doctor was the one with most attractions and fewest
     drawbacks. So early in March he entered himself as a student at Guy's, determined to throw
     himself heart and soul into his new career, and to let the dead past be. No return to the
     conditions of that past seemed possible to him, and, though he determined to think of it as
     little as he could, there were some things about it that haunted him disturbingly. But he
     hoped, among new friends and with new ambitions, to forget successfully. A man has his life to
     live, and life is not over at twenty-five, even when one has lost father, fortune, and heart's
     desire.
One windy, wild, bright March morning he was walking up to the hospital as usual from his
     lodgings in Kennington. He looked as cheerful as the morning itself as he strode along with an
     oak stick in his hand, and under his arm two or three shiny black note-books with red edges.
     Opposite St Thomas's Street he paused to watch for a favourable moment in which to effect a
     crossing; and before he had time to plunge into the chaos of vans, omnibuses, cabs, carriages,
     trucks, barrows and blasphemy, the touch of a hand on his arm made him turn sharply round. It
     was his foster-mother, with a basket on her arm, her attire several shades shabbier than he had
     been used to see it, and her worn face lighted up with pleasure at meeting him.
'Eh, but Ah'm glad to see thi face, my lad,' she said earnestly, as he turned and shook her
     hand heartily. 'I thowt as there was na more nor two pair o' shoulders like these, and I know'd
     it was thee or Rowley the minute Ah seed thee.'
The familiar North-country sing-song accent sent a momentary pain through the young man's
     heart as he answered,—

'I'm awfully glad to see you again; but what in the name of fortune are you doing here?'
'There's na fortune in't but bad fortune, lad,' she answered; 'tha know'd well enough when
     thee and Rowley fell out as Thornsett wouldn't be a home for any o' us for long.'
There was no reproach in her tone. Her speech was only a plain statement of fact.
'But what made you come to London?'
'T' master thowt as there'd be a big lot o' work to be gotten here, seeing as London be such
     a big place. Oh, but it is big, Master Dick. Ah'm getting a bit used to it now, but when first
     we came here the bigness and the din of it used to get into my head like, till times Ah felt
     a'most daft wi' it.'
By this time he had piloted her across, and they were walking side by side towards London
     Bridge, whither she told him she was bound.
'I'm afraid Hatfield found himself mistaken about the work; there are no mills in London,'
     said Richard.
'No, or if there be we never found them; but the master's had a bit o' luck, and he's getten
     took on at a place they call Dartford; m'appen you've heerd on it?'
'Well, I am glad to hear that. I hope all the hands have done as well.'
'No one's gladder nor me. Ah can't say for the lump o' the hands; but him, ever since he
     heerd as t' mill was to stop, he's not been t' say the same man as wor so fond of you and
     Rowley, and as used to go to chapel regular, and was allus the best o' husbands.'
'I hope he's not unkind to you?' said the young man anxiously.
'Nay; he's steady enow, and kind enow, but he's changed like. He willn't go to chapel no
     more, an' he says as he don't believe as our trouble's t' visitings o' a kind Providence.'

No more did Richard, but he forbore to say so; and she went on, the pent-up anxiety and
     sorrow of the last few weeks finding vent at last,—
'An' he's bitter set against Rowley. I wonder by hours and hours whether there's summat
     atween 'em as I don't know of. Sithee, Dick, if tha'll tell me one thing it'll do no harm nor
     no good to no one but me, and it'll set my mind at rest. Was there owt i' what folks set down
     i' Thornsett? Was it Rowley as stole our Alice?'
This point-blank question caught the young man right off his guard. His face gave the answer;
     his lips only stammered, 'How should I know? Besides, it can do no one any good now to know
     that.'
'Thi eyes is honester nor thi tongue,' Mrs Hatfield said, with a face full of trouble. 'Make
     thi tongue speak truth as well, lad, and tell me what tha knows. Tell me wheer shoo is.'
'If I had known you would have known too, long ago,' Richard answered.
'But tha hasn't told me a' tha knows e'en as 'tis.'
'I don't know anything,' Richard was beginning, when Mrs Hatfield clasped both her hands on
     his arm.
'Dick, Dick,' she said, 'tha's heerd o' her or tha's seen her. I've allus had a mother's
     heart for tha as well as for her, and now it's as if one o' my childer wouldn't help me to find
     t'other. What has tha heard? I see i' thi face 'twas Rowley. Eh, but I never thought the boy I
     nursed would ha' turned on them as loved him i' this fashion.'
The tears followed the words, which were not whispered, and the passers-by turned their heads
     wonderingly to look at the middle-aged countrywoman, with the basket, who was looking so
     earnestly and entreatingly into the face of the tall young medical student.
'Come in here,' he said, and led her into the waiting-room  of the London Bridge
     Station, which was fortunately empty. She sat down and began to cry bitterly, while Richard
     stood helplessly looking at her.
'Don't cry,' he said; but she took no notice, and went on moaning to herself.
'Couldn't tha ha' stopped it?' she said, suddenly raising her tear-stained face. 'Tha couldst
     surely ha' stood i' the way o' such a sinful, cruel thing as that.'
'Good God, no!' cried Dick, losing control of his tongue at the sudden implication of himself
     in these charges; 'what could I do? I knew nothing of it till last October, and then I did the
     best I could.'
'And tha found out for sure. Tell me a' abaat it.'
'I'm not sure enough to tell any one anything,' he answered: 'but I was sure enough to throw
     away all my chances, because I felt I couldn't have anything more to do with a fellow who'd do
     such a beastly mean thing as that.'
He had no idea that he was not speaking the truth. He had by this time really convinced
     himself that he had been prompted in his quarrel by the highest moral considerations, and had
     taught himself to forget how other motives and influences had been at work, and how he had been
     forced to acknowledge this at the time.
'How did tha find it out?' Mrs Hatfield persisted: and Richard in desperation told her the
     whole story. It seemed to her as convincing as it had done to him.
The mother asked him innumerable questions about Alice—how had she looked, how had she
     spoken? It grieved him not to be able to give her pleasanter answers, but, rather to his
     surprise, her mind seemed to dwell less with sorrow on Alice's want and hard work, than with
     pleasure on the thought that her daughter had given up her lover, or, as she called it,
     returned to the narrow path. But why had she not returned to her  mother? And that
     question Dick could not answer. All these questions and replies had taken some time, and the
     Dartford train had gone. Dick found out the time of the next train, and then came and sat down
     beside her, and did his best to cheer her, in which attempt his real affection for her assured
     him a measure of success. By the time the Dartford train was due she was calm again and
     reasonably cheerful. He led her to tell him of their life since they had come to London; how
     nearly everything had been turned into money; how the basket on her arm contained all that she
     had been able to keep; and how she was going down to join her husband, and to try to take root
     with him in a fresh soil. From her he heard for the first time of Count Litvinoff's visit to
     Thornsett, of the rioting of the mill hands, and, though she did not say so in so many words,
     he could see that she placed the two events in the relation of cause and effect. She told him,
     too, of Litvinoff's bravery, and of the fate of the luckless Isaac Potts; and Dick, though he
     couldn't help feeling interest and admiration at this recital, did not like the way in which
     Miss Stanley's name and Litvinoff's were coupled in Mrs Hatfield's account of the help, advice,
     and kindness shown to the hands before they dispersed from Thornsett. Her words suggested to
     him vague suspicions; but he couldn't think much just then, for it was time to take Mrs
     Hatfield's ticket and to see her off. This he did, and when he had seen her comfortably seated
     in a corner of a second-class carriage, he said good-bye to her, giving her at parting a very
     hearty hand-shake, and a sovereign, which he could ill afford.
'Good-bye, dear,' he said; 'you must write and tell me how you get on. Here's my address, and
     I hope with all my heart you will have good fortune.'
He drew back from the train as it began to move, and waved a farewell. She in turn waved her
     damp cotton handkerchief, and was borne out of sight.

As she disappeared Dick began to wonder what he should do with himself. The lecture he had
     been about to attend was hopelessly lost and there was nothing particular to be done till after
     lunch. Obedient to what would have been the instinct of most young men under such
     circumstances, his first thought was to take a ticket to Charing Cross, that being a more
     cheerful place for the consideration of any problem than the station where he found himself. In
     common with every other traveller on the South-Eastern Railway, he had long since arrived at
     the conclusion that London Bridge was the most unreasonably comfortless and altogether
     objectionable station in England—which is saying a good deal. He was just turning to go down to
     the booking office when—
'Great heavens, how wonderful!' he said. As he turned he found himself face to face with the
     girl whose mother had just left him. She was close to him, and had instinctively held out her
     hand, which he had clasped in greeting before he noticed that she was not alone. Her companion
     was evidently a gentleman. Her dress was much better than had been that of the girl for whom he
     had carried the brown-paper parcel five months ago. Richard noticed this with a pang of
     uneasiness as he said,—
'Why, Alice, I am very glad to see you; you're looking much better. Where are you off to?
     What are you doing?'
'Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, Mr Richard; I'm just going by this train to stay at Chislehurst with
     some friends of this gentleman's. Mr Petrovitch, Mr Ferrier.'
The men bowed—Petrovitch with easy courtesy, and Ferrier with a frigid reserve which would
     only allow him to raise his hat about an eighth of an inch—and as they did so the train steamed
     in.
'You must not miss this train,' said Petrovitch; 'there is not another for so long a
     time.'

'Good-bye, Mr Richard,' she said. 'When you see father or mother, tell them I'm well and
     happier, and have good friends.'
Ferrier had it on the tip of his tongue to tell her how he had just seen her mother, but
     Petrovitch, with an air of authority, cut short their farewells by hurrying her into the
     train.
'Good-bye,' said Richard, rather at a loss in this unexpected and bewilderingly brief
     meeting; 'couldn't you write to me? I'm at Guy's—Guy's Hospital, you know.'
'Stand back, sir,' said the guard, slamming the door with one hand and putting his whistle to
     his lips with the other, as the train gave a lurch and began to move off.
'Bon voyage, Mrs Litvinoff,' said Petrovitch, bringing a startled look and a vivid blush into
     Alice's face, and giving Richard the biggest surprise of his life. His blank astonishment was
     too evident for Petrovitch to ignore it. He looked at Richard inquiringly.
'Er—er, I beg your pardon,' stammered Ferrier, as soon as he could find words. 'You called
     that—a—lady Mrs Litvinoff?'
'I did, sir,' answered the other, with a rather angry flash of his deep-set eyes. 'I might
     have called her Countess Litvinoff, if you attach any importance to titles.'
'Good God!' said Richard, very slowly. He sat down on the wooden seat without another
     word.
'I wish you good-morning, sir,' said Petrovitch, making for the incline which leads off the
     platform.
Before he had made three paces young Ferrier had pulled himself together, and had overtaken
     him and laid a hand on his arm.
'Forgive me, sir—I am afraid you think me very strange and unmannerly—but I have a deeper
     interest in this matter than you can possibly imagine. I must beg you to allow me a few moments
     for explanation.'

'Certainly, sir; I shall be happy to walk your way,' answered the Russian, less stiffly.
No more was said till they got outside the station. It was not easy for Richard to know how
     to begin. He did not know how much this man knew of Alice, and he felt it would be unfair to
     tell her story, as far as he knew it, to one who seemed to know her only as a married woman.
     But, on the other hand, how much did he himself know of her story? He walked along beside
     Petrovitch for at least ten minutes before he could make up his mind how to begin. At length
     the other half-stopped and looked at him in a way that compelled speech of some kind.
'The reason I was so surprised when I heard you call that—lady Mrs Litvinoff, was that I have
     known her from a child, and did not know that she was married. I—I—also knew a Count Litvinoff
     in London a few months ago, and certainly did not know that he was married. The connection of
     the two names startled me. I must also tell you that it did more than startle me; it relieved
     me.'
'You are, then, very much interested in my friend?' said Petrovitch.
'Well,' said Richard, finding it desperately hard to break through his English reserve, and
     yet feeling that he could not in common fairness expect to get any information from one who
     called himself a 'friend' of Alice's without showing good reasons for asking for such
     information. 'Well, I am interested, very much interested, but not quite in the way that men
     generally are when they talk about being interested in a woman. Look here,' he said, stopping,
     and finding his powers of diplomacy absolutely failing him, falling back on the naked truth,
     'that young woman has been the cause—the innocent cause, mind—of a complete separation between
     my brother and myself. I thought my brother had done her a great  wrong. Can you
     tell me whether he did or not? His name is Roland Ferrier.'
'So far as I know Mrs Litvinoff's story,' said Petrovitch, speaking very deliberately, 'no
     wrong of any sort has ever been done her by any one of that name.'
'Ay, but,' said Richard, 'so far as you know; but do you know all? Do you know with whom she
     did go when she left her home?'
'I do.'
'It was not my brother?'
'It was not your brother.'
Richard had just said that he felt greatly relieved. If that statement was true, his looks
     certainly belied him.
'One question more,' he said. 'I want to know exactly how far wrong I have been. Do you know
     if my brother has had any communication at all with her since she left her home?—did he know
     where she was?'
'I believe that he has had no communication with her, and that he did not know where she
     was.'
'Can you tell me who this Litvinoff is, then? Is he the Count Michael Litvinoff that I know,
     or knew? If so, did he marry, and when did he marry her? and why did she leave him?—for she
      did leave some man; she told me so.'
'Ah,' said Petrovitch, 'you said one more question; that question I answered because I
     thought you were really concerned in knowing the answer. Forgive me, these other matters I
     think do not concern you.'
'Well,' Richard answered, 'I knew that girl when she was a baby, and I've always been fond of
     her, and I should naturally be glad to hear anything about her. I am glad to see her looking so
     much better, and better cared for than when I met her last.'
Petrovitch bent his head silently.

They had stopped by this time just opposite the Borough Market.
'I am sorry you will not tell me more about her; but since you have told me that my brother
     has not injured her in any way, I don't know that I have any right to ask you more. I must
     thank you for telling me what you have done, and ask you to excuse my seeming curiosity.'
Petrovitch bowed; young Ferrier did the same, and they parted—Petrovitch turned across the
     bridge, while Richard retraced his steps towards the station. He made his way to the telegraph
     office, and sent off this message:—'Richard Ferrier, Guy's Hospital, London, to Gates, The
     Hollies, Firth Vale.—Please wire me my brother's address at once if you know it.'
Then he crossed the station-yard, and ran down the steep stone steps which are part of the
     shortest cut to the hospital, and as he went he felt more wretched than he had ever been
     before. He had always believed in himself so intensely that an actual injury would have been
     less hard to bear than this sudden shattering of his faith in his own judgment. He had been so
     utterly mistaken—so wrong all round. Everything had seemed to point to his brother's guilt. Now
     everything seemed to have pointed to his innocence. If Richard's eyes had not been so blinded
     by—what? It was a moment for seeing things clearly, and Richard saw that his own passion and
     jealousy had perverted his view of all that had taken place in the autumn. That meeting in
     Spray's Buildings—of course it was the likeliest thing in the world that Roland really had seen
     Litvinoff, and at the thought of that sympathetic nobleman the young man ground his teeth. How
     completely he had been fooled! It must be the same Litvinoff—for had not Alice been present at
     his lecture in Soho? How had Alice met such a man? Oh, that might have happened in a  thousand ways. Had Litvinoff really married her? Richard thought he had not. He
     remembered Litvinoff's moustache, and felt sure that he had not. Felt sure? How could he feel
     sure of anything, when here, where he had been so absolutely certain, he was proved to have
     been wrong?
What fearful blunders he had made—what a horrible muddle he had got everything into—what
     irretrievable mischief he had done! But, though he blamed himself deeply and bitterly, he
     still, not unnaturally, blamed Litvinoff with still more bitter earnestness. One thing only was
     clear to him. He must find Roland at once, tell him all the circumstances, and beg his pardon.
     It would be all right again between him and his brother, towards whom he now felt a rush of
     reactionary affection. But how about the mill hands, now scattered far and wide beyond
     recall—beyond the reach of his help—through this same mad folly of his? In an impulse to do
     something for at least one of those who had suffered through him, he turned off from the
     hospital and took a hansom to his rooms, where he unlocked his desk, and, taking a five-pound
     note from his slender stock of money, enclosed it in an envelope, which he addressed to Mrs
     Hatfield at the address she had given him, in a hand not his own. He would do more for them
     when he and his brother had begun to work the mill again. That would be one big result of his
     new knowledge. His medical studies would be at an end, and he would be once more Ferrier of
     Thornsett. But that was poor compensation for all the rest.
When Mr Gates' answering telegram came it was a wet blanket on Richard's longing to make his
     confession and talk things over with Roland—for it ran thus:—'Robert Gates, The Hollies, Firth
     Vale, to Richard Ferrier, Guy's Hospital.—Don't know his address—he is expected here in a few
     days. Has left Chelsea, and is making visits on his way here. Glad you want him. Letter
     follows.'

So he could not see Roland that day, after all, and there was nothing for it but to possess
     his soul in patience until he heard again from Gates. So he spent the evening with some
     congenial acquaintances who had diggings in Trinity Square, and managed to get through the
     night without being driven to distraction by his remorseful self-tormenting thoughts. But the
     next morning he remembered, with a start, for the first time, that, not content with believing
     his brother to be guilty of a disgraceful action, he had accused him of it to Clare Stanley,
     and, worse than that, to Alice's own mother. He felt he could never face Clare again after
     that, come what might. But the Hatfields? At least it would be only fair to make what
     reparation he could by undeceiving them. He would go down to Dartford that very day, and tell
     them how mistaken he had been. He went by the same train which had carried Mrs Hatfield thither
     on the preceding day.
Arrived at Dartford the Dismal, Richard betook himself to the address that had been given
     him, which, after some difficulty, he found to be one of a row of small, ill-favoured, squalid
     cottages a little way out of the town. There were a good many children about, who stared at him
     with open-eyed curiosity, and did dreadful things to their mouths with their grimy little
     fingers in the excitement of seeing a gentleman stop at No. 5 Earl's Terrace. The battered,
     blistered green door had no knocker. The handle of Richard's umbrella afforded an impromptu
     one, and, in answer to the spirited solo which he proceeded to execute with it, the door was
     opened, and by his foster-mother herself.
She looked very pale and worried, and had evidently been crying. She didn't seem surprised to
     see him; she was in that state of mind when nothing seems worth being surprised about.
'Come in, lad,' she said. 'Ah got thi kind token. Ah  know'd 'twas thee as sent
     it, and m'appen Ah'll need it more nor tha thowt when tha sent it, for t' maister's giv' up his
     work an' gone off.'
She had set a chair for him, and as she finished this speech she sat down herself and looked
     hopelessly at him.
'Gone—gone! Left you! Why, he must be out of his mind.'
'His mind's right enough; it's his soul as Ah'm feared about, Dick. He's gone to have it out
     wi' Rowley, and get at the rights of it.'
'But where is Roland? Where's he gone to?'
'He's gone to Thornsett.'
'Why, Roland isn't there.'
'Thank God! God be praised, if it'll on'y please His good providence to keep 'em fra
     meetin'!'
'But how came he to go? How did it happen? Tell me all about it?'
It seemed that when her husband had met her at Dartford Station, she, pleased with having met
     Richard, had told him of the rencontre. That he had closely questioned her, and when at last he
     had learned every word that had passed between them, he had turned suddenly on her, and told
     her that this was the first time he had ever even thought of such a thing being possible as
     that Roland had been the cause of Alice's ruin, and that now he did know he would not lose a
     day in facing him with the accusation.
'Do you mean to say,' said Richard, 'that it's through me he thinks that Roland took her
     away?'
'I don't say it was thy fault, lad. I'm more to blame than thee. I should a-kept my
     clattering tongue quiet, and I should a-known my own man better after a' these years nor to
     think that if he had a-thowt it was Rowley he wouldna ha' faced him wi' it long sin'.'

'This is devilish pleasant!' said Richard, rising and taking a stride across the little room;
     but how did he go?'
It appeared he had started off with but a pound, or little more, in his pocket, intending to
     walk the greater part of the way, and only telling her that she wouldn't hear of him until she
     saw him back again.
'And what do you think will happen when they do meet?' he asked.
'Oh, Ah'm feared to think!' she said, wringing her hands and beginning to weep.
'I'll tell you what I'll do,' said Richard. 'I'll go straight down to Thornsett now, and keep
     a look-out for Hatfield. I'll stop any more mischief, any way. I think I can promise you that
     nothing much will happen if they do meet.'
She caught hold of his hand, and began to thank him.
'Oh, don't thank me!' he said; 'the whole sad business has been my fault from beginning to
     end. I found out yesterday, almost directly I left you, that Rowley was as innocent of doing
     any harm to Alice as I am, and I found out, too, that she is well and pretty happy, and, I
     heard, married. If it hadn't been for me, Hatfield wouldn't have gone off on this wild-goose
     chase. But I must get back now; my train goes in twenty minutes, and I want to catch the three
     o'clock train for Firth Vale.'
He caught the three o'clock train to Firth Vale, having managed, by a very hurried farewell,
     to escape the torrent of questions Mrs Hatfield would have liked to pour out. He felt that, all
     things considered, the less he said about the matter the better. He had been wrong too often,
     and too much.
