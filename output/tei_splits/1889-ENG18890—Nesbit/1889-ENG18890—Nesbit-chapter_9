AT SPRAY'S BUILDINGS.
IT seemed a very long walk home to Alice Hatfield, after that Sunday evening lecture. She
     felt almost as though she could never reach her lodging. It was such weary work to keep putting
     one tired foot before the other. And somehow she was so much more easily tired now than she
     used to be in her Derbyshire home, where she had been used to breast the steepest hills without
     even a quickened breath. She wished she had not gone; she had derived no pleasure from the
     evening, and had only gained a sharper heartache from the sight of a certain face, which had
     been, and was still for that matter, the dearest face in the world to her. She felt re-awakened
     too in her a liking for a different life among different surroundings; the life she had given
     up of her own free will three months ago. She had been much alone in that other life, it is
     true, and her thoughts had not made solitude sweet; but she had seen him sometimes,
     and now she was quite alone—always—save for the few slight acquaintances she had made in the
     house where she lived. In that other life, which now looked brighter than it had ever done when
     it was hers, she had been racked and tortured by her conscience, which had at last forced her
     to try and silence it by renouncing  what she had sacrificed everything to gain,
     and by voluntarily adopting this strange, hard way of living. But now that that gloomy monitor
     was on her side, it failed to give that comfort and support which one is taught to expect from
     it.
'Be virtuous and you will be happy,' say the copy-books. A somewhat higher authority
     (Professor Huxley) thinks otherwise. 'Virtue is undoubtedly beneficent,' he says, 'but the man
     is to be envied to whom her ways seem in any wise playful; and though she may not talk much
     about suffering and self-denial, her silence on that topic may be accounted for on the
     principle ça va sans dire. She is an awful goddess, whose ministers are the furies,
     and whose highest reward is peace.'
Alice Hatfield hadn't read Huxley, but if she had she would have agreed with him in this; and
     now it seemed as though the furies were driving her along the streets towards that miserable
     home of hers, where, so far, no dove of peace had folded its wings.
It is given to all of us, at one time or another, to repent—more or less—of the evil; but
     many of us also know what it is to look back, with something like remorse, on what we believe
     to have been the good. And good and evil, get so mixed up sometimes, when we have often heard
     the world's 'right' skilfully controverted and made to seem wrong, by the tongue whose
     eloquence once made wrong seem to us right.
Alice had to collect all her energies to enable her to climb the steep dark stairs which led
     to her room, and when she had gained it at last, and had lighted her little benzoline lamp, she
     sank down on her chair bedstead, exhausted and breathless. What a hateful room it was; how
     cold, and cheerless, and wretched. The few poor articles of furniture did not relieve its
     bareness in the least. There was no fire, of course, and her little lamp quite failed to light
     up the dark corners. There  must be something wrong with that lamp—it was going out
     surely—the room was growing so dark; or was it her eyes from which the power of seeing was
     going? The room seemed to swim before her sight, and a feeling of deadly faintness came over
     her, a horrible sensation of going through the floor. She staggered to her feet and drank some
     water, which gave her strength to go unsteadily down to the floor below, and to knock at the
     landlady's door.
'Oh, I am so ill—so ill! I think I'm dying,' she said, holding out both hands as the woman
     appeared; 'help me.'
Then she knew no more. Her troubles, her tiredness, her regrets, her very self, all were
     swallowed up in the horror of great darkness that overwhelmed her.
'Here's a nice set out,' grumbled Mrs Fludger, as her lodger fell at her feet; 'as if one
     hadn't enough troubles o' one's own—what with Jenny being out o' work, and the master on the
     booze since Friday. Jenny!'
'Here I am.'
Miss Jenny Fludger, a muscular young woman, with her hair in a long beaded net, responded to
     the call, and lent her help in carrying Alice back to her room. Then the unsympathetic hands of
     the two women undressed the girl and laid her in her bed. Then they looked meaningly at each
     other.
'If she don't soon come round I'll send Joe for the doctor,' said the mother. 'You never
     knows what may happen.'
Then Mrs Fludger dashed cold water in the patient's face, slapped her hands with a vigour
     that would have brought tears to her eyes had she been conscious, and made a horrible smell
     with the benzoline lamp and a pigeon's feather hastily begged from a lodger who had leanings
     ornithological. Alice showing no signs of being affected by the application of these generally
     efficacious remedies, Mrs Fludger decided that this was a case of 'going off' quite beyond her
     experience, and  feeling the responsibility too much to be borne alone, she
     despatched her third son in quest of a doctor, regardless of Miss Jenny's opinion that the
     lodger was 'shamming.' Joe Fludger was not particularly pleased at being sent. He was busy just
     then shaking up a mangy kitten and a recently-acquired guinea-pig in a box, with a view of
     getting them to fight, which they showed no signs of doing, and he did not care to relinquish
     this enthralling pastime until he had compassed his end. He put his two 'pets' into one pocket,
     hoping that that position would urge them to fulfil their destiny and have it out, and as he
     met several friends, and felt it incumbent on him to exhibit his treasures to each of them, it
     was some time before he carried out his instructions, and brought medical science, as
     represented by Dr Moore, to 15 Spray's Buildings. But even when the doctor did at last stand by
     her bedside, Alice was still insensible.
He raised her eyelids, felt her pulse, asked one or two brief questions, and then stood
     holding her hand till she sighed, and moved slightly.
'She's coming round,' he said. 'Not married, I see,' he added, glancing at the hand he held,
     on which shone no golden circle, not even the brass substitute which takes its place
     occasionally, when times are very hard.
'Not as I ever heard of,' said Miss Jenny with a toss of the net, which drew down upon her a
     glance of disapproval from the old doctor, and a sharp recommendation from her mother to go
     downstairs. 'Give the girl air; there's too many of us here a'ready.'
Miss Fludger withdrew with a gesture expressive of a sovereign contempt for faints in
     general, and this collapse in particular.
'How does this poor thing get her living?' asked the doctor; 'she looks as if she got it
     honestly.' He, being an observant man, glanced as he spoke at the roughened forefinger of her
     left hand, and then round the bare, dreary attic.

'Lord! doctor, how should I know? Do you think I puts all my lodgers through their cataclysm
     before I takes 'em in?' said Mrs Fludger, with some general recollection of the days when she
     went to Sunday school. Mrs Fludger did not always manage to hit on the right word to express
     the meaning she intended to convey, but she always found a word something like the right one,
     and a word which really had a place in the English dictionary; she had a rare dexterity in the
     finding of such words, and a fine confidence in the use of them, which made them answer her
     purpose admirably.
'You're better now, aren't you?' said the doctor, as Alice opened her eyes. 'Here's a
     shilling, ma'am: can you send for some brandy?'
Mrs Fludger would go herself. Such an admirable opportunity for having 'two penn'orth' at the
     'Hope' was not to be let slip.
'Don't be frightened,' he said, as the landlady left the room. 'It's only the doctor. You've
     been overdoing it—working too hard, and eating too little.'
'But I never felt like that before,' said Alice slowly and faintly. 'I thought I was going to
     die.'
'Haven't you anyone belonging to you? You ought to be with friends just now.'
'No. I'm quite alone, quite alone. Why just now?'
'My dear child, don't you know why?'
She did not answer, but looked at him with large, frightened, questioning eyes; and before
     Mrs Fludger returned with a shrunken shilling's-worth in a ginger-beer bottle, Alice had
     learned that that which she had feared, till a sort of hope had grown out of the very intensity
     of her fear—that which had seemed almost too terrible to be possible—was to be. She now had
     that certainty which is a spring of secret happiness to so many women, to some only a fresh
     care and anxiety,  and to some, alas! the sign and token of social banishment—the
     warrant of disgrace and despair.
Doctor Moore spoke kindly, and with no note of censure in his voice. He had a naturally
     tender heart, and long years of practice in a poor neighbourhood had developed his sympathies,
     instead of blunting them, as, unfortunately, happens in too many cases. He was an old man now,
     and this was an old story to him; but his eyes were still sharp enough to see that the girl
     before him did not belong to that class of patients to whom such an announcement would have
     meant little more than a temporary inconvenience and a trifling subsequent expense. He thought
     to himself that he would look in in the morning and see the girl again. There had been a look
     in her eyes as she listened to him that made him feel that she wanted looking after.
'Give her some hot brandy-and-water, and let her go to sleep—that's the best thing for her,'
     he said to Mrs Fludger as he came away. The landlady accompanied him downstairs in a halo of
     apology for having 'such like' in her house, and when she had lighted him out she climbed once
     more, protesting, to the attic, and having administered the brandy as prescribed, came away,
     after bidding the girl 'good-night' not unkindly.
But, all the same, she made up her mind that Alice must go. If the girl had come there as
     'Mrs' Anybody—and worn a ring, no questions would have been asked by Mrs Fludger. There would
     then have been the alternative of supposing that the Mr in the case was in the seafaring way,
     or was enjoying a holiday upon the breezy slopes of Dartmoor. But as she had chosen to neglect
     the payment of that slight tribute to the proprieties which even this neighbourhood demanded,
     there was no help for it—she must go. Besides, there might be difficulties about rent, and even
     a want of money for the necessaries of  life—and Mrs Fludger was afraid to trust
     her tender heart. Even forty years of being pinched and 'druv' had not quite dried up the milk
     of human kindness in her bosom, and she felt that she would rather not have a lodger who would
     excite her sympathy and possibly make demands upon her pocket. This habit of 'not trusting our
     tender hearts' is not confined to the class to which Mrs Fludger belonged. Others who have
     larger means of meeting probable drafts on their 'tenderness' have also a way of pushing misery
     out of sight, or handing it over to the emollient remedies of a Royal Commission, which, of
     course, goes thoroughly into the matter. Does it? The Royal Commissioners do not find their
     shoulders any easier under the burden we have shifted on to them than we found ours, and not
     being able to shift the weight again, they skilfully dissolve it, and give it us back in the
     solution of a wordy report. And for Mrs Fludger, who had to look sharp after every halfpenny,
     and who knew no higher morality than that taught in the precept, 'Take care of number one,'
     which to her meant the number nine, of whom Miss Jenny was the eldest, there was more excuse
     than there is for the theoretical philanthropists who wear purple and fine linen, and fare
     sumptuously every day.
But the landlady was not required to make the announcement which she had proposed to herself,
     for when she went up to Alice's room the next morning, to say that she wished to have a few
     words with her (and when people say that, you may be sure the words are not going to be
     pleasant ones), she found the girl already dressed—with her little belongings arranged as for
     an immediate departure. So she changed her mind, and instead of that speech about the few
     words, she said simply,—
'Good morning. You're better, I see.'
'Yes, thanks,' said Alice, hurriedly; 'and I think I would like to leave this morning—and
     here is a week's money from last Saturday.'

Mrs Fludger rubbed her hands together in a little embarrassment.
'I don't say but you're in the right to go, and I hope you'll get on all right, and not let
     your trouble play upon your mind too much; but as for the money, never mind. It's only a couple
     of days, and I don't grudge that. An' if you'll take my advice you'll go home to your own folk,
     if you've got any. God-a'mighty knows it's hard lions with most of us.'
Which Alice, listening sadly, interpreted to mean 'hard lines.'
And so it happened that her worldly goods were taken away on a hand-barrow, she herself
     walking beside it—whither Mrs Fludger was careful not to inquire; and Dr Moore, coming at noon,
     received the comforting intelligence that the girl had gone home to her people; for Mrs
     Fludger, like so many others, thought that her advice once given could not fail to be
     taken.
