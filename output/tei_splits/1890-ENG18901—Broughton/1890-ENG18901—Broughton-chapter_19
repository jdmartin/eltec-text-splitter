CHAPTER XIX.
Camille.—"Que me conseilleriez-vous de faire le jour où je verrais que vous
       ne m'aimez plus?"
There is no greater fiction than that for time to go quickly implies that it must needs go
      pleasantly. Jim has seldom spent a more disagreeable period than the hours which follow his
      conversation with Byng, and which he passes in his own bedroom, with his elbows on the
      window-ledge, looking blankly out at the Piazza, and at the great "Bride" of Arnolpho's
      planning, the church of Santa Maria Novella. And yet, when the city clocks, which have chimed
      unnoticed by him several times, at length convey to his inattentive ear what the hour is, he
      starts up, shocked and confused at its lateness. He had meant to have reached the Villa
      Schiavone in time to receive Amelia, and now she must have long preceded him, and be
      attributing his tardiness to some fresh neglect and indifference. In five minutes he has
      rearranged his dress, and jumped into a fiacre. Through the Porta Romana, and up between the
      straight row of still and inky cypresses, up and up to where the villa door, promising so
      little and performing so much, opens as so many do, straight upon the road.
The day has changed its ravishing blue gaiety for a pensive cloudy gloom, and the guests at
      the villa are walking about without any sunshades. They are numerous, though few indeed in
      comparison of the Banksia roses on the laden wall, over which, too, a great wistaria—put in,
      as the host with a just pride relates, only last year—is hanging and flinging its lilac
      abundance. And seen above its clusters, and above the wall, what a view from this raised
      terrace! Jim is really in a hurry to find Amelia, and yet he cannot choose but stop to look at
      it—from Galileo's tower on the right, to where, far down the plain of the Arno, Carrara loses
      itself in mist. It is all dark at first, sullen, purple-gray, without variation or stir—city,
      Duomo, Arno, Fiesole, and all her chain of sister-hills—one universal frown over every slope
      and jag, over street and spire, over Campanile with its marbles, and Santa Croce with its
      dead. But now, as it draws on towards sun-setting, in the western sky there comes a beginning
      of light, a faint pale tint at first, but quickly broadening across the firmament, while the
      whole huge cloud canopy is drawn aside like a curtain, and, as a great bright eye from under
      bent brows, the lowering sun sends arrows of radiance over plain, and river, and city. All of
      a sudden there is a vertical rain of dazzling white rays on the plain, and the olive shadows,
      merged all the afternoon in the universal gray, fall long and soft upon the blinding green of
      the young corn. He has forgotten Amelia. Oh, that that other, that creature herself made out
      of sun-rays and sweet rain-drops, were beside him, her pulses beating, as they so surely
      would, to his tune, her whole tender being quivering with delicate joy at this heavenly
      spectacle.
Someone touches him on the shoulder, and he starts violently. Has the intensity of his
      invocation called her spirit out of her light body, and is she indeed beside him?
"What a bad conscience you must have! Did you think that I was a bailiff?" cries Mrs. Byng,
      laughing.
"Where is Amelia?" he asks, rather curtly, the memory of Byng's communication about his
      mother being too fresh in his mind to make it possible for him to answer her in her own
      rallying key. "What have you done with Amelia?"
"What a 'Stand-and-deliver' tone!" says she, laughing still, but looking not unnaturally
      surprised. "Well, where is she?" glancing round. "She was here five minutes ago with Willy.
      Poor Amelia!" lowering her voice to a more confidential key. "I am so glad you have come at
      last; she is patience personified. I must congratulate you upon the excellent training into
      which you have got her, but I think that she was beginning to look a little anxious."
"And I think that you have been giving the reins to your imagination, as usual,"
      replies he, walking off in a huff.
There is another delightful garden at the back of the villa, and there, having failed to
      find her in the first, he now with growing irritation at her for not being more immediately
      conspicuous, seeks Amelia. It is a sheltered leisurely paradise, where white rose-trees, with
      millions of bursting buds, are careering over the walls in leafy luxuriance, where double
      wallflowers—bloody warriors, one should call them, if one could connect any warlike idea with
      this Eden of scented peace—stocks in fragrant row are flowering as we Britons never see them
      flower in our chary isle, save in the plates of a Gardeners' Chronicle. But among them he
      finds no trace of his homely English blossom. He finds, indeed, him who had been named as her
      late companion, Byng; but it is not with Amelia, but with one of the pretty young daughters of
      the house that he is pacing the straight walk in lively dialogue. Jim accosts him
      formally:
"I understood that Miss Wilson was with you? Do you happen to know where she is?"
Byng stops short in his leisurely pacing.
"Why, where is she?" he says, looking round, as his mother had done, but with a more guilty
      air. "She was here five minutes ago. Where can she have disappeared to?"
It is but too obvious that in greeting and being greeted by their numerous acquaintances,
      both poor Amelia's chaperon and that chaperon's son have completely forgotten her existence.
      Always nervously afraid of being burdensome, Jim feels convinced from what he knows of her
      character that she is going about in unobtrusive forlornness, the extreme smallness of her
      Florentine acquaintances making it unlikely that she has found anyone to supply the place of
      the friends who have become so entirely oblivious of her. The conviction, pricking his
      conscience as he hastens contritely away from the vainly-repentant Byng, lends speed and
      keenness to his search. But thorough and earnest as it is, it is for some time quite
      unsuccessful. She makes one of no group, she loiters under no Banksia rose-bower, she is no
      gazer from the terrace at gold-misted valley or aureoled town, she is to be found neither in
      hidden nook, nor evident path. She is not beneath the loggia, she is nowhere out-of-doors. She
      must then, in her loneliness, have taken refuge in the house. He finds himself in a long,
      noble room, with a frescoed ceiling, a room full of signs of recent habitation and recent tea,
      but which has apparently been deserted for the sunset splendours on the terrace. He can see no
      single occupant. He walks slowly down it to assure himself of the fact of its entire
      emptiness.
By a singular and unaccountable freak of the builders, the windows are set so high in the
      wall that each has had to have a little raised daïs erected before it to enable the inmates to
      look comfortably out. Upon each small platform stands a chair or two, and low over them the
      curtains sweep. As he passes one recess, he notices that the drapery is stirring a little, and
      examining more closely, sees the tail of a well-known gown—of that gown which has met with his
      nearest approach to approval among Amelia's rather scanty stock—peeping from beneath the stiff
      rich folds of the old Italian brocade. It is the work of a second to sweep the latter aside,
      and discover his poor fiancée all alone, and crouching desolately in a low arm-chair.
      There is something so unlike her in the attitude, something so different from her usual
      uncomplaining, unpretending fortitude, something so disproportioned to the cause—his own
      careless but not criminal delay, as he supposes—in the despair evidenced by her whole pose,
      that he feels at once terrified and angry. In a second he, too, has stepped up on to the
      little platform beside her.
"Amelia!" he cries. "Amelia! What are you doing up here? With whom are you playing
      hide-and-seek?"
Her words and her smiles are apt to be prompt enough, Heaven knows, to spring out, answering
      his least hint; but now she neither speaks nor moves a muscle of her face. She scarcely starts
      at all at his sudden apparition and address, and no light comes across her features—those
      features which, now that he looks at them more closely, he sees to be set in a much more
      pinched pallor than even three watching nights and a week of airless worry can account
      for.
"Are you ill?"
"No; I am not ill."
The sting of irritation which, mixed with genuine alarm, had besieged Jim's mind on his
      first realizing her crouched and unnatural attitude, now entirely supersedes any other
      feeling. Is the accidental delay of half an hour, an hour, say even an hour and a half, enough
      to justify such a parade of anguish as this?
"Is it possible," he inquires, in a tone of cold displeasure, "that I am to attribute
      this—this state of things—to my being accidentally late? It was a mere accident: it is not
      like you to make a scene. I do not recognise you; I am very sorry that I was late, and that I
      have made you angry."
The chill reproach of his words seems to rouse her to a state more akin to her natural one,
      to the humble and unexacting one which is habitual to her.
"Angry!" she repeats: "angry with you for being late? Oh, you are quite mistaken! In all
      these years how often have I been angry with you?"
There is such a meek upbraiding in her tone that his ill-humour gives way to a vague
      apprehension.
"Then what is it?" he cries brusquely; "what is it all about? I think I have a right to ask
      you that; since I saw you last something must have happened to you to produce this
      extraordinary change."
She heaves a long dragging sigh.
"Something has happened to me; yes, something has happened!"
"But what—what kind of a something? I have a right to know—I insist upon knowing; tell
      me!"
He has grasped both her hands, whose unnatural coldness he feels even through her rather
      ill-fitting gloves. So strange and mean a thing is human nature that even at this moment it
      flashes across him, with a sense of annoyance, what bad gloves Amelia always wears. However,
      he is not troubled with them long, for she takes them and her cold hands quietly back.
"I will tell you, there is no question of insisting. I should have told you anyhow; but not
       here"—glancing nervously round the dropped curtains—"not now!"
"Why not here? Why not now?"
Her face quivers.
"I could not," she says piteously. "I do not quite know how I shall get through telling it;
      it must be somewhere—somewhere where it will not matter if I do break down!"
He stares at her in an unfeigned bewilderment, again slightly streaked with wrath.
"Have you gone mad, Amelia? or are you taking a leaf out of Sybilla's book? If you do not
      clear up this extraordinary mystification at once, I shall be compelled to believe either the
      one or the other."
Again her face contracts with pain.
"Oh, if it were only a mystification!" she says, with a low cry. "I cannot tell you here; it
      is physically impossible to me. But do not be afraid"—with an accent of bitterness, which he
      is quite at a loss to account for—"you shall not have long to wait; I will tell you, without
      fail, to-morrow; to-morrow morning, if you like. Come as early as you please, I shall be ready
      to tell you; and now would you mind leaving me? I want to have a few moments to myself before
      I see anybody—before I see Mrs. Byng; will you please leave me?"
It is so apparent that she is in deadly earnest, and resolute to have her request complied
      with, that he can do nothing but step dizzily down off the little daïs, feeling as if the
      world were turning round with him.
A quarter of an hour later he sees her leaving the party with Mrs. Byng, looking as simple,
      as collected, and not very perceptibly paler than usual.
