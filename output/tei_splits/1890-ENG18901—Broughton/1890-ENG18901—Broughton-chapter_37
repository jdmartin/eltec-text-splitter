CHAPTER VII.
The latest waking impression left on Jim's fancy is that it is the golden rule of Elizabeth
      Le Marchant's life to comply with any and every request that is made to her; moreover, that in
      her mind the boundary-line which parts the permitted from the unpermitted is not so clearly
      defined as, did she belong to him (the naked hypothesis makes his strait-laced heart give a
      jump), he should wish it to be. If on the morrow, with the sun shining and the leaf-shadows
      dancing on the fretted balcony-wall, he invite her to some fresh junket, he is sure that she
      will readily and joyfully acquiesce; that her spirits will go up like rockets at the prospect;
      and that her one anxiety will be that she may be sure to hit in her choice upon the form of
      dissipation most congenial to him. He will therefore not invite her. He will have a greater
      care for her reputation than apparently she has for it herself. Not until the return of her
      parents, not until the difficulties of intercourse with her are centupled, and the pleasure
      minimized, will he again seek her.
To put himself beyond the reach of temptation, he sets off immediately after breakfast on a
      long walking expedition, which he means to occupy the whole of the daylight hours. He wanders
      about the great plain of the Metidje; he visits a Kabyle village, with its hovels cowering
      among its hideous fat-fleshed cactus; later on in the afternoon he finds himself in the little
      French hamlet of Biermandreis, and finally drops down upon the Jardin d'Essai, that delightful
      botanic garden which is one of the many blessings for which Algerian France has to thank the
      much-vilipended Napoleon III.
It is difficult for even the reddest Republican to think hardly of that dead ruler as he
      walks down the avenue of gigantic palms that lead, straight as a die, to where, like a deep
      blue gem far away, the Mediterranean shows

"No bigger than an agate stone
On the forefinger of an alderman."

Jim walks along beneath the huge date-palms that give him a crick in the neck to gape up at
      ere he can perceive their towering head of waving plumes far up against the blue. They remind
      him absurdly of the pictures in the missionary books of his youth—the palm-tree, the log
      cabin, the blackamoors, and the missionary in a palm hat. Is he the missionary, and
      is this inky negress in a black bonnet, scarcely distinguishable from her face, his one
      catechumen?
Alternating with the date are superb fan-palms, of which it is difficult to realize that it
      is their stunted, puny brothers which, anxiously tended, sponged, and cosseted, drag out a
      languid existence in London drawing-rooms. Among their Titan fans lies their mighty fruit,
      like a bunch of grapes, a yard and a half long, strung upon ropes of yellow worsted.
Half-way down its length the main avenue is intersected by a splendid alley of bamboos,
      which lean their smooth-jointed stems and their luxuriant narrow leaves towards each other
      across the dimmed interspace, and unite in a pointed Gothic arch of living green.
Jim paces objectlessly down the long arcade, stooping now and again to pick up a fragment of
      the peeled bark that looks so strangely like a papyrus roll with a mother-of-pearl glaze upon
      it. He pulls it idly open, as if expecting to find the secret of some forgotten race written
      upon its shining surface; but if he reads any secret there, it is only his own, which, after
      all, is not much of a secret. He merely sees written there that it is too early to go home
      yet; that there is no security that Elizabeth may not still be sitting on the terrace
      stitching away with her gold thimble and her coloured silks. The sun, it is true, has left the
      garden, but he departs thence over-early. It will be safer to stay away yet half an hour or
      so.
Thus resolving, he retraces his steps, and explores in a new direction; saunters down a
      rose-alley, where, climbing immoderately high up tall palms, seeming as if they would strangle
      them with their long bowery arms, rose-trees wave far above him in the still air; and upon
      them, though it is still but the month of January, when people are skating, blue-nosed, in
      England, creamy tea-roses show their pale-yellow hearts, fair and frequent, on the unpruned
      boughs, rioting in licensed liberty above his head. The walk ends in a circle of gigantic
      magnolias, which take hands round a square fountain-basin. Each huge trunk is, as it were, a
      little commonwealth of trees rolled into one, instead of a single tree. Beneath them benches
      stand. Upon one his negress sits, chatting with a French bonne; on a second there is
      also something female and slender, something with its little white profile—how white it looks
      in this deceiving light!—lifted, although white, yet smiling, animated, and talking to a man
      standing beside it.
He has dawdled and kicked his heels, and run the chance of contracting a spiteful Southern
      chill, in order to avoid Elizabeth; and he has succeeded in running straight into her
      arms.
He does not at the first glance recognise her companion, but a second look shows him that he
      is one of the inmates of the hotel—a French Vicomte; and though Jim knows that he is both
      consumptive and the father of a family, that knowledge does not hinder the rising in his
      breast of the jealous and censorious thought that he has detected Elizabeth in throwing a
      great deal more than the necessary modicum of amiability into her manner to him.
As Jim comes into sight, the Frenchman clicks his heels, doubles up his body, lifts his hat,
      and walks away. It is evident, at all events, that their meeting was a casual one; and the
      reflection brings with it a sense of relief, coupled with a feeling of shame at his own rooted
      readiness to suspect her, on any or no evidence, which yet, on the other hand, is not strong
      enough, when she turns her sweet bright look towards him, to hinder the thought that it is
      scarcely, if at all, sweeter or brighter than that which he had caught her squandering on the
      casual table d'hôte acquaintance who has just quitted her.
"You, too!" she says; "why, the whole hotel seems to be emptied out into these gardens; the
      widow Wadman is buying violets—mark if they do not appear upon Uncle Toby at dinner to-night.
      The Vicomte——"
"Yes, I saw you engaged in animated dialogue with him," interrupts Jim, with slight
      acrimony; "I had no idea that you were such allies."
"Had not you?" rejoins she innocently. "He was telling me about his English governess, what
      a treasure she is"—her face dimpling mischievously—"and how wonderfully pure her accent. So it
      is—pure Cockney. You should hear the little Vicomte talk of the biby and the
       pipers."
He rewards her small pleasantry only by an absent smile, and she speaks again—rather
      wistfully this time.
"Have you been on another expedition?"
"No, not an expedition; only a walk. If"—yielding to the temptation of putting a question
      which no one would have judged more severely than he, had it been put by anyone else—"if I had
      invited you to do me the honour of making another excursion with me to-day, do you think that
      you would have consented?"
As he speaks, he departs yet further from the line of conduct he has marked out for himself
      by sitting down on the bench at her side.
Her eyes are fixed upon the soaring date-palm, which stands, instead of a water-jet, in the
      middle of the fountain-basin, and on which last year's dead plumes hang sapless, and ready to
      fall off, in contrast to this year's verdant vigour.
"Is not that rather a tantalizing question when you did not ask me?" inquires she, with soft
      archness. "Yes, I suspect that I should; I was so very happy yesterday; and although you told
      me the other night"—swallowing a sigh—"that you supposed I must love my own society, in point
      of fact, I do not think I do."
After all, the sun is not quite gone; there are flashes of light in the verdant gloom, and
      green reflections in the water.
"And yet," says Jim thoughtfully, "you seem to have a good deal of it; I suppose, in your
      position, it is unavoidable."
He had meant an allusion to her situation as bad third to her uxorious parents; before his
      mind's eye has risen a picture of the little forlorn shawled figure he had seen studying its
      Italian Grammar with the door shut upon its loneliness; but almost before the words have left
      his lips, he sees of how different, of how cruel, a construction they may be capable.
He snatches a glance of real terror at her, to see whether she has made that erroneous, yet
      all too plausible application—a glance which confirms his worst fears. She has turned as white
      as the pocket-handkerchief which she is passing over her trembling lips.
"Yes," she says in a hollow whisper; "you are right. In my position it is
      unavoidable, and it is cowardly of me not to accept it as such."
"I mean"—he cries desperately—"I only meant—I mean——"
But she does not suffer him to finish his stuttered explanation.
"It is cold," she says, rising. "I will go home."
He does not attempt to accompany or follow her.
After she is gone, he rages about the garden, and passes beyond it to where—still
      sunlight-smitten—the blue Mediterranean is breaking in joyous foam.
He sits down on the shelly strand, and, in futile anger, hurls back the wet pebbles into the
      sea's azure lap. Away to the left, the three-cornered town swarms candescent up the hill, and
      the white lighthouse stands out against the lapis-coloured air.
How sharp-cut and intense it all is!—none of our dear undecided grays. Here, if you are not
      piercing blue, you are dazzling white or profound green. There is, indeed, something less
      sharp-cut and uncompromising—a something more of mystery in the glory that—bright, too, but
      not making its full revelation—envelopes the long hill range that, ending in Cape Matifou,
      stretches away to the far right. Round the corner, to the right too, a party of Arabs, sitting
      sideways on little donkeys, white draped, with their haik-swathed heads, are
      disappearing on their small beasts in the clear air. It is like a page out of the Bible—a
      flight into Egypt—and they are going towards Egypt too.
Jim's eye follows the placid Easterns, but without catching the infection of their
      tranquillity. "Whenever I see her, I stick a knife into her! It is impossible! There is no use
      trying! I will give up the attempt. It is out of the question to have any happy relations with
      a woman who has a past!"
After all, Mr. Le Marchant does not like Hammam Rhira. He thinks the hotel cold and the
      roads bad. Jim overhears him telling someone this, and his own heart leaps.
It is true that he takes it to task for doing so. Perhaps, after all, Elizabeth's removal
      would have been the best solution of his problem. Had she left Algiers, he could scarcely have
      followed her, and she would have been freed from the chance of his clumsy stabs.
But all the same his heart leaps. It leaps yet higher a day or two later when he discovers
      that, though Hammam Rhira has not met with Mr. Le Marchant's approbation, yet that, by his
      trip to it, he has been bitten with a taste for travel, the outcome of which is his solitary
      departure on an expedition to Constantin, Tunis, etc., which must occupy him at least a week.
      His wife accompanies him to the station, but his daughter is not allowed to go beyond the
      hotel steps.
Jim surreptitiously watches her hovering with diffident affection round her father,
      unobtrusively and unthanked fetching and carrying for him. He sees the cold kiss that just
      brushes her cheek, and hears the chill parting admonition to look well after her mother and
      see that she does not overtire herself.
It is accepted with ready meekness, but leaves the recipient so crestfallen, as she stands
      looking after the departing vehicle, that Burgoyne cannot forbear joining her, with some vague
      and, as he knows, senseless velleity of championship and consolation.
"He is gone for a week, is not he?" is the form that his sympathy takes, in a tone which he
      is at but small pains not to render congratulatory.
"Yes, quite a week."
"Are you"—he is perfectly conscious while asking it that he has not the slightest right to
      put the question—"are you glad or sorry?"
She starts perceptibly.
"Why should I be glad? Do you mean"—with an unconquerable streak of satisfaction in her own
      voice—"because I shall have mammy all to myself? You must not think"—with an obvious rush of
      quickly following compunction—"that I am not fond of him, because he sometimes speaks a little
      roughly to me." After a pause, in a lowered voice: "You see, when you have broken a person's
      heart, you can scarcely blame him for not having a very high opinion of you."
So saying, she suddenly leaves him as she had left him in the Jardin d'Essai. He does not
      again approach her that day, but at dinner-time he has the answer to his question as to her
      being glad or sorry at her father's departure. She is apparently in the best of spirits,
      sitting nestled close up to her mother for the better convenience of firing a series of little
      jokes and comments into that parent's appreciative ear.
"They make fun of the whole hotel," observes Miss Strutt with exasperation. "I do not
      believe that one of us escapes! When he is not there to check them, there is no holding
      them!"
No holding Elizabeth! The phrase recurs to him several times during the next few
      days, as not without its justness, when he sees its object flitting about the house, gay as a
      linnet; when he meets her singing subduedly to herself upon the stairs; when he watches her
      romping with the French children, and mischievously collecting flowers of Clapham eloquence
      from their governess, which she is good enough to retail for his own and her mother's benefit
      when evening unites the three in the retirement of their little salon. For, strange and
      improbably blissful as it seems, he has somehow, ere three days are over, effected an entrance
      into that small and fragrant sanctuary.
Mrs. Le Marchant's first fears that the meeting with him again would re-open sorrow have
      disappeared in the light of her daughter's childish gaiety, and are even exchanged for a
      compunctious gratitude to him for having been in part the cause of her new light-heartedness.
      The weather has again broken, a fact which he alone of the whole hotel does not deplore, since
      it was his own ostentatiously displayed wet-day dreariness that was the cause of his first
      admission within the doors that are closed upon all others. Moreover, had it not been wet
      weather, could he have held an umbrella over Elizabeth's head when he met her in the
      eucalyptus wood, and they walked among the naked trunks, while the long, loose, pale foliage
      waved like dishevelled hair in the rain, and the pungent asphodels grew thick about their feet
      in the red earth? And when, by-and-by, the clouds disperse again, and there comes a fair day,
      bracketed between three or four foul ones—the usual Algerian proportion—it has grown quite
      natural to all three that he should sit opposite to them in their drives; that he should
      haggle with Arabs for them, and remonstrate with the landlord, and generally transfer all the
      smaller roughnesses of life from their shoulders to his own. Brought into more intimate
      communion with them than he has ever been before, Burgoyne realizes how much they belong to
      the kneeling, leaning, spoiling type of womankind. Elizabeth would be the easiest woman in the
      world to manage. How is it that in her ten years of womanhood no man has been found to
      undertake the lovely facile task? He himself knows perfectly the treatment that would befit
      her; the hinted wishes—her tact is too fine and her spirit too meek to need anything so coarse
      as commands—the infinitesimal rebukes and the unlimited—oh! limitless—caresses:

"Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles."

Every day he finds himself repeating Wordsworth's line, and every day, in his fancied
      guidance of her, he tells himself that the blame should be less and the kisses more.
Mr. Le Marchant has been gone more than a week, and February has come wetly in, with rain
      wildly weeping against the easements, and angry-handed rain boxing the unlucky orange-trees'
      ears. It has rained for forty-eight hours without a break. The Grand Hotel is at the end of
      its resources. Uncle Toby, his struggle ended, lies vanquished in the widow's net; and there
      is murder in the lurid eye which Miss Strutt turns on the votary of Whiteley.
Jim alone, outdoor man as he habitually is, looking upon a house merely in the light of a
      necessary shelter, has no quarrel either with the absent sun or the present deluge? for are
      not they the cause of his having spent two whole afternoons in the company of Elizabeth and
      her mother? To-day has not Elizabeth been singing to him, and cutting him orange-flower
      bread-and-butter, when Fritz brought in the afternoon tea, and set the real English kettle
      fizzing over its spirit-lamp? And, in return, has not he now, after dinner, been helping her
      to weed out her own and her mother's photograph-books? As he does so the idea strikes him of
      how very meagre her own collection of acquaintances seems to be. From that weeding have they
      not, by an easy transition, at her suggestion, passed to the more playful and ingenious
      occupation of amputating the heads of some of the rejected friends and applying them to the
      bodies of others? Each armed with a pair of scissors, and with Mrs. Le Marchant for umpire,
      they have been vying with each other as to who can produce the most startling results by this
      clever process.
The palm has just been awarded to Elizabeth for a combination which presents the head of an
      elderly lady, in a widow's cap, mounted upon the cuirass and long boots of a Life Guardsman.
      Jim's application of the cornet's discarded head to the body of a baby in long clothes,
      although allowed to be a pretty conceit, commands but little real admiration—an instance of
      nepotism which he does not allow to pass without protest.
Elizabeth, elated by her triumph, has flown out of the room to examine her private stores
      for fresh material, and Jim and her mother—for the first time, as it happens, since that early
      meeting, when her anxious eye had so plainly implored him to leave Algiers—are
       tête-à-tête. Her changed aspect towards him as she sits, with a lingering laugh
      still on her face, beside the wood fire—which, after having twice gone out, as it almost
      always does, the souches being invariably wet, burns bright and crackly—strikes him with such
      a feeling of warm pleasure that he says in a voice of undisguised triumph:
"What spirits she is in, is not she?"
"Yes; is not she?" assents the mother eagerly. "Oh, I cannot say how grateful I am to you
      for having cheered her up as you have done! Oh," with a low sigh that seems to bear away on
      its slow wings the last echoes of her late mirth, "if it could only last!"
"Why should not it last?"
"If nothing fresh would happen!"
"Why should anything fresh happen?"
She answers only indirectly;

"'Fear at my heart, as at a cup,
The life-blood seemed to sip.'

"Sometimes I think that Coleridge wrote those lines expressly for me." After a pause, in a
      voice of anxious asking: "She has not mentioned him to you lately, has she?"
"No."
"That is a good sign. Do not you think that that is a good sign? I think that she is getting
      better; do not you?"
For a moment he cannot answer, both because he is deeply touched by the confidence in him
      and his sympathy evidenced by her appeal, and for a yet more potent reason. Little she guesses
      how often, and with what heart-searchings and spirit-sinkings, he has put that question to
      himself.
"I do not know," he replies at last, with difficulty; "it is hard to judge."
"You have not told him that we are here?" in a quick, panic-struck tone, as of one smitten
      with a new and sharp apprehension.
"Oh no!"
"You do not think that he is at all likely to join you here?"
"Not in the least!" with an almost angry energy, which reveals to himself how deeply
      distasteful the mere suggestion of Byng's reappearance on the scene is to him.
Mrs. Le Marchant heaves a second sigh. This time it is one of relief.
"Then I do not see," with a sudden bound upwards into sanguineness which reminds him of her
      daughter, "why we should not all be very comfortable."
Jim is pondering in his mind upon the significance of this "all," whether it is meant to
      include only Mr. Le Marchant, or whether, under its shelter, he himself may creep into that
      promised comfort, when she of whom they have been speaking re-enters. She has a packet of
      photographs, presumably suitable for amputation, in her hand, in which is also held a
      telegram, which she extends to Burgoyne.
"I met M. Cipriani bringing you this. It seems that you ought to have had it two days ago,
      but, by some mistake, it was put into another gentleman's room—a gentleman who has never
      arrived—and there it has remained. He was full of apologies, but I told him what culpable
      carelessness it showed. I do trust," with a sweetly solicitous look, "that it is not anything
      that matters."
"It cannot be of much consequence," replies Jim indifferently, while a sort of pang darts
      through him at the thought of how strangely destitute he is of people to be uncomfortably
      anxious about, and so tears it open.
An English telegram transmitted by French clerks often wears a very different air from that
      meant to be imparted to it by the sender, which is, perhaps, the reason why Jim remains
      staring so long at his—so long that the two women's good manners prompt them to remove their
      sympathetic eyes from him, and to attempt a little talk with each other.
"I hope you have no bad news?"
The elder one permits herself this inquiry after a more than decent interval has elapsed,
      during which he has made no sign.
He gives a start, as one too suddenly awaked out of deep sleep.
"Bad news?" he repeats in an odd voice—"what is bad news? That depends upon people's tastes.
      It is for you to judge of that; it concerns you as much or more than it does me."
So saying, he places the paper in her hand, and, walking away to the little square
      window—open, despite the wildness of the weather—looks out upon the indigo-coloured night.
Although his back is turned towards them, he knows that Elizabeth is reading over her
      mother's shoulder—reading this:

"Bourgouin,
"Grand Hotel,
"Algiers.
"Have heard of Le Marchants. If you do not wire to the contrary, shall cross
        to-morrow.—Byng, Marseille."
He is not left long in doubt as to their having mastered the meaning of the missive.
"He is coming!" says Mrs. Le Marchant with a species of gasp; "and you told me—not five
      minutes ago you told me"—with an accent of reproach—"that there was not the remotest chance of
      it. Oh, stop him! stop him! Telegraph at once! The office will be open for two or three hours
      yet! There is plenty, plenty of time! Oh, telegraph at once—at once!"
"It is too late," replies Jim, retracing his steps to the table; "you forget that it is two
      days old. You see, they have spelt my name wrong; that accounts for the mistake.
       Bourgouin! It looks odd spelt Bourgouin, does not it?"
He hears himself giving a small, dry laugh, which nobody echoes.
"He must have sailed yesterday," continues the young man, wishing he could persuade his
      voice to sound more natural; "he may be here at any moment. If the weather had been decent, he
      would have arrived ere now."
"Then there is nothing to be done!" rejoins Mrs. Le Marchant in a tone of flat desperation,
      sitting down again on the chair out of which she had instinctively risen at the little stir of
      the telegram's arrival.
Elizabeth is dead silent. Though there is no direction by the eye to show that Jim's next
      remark is aimed at her, there can be no doubt that it is awkwardly thrown in her
      direction.
"If this had not been delayed—if it had not been too late, would you have wished, would you
      have decided to stop him?"
"What is the use of asking me such a question now that it is too late?" replies
      she, with more of impatience, almost wrath, in her voice than he has ever before heard that
      most gentle organ express.
But besides the ire and irritation, there is another quality in it which goads him to snatch
      a reluctant glance at her. She is extremely agitated, but underlying the distress and
      disturbance of her face there is an undoubted light shining like a lamp through a pale pink
      shade—a light that, with all her laughter and her jokes, was not there half an hour ago. He
      had often reproached himself that, by his clumsiness, he had stuck a knife into her tender
      heart. She is even with him to-night. To-night the tables are turned. It is she that has stuck
      a knife into him. It is clear as day that she is glad it is too late.
