 I.
The others had gone, and Sherman was alone in the drawing-room by himself, looking through
      the window. Never had London seemed to him so like a reef whereon he was cast away. In the
      Square the bushes were covered with dust; some sparrows were ruffling their feathers on the
      side-walk; people passed, continually disturbing them. The sky was full of smoke. A terrible
      feeling of solitude in the midst of a multitude oppressed him. A portion of his life was
      ending. He thought that soon he would be no longer a young man, and now, at the period when
      the
       desire of novelty grows less, was coming the great change of his life. He felt he
      was of those whose granaries are in the past. And now this past would never renew itself. He
      was going out into the distance as though with strange sailors in a strange ship.
He longed to see again the town where he had spent his childhood: to see the narrow roads
      and mean little shops. And perhaps it would be easier to tell her who had been the friend of
      so many years of this engagement in his own person than by letter. He wondered why it was so
      hard to write so simple a thing.
It was his custom to act suddenly on his decisions. He had not made many in his life. The
      next day he announced at the office that he would be absent for three or four days. He told
      his mother he had business in the country.
His betrothed met him on the
       way to the terminus, as he was walking, bag in hand, and asked where he was
      going. “I am going on business to the country,” he said, and blushed. He was creeping away
      like a thief.
