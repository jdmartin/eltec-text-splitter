II.
Next day his fellow-clerks noticed a decided improvement in Sherman’s spirits. He had a
      lark-like cheerfulness and alacrity breaking out at odd moments. When evening came he called,
      for the first time since his return, on Miss Leland. She scolded him roundly for having
      answered her note in such a formal way, but was sincerely glad to see him return to his
      allegiance. We have said he had sometimes, though rarely, a talkative fit. He had one this
      evening. The last play they had been to, the last party, the picture of the year, all in turn
      he glanced at.
       She was delighted. Her training had not been in vain. Her barbarian was learning
      to chatter. This flattered her a deal.
“I was never engaged,” she thought, “to a more interesting creature.”
When he had risen to go Sherman said—“I have a friend coming to visit me in a few days; you
      will suit each other delightfully. He is very mediæval.”
“Do tell me about him; I like everything mediæval.”
“Oh,” he cried, with a laugh, “his mediævalism is not in your line. He is neither a gay
      troubadour nor a wicked knight. He is a High Church curate.”
“Do not tell me anything more about him,” she answered; “I will try to be civil to him, but
      you know I never liked curates. I have been an agnostic for many years. You, I believe, are
      orthodox.”
As Sherman was on his way home he met a fellow-clerk, and stopped him with—

 “Are you an agnostic?”
“No. Why, what is that?”
“Oh, nothing! Good-bye,” he made answer, and hurried on his way.
