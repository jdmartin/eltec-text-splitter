IV.
On the evening of the 20th of June, after the blinds had been pulled down and the gas
      lighted, Sherman was playing chess in the smoking-room, right hand against left. Howard had
      gone out with a message to the Lelands. He would often say, “Is there any message I can
      deliver for you? I know how lazy you are, and will save you the trouble.” A message was always
      found for him. A pile of books lent for Sherman’s improvement went home one by one.
“Look here,” said Howard’s voice in the doorway, “I have been watching you for some time.
       You are cheating the red men most villainously. You are forcing them to make
      mistakes that the white men may win. Why, a few such games would ruin any man’s moral
      nature.”
He was leaning against the doorway, looking, to Sherman’s not too critical eyes, an
      embodiment of all that was self-possessed and brilliant. The great care with which he was
      dressed and his whole manner seemed to say, “Look at me; do I not combine perfectly the zealot
      with the man of the world?” He seemed excited to-night. He had been talking at the Lelands,
      and talking well, and felt that elation which brings us many thoughts.
“My dear Sherman,” he went on, “do cease that game. It is very bad for you. There is nobody
      alive who is honest enough to play a game of chess fairly out—right hand against left. We are
      so radically dishonest that we even cheat ourselves. We can no more play chess
       than we can think altogether by ourselves with security. You had much better
      play with me.”
“Very well, but you will beat me; I have not much practice,” replied the other.
They reset the men and began to play. Sherman relied most upon his bishops and queen. Howard
      was fondest of the knights. At first Sherman was the attacking party, but in his
      characteristic desire to scheme out his game many moves ahead, kept making slips, and at last
      had to give up, with his men nearly all gone and his king hopelessly cornered. Howard seemed
      to let nothing escape him. When the game was finished he leant back in his chair and said, as
      he rolled a cigarette—
“You do not play well.” It gave him satisfaction to feel his proficiency in many small arts.
      “You do not do any of these things at all well,” he went on, with an insolence peculiar to him
       when excited. “You have been really very badly brought up and stupidly educated
      in that intolerable Ballah. They do not understand there any, even the least, of the arts of
      life; they only believe in information. Men who are compelled to move in the great world, and
      who are also cultivated, only value the personal acquirements—self-possession, adaptability,
      how to dress well, how even to play tennis decently—you would be not so bad at that, by the
      by, if you practised—or how to paint or write effectively. They know that it is better to
      smoke one’s cigarette with a certain charm of gesture than to have by heart all the
      encyclopedias. I say this not merely as a man of the world, but as a teacher of religion. A
      man when he rises from the grave will take with him only the things that he is in himself. He
      will leave behind the things that he merely possesses, learning and information
       not less than money and high estate. They will stay behind with his house and
      his clothes and his body. A collection of facts will no more help him than a collection of
      stamps. The learned will not get into heaven as readily as the flute-player, or even as the
      man who smokes a cigarette gracefully. Now you are not learned, but you have been brought up
      almost as badly as if you were. In that wretched town they told you that education was to know
      that Russia is bounded on the north by the Arctic Sea, and on the west by the Baltic Ocean,
      and that Vienna is situated on the Danube, and that William the Third came to the throne in
      the year 1688. They have never taught you any personal art. Even chess-playing might have
      helped you at the day of judgment.”
“I am really not a worse chess-player than you. I am only more careless.”

 There was a slight resentment in Sherman’s voice. The other noticed it, and
      said, changing his manner from the insolent air of a young beauty to a self-depreciatory one,
      which was wont to give him at times a very genuine charm—
“It is really a great pity, for you Shermans are a deep people, much deeper than we Howards.
      We are like moths or butterflies on rather rapid rivulets, while you and yours are deep pools
      in the forest where the beasts go to drink. No! I have a better metaphor. Your mind and mine
      are two arrows. Yours has got no feathers, and mine has no metal on the point. I don’t know
      which is most needed for right conduct. I wonder where we are going to strike earth. I suppose
      it will be all right some day when the world has gone by and they have collected all the
      arrows into one quiver.”
He went over to the mantlepiece to hunt for a match, as
       his cigarette had gone out. Sherman had lifted a corner of the blind and was
      gazing over the roofs shining from a recent shower, and thinking how on such a night as this
      he had sat with Mary Carton by the rectory fire listening to the rain without and talking of
      the future and of the training of village children.
“Have you seen Miss Leland in her last new dress from Paris?” said Howard, making one of his
      rapid transitions. “It is very rich in colour, and makes her look a little pale, like St.
      Cecilia. She is wonderful as she stands by the piano, a silver cross round her neck. We have
      been talking about you. She complains to me. She says you are a little barbarous; you seem to
      look down on style, and sometimes—you must forgive me—even on manners, and you are quite
      without small talk. You must really try and be worthy of that beautiful girl, with her great
      soul and religious genius. She
       told me quite sadly, too, that you are not improving.”
“No,” said Sherman, “I am not going forward; I am at present trying to go sideways like the
      crabs.”
“Be serious,” answered the other. “She told me these things with the most sad and touching
      voice. She makes me her confidant, you know, in many matters, because of my wide religious
      experience. You must really improve yourself. You must paint or something.”
“Well, I will paint or something.”
“I am quite serious, Sherman. Try and be worthy of her, a soul as gentle as St.
      Cecilia’s.”
“She is very wealthy,” said Sherman. “If she were engaged to you and not to me you might
      hope to die a bishop.”
Howard looked at him in a mystified way and the conversation dropped. Presently Howard got
      up and went to his room, and Sherman, resetting
       the chess-board, began to play again, and, letting longer and longer pauses of
      reverie come between his moves, played far into the morning, cheating now in favour of the red
      men now in favour of the white.
