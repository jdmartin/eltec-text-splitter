CHAPTER THE LAST.
One of the happiest days of my life.
July 10—The excitement and anxiety through which I have gone the last few days
     have been almost enough to turn my hair grey. It is all but settled. To-morrow the die will be
     cast. I have written a long letter to Lupin-feeling it my duty to do so,-regarding his
     attention to Mrs. Posh, for they drove up to our house again last night.
July 11.—I find my eyes filling with tears as I pen the note of my interview
     this morning with Mr. Perkupp. Addressing me, he said: "My faithful servant, I will not dwell
     on the important service you have done our firm. You can never be sufficiently thanked. Let us
     change the subject. Do you like your house, and are you happy where you are?"
I replied: "Yes, sir; I love my house and I love the neighbourhood, and could not bear to
     leave it."
Mr. Perkupp, to my surprise, said: "Mr. Pooter, I will purchase the freehold of that house,
     and
      present it to the most honest and most worthy man it has ever been my lot to
     meet."
He shook my hand, and said he hoped my wife and I would be spared many years to enjoy it. My
     heart was too full to thank him; and, seeing my embarrassment, the good fellow said: "You need
     say nothing, Mr. Pooter," and left the office.
I sent telegrams to Carrie, Gowing, and Cummings (a thing I have never done before), and
     asked the two latter to come round to supper.
On arriving home I found Carrie crying with joy, and I sent Sarah round to the grocer's to
     get two bottles of "Jackson Frères."
My two dear friends came in the evening, and the last post brought a letter from Lupin in
     reply to mine. I read it aloud to them all. It ran: "My dear old Guv.,—Keep your hair on. You
     are on the wrong tack again. I am engaged to be married to 'Lillie Girl.' I did not mention it
     last Thursday, as it was not definitely settled. We shall be married in August, and amongst our
     guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing and Cummings. With much love to all, from The
      same old Lupin."
