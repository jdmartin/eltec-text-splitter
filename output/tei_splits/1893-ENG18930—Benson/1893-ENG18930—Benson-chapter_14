CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Dodo was called that morning at six, and she felt in very good spirits. There was something
      exhilarating in the thought of a good gallop again. There had been frost for a week before,
      and hunting had been stopped, but Dodo meant to make up all arrears. And, on the whole, her
      interview with Jack had consoled her, and it had given her quite a new feeling of duty. Dodo
      always liked new things, at any rate till the varnish had rubbed off, and she quite realised
      that Jack was making a sacrifice to the same forbidding goddess.
"Well, I will make a sacrifice, too," she thought as she dressed, "and when I die I shall be
      St. Dodo. I don't think there ever was a saint Dodo before, or is it saintess? Anyhow, I am
      going to be very good. Jack really is right; it is the only thing to do. I should have felt
      horribly mean if I had gone off last night, and I daresay I should have had to go abroad,
      which would have been a nuisance. I wonder if Chesterford's coming. I shall make him, I think,
      and be very charming indeed. Westley, go and tap at the door of Lord Chesterford's room, and
      tell him he is coming hunting, and that I've ordered his horse, and send his man to him, and
      let us have breakfast at once for two instead of one."
Dodo arranged her hat and stood contemplating her own figure at a cheval glass. It really
      did make a charming picture, and Dodo gave two little steps on one side, holding her skirt up
      in her left hand.

"Just look at that,
 Just look at this, 
 I really think I'm not amiss," 
she hummed to herself. "Hurrah for a gallop."
She ran downstairs and made tea, and began breakfast. A moment afterwards she heard steps in
      the hall, and Chesterford entered. Dodo was not conscious of the least embarrassment, and
      determined to do her duty.
"Morning, old boy," she said, "you look as sleepy as a d. p. or dead pig. Look at my hat.
      It's a new hat, Chesterford, and is the joy of my heart. Isn't it sweet? Have some tea, and
      give me another kidney â€”two, I think. What happens to the sheep after they take its kidneys
      out? Do you suppose it dies? I wonder if they put india-rubber kidneys in. Kidneys do come
      from sheep, don't they? Or is there a kidney tree? Kidneys look like a sort of mushroom, and I
      suppose the bacon is the leaves, Kidnonia Baconiensis; now you're doing Latin, Chesterford, as
      you used to at Eton. I daresay you've forgotten what the Latin for kidneys is. I should like
      to have seen you at Eton, Chesterford. You must have been such a dear, chubby boy with blue
      eyes. You've got rather good eyes. I think I shall paint mine blue, and we shall have a nice
      little paragraph in the Sportsman. Extraordinary example of conjugal devotion. The
      beautiful and fascinating Lady C. (you know I am beautiful and fascinating, that's why you
      married me), the wife of the charming and manly Lord C. (you know you are charming and manly,
      or I shouldn't have married you, and where would you have been then? like Methusaleh when the
      candle went out), who lived not a hundred miles from the ancient city of Harchester,' etc. Now
      it's your turn to say something, I can't carry on a conversation alone. Besides, I've finished
      breakfast, and I shall sit by you and feed you. Don't take such large mouthfuls. That was
      nearly a whole kidney you put in then. You'll die of kidneys, and then people will think you
      had something wrong with your inside, but I shall put on your tombstone, 'Because he ate them,
      two at a time.'"
Chesterford laughed. Dodo had not behaved like this for months. What did it all mean? But
      the events of the night before were too deeply branded on his memory to let him comfort
      himself very much. But anyhow it was charming to see Dodo like this again. And she shall never
      know.
"You'll choke if you laugh with five kidneys in your mouth," Dodo went on. "They'll get down
      into your lungs and bob about, and all your organs will get mixed up together, and you won't
      be able to play on them. I suppose Americans have American organs in their insides, which
      accounts for their squeaky voices. Now, have you finished? Oh, you really can't have any
      marmalade; put it in your pocket and eat it as you go along."
Dodo was surprised at the ease with which she could talk nonsense again. She abused herself
      for ever having let it drop. It really was much better than yawning and being bored. She had
      no idea how entertaining she was to herself. And Chesterford had lost his hang-dog look. He
      put her hat straight for her, and gave her a little kiss just as he used to. After all, things
      were not so bad.
It was a perfect morning. They left the house about a quarter to seven, and the world was
      beginning to wake again. There was a slight hoar-frost on the blades of grass that lined the
      road, and on the sprigs of bare hawthorn. In the east the sky was red with the coming day.
      Dodo sniffed the cool morning air with a sense of great satisfaction.
"Decidedly somebody washes the world every night," she said, "and those are the soapsuds
      which are still clinging to the grass. What nice clean soap, all in little white crystals and
      spikes. And oh, how good it smells! Look at those poor little devils of birds looking for
      their breakfast. Poor dears, I suppose they'll be dead when the spring comes. There are the
      hounds. Come on, Chesterford, they're just going to draw the far cover. It is a sensible plan
      beginning hunting by seven. You get five hours by lunch-time."
None of Dodo's worst enemies accused her of riding badly. She had a perfect seat, and that
      mysterious communication with her horse that seems nothing short of magical. "If you tell your
      horse to do a thing the right way," she used to say, "he does it. It is inevitable. The
      question is, 'Who is master?' as Humpty Dumpty said. But it isn't only master; you must make
      him enjoy it. You must make him feel friendly as well, or else he'll go over the fence right
      enough, but buck you off on the other side, as a kind of protest, and quite right too."
Dodo had a most enjoyable day's hunting, and returned home well pleased with herself and
      everybody else. She found Jack's note waiting for her. She read it thoughtfully, and said to
      herself, "He is quite right, and that is what I mean to do. My young ideal, I am teaching you
      how to shoot."
She took up a pen, meaning to write to him, but laid it down again. "No," she said, "I can
      do without that at present. I will keep that for my bad days. I suppose the bad days will
      come, and I won't use my remedies before I get the disease."
The days passed on. They went hunting every morning, and Dodo began to form very high hopes
      of her new child, as she called her ideal. The bad days did not seem to be the least imminent.
      Chesterford behaved almost like a lover again in the light of Dodo's new smiles. He kept his
      bad times to himself. They came in the evening usually when the others had gone to bed. He
      used to sit up late by himself over his study fire, thinking hopelessly, of the day that had
      gone and the day that was to come. It was a constant struggle not to tell Dodo all he knew. He
      could scarcely believe that he had heard what Maud had said, or that he ever had had that
      interview with Jack. He could not reconcile these things with Dodo's altered behaviour, and he
      gave it up. Dodo was tired of him, and he knew that he loved her more than ever. A more
      delicately-strung mind might almost have given way under the hourly struggle, but it is the
      fate of a healthy simple man to be capable of more continued suffering than one more highly
      developed. The latter breaks down, or he gets numbed with the pain; but Chesterford went on
      living under the slow ache, and his suffering grew no less. But through it all he looked back
      with deep gratitude to the chance that had sent Dodo in his way. He did not grow bitter, and
      realised in the midst of his suffering how happy he had been. He had only one strong wish.
      "Oh, God," he cried, "give me her back for one moment! Let her be sorry just once for my
      sake."
But there is a limit set to human misery, and the end had nearly come.
It was about a fortnight after Jack had gone. Maud and Mr. Spencer had gone too, but Mrs.
      Vivian was with them still. Dodo had more than once thought of telling her what had happened,
      but she could not manage it. When Mrs. Vivian had spoken of going, Dodo entreated her to stop,
      for she had a great fear of being left alone with Chesterford.
They had been out hunting, and Dodo had got home first. It was about three in the afternoon,
      and it had begun to snow. She had had lunch, and was sitting in the morning-room in a drowsy
      frame of mind. She was wondering whether Chesterford had returned, and whether he would come
      up and see her, and whether she was not too lazy to exert herself. She heard a carriage come
      slowly up the drive, and did not feel interested enough to look out of the window. She was
      sitting with her shoes off warming her feet at the fire, with a novel in her lap, which she
      was not reading, and a cigarette in her hand. She heard the opening and shutting of doors, and
      slow steps on the stairs. Then the door opened and Mrs. Vivian came in.
Dodo had seen that look in her face once before, when she was riding in the Park with Jack,
      and a fearful certainty came upon her.
She got up and turned towards her.
"Is he dead?" she asked.
Mrs. Vivian drew her back into her seat.
"I will tell you all," she said. "He has had a dangerous fall hunting, and it is very
      serious. The doctors are with him. There is some internal injury, and he is to have an
      operation. It is the only chance of saving his life, and even then it is a very slender one.
      He is quite conscious, and asked me to tell you. You will not be able to see him for half an
      hour. The operation is going on now."
Dodo sat perfectly still. She did not speak a word; she scarcely even thought anything.
      Everything seemed to be a horrible blank to her.
"Ah God, ah God!" she burst out at last. "Can't I do anything to help? I would give my right
      hand to help him. It is all too horrible. To think that Iâ€”" She walked up and down the room,
      and then suddenly opened the door and went downstairs. She paced up and down the drawing-room,
      paused a moment, and went into his study. His papers were lying about in confusion on the
      table, but on the top was a guide-book to the Riviera. Dodo remembered his buying this at
      Mentone on their wedding-tour, and conscientiously walking about the town sight-seeing. She
      sat down in his chair and took it up. She remembered also that he had bought her that day a
      new volume of poems which had just come out, and had read to her out of it. There was in it a
      poem called "Paris and Helen." He had read that among others, and had said to her, as they
      were being rowed back to the yacht again that evening, "That is you and I, Dodo, going
      home."
On the fly-leaf of the guide-book he had written it out, and, as she sat there now, Dodo
      read it.

As o'er the swelling tides we slip
 That know not wave nor foam,
 Behold the helmsman of our ship,
 Love leads us safely home. 
 
 His ministers around us move
 To aid the westering breeze,
 He leads us softly home, my love,
 Across the shining seas. 
 
 My golden Helen, day and night
 Love's light is o'er us flung,
 Each hour for us is infinite,
 And all the world is young. 
 
 There is none else but thou and I
 Beneath the heaven's high dome,
 Love's ministers around us fly,
 Love leads us safely home. 
Dodo buried her face in her hands with a low cry. "I have been cruel and wicked," she sobbed
      to herself. "I have despised the best that any man could ever give me, and I can never make
      him amends. I will tell him all. I will ask him to forgive me. Oh, poor Chesterford, poor
      Chesterford!"
She sat there sobbing in complete misery. She saw, as she had never seen before, the
      greatness of his love for her, and her wretched, miserable return for his gift.
"It is all over; I know he will die," she sobbed. "Supposing he does not know meâ€”supposing
      he dies before I can tell him. Oh, my husband, my husband, live to forgive me!"
She was roused by a touch on her shoulder. Mrs. Vivian stood by her.
"You must be quick, Dodo," she said. "There is not much time."
Dodo did not answer her, but went upstairs. Before the bedroom door she stopped.
"I must speak to him alone," she said. "Send them all out."
"They have gone into the dressing-room," said Mrs. Vivian; "he is alone."
Dodo stayed no longer, but went in.
He was lying facing the door, and the shadow of death was on his face. But he recognised
      Dodo, and smiled and held out his hand.
Dodo ran to the bedside and knelt by it.
"Oh, Chesterford," she sobbed, "I have wronged you cruelly, and I can never make it up. I
      will tell you all."
"There is no need," said he; "I knew it all along."
Dodo raised her head. "You knew it all?" she asked.
"Yes, dear," he said; "it was by accident that I knew it."
"And you behaved to me as usual," said Dodo.
"Yes, my darling," said he; "you wouldn't have had me beat you, would you? Don't speak of
      itâ€”there is not much time."
"Ah, forgive me, forgive me!" she cried. "How could I have done it?"
"It was not a case of forgiving," he said. "You are you, you are Dodo. My darling, there is
      not time to say much. You have been very good to me, and have given me more happiness than I
      ever thought I could have had."
"Chesterford! Chesterford!" cried Dodo pleadingly.
"Yes, darling," he answered; "my own wife. Dodo, I shall see the boy soon, and we will wait
      for you together. You will be mine again then. There shall be no more parting."
Dodo could not answer him. She could only press his hand and kiss his lips, which were
      growing very white.
It was becoming a fearful effort for him to speak. The words came slowly with long
      pauses.
"There is one more thing," he said. "You must marry Jack. You must make him very happyâ€”as
      you have made me."
"Ah, don't say that," said Dodo brokenly; "don't cut me to the heart."
"My darling," he said, "my sweet own wife, I am so glad you told me. It has cleared up the
      only cloud. I wondered whether you would tell me. I prayed God you might, and He has granted
      it me. Good-bye, my own darling, good-bye."
Dodo lay in his arms, and kissed him passionately.
"Good-bye, dear," she sobbed.
He half raised himself in bed.
"Ah, my Dodo, my sweet wife," he said.
Then he fell back and lay very still.
How long Dodo remained there she did not know. She remembered Mrs. Vivian coming in and
      raising her gently, and they left the darkened room together.
