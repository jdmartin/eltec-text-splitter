CHAPTER II.
BERNARDINE BEGINS HER BOOK.
AFTER the announcement of Mrs. Allitsen's death, Bernardine lived in a misery of suspense.
      Every day she scanned the obituary, fearing to find the record of another death, fearing and
      yet wishing to know. The Disagreeable Man had yearned for his freedom these many years, and
      now he was at liberty to do what he chose with his poor life. It was of no value to him. Many
      a time she sat and shuddered. Many a time she began to write to him. Then she remembered that
      after all he had cared nothing for her companionship. He would not wish to hear from her. And
      besides, what had she to say to him?
A feeling of desolation came over her. It was not enough for her to take care of the old man
      who was drawing nearer to her every day; nor was it enough for her to dust the books, and
      serve any chance customers who might look in. In the midst of her trouble she remembered some
      of her old ambitions; and she turned to them for comfort as we turn to old friends.
"I will try to begin my book," she said to herself. "If I can only get interested in it, I
      shall forget my anxiety!"
But the love of her work had left her. Bernardine fretted. She sat in the old bookshop, her
      pen unused, her paper uncovered. She was very miserable.
Then one evening when she was feeling that it was of no use trying to force herself to begin
      her book, she took her pen suddenly, and wrote the following prologue.
