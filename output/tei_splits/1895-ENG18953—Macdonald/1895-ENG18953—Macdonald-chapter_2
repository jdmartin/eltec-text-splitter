THE MIRROR
NOTHING more happened for some days. I think it was about a week after, when what I have now
     to tell took place.
I had often thought of the manuscript fragment, and repeatedly tried to discover some way of
     releasing it, but in vain: I could not find what held it fast.
But I had for some time intended a thorough overhauling of the books in the closet, its
     atmosphere causing me uneasiness as to their condition. One day the intention suddenly became a
     resolve, and I was in the act of rising from my chair to make a beginning, when I saw the old
     librarian moving from the door of the closet toward the farther end of the room. I ought rather
     to say only that I caught sight of something shadowy from which I received the impression of a
     slight, stooping man, in a shabby dress-coat reaching almost to his heels, the tails of which,
     disparting a little as he walked, revealed thin legs in black stockings, and large feet in
     wide, slipper-like shoes.
At once I followed him: I might be following a shadow, but I never doubted I was following
     something. He went out of the library into the hall, and across to the foot of the great
     staircase, then up the stairs to the first floor, where lay the chief rooms. Past these rooms,
     I following close, he continued his way, through a wide corridor, to the foot of a narrower
     stair leading to the second floor. Up that he went also, and when I reached the top, strange as
     it may seem, I found myself in a region almost unknown to me. I never had brother or sister to
     incite to such romps as make children familiar with nook and cranny; I was a mere child when my
     guardian took me away; and I had never seen the house again until, about a month before, I
     returned to take possession.
Through passage after passage we came to a door at the bottom of a winding wooden stair,
     which we ascended. Every step creaked under my foot, but I heard no sound from that of my
     guide. Somewhere in the middle of the stair I lost sight of him, and from the top of it the
     shadowy shape was nowhere visible. I could not even imagine I saw him. The place was full of
     shadows, but he was not one of them.
I was in the main garret, with huge beams and rafters over my head, great spaces around me, a
     door here and there in sight, and long vistas whose gloom was thinned by a few lurking
     cobwebbed windows and small dusky skylights. I gazed with a strange mingling of awe and
     pleasure: the wide expanse of garret was my own, and unexplored!
In the middle of it stood an unpainted inclosure of rough planks, the door of which was ajar.
     Thinking Mr. Raven might be there, I pushed the door, and entered.
The small chamber was full of light, but such as dwells in places deserted: it had a dull,
     disconsolate look, as if it found itself of no use, and regretted having come. A few rather dim
     sunrays, marking their track through the cloud of motes that had just been stirred up, fell
     upon a tall mirror with a dusty face, old-fashioned and rather narrow—in appearance an ordinary
     glass. It had an ebony frame, on the top of which stood a black eagle, with outstretched wings,
     in his beak a golden chain, from whose end hung a black ball.
I had been looking at rather than into the mirror, when suddenly I became aware that it
     reflected neither the chamber nor my own person. I have an impression of having seen the wall
     melt away, but what followed is enough to account for any uncertainty:—could I have mistaken
     for a mirror the glass that protected a wonderful picture?
I saw before me a wild country, broken and heathy. Desolate hills of no great height, but
     somehow of strange appearance, occupied the middle distance; along the horizon stretched the
     tops of a far-off mountain range; nearest me lay a tract of moorland, flat and melancholy.
Being short-sighted, I stepped closer to examine the texture of a stone in the immediate
     foreground, and in the act espied, hopping toward me with solemnity, a large and ancient raven,
     whose purply black was here and there softened with gray. He seemed looking for worms as he
     came. Nowise astonished at the appearance of a live creature in a picture, I took another step
     forward to see him better, stumbled over something—doubtless the frame of the mirror—and stood
     nose to beak with the bird: I was in the open air, on a houseless heath!
