THE SHADOW
A MURMUR of pleasure from my companions roused me: they had caught sight of their fellows in
     the distance! The two on Lona's horse rode on to join them. They were greeted with a wavering
     shout—which immediately died away. As we drew near, the sound of their sobs reached us like the
     breaking of tiny billows.
When I came among them, I saw that something dire had befallen them: on their childish faces
     was the haggard look left by some strange terror. No possible grief could have wrought the
     change. A few of them came slowly round me, and held out their arms to take my burden. I
     yielded it; the tender hopelessness of the smile with which they received it, made my heart
     swell with pity in the midst of its own desolation. In vain were their sobs over their
     mother-queen; in vain they sought to entice from her some recognition of their love; in vain
     they kissed and fondled her as they bore her away: she would not wake! On each side one carried
     an arm, gently stroking it; as many as could get near, put their arms under her body; those who
     could not, crowded around the bearers. On a spot where the grass grew thicker and softer they
     laid her down, and there all the Little Ones gathered sobbing.
Outside the crowd stood the elephants, and I near them, gazing at my Lona over the many
     little heads between. Those next me caught sight of the princess, and stared trembling. Odu was
     the first to speak.
"I have seen that woman before!" he whispered to his next neighbour. "It was she who fought
     the white leopardess, the night they woke us with their yelling!"
"Silly!" returned his companion. "That was a wild beast, with spots!"
"Look at her eyes!" insisted Odu. "I know she is a bad giantess, but she is a wild beast all
     the same. I know she is the spotted one!"
The other took a step nearer; Odu drew him back with a sharp pull.
"Don't look at her!" he cried, shrinking away, yet fascinated by the hate-filled longing in
     her eyes. "She would eat you up in a moment! It was her shadow! She is the wicked
     princess!"
"That cannot be! they said she was beautiful!"
"Indeed it is the princess!" I interposed. "Wickedness has made her ugly!"
She heard, and what a look was hers!
"It was very wrong of me to run away!" said Odu thoughtfully.
"What made you run away?" I asked. "I expected to find you where I left you!"
He did not reply at once.
"I don't know what made me run," answered another. "I was frightened!"
"It was a man that came down the hill from the palace," said a third.
"How did he frighten you?"
"I don't know."
"He wasn't a man," said Odu; "he was a shadow; he had no thick to him!"
"Tell me more about him."
"He came down the hill very black, walking like a bad giant, but spread flat. He was nothing
     but blackness. We were frightened the moment we saw him, but we did not run away; we stood and
     watched him. He came on as if he would walk over us. But before he reached us, he began to
     spread and spread, and grew bigger end bigger, till at last he was so big that he went out of
     our sight, and we saw him no more, and then he was upon us!"
"What do you mean by that?"
"He was all black through between us, and we could not see one another; and then he was
     inside us."
"How did you know he was inside you?"
"He did me quite different. I felt like bad. I was not Odu any more—not the Odu I knew. I
     wanted to tear Sozo to pieces—not really, but like!"
He turned and hugged Sozo.
"It wasn't me, Sozo," he sobbed. "Really, deep down, it was Odu, loving you always! And Odu
     came up, and knocked Naughty away. I grew sick, and thought I must kill myself to get out of
     the black. Then came a horrible laugh that had heard my think, and it set the air trembling
     about me. And then I suppose I ran away, but I did not know I had run away until I found myself
     running, fast as could, and all the rest running too. I would have stopped, but I never thought
     of it until I was out of the gate among the grass. Then I knew that I had run away from a
     shadow that wanted to be me and wasn't, and that I was the Odu that loved Sozo. It was the
     shadow that got into me, and hated him from inside me; it was not my own self me! And now I
     know that I ought not to have run away! But indeed I did not quite know what I was doing until
     it was done! My legs did it, I think: they grew frightened, and forgot me, and ran away!
     Naughty legs! There! and there!"
Thus ended Odu, with a kick to each of his naughty legs.
"What became of the shadow?" I asked.
"I do not know," he answered. "I suppose he went home into the night where there is no
     moon."
I fell a wondering where Lona was gone, and dropping on the grass, took the dead thing in my
     lap, and whispered in its ear, "Where are you, Lona? I love you!" But its lips gave no answer.
     I kissed them, not quite cold, laid the body down again, and appointing a guard over it, rose
     to provide for the safety of Lona's people during the night.
Before the sun went down, I had set a watch over the princess outside the camp, and sentinels
     round it: intending to walk about it myself all night long, I told the rest of the army to go
     to sleep. They threw themselves on the grass and were asleep in a moment.
When the moon rose I caught a glimpse of something white; it was the leopardess. She swept
     silently round the sleeping camp, and I saw her pass three times between the princess and the
     Little Ones. Thereupon I made the watch lie down with the others, and stretched myself beside
     the body of Lona.
