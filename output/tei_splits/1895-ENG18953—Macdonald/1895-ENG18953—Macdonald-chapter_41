I AM SENT
THEN I turned and said to Eve, "Mother, one couch next to Lona is empty: I know I am
     unworthy, but may I not sleep this night in your chamber with my dead? Will you not pardon both
     my cowardice and my self-confidence, and take me in? I give me up. I am sick of myself, and
     would fain sleep the sleep!"
"The couch next to Lona is the one already prepared for you," she answered; "but something
     waits to be done ere you sleep."
"I am ready," I replied.
"How do you know you can do it?" she asked with a smile.
"Because you require it," I answered. "What is it?"
She turned to Adam: "Is he forgiven, husband?"
"From my heart."
"Then tell him what he has to do."
Adam turned to his daughter. "Give me that hand, Mara, my child."
She held it out to him in her lap. He took it tenderly.
"Let us go to the cottage," he said to me; "there I will instruct you."
As we went, again arose a sudden stormful blast, mingled with a great flapping on the roof,
     but it died away as before in a deep moan.
When the door of the death-chamber was closed behind us, Adam seated himself, and I stood
     before him.
"You will remember," he said, "how, after leaving my daughter's house, you came to a dry
     rock, bearing the marks of an ancient cataract; you climbed that rock, and found a sandy
     desert: go to that rock now, and from its summit walk deep into the desert. But go not many
     steps ere you lie down, and listen with your head on the sand. If you hear the murmur of water
     beneath, go a little farther, and listen again. If you still hear the sound, you are in the
     right direction. Every few yards you must stop, lie down, and hearken. If, listening thus, at
     any time you hear no sound of water, you are out of the way, and must hearken in every
     direction until you hear it again. Keeping with the sound, and careful not to retrace your
     steps, you will soon hear it louder, and the growing sound will lead you to where it is
     loudest: that is the spot you seek. There dig with the spade I will give you, and dig until you
     come to moisture: in it lay the hand, cover it to the level of the desert, and come home.—But
     give good heed, and carry the hand with care. Never lay it down, in what place of seeming
     safety soever; let nothing touch it; stop nor turn aside for any attempt to bar your way; never
     look behind you; speak to no one, answer no one, walk straight on.—It is yet dark, and the
     morning is far distant, but you must set out at once."
He gave me the hand, and brought me a spade.
"This is my gardening spade," he said; "with it I have brought many a lovely thing to the
     sun."
I took it, and went out into the night.
It was very cold, and pitch-dark. To fall would be a dread thing, and the way I had to go was
     a difficult one even in the broad sunlight! But I had not set myself the task, and the minute I
     started I learned that I was left to no chance: a pale light broke from the ground at every
     step, and showed me where next to set my foot. Through the heather and the low rocks I walked
     without once even stumbling. I found the bad burrow quite still; not a wave arose, not a head
     appeared as I crossed it.
A moon came, and herself showed me the easy way: toward morning I was almost over the dry
     channels of the first branch of the river-bed, and not far, I judged, from Mara's cottage.
The moon was very low, and the sun not yet up, when I saw before me in the path, here
     narrowed by rocks, a figure covered from head to foot as with a veil of moonlit mist. I kept on
     my way as if I saw nothing. The figure threw aside its veil.
"Have you forgotten me already?" said the princess—or what seemed she.
I neither hesitated nor answered; I walked straight on.
"You meant then to leave me in that horrible sepulchre! Do you not yet understand that where
     I please to be, there I am? Take my hand: I am alive as you!"
I was on the point of saying, "Give me your left hand," but bethought myself, held my peace,
     and steadily advanced.
"Give me my hand," she suddenly shrieked, "or I will tear you in pieces: you are mine!"
She flung herself upon me. I shuddered, but did not falter. Nothing touched me, and I saw her
     no more.
With measured tread along the path, filling it for some distance, came a body of armed men. I
     walked through them—nor know whether they gave way to me, or were bodiless things. But they
     turned and followed me; I heard and felt their march at my very heels; but I cast no look
     behind, and the sound of their steps and the clash of their armour died away.
A little farther on, the moon being now close to the horizon and the way in deep shadow, I
     descried, seated where the path was so narrow that I could not pass her, a woman with muffled
     face.
"Ah," she said, "you are come at last! I have waited here for you an hour or more! You have
     done well! Your trial is over. My father sent me to meet you that you might have a little rest
     on the way. Give me your charge, and lay your head in my lap; I will take good care of both
     until the sun is well risen. I am not bitterness always, neither to all men!"
Her words were terrible with temptation, for I was very weary. And what more likely to be
     true! If I were, through slavish obedience to the letter of the command and lack of pure
     insight, to trample under my feet the very person of the Lady of Sorrow! My heart grew faint at
     the thought, then beat as if it would burst my bosom.
Nevertheless my will hardened itself against my heart, and my step did not falter. I took my
     tongue between my teeth lest I should unawares answer, and kept on my way. If Adam had sent
     her, he could not complain that I would not heed her! Nor would the Lady of Sorrow love me the
     less that even she had not been able to turn me aside!
Just ere I reached the phantom, she pulled the covering from her face: great indeed was her
     loveliness, but those were not Mara's eyes! no lie could truly or for long imitate them! I
     advanced as if the thing were not there, and my foot found empty room.
I had almost reached the other side when a Shadow—I think it was The Shadow, barred my way.
     He seemed to have a helmet upon his head, but as I drew closer I perceived it was the head
     itself I saw—so distorted as to bear but a doubtful resemblance to the human. A cold wind smote
     me, dank and sickening—repulsive as the air of a charnel-house; firmness forsook my joints, and
     my limbs trembled as if they would drop in a helpless heap. I seemed to pass through him, but I
     think now that he passed through me: for a moment I was as one of the damned. Then a soft wind
     like the first breath of a new-born spring greeted me, and before me arose the dawn.
My way now led me past the door of Mara's cottage. It stood wide open, and upon the table I
     saw a loaf of bread and a pitcher of water. In or around the cottage was neither howl nor
     wail.
I came to the precipice that testified to the vanished river. I climbed its worn face, and
     went on into the desert. There at last, after much listening to and fro, I determined the spot
     where the hidden water was loudest, hung Lilith's hand about my neck, and began to dig. It was
     a long labour, for I had to make a large hole because of the looseness of the sand; but at
     length I threw up a damp spadeful. I flung the sexton-tool on the verge, and laid down the
     hand. A little water was already oozing from under its fingers. I sprang out, and made haste to
     fill the grave. Then, utterly fatigued, I dropped beside it, and fell asleep.
