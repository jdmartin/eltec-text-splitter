CHAPTER V.
"Then marry me," the musician was saying, half-an-hour later. It had not struck him before
     that she might not possibly want to do so.
"But I have already told you that I do not love you," persisted Lady Joan, who was enjoying
     herself immensely.
"What does that matter? It will come in time, it is sure to come. Besides, I love you; is not
     that enough?"
It would have been, to most of his lady friends; but Lady Joan only caught the humor of his
     words, and laughed derisively.
"You think you are going to put me off by pretending to laugh," he went on patiently; this
     was to show his superior knowledge of her character; "but the truth is that you dare not be
     serious, Lady Joan; why don't you give in to your real feelings and stop making a joke of life
     just this once?"
"I make a joke of life?" she cried; she was half in earnest now; "how is that possible unless
     one has realized its sadness? You enthusiasts who have never laughed at anything, and are
     always talking about taking life seriously, you have never gone deep enough to see that it
      is serious. If you had, you would only laugh for the rest of your life, because—it
     would be impossible after you had once realized that to keep serious and live."
For the first time in his life the musician did not want to argue.
"Don't you see that I love you as I have never loved any one before, as I could never love
     any one again?" he said humbly.
"How am I to believe that?" she retorted sharply, and he flushed slightly.
"Is that quite fair of you? Have I not been always perfectly open with you? I told you the
     story of my marriage the first time I ever met you, and I have told you to-day about poor
     little No—about Miss Bisley. Could any man do more?"
"No," she said carelessly, "but you might very well have done less,—I mean, the whole town
     told me about Miss Bisley directly I came home from abroad, though, except for the name, the
     two accounts do not tally in the least. But then, nothing in Relton shrinks in the
     washing."
The musician flinched, and tried another tactic.
"Then I suppose you merely think I am a brute who is taking advantage of your loneliness to
     profess an affection for you which he does not feel? A man has to pay a big penalty for your
     friendship, Lady Joan."
She would not have let him see it for the world, but she felt she had gone a little too far,
     and a rapid change came over her mood.
"It is not that; I am afraid of myself, I think," she said with a sigh, and she looked down
     at his boots.
His face lighted up.
"Then—" he began eagerly; but she put up her hand with a gesture of warning.
"No, no, you mistake me; I do not believe that it is in me to love anybody—for long. My
     friends say it is because I have never known a mother's love; but if my parents had lived they
     would simply have made me fight with them through their tiresome affection for me. Now, I know
     what you are going to say—that I am speaking with the spirit of the age, or some of that
     twaddle I have heard before. If I am, it is you who have taught it me, for I don't allow
     anybody else to mention the age to me; I am sick of it and the people who make their living out
     of abusing it. I could never love you, or anybody. That's the truth, and—don't you believe
     me?"
"Not quite," he said, and looked at her in an unpleasantly direct way.
"Besides," she said, rather awkwardly, catching at another loophole of escape, "there is this
     Norah Bisley: how am I to know that she will not come back?"
He shook his head, and she smiled at the guilelessness of his reply.
"I don't think it is possible. You see, I wrote three times—"
"The letters may have gone astray."
"The third one I sent by hand, and it was returned to me unopened. I can see now that it is
     only what I might have expected; she did not have a thought apart from her father, and her
     father never liked me well enough to look on me in the light of a son-in-law. He took her away
     directly he suspected our liking for one another, and when they got together and away from me
     he must have persuaded her to give me up. I wrote to him and I wrote to her, but, as you know,
     with no avail. She was a lovable little thing, spoiled by her weakness of will, poor little
     Norah!"
"Poor little Norah!" she echoed half mockingly, and crumbled some mortar off the broken wall
     and watched it splash into the water below. She was wondering how it was that she had been more
     fascinated in half-an-hour by handsome, empty-headed Jack Raleigh than she had been in three
     long years by this large-hearted musician, with the high forehead and the cavernous eyes, with
     his passion for metaphysics and Socialism, and his ardent desires to reform society and the
     world in his own lifetime. Yet she found him interesting sometimes, generally when he was not
     there and she was thinking about him, and she wondered again why he did not interest her more,
     and whether she would not have tumbled into a commonplace engagement with him if her parents
     had been alive and he had been asked to dine at the Court, like any ordinary young man, and she
     had been forbidden, like any ordinary young woman, to come down to the inn and play with his
     child. But she had no parents to impose conventionality upon her, and she had gloried in her
     liberty for twenty-five years, and she was loth to give it up now for the sake of a man who,
     she felt sure, would bore her in a week with his desperate enthusiasms, and whom she was not
     even sure that she loved. No, she could not marry him, she felt sure, and she looked up to say
     so, and met his restless eyes watching her with such a boy's eagerness that she again went off
     on a side issue.
"I am not livable with, that is the truth," she said rather weakly, and crumbled some more
     mortar off the wall, and wished he would not look at her so gloomily. He was thinking that the
     courtship was not going as smoothly as he expected it would, and beginning dimly to understand
     that for the only time in his experience he was humbling himself before a woman who was not
     going to fall a victim to his persuasions; and the discovery did not make him more eloquent nor
     less humble, though it tended to make him look at the question still more blindly from his own
     point of view, and he told himself again, obstinately, that he could not live without her for
     his wife.
"Lady Joan," he said suddenly, "is it me that you dislike, or marriage?"
"Both," she said, and laughed heartily, and became swiftly grave again, and came up to him
     and took both his hands, an unwonted action that brought the color to his cheeks; "don't you
     see, my dear friend, that if we were to marry I should plague your life out, and you would
     never write another note of music, and Mrs. Reginald Routh and all the others would point at me
     with invective? And you would bore me to the verge of extinction in a month! Of course if you
     didn't like me it might work better, because then I should have to make you fall in love with
     me, and that would prevent it from being such a deadly dull affair. Or if I hated you I might
     do it, because then we could live our separate lives, and there would be nothing to spoil.
     Don't you see how marriage always spoils things? It is never romantic; it is expedient, that's
     all. It does for people who are not fond of one another, or for people who do not feel such
     things; but for two people who are in love, and one of them a hypersensitive musician—bah! it
     would be madness! Not that I am in love, of course."
He chose to ignore the feminine way in which she concluded, and as she dropped his hands and
     swung away from him, he found himself feeling for his tobacco pouch, and he reflected that the
     courtship was not much more romantic than the married life she pictured.
"Then you believe in perpetual engagements?" he asked, for the sake of saying something.
"Not a bit of it," she replied gayly, leaning over the broken wall and watching the creatures
     in the water below; "engagements simply mean all the conventional drawbacks without the moral
     conveniences. No, there is only one way out of it, and that won't work when you come to examine
     it."
"And what is that?" he asked, like a man, rashly.
"To marry some one who doesn't matter, and be in love with some one else," she replied
     carelessly, and kept her face averted.
He rolled up his cigarette and lighted it, and wondered whether women ever discussed among
     themselves these subjects which they had no diffidence in approaching with men.
"No, it would hardly work, I am afraid," he said slowly. "Lady Joan, it is an absurdly
     old-fashioned thing to say, but do you know I fancy, after all, that marriage is the only way
     out of it?"
She turned round and faced him with hot cheeks and angry eyes.
"I think you are merely abusing your privilege as my friend," she cried; "I am not going to
     stay here for you to draw me out and then—then laugh at me. It is time we closed this—this
     absurd interview, and I wish—I wish I had known you were here before I started for my walk. Do
     you suppose that I would say anything to you that the whole world might not
     hear?"
He certainly did suppose so from quite recent experience, but he only apologized humbly for
     having his meaning mistaken, and allowed her to retrace her steps across the field without
     uttering any commonplace about meeting again as friends. Perhaps he knew quite well that when
     they did meet again she would be by far the most self-possessed of the two.
The musician walked back to the inn and tried to persuade himself that he was a disappointed
     man.
"My engagements never do seem to go right," he thought dejectedly, as he leaned out of the
     parlor window and looked vaguely among the fruit-trees. The door was pushed open from without,
     and a rush of red sunshine and childish footsteps came into the room.
"Here I are, daddy! Where is you, daddy? I've been a naughty boy, welly naughty
     Nanny says, 'cos I didn't say grace at tea-time. Why don't you never say grace, my
     daddy? When I are a big man I aren't never going to say grace no more! Nanny says I are to kiss
     you free times, and did you bring any sweets for me, daddy?"
"That will do, my son, yes," said Digby, nervously, as the boy clambered on his knee and
     proceeded to cover him with sticky embraces; "Nanny is always right, of course, but I think
     twice will be enough. Thanks. The sweets are in this pocket, so you need not turn out all the
     others. And you must not have any unless you stop jumping."
The musician was not fond of children, and he always imagined his own was going to break his
     neck or damage himself in some way every time he came into the room. Sonny on his part had his
     own views concerning this mysterious daddy who came and went so strangely, and who was always
     going to chastise him severely according to Mrs. Haxtell, but never did anything worse than
     bring him sweets, and hold him by his sash until he was nearly suffocated.
"And now for my story, daddy," he shouted, with his mouth full of sugar-plums. "Be quick
     please, my daddy; once upon a time—go on, daddy!"
"Once upon a time," began the musician vaguely, and his thoughts strayed away to the
     lithesome figure swaying to and fro on the broken wall, and he tried hard to realize his
     crestfallen condition now that she had refused him.
"Yes, daddy, yes; go on, please, my daddy: are you forgotten the end of my story, daddy
     dear?" pleaded the restless spirit in his arms.
"Oh, dear, once upon a time there was—there was—oh, confound it all, there was a beautiful
     lady, wasn't there?" he began wearily.
"A booful lady? Welly booful, daddy?"
"Very beautiful, my son."
"Oh," solemnly, "and what sort of daddy did she have?"
"Eh, what? Daddy? Oh—she didn't have one," said the musician, oblivious of morality; he was
     going through an eloquent speech in his mind which he might have said in the castle meadow if
     only he had not been so absurdly nervous.
"Oh," said the baby voice, growing shrill with interest, "didn't she never have no daddy at
     all?"
Of course, thought the musician, if he had said that to her instead of stuttering over a few
     commonplaces she would have found him irresistible at once.
"Daddy, dear," implored Sonny, tugging at his coat suggestively.
"Oh, the devil take the story!" shouted the musician; "didn't I tell you she never had a
     daddy? Don't ask so many questions, Sonny."
The big blue eyes became tearful at the unusual tone of anger and at the untimely end of the
     story, and Digby's conscience smote him a little.
"I aren't crying, only little girls cry," gasped the child between his hardly suppressed
     sobs. "I was only just thinking, daddy, what a welly funny booful lady she were, daddy."
"Yes, my son," said the musician, very much in the tone of respect he would have used to a
     man of his own age who was battling with some terrible grief, "yes, my son, she was a very
     funny beautiful lady, so funny that daddy could not understand her at all, although he loved
     her so much. And she laughed at daddy, and wouldn't be kind to him, though she was kind to the
     whole world besides."
The musician almost choked with his own emotion this time; but Sonny jumped up and down with
     glee at having at last discovered a human chord in the mythical beautiful lady.
"Oh, so she were a naughty booful lady, daddy? Then she won't have jam for tea next
     Sunday, will she, daddy dear?"
The wooden door that led into the yard creaked open again, and again the red light from the
     setting sun flooded the little room.
"Yes, Sonny, of course, she was a naughty beautiful lady, that's just what she was! But do
     you know I've come back to say that I won't be naughty any more just yet, at least if daddy
     lets me, and I'm going to be kind to him—at least, if daddy wants me. Daddy, do say something.
     May I be good for a change, and will you let me be kind to you? I've come to say I am sorry,
     like a good little girl; and—I may have jam for tea next Sunday, mayn't I? Oh, daddy, do say
     something, and don't look so doleful! Don't you understand? I was wrong, and you were right,
     and—oh, how stupid it all is! Why—daddy—I—I don't believe you want me now!"
And Lady Joan flung herself into the old high-backed wooden settle, and crossed her feet, and
     broke into her maddening, mocking laugh as if to hide something she was ashamed of showing. But
     the musician, who knew her better than she thought he did, in spite of his almost childish
     ignorance of woman's nature, went up to her and put the child on her lap, and smiled down into
     her upturned, laughing face.
"We both want our beautiful lady, don't we, Sonny? And may I make my confession too, Lady
     Joan? I was not sure that I did want you so desperately after you sent me away just now. But I
     found that I did directly you opened the door and the sunshine came in, and I can never do
     without you again. But it is better to understand one another at starting, isn't it?"
"Much better. And ideals are such bosh when we have grown out of our short frocks. So the
     understanding is quite complete; you don't know how much you love me, so we will call it
     desperately, and I don't know how much I love you, so we will call it desperately too. You have
     been in love shoals of times before, and I—well, I am capable of falling in love with some one
     else on my wedding-day. So neither of us will be disappointed if it does not answer, but we
     have agreed to try. Hey-day, what fun it is! The lonely lady at the Court marrying the musician
     at the inn; the lady has the establishment, and the musician has the money to keep it up: if
     you were truly modern you would have both, and be a risen cabinet-maker. Relton will have
     enough to talk about for a year. But you will not behave as if we were engaged, just
     yet, will you? I—I don't feel as if I could quite stand it; do you understand?"
He had never heard her voice falter like that before, and he nodded to show that he quite
     understood. But she sprang to her feet with one of her quick gestures before he had time to
     realize the intoxicating feeling of that moment, and he experienced a sensation of chill.
"What wickedness to keep this child up so late; come along, Sonny lad, I told Nanny that I
     would put you to bed for a treat, and daddy is going to stay here and smoke his pipe."
And she vanished up the primitive staircase which led straight from the parlor up to the room
     above; and daddy was left somewhat with the feeling of having consented to Lady Joan's
     suggestion of marriage without receiving the right to kiss her, and he sat by the window again
     and looked among the fruit-trees, and called himself the happiest man in the world, and felt
     that he would be able to write his Swinburne song when the house was quiet.
A third time the wooden door creaked, and a third time the red sunlight filled the room. But
     the musician did not notice it, for he was still looking out of the window into the orchard,
     and he was telling himself with a sense of profound relief that his engagement was at last
     going right.
There was the sound of a low, soft, glad cry in the little inn parlor, and something glided
     in noiselessly, hesitated for a moment, and then sped across the ray of light to where he sat
     by the window. And the musician turned his eyes away from the fruit-trees then, and fixed them
     on the apparition before him, and a look of dumb amazement began to creep slowly over his
     face.
"Digby, I've come at last. You said you would not mind waiting ten years for me, and it has
     only been one; yet, oh! such a weary long one to me, Digby! But it has not been my fault, it
     hasn't really, dear; they never told me, and papa stopped your two first letters, and Roger
     Brill—it was Roger, wasn't it?—never brought me the last one at all. It was all a mistake, I
     can't tell you now, but I found it out and gave them the slip, and came straight here. Oh,
     Digby, you are not angry with me, are you? I never meant to keep you waiting so, but I did not
     find it all out till yesterday, so I could not come before. Oh, it has been so sad, waiting for
     you. And I have been so ill too, Digby; they did not know what was the matter with me, but
      I knew all the time. It is all over now, though, and we are going to be happy at
     last, aren't we? And may I have my kiss now, the one you promised me? I think if you had kissed
     me before I went away I should never have been ill. But I am going to be happy now, so happy.
     Oh, Digby, I feel so greedy over my happiness that I am frightened of its slipping away again.
     Is it because I have startled you that you are so silent? Tell me you are not angry with me,
     Digby,—and—when may I have my kiss, please?"
He took her mechanically into his arms and kissed the mouth that was held up to him, and he
     experienced dully the sort of shock that an unconventional man feels when a woman he has always
     considered the type of purity does something which a woman of the world would know better than
     to risk her reputation by doing. Upstairs, in the room overhead, he could hear Lady Joan
     singing his child to sleep. He passed his hand across his brow and wondered in a vague sort of
     way how it was all going to end; it seemed years since Lady Joan had spoken to him.
"No, Norah child, of course I am not angry with you; how could any one be that? But—"
"I don't mind anything if you are not angry with me. Only, why are you so quiet? Have you
     been suffering too, Digby; haven't they been kind to you?"
"Who? the fates? No, I fancy they have not been kind to me. Did you come alone, childie?"
"I came with old nurse; she is at the station. Digby, tell me, have you been ill?"
"No, I have not been ill; I have been working rather hard, and perhaps worrying as well.
     Forgive me, dear; you must own it is all rather startling?"
She put her arms round him, and laughed her low, soft laugh; and he writhed at the contrast
     it made to Lady Joan's loud mocking one, which still rang in his ears.
"Of course it is; I feel as if I had begun to live all over again after being asleep in a
     cold, dark place ever since last year. Have you ever felt like that, Digby? Oh, I have never
     asked after Sonny; how is he? Has he gone to bed? May I go up and kiss him?"
"No, stay here," he said vehemently, and then bit his moustache savagely when she opened her
     great eyes at him; and he added in a quieter tone, "he is quite bonny, but we—we won't disturb
     him yet. There is a lady with him who—who has been kind to me, and—and she will be coming down
     perhaps—"
"A lady? Oh, I see," wonderingly. "I am glad she has been kind to you—very. Do you like
     her?"
Should he tell her then? It was not yet absolutely necessary.
"Yes, I like her," he said in a toneless voice, and he forced himself to smile reassuringly
     at her.
"I should like to see her, then. Hark, she is coming downstairs; how merry she is, your
     friend!" as the full healthy laugh came down the stairs.
If there had been any means, however desperate, of putting off the crisis for another ten
     seconds, the musician would have stooped to it. But he realized that there was none, and with
     the same flash of consciousness as he realized it he braced himself to meet the event as
     manfully as such a pitiful situation would allow.
"Norah," he said sternly, putting her off his knee and standing up in front of her, "I have
     something to say to you. Will you be brave and hear me? It may all come right, of course,
     but—this lady was kind to my boy—and to me, when no one else would hold out a hand to us; and I
     thought you had forgotten me, and so—I asked her to marry me. It was only this afternoon, and
     of course—"
The noisy peals of laughter came right into the room through the inner door, and Lady Joan
     stood in the dull glow which was all that remained of the sunlight.
"Oh, daddy, what do you think Sonny said? Why—who—what is it?"
Something white, and quivering, and small, had fallen with a thud across her feet, and again
     the low, long child's cry with the joy gone out of it sounded in the stillness of the summer
     evening.
The musician had sunk on a chair with his face in his hands.
