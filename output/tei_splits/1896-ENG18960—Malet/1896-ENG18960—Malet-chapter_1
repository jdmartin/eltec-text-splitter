CHAPTER I
FEW persons (Hammond said) are truthful; yet the complete and experienced liar is
      rare. A really great lie, whether acted or spoken, is the supreme expression of a nature. It
      is an inspiration of genius. I make my bow to it with my hand on my heart. And all this
      reminds me of a man whom I once knew called Leversedge—Constantine Leversedge. For although he
      told, consciously at all events, no lies, he was intimately involved in the telling of one of
      a really superior order. And a young lady, eminently distinguished for the ripeness of her
      modernity, was involved in it also.
I met Leversedge in London once in a way. Then he would disappear for an indefinite period,
      to return—very long and lean and brown—furnished with a vocabulary floridly rich in abusive
      epithets applicable to South African society. He
       had business, as I understood, in those savage regions. And
      it must have proved remunerative, for he gave an increasing impression of prosperity each time
      I saw him. But whether it consisted in exploiting the aborigines, digging for diamonds,
      pulling the tail feathers out of live ostriches, or undertaking dental operations on dead
      elephants, I never exactly knew. He grew rich, voilà tout;
      and he really was a charming fellow, though his appearance always seemed to imply the near
      neighbourhood of a horse—a thing which I, personally, find slightly irritating. For I have no
      drop of the blood of the Centaurs in me. I gravitate naturally, as you may say, to my own feet
      or to wheels. So that a being half equine, as are so many of the members of our great race,
      produces in me an annoying sense of the limitations of my opportunities.
This, however, is a digression.—It remains that this man Leversedge had just that hint of a
      stoop about the shoulders, indolent fashion of moving, and slightly distracted look across the
      eyes and brow which riding-men so frequently have. He had more legs, too, than are absolutely
      requisite in civilised society. I may mention, in passing, that he was delightfully clean;
      that his almost black beard was neatly trimmed, while his moustache, which was a quite bright
      brown, stood rather gallantly away from it. Had you
       arrayed him in white ruff and trunk-hose he would have made
      an admirable Elizabethan adventurer. Pardon these details, since it is necessary to the
      appreciation of what follows that you should see the creature “in his habit as he lived.”
The last time I met Leversedge was at a large summer hotel on the Lake of Geneva. It is a
      very commendable dwelling-place,—according to the style of such things,—situated in several
      acres of garden that stretch down to and along the lake shore. I abstain from localising it
      more particularly, for Leversedge's is not a name to conjure with there. Quite unintentionally
      he spoilt the manager's season for him. Even the British and American tourist, matter-of-fact
      animal though it is, has its superstitions. My friend's eccentric action aroused them, aroused
      them to the extent of making the owners of them run away. For he caused life suddenly to dip
      to the tragic level—a thoughtless thing to do at any time, an almost criminal one at a summer
      hotel.
But I am getting the cart before the horse. All that came later. Immediately, Leversedge
      appeared to be in the very heyday of success. He had attained. He had made his pile. The
      elephants and ostriches and South Africans, white or black, had receded into the Great Inane.
      The diamonds had receded also, saving and excepting the considerable store of those
       delightful stones that he had brought along with him, and
      destined for the delectation and adornment of his bride. For Leversedge's tastes were
      innocent, innocent to the point of matrimony. He was engaged to a young lady, by name Miss
      Charlotte Perry,—playfully addressed by her father in moments of expansion as “carissima Carlotta mia,”—had been so engaged for quite a number of
      years. Now he was about to marry her, a proceeding which, subject to the fact of a protracted
      engagement, really touches the high-water mark of innocence, doesn't it?
The Perry parents, I regret to say, struck me as leaving something to be desired. Leversedge
      had offered to take the best suite of rooms in the house for them; and they had, perhaps
      consequently, shown considerable alacrity in coming this far to meet him on his homeward
      journey.
They were a rather dusty-looking couple. He a voracious, adhesive little rat of a man, with
      a lop-sided way of walking, a coat-collar insufficiently brushed at all times, and a waistcoat
      to match after meals. He smiled upon one ravenously; and told many stock stories of witty
      bishops and Conservative politicians, giving his audience to understand he had himself
      invariably acted Horatio to the Hamlet of these good and great men. Mrs. Perry was in another
      style. Dusty too, but round-about and kindly; of an
       expansive, middle-class figure, and a countenance resembling
      a moon on a clock-face. A suburban moon, be it added, of the very honestest sort, wholly
      unsymbolic of the worship of Artemis or Astarte, without phases, standing ever at a guileless
      full. But if in outward aspect this worthy pair was divided, in sentiment they were one—in as
      far, at least, as sentiment related to their fair daughter; for they reverenced her as the
      supreme expression of their highest selves. And there was something genuinely touching in the
      whole-heartedness of that reverence, in their whispered confidences regarding the effect of
      her beauty, the widespread recognition of her talents, the brilliancy of her social successes.
      If one might accept the witness of these good parents, the life of London, intellectual and
      artistic, pulsed with profounder colour and thrilled into more vigorous effort when Charlotte
      Perry passed along. According to them, Walter Creighton extolled her pastels, and even that
      harshest of critics, James Colthurst, praised her draughtsmanship; while Zeltingen had been
      heard, more than once, to protest that if she played in public his reputation as a pianist
      would be completely gone. At Adolphus Carr's Wednesday afternoons she was a more than welcome
      guest; and Mrs. Septimus Mertyns, the wife of the distinguished Q.C., whose drawing-rooms in
      Portland Place so perpetually
       reverberate to the roarings of lions young and old, could not
      be happy without her. Given dearest Lotta to help, she is reported to have declared herself
      equal to entertaining the Immortals of all ages—without distinction of race, creed, or
      sex—and, what is more, of making a success of the affair.
From all of which it may assuredly be gathered that this accomplished young lady had been
      designed by nature to fill some notable niche in contemporary history. And that provoked a
      little inward questioning as to whether she was equally designed by nature to be the contented
      wife of Constantine Leversedge, with his distracted brow, and long legs, and probably very
      ordinary, primitive view of the marital relation.
The thermometer, I remember, stood rather persistently at 90° in the shade that summer,—a
      condition of the atmosphere which disposes one to the exclusive observation of objects in the
      immediate foreground, easily within the range of vision, that can be contemplated without the
      breaking of a decent repose, without the unlovely heatings of physical exertion. And
      therefore, I suppose, I began to observe the Perry-Leversedge drama rather closely. It was
      under my hand. Daily it was round about me. At first the action was languid. Suddenly
      unexpected elements introduced themselves into the piece.
