CHAPTER VI
THE dark is all very well. The dark may even prove a friend; at times I have found
      it so myself. But this was not one of those times, and somehow I mistrusted the events of the
      last few minutes; neither Gerarrd's action or our fair Charlotte's had appeared to me quite
      spontaneous. I reproved myself for my eternal cavilling where these two persons were
      concerned; yet I remained impressed with the feeling that his request had been curiously
      insistent, her granting of it curiously elaborate.
And then, the darkened room unquestionably wore a somewhat sinister aspect, by no means
      calculated to dispel uncomfortable suspicions, however foolish and unfounded such suspicions
      might be. The electric lights on the terrace threw a vague, stark sort of brightness, crossed
      by equally vague bluish shadows, upon the ceiling, upon portions of the wall above the piano,
      and upon the edges of the furniture near the window. The shadow of the ironwork of the balcony
      lay along the floor, twisted and contorted by the opposing
       angles of the lamps below. Otherwise the room and its
      contents were colourless and indistinct.
As Miss Perry's fingers touched the keys again, I placed myself on the sofa left vacant by
      her mother's departure to the connubial chamber. The silk-covered pillows, that had supported
      that good lady's back and promoted her unaristocratic tendency towards slumber, had now
      slipped down on to the seat. The crumpled surface of the upper one and the frill of it caught
      the light. Leversedge stepped back on to the balcony. He stood there, his left shoulder
      resting against the woodwork of the window-frame. His face was turned towards the darkened
      room; but I had a sense it bore an expression of exaltation, the exaltation of something
      successfully dared and won. The man was generous to a fault. Generosity communicates a
      pleasant glow to the whole person. I have been generous myself just often enough to know that
      one's first sensation is delicious, as is the first moment after jumping out of a cold bath. I
      have, also, observed you need subsequently to rub yourself very hard if you would retain
      either the moral or spiritual sensation of warmth. The tonic has been a trifle too strong, a
      reaction follows. These thoughts passed through my mind as I looked up at Leversedge, and in
      doing so became aware that his lean, well-made figure—showing black against the purple depth of
       the night sky—was surrounded, like the cushions and carved
      woodwork of the sofa immediately below him, by a pale luminous outline.
Charlotte Perry played that nocturne—I stupidly forget the number of it—with a tenderness
      beyond all praise. I murmured something of my very genuine admiration, the most rudimentary
      taste forbidding, to my thinking, at all pronounced applause. Gerrard, however, uplifted his
      voice without hesitation. He belongs to a set—the Mrs. Septimus Mertyns set—in which endless
      discussion is fashionable, and a hundred and one wise reasons are offered in justification of
      even the most trivial personal opinion. He spoke languidly, yet loud. He intended us to
      hear.
“Thanks,” he said, “you have surpassed yourself. I fancy that unconsciously you have done
      more. We were speaking of self-revelation just now. Surely, in your rendering of that
      delicious thing, you permitted yourself to draw away a veil from your own soul, and, for those
      who have ears to hear and eyes to see, in a measure revealed your deepest self!”
Leversedge moved slightly.
“The spiritual element in that nocturne is definite, it speaks directly to my religious
      instinct,” he continued. “But the spiritual element is not the only one, for the sentiment as
      a whole is marvellously complex. That is what renders
       it so profoundly interesting. The religious emotion in its
      simple expression is always joyous, isn't it?”
“I think so,” the girl answered softly.
“I am sure that it is,” Gerrard asserted. “Recalling the hours when I have been most deeply
      conscious of the magnetism of the Divine Idea, I recognise that they were hours of unalloyed
      joyousness.”
I hugged myself silently at the thought of Gerrard of all men on earth, Percy Gerrard,
      author of Leda's Lover, and editor of the Present Day, with his
      lethargic temperament and gift of heavy feeding, in a condition of unalloyed joyousness,
      thanks to the magnetism of the Divine Idea!
“But here, notwithstanding the presence of true spirituality, I find little gladness. I am
      aware, indeed, throughout of a tremor of intense and vital melancholy. You were aware of that
      also, Miss Perry; and you intended to convey it to your hearer?”
“Ah yes!” she answered, again softly.
Leversedge shifted his position.
“I knew it!” exclaimed Gerrard. “Your dramatic instinct, of course, is strong, since you
      possess in so remarkable a degree the artistic temperament. But, knowing you as well as I am
      learning to know you, I can rapidly detect where
       you draw upon the comparative shallows of the dramatic
      instinct, and where upon the deeps of living personal experience.”
“The deuce you can!” said Leversedge, under his breath.
“May I try, will you grant me permission to try, to construe your thought?”
Gerrard still addressed himself with rather ostentatious exclusiveness to Miss Perry; but he
      still spoke quite loud, his voice cracking up now and again into the shrillest and most
      unengaging treble. It had the effect of a challenge as delivered by a cockerel, none too
      certain of his own prowess or of his footing, from the top of a wall. His manner and the
      subject of his discourse, in short, were quite ironically at variance.
“To me it seems you found in that nocturne, and gave in your rendering of it, the
      melancholy, not of a rejected soul—far from that—but rather of one who, after long struggle,
      has sacrificed the consummation of terrestrial happiness in obedience to the compelling
      dominion of some moral idea; and who, looking back, momentarily gauges the immensity, I had
      almost said, the enormity of such a sacrifice.”—He paused, trying, as I imagined, to gain more
      mastery over his wandering voice.—“Yes, your reading was richly subtle, richly pathetic. I too
      can figure that broken melody,
       those searching harmonies, which seem to vibrate through
      the secret places of one's most innermost being, as the utterance of some exquisite woman,
      artist by nature, saint through the constraining power of adverse circumstance, as she
      realises for some brief but hideous instants the eternal anguish, the glory of her own
      self-dedication.”
“It's all very fine, I daresay,” Leversedge said; “but, upon my honour, if this sort of
      thing goes on the kicking will have to take place sooner than I expected.”
Gerrard turned towards us, his face projecting itself as a livid platelike object from the
      encompassing obscurity.
“I beg your pardon, I did not quite catch what you were saying, Mr. Leversedge; you were
      good enough to remark?”
“Oh! my remark will keep until a more convenient season,” the other answered. “When that
      season arrives I shall have the greatest pleasure, I assure you, in repeating it with
      appropriate action.”
But here Charlotte Perry's hands most opportunely descended with a crash upon the piano.
The young lady's melting mood seemed to have passed, giving place to a very different
      humour. What she played during the ensuing ten to fifteen minutes I do not know. I never heard
      it before; I am more than willing never to
       hear it again. I suppose it must have been a tarantella,
      but a tarantella conceived in a madhouse. It gave me a nightmarish impression of innumerable
      tormented, shrieking, human figures whirling in a desperate and formless dance—driven hither
      and thither in purposeless fashion, like desert sand by an evil wind. It was exciting, for it
      took one into the region of utter lawlessness; and that region is always exciting, however
      undesirable. This was decidedly exciting, but it was not quite nice.
Miss Perry lent herself whole-heartedly to the spirit of the music. I trust I am far from
      being a prude, but there are limits, and she passed them. Her playing was not quite nice.
      Perhaps, therefore,—I have confessed to a dislike of the man,—it stirred Gerrard's somewhat
      sluggish blood. I watched him rise, and move slowly close to the side of the grand piano,
      facing the girl as she played—his squat person a blot of deeper darkness against the dark.
Leversedge made a movement also. I fancied he did not relish the performance, and was going
      out on to the balcony to escape somewhat from it; but he merely stepped into the middle of the
      window, while his shadow, crossing that of the iron balustrade, lay right along the carpet of
      the room almost to where the skirt of Miss Perry's light dress trailed back from the music
      stool.

The music grew in vehemence and force, in violence of discordant sounds; while the human
      figures it conjured up before me seemed to become more wanton in the passion of their
      dance.
The thing was unpleasant. I wished it would stop. It affected me uncomfortably, it agitated
      me. I could not remain quite still. I began fidgetting with the scalloped frills of good Mrs.
      Perry's puce silk pillows, while I meditated upon the extraordinary divergence of nature
      exhibited by the mother and daug hter. Kindly and estimable clock-moon! by what strange
      workings of heredity had she contrived to produce this young creature, possessed as she just
      now appeared to be, by the spirit of a fin de siècle
      Bacchante?
Just then Leversedge spoke. He was close to me. His voice was hoarse.—“Hammond,” he said,
      “would you mind keeping your hand away from that cushion?”
I looked up at him in some surprise. He had turned sideways and the light took his profile.
      His face had changed notably in the last few minutes. It had grown thin, and, as once before,
      his lips stood away from his teeth.
“By all means, my dear fellow,” I answered, “if you wish it. But why? Is anything the
      matter?”
“The dog's the matter,” Leversedge said quietly. “It's sitting on that cushion. It's just
      jumped up.”

I glanced at the cushion and then back at Leversedge. For an instant I doubted whether he
      was chaffing; though, considering our former discourses upon this subject, it occurred to me
      as improbable he should indulge in so grim a joke at his own expense. But that one glance
      assured me very completely he was very far from chaffing. I debated inwardly what could be
      done—whether it was possible to demonstrate convincingly to Leversedge, once and for all, that
      he laboured under an hallucination. But the wicked spirit which infected Miss Perry's playing,
      and expressed itself in that chaotic clamour, still agitated me and rendered it difficult to
      me to think clearly. I am afraid I made a disastrous mistake. If I did so, let it be put down,
      in part at all events, to the Witches' Sabbath of sound assailing my ears and plaguing my
      brain, and not exclusively to my inborn stupidity.
“Believe me, you are dreaming,” I said. “I give you my word there is nothing whatever upon
      that cushion.”
“I am not lying, anyhow,” Leversedge answered rather hastily. “You are behind it, so of
      course you can't see. Come round—stand here—now look.”
So, to humour him I got up and stood beside him, while Charlotte Perry played, still
      played.
“There now,” he went on,—“now you can see its
       eyes. You must see them; they're plain enough, I'm sure.
      And look how the silk of the cushion gives under the beast's haunches and under its
      forefeet.”
And I stared obediently,—at what? Merely the little crumples left by the impress of good
      Mrs. Perry's solid shoulders—little wandering lines of light, that appeared to me as
      abundantly pathetic, abundantly absurd, taken in connection with the supernatural horror whose
      presence they were declared to indicate.
“Heaven forbid I should seem to call your veracity in question,” I exclaimed; “but, indeed,
      I see nothing. My dear friend, you are the victim of an optical or cerebral delusion—I suppose
      the two mean much the same thing—as I have told you all along. No dog, no nothing, is there,
      and I can prove it to you.”
Certainly Leversedge never showed to better advantage than under extreme pressure. If his
      courtesy failed for an instant, he recovered speedily and very gracefully. Now his lips gave,
      and he smiled at me in that singularly longsuffering way of his.
“I am afraid not, though I wish to goodness you could,” he said. “No, no; for mercy's sake
      don't touch it!” His voice dropped.—“It smells—the brute—to-night it smells—your hands will
      never feel clean again.”

I own it required a little nerve, for I was shaken by that violent and ceaseless music, and
      Leversedge's tone and manner were calculated to produce faith in the most sceptical mind;
      still, I did sweep my hand down slowly over the surface of the cushion. And, of course, it
      encountered no resistance. How could it, since, as I had affirmed, nothing, absolutely
      nothing, was there?
“You see,” I said.
He shook his head.
“It got away; it jumped down,” he replied. “Anyhow, I am thankful you did not touch it.”
Argument is wasted upon a man in this frame of mind. Yet I was pushed by the desire to
      convince him. I paused, asking myself what on earth I could do or say next. Meanwhile Miss
      Perry's playing became slower, more broken, full of wailing; as though the dance had changed
      to a Danse Macabre, and Death was breaking their ranks,
      bearing away or beating down those lawless dancers. Gerrard moved a little nearer, he bent
      over and talked to the girl, the occasionally shrill tones of his voice, which still appeared
      to be under insufficient control, mingling oddly with her playing.
Suddenly a cry—it was exceedingly dreadful, it turned me cold and sick—broke in through the
      rhythm of the music, and Leversedge rushed past me across the room. The train of Charlotte
       Perry's dress lay out pale over the floor; and he kicked
      it, stamped on it, trampled it under foot. The music stopped with a harsh discord, and,
      without rising, the girl turned half round on the music stool, stretching out her hands as
      though to save herself and push him from her.
“Constantine, Constantine, what has happened? Pray calm yourself. What are you doing?” she
      demanded.
For all answer he took her up bodily in his arms,—I had no conception the man was so
      strong,—shook her, as you might shake out a handkerchief on which a spider or some other
      noxious insect was crawling; carried her right out on to the balcony into the full glare of
      the electric light; and stood there holding her close against him as he might have held a
      child.
“My sweet,” I heard him say, his voice broken by emotion; “my sweet, forgive me. I am so
      rough, I must seem to you such a brute. But that vile thing took refuge beside you. It was
      upon your gown,—it was upon your knees. I saw its eyes here—oh! my God, my God, the
      unspeakable desecration of it—its hateful head was against your dear bosom.”
Leversedge's voice sank away into a whisper. He kissed the girl's eyes, her throat, as she
      lay in his arms. And then suddenly, as it seemed, recollecting himself, he set her down very gently
       on her feet, and turned round with a terrible face upon
      Percy Gerrard, who stood nearest the window.
“Go,” he said, “you are not wanted here. We have had too much of you all along.”
The distinguished journalist retired in some haste; he was not by nature a fire-eater—save
      on paper. I followed him. The girl was safe, and, for the rest, I wanted neither to hear nor
      see more. Indeed, I had heard and seen too much already. It is hardly decent to witness the
      outcry of a fellow-creature in such awful straits. The joys of the Puritan, in heaven, are
      multiplied sevenfold by listening to the cries of the damned which reach him from across the
      Great Gulf; but I am not made of such iron stuff that my personal comfort is enchanced by
      articulate misery on the part of others. I am afraid I advanced rather unceremoniously upon
      Percy Gerrard.
“Here are matches,” I said; “for pity's sake help me light the candles, and then disappear
      as soon as possible.”
Gerrard's nerves appeared to have suffered. His squat hands fumbled awkwardly with the box
      of matches as he tried to strike them, and his smooth hair looked positively dank.
“The man is insane,” he quavered. “I told her so. I knew it.”
“Mr. Hammond!”—Charlotte Perry clutched my arm.

During the extraordinary scene we had just assisted at she had behaved with really
      magnificent composure, neither calling out nor struggling. I could not but admire her courage.
      She was composed still; but she gripped me like a vice, the points of her fingers digging
      themselves into my arm, while her pretty face was blanched and sharpened. The maternal element
      was wholly banished. The rat had it all his own way; and what a rat—strong, astute, almost
      alarming!
“Remember you are bound to obey me,” she said; “you have promised, and I hold you to your
      promise.”
Gerrard came close to her.
“I was not mistaken, you see,” he murmured.
Charlotte Perry looked at him for a moment with the strangest expression.
“Good-night,” she said. Then she addressed me again. “My parents must know nothing of what
      has just taken place. You must be silent; you understand—absolutely silent. And you must leave
      us, please. You cannot help now except by being silent. Later, perhaps,—good-night.”
