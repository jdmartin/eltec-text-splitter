CHAPTER TWELVE
JOAN WALKS HOME
While John Barren determined that a space of time extending over some days should now
      separate him from Joan, she, for her part, had scarce left Gorse Point after the conversation
      just chronicled when there came a great longing in her heart to return thither. As she walked
      home she viewed wearily the hours which lay between her and the following morning when she
      might go back to him and see his face again. Time promised to drag for the next day and night.
      Already she framed in her mind the things her mouth should say to-morrow; and that almost
      before she was beyond sight of the man's easel. Her fears had vanished with her tears. The
      future was entirely in his hand now, for she had accepted his teaching, endeavored to look at
      life with his eyes, made his God her own, so far as she had wit to gather what his God was.
      She accepted the situation with trust, and felt responsibility shifted on to "Mister Jan's"
      shoulders with infinite relief. He was very wise and knew everything and loved the truth. It
      is desirable to harp and harp upon this ever-recurring thought: the artist's grand love for
      truth; because all channels of Joan's mind flowed into this lake. His sincerity begat absolute
      trust. And, as John Barren and his words and thoughts filled the foreground of life for her,
      so, correspondingly, did the affairs of her home, with all the circumstances of existence in
      the old environment, peak and dwindle toward shadowy insignificance. Her father lost his
      majestic proportions; the Luke Gospelers became mere objects for compassion; the petty,
      temporal interests and concerns of the passing hour appeared mere worthless affairs for the
      occupation and waste of time. "Mister Jan" loved her, and she loved him, and what else
      mattered? Past hours of unrest and wakefulness were forgotten; her tears washed the dead
      anxieties clean away; and the kiss which had caused them, though it scorched her lip when it
      fell there, was now set as a seal and a crowning glory to her life. He never kissed any other
      woman. That pledge of this rare man's affection had been won by the magic of love, and Joan
      welcomed Nature gladly and called it God with a warm heart and thankful soul; for Nature had
      brought about this miracle. Her former religion worked no wonders; it had only conveyed terror
      to her and a comprehensive knowledge of hell. "Mister Jan" smiled at hell and she could laugh
      at her old fears. How was it possible to hesitate between two such creeds? She did not do so,
      and, with final acceptation of the new, and secret rejection of the old, came a great peace to
      Joan's heart with the whisper of many voices telling her that she had done rightly.
So the storm gave place to periods of delicious calm and content only clouded by a longing
      to be back with the artist again. He loved her; the voice of his love was the song of the
      spring weather, and the thrush echoed it and the early flowers wrote it on the hedgerows. God
      was everywhere to her open eyes. Everything that was beautiful, everything that was good,
      seemed to have been created for her delight during that homeward walk. She was mightily lifted
      up. Nature seemed so strong, so kind, such a guardian angel for a maiden. And the birds sang
      out that "Mister Jan" was Nature's priest and could do no wrong; and that to obey Nature was
      the highest good.
From which reflection rose a hazy happinessâ€”dim, beautiful and indefinable as the twinkling
      gold upon the sea under the throne of the sun. Joan dwelt on the memory of the day which was
      now over for her, and on the thought of morning hours which to-morrow would bring. But she
      looked no further; and backward she did not gaze at all. No thought of Joe Noy dimmed her
      mental delight; no shadowy cloud darkened the horizon then. All was bright, all perfect. Her
      mind seemed to be breaking its little case, as the butterfly bursts the chrysalis. Her life
      till then had been mere grub existence; now she could fly and had seen the sun drawing the
      scent from flowers. Great ideas filled her soul; new emotions awoke; she was like a baby
      trying to utter the thing he has no word for; her vocabulary broke down under the strain, and
      as she walked she gave thanks to Nature in a mere wordless song, like the lark, because she
      could not put her acknowledgment into language. But the great Mother, to whom Life is all in
      all, the living individual nothing, looked on at a world wakening from sleep and viewed the
      loves of the flowers and the loves of the birds and beasts and fishes with concern as keen as
      the love in the blue eyes of Joan upon her homeward way.
Busy indeed at this vernal season was the mysterious Nurse of God's little world. Her hands
      rested not from her labors. She worked strange wonders on the waste, by magic of a million
      breaking buds, by burying of the dead, by wafting of subtle pollen-life from blossom to
      blossom. And in cliffs above the green waters the nests of her wild-fowl were already lined
      with wool and feather; neither were her samphires forgotten in their dizzy habitations; and
      salt spray sprinkled her uncurling sea ferns in caves and crannies where they grew. She
      laughed at the porpoises rolling their fat sides into sunshine; she brought the sea-otter
      where it should find fish for its young; she led giant congers to drowned men; she patted the
      sleek head of the sad-eyed seal. Elsewhere she showed the father-hawk a leveret crouching in
      his form; she took young rabbits to the new spring grass; the fox to the fowl, the fly to the
      spider, the blight to the bud. Her weakly nestlings fell from tree and cliff to die, but she
      beheld unmoved; her weasel sucked the gray-bird's egg, yet no hand was raised against the
      thief, no voice comforted the screaming agony of the mother. With the van of her legions she
      moved, and the suffering stragglers cried in vain, for her concerns were not with them. She
      did no right, she worked no evil; she was not cruel, neither shall we call her kind. The
      servant of God was she, then as always, heedful of His utterances, obedient to His laws. Which
      laws, when man better divines, he shall learn thy secret too, Nurse of the world, but not
      sooner.
