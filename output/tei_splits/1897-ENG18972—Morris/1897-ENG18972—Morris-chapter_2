 Chapter II ~ Now Shall Be Told of the House by the Water-Side 
Four days they wended the wood, and nought befell to tell of. The witch-wife (for even such
      was she) fed the stolen child well and duly, and whiles caressed her and spake sweetly unto
      her; whiles also she would take her out of the pannier, and set her on the assâ€™s back and hold
      her thereon heedfully; or, otherwhiles, when they came upon grassy and flowery places, she
      would set her down on the ground and let her roam about, and pluck the flowers and the
      strawberries. And whoso might be sorry, the child was glad, so many things new and fair as she
      came upon.
At last, when the fifth day was waning, and they had been a long while wending a wood set
      thick with trees, it began to grow grey betwixt the distant boles, and then from grey to
      white, and it was as if a new world of light lay before them. Thitherward went they, and in a
      little, and before the sun was set, came they to the shore of a great water, and thence was no
      more land to be seen before them than if it had been the main sea itself, though this was a
      sweet water. Albeit, less than a half mile from the shore lay two eyots, as it might have been
      on the salt sea; but one of these sat low down on the water, and was green and well bushed,
      but the other, which lay east of it, and was nigher to the shore, was high, rocky, and
      barren.
Now the ending of the wood left a fair green plain betwixt it and the water, whiles more
      than a furlong across, whiles much less; and whiles the trees came down close to the
      water-side. But the place whereas they came from out the wood was of the widest, and there it
      was a broad bight of greensward of the fashion of the moon seven nights old, and a close hedge
      of thicket there was at the back of it; and the lake lay south, and the wood north. Some deal
      of this greensward was broken by closes of acre-land, and the tall green wheat stood
      blossoming therein; but the most was sweet meadow, and there as now was a gallant flock of
      goats feeding down it; five kine withal, and a tethered bull. Through the widest of this
      meadow ran a clear stream winding down to the lake, and on a little knoll beside a lap of the
      said stream, two bow-shots from the water, was a knoll, whereon stood, amidst of a potherb
      garden, a little house strongly framed of timber. Before it the steep bank of the lake broke
      down into a slowly-shelving beach, whose honey-coloured sand thrust up a tongue in amongst the
      grass of the mead.
Went the witch-wife straight to the door of the said house as if she were at home, as was
      sooth indeed. She threw the door open, and unladed the ass of all his wares, and first of the
      youngling, whom she shook awake, and bore into the house, and laid safely on the floor of the
      chamber; nor did she wait on her wailing, but set about what was to be done to kindle fire,
      and milk a she-goat, and get meat upon the board. That did she, and fed both herself and the
      child plenteously: neither did she stint her of meat ever, from that time forward, however
      else she dealt with her.
