Chapter II ~ Birdalone Falleth in with New Friends
When she next awoke, the sun was not yet high, and the morning young, yet she stood upon her
      feet much refreshed by that short slumber. She turned toward the hill and the gay house, and
      saw one coming over the meadow to her, a woman to wit, in a shining golden gown, and as she
      drew nigh Birdalone could see that she was young and fair, tall, white-skinned and hazel-eyed,
      with long red hair dancing all about her as she tripped lightly and merrily over the
      greensward.
Now she comes up to Birdalone with wonder in her eyes, and greets her kindly, and asked her
      of her name, and Birdalone told it all simply; and the new-comer said: What errand hast thou
      hither, that thou art come thus naked and alone in this ill-omened ferry? Birdalone trembled
      at her words, though she spake kindly to her, and she said: It is a long story, but fate drave
      me thereto, and misery, and I knew not whither I was bound. But is there no welcome for me in
      this lovely land? I lack not deftness wholly; and I will be a servant of servants, and ask no
      better if it must be so. Said the new-comer: Unto that mayst thou come, but sore will be thy
      servitude. I fear me thy welcome here may be but evil. Said Birdalone: Wilt thou not tell me
      how so? Quoth that lady: We know thy ferry here, that it is the craft wherein cometh hither
      now and again the sister of our lady the Queen, into whose realm thou art now come, and who
      liveth up in the white palace yonder, and whom we serve. And meseems thou wilt not have come
      hither by her leave, or thou wouldst be in other guise than this; so that belike thou wilt be
      the runaway of thy mistress. Wherefore I fear that thou wilt be sent back to thy said mistress
      after a while, and that that while will be grievous to thee, body and soul.
Birdalone’s heart sank, and she was pale and trembling; but she said: O dear lady, might I
      then depart as I have come hither, without the wotting of this Queen! after thou hast given me
      a morsel of bread, for I am hungry. Said the gold-clad one, looking on her pitifully: Nay,
      maiden, I cannot choose but bring thee before our mistress, whereas most like she hath already
      seen thee from above there. For she is far-sighted beyond the wont of folk who be more
      manlike. But as for the bread, see thou! I have brought a manchet in my pouch, and cheese
      withal, as I came hurrying; for I thought, she will be hungry. And she reached the victual out
      to her. And Birdalone took it and kissed the golden lady’s hands, and she might not refrain
      her tears, but wept as she ate.
Meanwhile the golden lady spake unto her and said: Nevertheless, thou poor maiden, somewhat
      may be done for thine helping, and I will presently speak to my sisters thereon, who are, both
      of them, wiser than I. Sisters by blood are we not, but by love and fellowship. And I doubt
      not but that as we go up into the house we shall happen upon them in the garden. But now I
      look upon thee, how fair a woman art thou!
Thou art kind and friendly, said Birdalone, smiling amidst of her tears, might I know by
      what name to call so dear a woman? Thou shalt call me Aurea, said the other; and my next
      sister is Viridis, and the third, Atra; for that is according to the hues of our raiment, and
      other names we have not now. And lo! here cometh Viridis over the meadow.
Birdalone looked, and saw a woman coming toward them clad all in green, with a rose-wreath
      on her head. And she drew nigh, and greeted Birdalone kindly, and she also was a very
      beauteous woman; not great of body, whereas Aurea was tall and big-made, though excellently
      shapen. Light brown and goodly waved of hair was Viridis, her eyes brown, and rather long than
      great; her lips full and ruddy, her cheeks soft and sweet and smooth, and as rosy-tinted
      pearl; her hands small and delicate of fashion; her whole body soft-shapen as an egg; a kind,
      wheedling look her face bore.
When she had looked a while on Birdalone, she kissed her, and said: I would thou wert
      happier, for thou art beauteous, and all but the evil must love thee. Therewith she drew a
      cate from her pouch, and said: Eat somewhat, for thou wilt be hungry; and let us go meet our
      other sister, who is wiser than we.
So they went, all three of them, and came from off the meadow on to the garden-slopes, and
      at the entry thereof was come Atra to meet them; she was clad all in black, a tall, slim
      woman, with the grace of the willow-bough in the wind, with dark plenteous hair and grey
      hawk-eyes; her skin privet-white, with but little red in her cheeks. She also greeted
      Birdalone kindly, but sadly withal. She gave her strawberries to eat laid on a big kale-blade;
      and she said: Sisters, here are we hidden by the trees, and cannot be seen from the house;
      therefore we may sit here for a minute or two, while we talk together as to what may perchance
      be done for the helping of this unhappy maiden, who is so fair and lovely, and hath strayed
      into so ugly a trap. Then she said to Birdalone: Thou must know, poor wanderer, that this
      Queen, our mistress, who is sister to the Witch Under the Wood, is big and strong, well-made,
      and white-skinned, so that she deems herself a Queen of all beauty: keen-eyed is she to see a
      fly where others would see nought smaller than a coney; fine-eared withal; wise in wizardry;
      not altogether dull-witted, though she be proud, and crueller than the cruellest. But herein
      she faileth, that her memory is of the shortest for matters of the passing hour, albeit she
      remembers her spells and witch-songs over well. But other matters will scarce abide in her
      head for four and twenty hours. Wherefore, sisters, if we may keep this maiden out of her
      sight (after she hath seen her and given doom upon her) till the dead of tomorrow night, we
      may perchance do some good for her; and it is in my mind that then she may do good for us
      also.
Now they rejoiced in this word of Atra the wise; and Atra prayed Birdalone to tell them
      somewhat more of her story; and she told them much; but, whyso it were, she said nought
      concerning the wood-wife, whose outward semblance was the same as hers. Then they pitied her,
      and caressed her; but Atra said: We must tarry here no more, but go straight up to the lady,
      or maybe we shall lose all.
So they went their ways and came into the pleasance, and trod the sweet greensward betwixt
      the garland flowers and the beauteous trees; which now indeed, though Birdalone saw them all
      clear and over-clear, were become nought to her. Those three also spake gently to her, and now
      and then asked her somewhat, as if to show her that she was one of themselves; but she spake
      not, or answered at random, and to say sooth scarce heard their words: forsooth she was now
      become heart-sick, and was half dead for fear; and her nakedness, which would have troubled
      her little across the water, was now grown a shame and a terror unto her, and every deal of
      her body quivered with the anguish thereof.
