Chapter IV ~ Of the Witch’s Prison in the Wailing-Tower
Birdalone did as she was bidden, and the witch called unto her Atra, who came and stood
      humbly on the footpace beside her, and held converse with her mistress a while. Then she went
      backward from her a little, and then came to Birdalone, and in a somewhat harsh voice bade her
      come with her. Birdalone followed her, quaking, and they came out of the hall and into a long
      passage, which led to a wide stair winding round a newel; and all was builded exceeding fair,
      had Birdalone’s heart suffered her eyes to see it; but her flesh was weak, and quaked before
      the torment to come, so that her knees well-nigh failed her.
But now Atra lays a hand kindly on her shoulder and stays her, and says: Now meseems the
      walls of the Wailing–Tower, for so it hight, have no ears to hear, and we may talk together.
      Wottest thou why I have brought thee hither? Said Birdalone in a faint voice: Hast thou been
      bidden to whip me? And if I had been so bidden, dear maiden, said Atra laughing, nowise would
      I do it. Hold up thine heart! For all hath gone well so far, and now meseems betwixt us three
      we shall save thee.
Birdalone’s spirit came back to her at that word, and she put her hands to her face and fell
      a-weeping. But Atra was kind to her and made much of her; and she kissed her and wiped her
      tears, and Birdalone smiled again amidst her sobs, and she thanked Atra; who said to her:
      First of all I must tell thee that I am taking thee to prison by the witch’s bidding. Yea,
      said Birdalone, and what is prison? Said Atra: A prison is a grim place where poor folk who
      have done that which pleaseth not rich folk are shut up, that they may be grieved and
      tormented by not being able to fare abroad, or go where they would; and by suffering
      whatsoever their masters may lay upon them, as darkness, and cold, and hunger, and stripes.
      Somewhat so, or worse, our lady would have it for thee; but so would not we. Therefore for
      thee shall this prison be a place where thou shalt be safe till we may bring thee forth when
      the night hath worn towards its ending. For she will have forgotten thee by tomorrow; and this
      she knoweth; wherefore just now, when thou stoodest out of earshot, she was bidding me,
      amongst other matters, to bring thee before her tomorrow morning, and tell her the tale of
      thee, that she might call it to mind then what she had will to this morning.
Yea, said Birdalone, but will she not remember that she hath given thee a charge concerning
      me? But little thereof, said Atra, and with a few words I may easily confuse her memory so
      that speech thereon will fail her. Keep up thine heart, sweetling; but let us up this stair
      now forthwith, for I were fain to have thee hid away in this prison, and then will I down to
      her and tell her that thou art lying therein in all misery and terror, lest it come into her
      head to send for thee ere her memory is grown dim.
Again did Birdalone take heart, and they hastened a long way up the stair, till Atra stayed
      at last at a door all done with iron, endlong and over-thwart. Then she took a leash of keys
      from her girdle, one big and two little, and set the big one in the lock and turned it, and
      shoved the heavy door and entered thereby a chamber four-square and vaulted; and the vault was
      upheld by a pillar of red marble, wherein, somewhat higher than a man’s head, were set
      stanchions of latten, that could be clasped and unclasped. This chamber was in a way goodly,
      but yet grim to look on; for the walls were all of black ashlar stone close-jointed, and the
      floor black also, but of marble polished so wholly that it was as dark water, and gave back
      the image of Birdalone’s dear feet and legs as she went thereon. The windows were not small,
      and the chamber was light in every corner because of them, but they were so high up under the
      vaulting that none might see thereout aught save the heavens. There was nought in the chamber
      save a narrow bench of oak and three stools of the same, a great and stately carven chair
      dight with cushions of purple and gold, and in one corner a big oaken coffer.
Now spake Atra: This is our lady’s prison, and I fear me we cannot make it soft for thee,
      dear stranger. Yea, I must tell thee (and she reddened therewith) that it is part of my charge
      to set thee in irons. Birdalone smiled on her, and was over weary to ask what that meant,
      though she knew not. But Atra went to the big coffer and opened it and thrust in her hands,
      and there was a jangling therewith, and when she turned about to Birdalone again she had iron
      chains in her hands, and she said: This shameth me, dear friend; yet if thou wouldst wear them
      it might be well, for she may have a mind to go visit her prison, and if she find thee there
      unshackled she shall be wroth, and oftenest her wrath hath a whip in its hand. And these are
      the lightest that I might find.
Birdalone smiled again, and spake not, for she was very weary, and Atra did the irons on her
      wrists and her ankles; and said thereafter: Yet bear in mind that it is a friend that hath the
      key of these things. And now I will go away for a little, but I shall be on thine errands; for
      first I shall tell the mistress that thou art lying here shackled and in all wanhope; and
      next, by the will and command of her, I am to see that thou be well fed and nourished today
      that thou mayst be the stronger for tomorrow. Now if I may give thee rede, it is that thou
      forbear to open the coffer yonder; for ugly things shalt thou find there, and that may
      dishearten thee again.
Therewith she kissed her kindly on the cheek and went her ways, and the great key turned in
      the lock behind her.
There then was Birdalone left to herself; and she was over weary even to weep; true it is
      that she made a step or two towards the coffer, but reframed her, and took two of the pillows
      from the great chair and turned aside into the other corner, her chains jingling as she went.
      There she laid herself down, and nestled into the very wall-nook, and presently fell asleep,
      and slumbered dreamlessly and sweetly a long while.
