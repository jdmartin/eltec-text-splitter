 Chapter IV ~ Of the Waxing of the Stolen Child 
This little one, who is henceforth called Birdalone, though the witch called her but seldom
      so, nor indeed by any name, dwelt there betwixt the water and the wood, and saw none save the
      said witch-wife, who, as aforesaid, fed her well, but scarce meddled with her else for a long
      while; so she wandered well-nigh as she had will, and much in the wood; for she had no fear
      thereof, nor indeed of aught else save of the dame. She learned of the ways and the wont of
      all the creatures round about her, and the very grass and flowers were friends to her, and she
      made tales of them in her mind; and the wild things feared her in no wise, and the fowl would
      come to her hand, and play with her and love her. A lovely child she was, rosy and strong, and
      as merry as the birds on the bough; and had she trouble, for whiles she came across some ugly
      mood of the witch-wife, she bore it all as lightly as they.
Wore the years thus, till now she was grown tall and thin, and had seen twelve winters, and
      was far stronger and handier than at first sight she looked to be. That found her mistress,
      and would not forego the using of her deftness. For indeed the maiden knew all matters of wood
      and field full well, and somewhat of the water also (though no boat had she ever seen there),
      for she learned herself swimming, as the ducks do belike.
But now her mistress would learn her swinking, and hard was the lesson, for with twiggen
      rods and switches was she learned, and was somewhat stubborn with this woman, who she deemed
      loved her not; and, however it were, there began to grow in her an inkling that all was not
      well with the dame, and howsoever she might fear her, she trusted her not, nor worshipped her;
      otherwise she had learned her lesson speedily; for she was not slack nor a sluggard, and hated
      not the toil, even when it pained and wearied her, but against the anger and malice she
      hardened her heart.
It is to be said, that though there she dwelt alone with the witch-wife, she had somehow got
      to know that they two were not alone in the world, and she knew of male and female, and young
      and old. Thereof doubtless the witch herself had learned her, would she, would she not; for
      though she were mostly few-spoken, yet whiles the tongue of her would loosen, and she would
      tell Birdalone tales of men and women, and kings and warriors and thralls, and the folk of the
      world beyond them, if it were but to scare the child. Yea, and when she rated Birdalone, or
      girded at her, words would come forth which the maiden stored up, and by laying two and two
      together gat wisdom howso it were. Moreover, she was of the race of Adam, and her heart
      conceived of diverse matters from her mother’s milk and her father’s blood, and her heart and
      her mind grew up along with her body. Herein also was she wise, to wit, how to give wrath the
      go-by, so that she oft found the wood a better home than the house: for now she knew that the
      witch-wife would enter it never; wherefore she loved it much, and haunted it daily if she
      might.
Amidst all this she lived not unmerrily; for the earth was her friend, and solaced her when
      she had suffered aught: withal she was soon grown hardy as well as strong; and evil she could
      thole, nor let it burden her with misery.
