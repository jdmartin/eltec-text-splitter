 Chapter VI ~ Herein is Told of Birdalone’s Raiment 
Lank and long is Birdalone the sweet, with legs that come forth bare and browned from under
      her scant grey coat and scantier smock beneath, which was all her raiment save when the time
      was bitter, and then, forsooth, it was a cloak of goat-skin that eked her attire: for the dame
      heeded little the clothing of her; nor did Birdalone give so much heed thereto that she cared
      to risk the anger of her mistress by asking her for aught.
But on a day of this same spring, when the witch-wife was of sweeter temper than her wont
      was, and the day was very warm and kindly, though it was but one of the last of February days,
      Birdalone, blushing and shamefaced, craved timidly some more womanly attire. But the dame
      turned gruffly on her and said: Tush, child! what needeth it? here be no men to behold thee. I
      shall see to it, that when due time comes thou shalt be whitened and sleeked to the very
      utmost. But look thou! thou art a handy wench; take the deer-skin that hangs up yonder and
      make thee brogues for thy feet, if so thou wilt.
Even so did Birdalone, and shaped the skin to her feet; but as she was sewing them a fancy
      came into her head; for she had just come across some threads of silk of divers colours; so
      she took them and her shoon and her needle up into the wood, and there sat down happily under
      a great spreading oak which much she haunted, and fell to broidering the kindly deer-skin. And
      she got to be long about it, and came back to it the next day and the next, and many days,
      whenso her servitude would suffer it, and yet the shoon were scarce done.
So on a morning the dame looked on her feet as she moved about the chamber, and cried out at
      her: What! art thou barefoot as an hen yet? Hast thou spoilt the good deer-skin and art yet
      but shoeless? Nay, our lady, said Birdalone, but the shoon are not altogether done. Show them
      to me, said the dame.
Birdalone went to her little coffer to fetch them, and brought them somewhat timorously, for
      she knew not how her mistress would take her working on them so long, if perchance she would
      blame her, or it might be chastise her, for even in those days the witch-wife’s hand was
      whiles raised against her. But now when the dame took the shoes and looked on them, and saw
      how there were oak-leaves done into them, and flowers, and coneys, and squirrels, she but
      smiled somewhat grimly on Birdalone, and said: Well, belike thou art a fool to waste thy time
      and mine in such toys; and to give thee thy due would be to give thee stripes. But thou doest
      herein after the nature of earthly women, to adorn thy body, whatsoever else is toward. And
      well is that, since I would have thee a woman so soon as may be; and I will help thy mind for
      finery, since thou art so deft with thy needle.
Therewith she went to the big coffer and drew forth thence a piece of fine green cloth, and
      another of fine linen, and said to Birdalone: This mayest thou take, and make thee a gown
      thereof and a new smock, and make them if thou wilt as gay as thy new shoon are gotten to be;
      and here is wherewithal. And therewith she gave her two handfuls of silken threads and gold,
      and said: Now I suppose that I must do the more part of thy work, while thou art making thee
      these gaudy garments. But maybe someone may be coming this way ere long, who will deem the
      bird the finer for her fine feathers. Now depart from me; for I would both work for thee and
      me, and ponder weighty matters.
Who was glad now but Birdalone; she grew red with new pleasure, and knelt down and kissed
      the witch’s hand, and then went her ways to the wood with her precious lading, and wrought
      there under her oak-tree day after day, and all days, either there, or in the house when the
      weather was foul. That was in the middle of March, when all birds were singing, and the young
      leaves showing on the hawthorns, so that there were pale green clouds, as it were, betwixt the
      great grey boles of oak and sweet-chestnut; and by the lake the meadow-saffron new-thrust-up
      was opening its blossom; and March wore and April, and still she was at work happily when now
      it was later May, and the hare-bells were in full bloom down the bent before her.
All this while the witch had meddled little with Birdalone, and had bidden her to no work
      afield or in the stead which was anywise grievous, but had done all herself; yet was she
      few-spoken with her, and would oft behold her gloomily. And one evening when Birdalone came in
      from the wood, the witch came close up to her and stared her in the face, and said suddenly:
      Is it in thine heart to flee away from me and leave me?
A sharp pang of fear shot through Birdalone’s heart at that word, and she turned very red,
      and then pale to the lips, but stammered out: No, lady, it is not in mine heart. The dame
      looked grimly on her and said: If thou try it and fail, thou shalt rue it once only, to wit,
      lifelong; and thou canst but fail. She was silent a while, and then spake in a milder voice:
      Be content here a while with me, and thereafter thou shalt be more content, and that before
      long.
She said no more at that time; but her word clave to Birdalone’s heart, and for some time
      thereafter she was sorely oppressed with a burden of fear, and knew not how to hold herself
      before the witch-wife. But the days wore, and nought betid, and the maiden’s heart grew
      lighter, and still she wrought on at her gown and her smock, and it was well-nigh done. She
      had broidered the said gown with roses and lilies, and a tall tree springing up from amidmost
      the hem of the skirt, and a hart on either side thereof, face to face of each other. And the
      smock she had sewn daintily at the hems and the bosom with fair knots and buds. It was now
      past the middle of June, hot and bright weather.
