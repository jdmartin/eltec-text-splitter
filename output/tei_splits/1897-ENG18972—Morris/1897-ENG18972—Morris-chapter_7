 Chapter VII ~ Birdalone Hath an Adventure in the Wood 
On a day she went to the wood, and sat down under her oak-tree, and it was far and far out
      of sight of anyone standing in the meadow by the lake; and in the wood Birdalone looked to see
      nought at all save the rabbits and squirrels, who were, forsooth, familiar enough with her,
      and fearless, so that they would come to her hand and sport with her when she hailed them.
      Wherefore, as the day was exceeding hot, she put off from her her simple raiment, that she
      might feel all the pleasure of the cool shadow and what air was stirring, and the kindness of
      the greensward upon her very body. So she sat sewing, covered but by a lap of the green gown
      which her needle was painting.
But as she sat there intent on her work, and her head bent over it, and it was now at the
      point of high noon, she heard as if some creature were going anigh to her; she heeded it not,
      deeming that it would be but some wandering hind. But even therewith she heard one say her
      name in a soft voice, and she leapt up trembling, deeming at first that it would be the witch
      come to fetch her: but yet more scared she was, when she saw standing before her the shape of
      a young woman as naked as herself, save that she had an oak wreath round about her loins.
The new-comer, who was now close to her, smiled on her, and said in a kind and sweet voice:
      Fear nought, Birdalone, for I deem thou wilt find me a friend, and it is not unlike that thou
      wilt need one ere long. And furthermore, I will say it, said she smiling, that since I am not
      afraid of thee, thou needest not be afraid of me. Said Birdalone, she also smiling: True it is
      that thou art nought fearsome to look on. The new-comer laughed outright, and said: Are we not
      well met then in the wildwood? and we both as two children whom the earth loveth. So play we
      at a game. At what game? said Birdalone. Spake she of the oak-wreath: This; thou shalt tell me
      what I am like in thine eyes first, because thou wert afraid of me; and then when thou art
      done, I will tell thee what thou seemest to me.
Quoth Birdalone: For me that will be hard; for I have nought to liken thee to, whereas save
      this sight of thee I have seen nought save her that dwelleth in the House by the Water, and
      whom I serve. Nay, said the other, then will I begin, and tell thee first whatlike thou art,
      so that thou wilt know the better how to frame thy word concerning me. But tell me, hast thou
      ever seen thyself in a mirror? What thing is that? said Birdalone. It is a polished round of
      steel or some other white metal, said the wood-maiden, which giveth back in all truth the
      image of whatso cometh before it. Said Birdalone and reddened therewith: We have at home a
      broad latten dish, which it is my work, amongst other things, to brighten and keep bright; yet
      may I not make it so bright that I may see much of mine image therein; and yet. What wouldst
      thou? said the wood-woman. Said Birdalone: I shall tell thee presently when thy part of the
      play is done.
Laughed the new-comer, and said: It is well; now am I to be thy mirror. Thus it is with
      thee: thou standest before me a tall and slim maiden, somewhat thin, as befitteth thy
      seventeen summers; where thy flesh is bare of wont, as thy throat and thine arms and thy legs
      from the middle down, it is tanned a beauteous colour, but otherwhere it is even as fair a
      white, wholesome and clean, and as if the golden sunlight, which fulfilleth the promise of the
      earth, were playing therein. Fairer and rounder shall be thine arms and thy shoulders when
      thou hast seen five more summers, yet scarce more lovesome, so strong and fine as now they
      are. Low are thy breasts, as is meet for so young a maiden, yet is there no lack in them; nor
      ever shall they be fairer than now they are. In goodly fashion sits thine head upon thy
      shoulders, upheld by a long and most well-wrought neck, that the sun hath tanned as aforesaid.
      The hair of thee is simple brown, yet somewhat more golden than dark; and ah! now thou lettest
      it loose it waveth softly past thy fair smooth forehead and on to thy shoulders, and is not
      stayed by thy girdlestead, but hideth nought of thy knees, and thy legs shapely thin, and thy
      strong and clean-wrought ankles and feet, which are with thee as full of thine heart and thy
      soul and as wise and deft as be thy wrists and thine hands, and their very fellows. Now as to
      thy face: under that smooth forehead is thy nose, which is of measure, neither small nor
      great, straight, and lovely carven at the nostrils: thine eyen are as grey as a hawk’s, but
      kind and serious, and nothing fierce nor shifting. Nay, now thou lettest thine eyelids fall,
      it is as fair with thy face as if they were open, so smooth and simple are they and with their
      long full lashes. But well are thine eyen set in thine head, wide apart, well opened, and so
      as none shall say thou mayst not look in the face of them. Thy cheeks shall one day be a snare
      for the unwary, yet are they not fully rounded, as some would have them; but not I, for most
      pitiful kind are they forsooth. Delicate and clear-made is the little trench that goeth from
      thy nose to thy lips, and sweet it is, and there is more might in it than in sweet words
      spoken. Thy lips, they are of the finest fashion, yet rather thin than full; and some would
      not have it so; but I would, whereas I see therein a sign of thy valiancy and friendliness.
      Surely he who did thy carven chin had a mind to a master-work and did no less. Great was the
      deftness of thine imaginer, and he would have all folk that see thee wonder at thy deep
      thinking and thy carefulness and thy kindness. Ah maiden! is it so that thy thoughts are ever
      deep and solemn? Yet at least I know it of thee that they be hale and true and sweet.
My friend, when thou hast a mirror, some of all this shalt thou see, but not all; and when
      thou hast a lover some deal wilt thou hear, but not all. But now thy she-friend may tell it
      thee all, if she have eyes to see it, as have I; whereas no man could say so much of thee
      before the mere love should overtake him, and turn his speech into the folly of love and the
      madness of desire. So now I have played the play, and told thee of thee; tell me now of me,
      and play thy play.
For a while stood Birdalone silent, blushing and confused, but whiles casting shy glances at
      her own body, what she might see of it. At last she spake: Fair friend, I would do thy will,
      but I am not deft of speech; for I speak but little, save with the fowl and wild things, and
      they may not learn me the speech of man. Yet I will say that I wonder to hear thee call me
      fair and beauteous; for my dame tells me that never, nor sayeth aught of my aspect save in her
      anger, and then it is: Rag! and bag-of-bones! and when wilt thou be a woman, thou lank elf
      thou? The new-comer laughed well-favouredly hereat, and put forth a hand, and stroked her
      friend’s cheek. Birdalone looked piteous kind on her and said: But now I must needs believe
      thy words, thou who art so kind to me, and withal thyself so beauteous. And I will tell thee
      that it fills my heart with joy to know that I am fair like to thee. For this moreover I will
      tell thee, that I have seen nought in field or woodland that is as lovely to me as thou art;
      nay, not the fritillary nodding at our brook’s mouth, nor the willow-boughs waving on Green
      Eyot; nor the wild-cat sporting on the little woodlawn, when she saw me not; nor the white doe
      rising up from the grass to look to her fawn; nor aught that moves and grows. Yet there is
      another thing which I must tell thee, to wit, that what thou hast said about the fashion of
      any part of me, that same, setting aside thy lovely words, which make the tears come into the
      eyes of me, would I say of thee. Look thou! I take thine hair and lay the tress amongst mine,
      and thou mayst not tell which is which; and amidst the soft waves of it thy forehead is
      nestling smooth as thou saidst of mine: hawk-grey and wide apart are thine eyen, and deep
      thought and all tenderness is in them, as of me thou sayest: fine is thy nose and of due
      measure; and thy cheeks a little hollow, and somewhat thin thy lovely lips; and thy round chin
      so goodly carven, as it might not be better done. And of thy body else I will say as thou
      sayst of mine, though I deem these hands have done more work than thine. But see thou! thy leg
      and mine as they stand together; and thine arm, as if it were of my body. Slim and slender
      thou art, or it may be lank; and I deem our dame would call thee also bag-of-bones. Now is
      this strange. Who art thou? Art thou my very own sister? I would thou wert.
Spake then to Birdalone that image of her, and said, smiling kindly on her: As to our
      likeness, thou hast it now; so alike are we, as if we were cast in one mould. But thy sister
      of blood I am not; nay, I will tell thee at once that I am not of the children of Adam. As to
      what I am, that is a long story, and I may not tell it as now; but thou mayst call me
      Habundia, as I call thee Birdalone. Now it is true that to everyone I show not myself in this
      fair shape of thee; but be not aghast thereat, or deem me like unto thy mistress herein, for
      as now I am, so ever shall I be unto thee.
Quoth Birdalone, looking on her anxiously: Yea, and I shall see thee again, shall I not?
      else should I grieve, and wish that I had never seen thee at all. Yea, forsooth, said
      Habundia, for I myself were most fain to see thee oft. But now must thou presently get thee
      back home, for evil as now is the mood of thy mistress, and she is rueing the gift of the
      green gown, and hath in her mind to seek occasion to chastise thee.
Now was Birdalone half weeping, as she did on her raiment while her friend looked on her
      kindly. She said presently: Habundia, thou seest I am hard bestead; give me some good rede
      thereto.
That will I, said the wood-wife. When thou goest home to the house, be glad of countenance,
      and joyous that thy gown is nigh done; and therewith be exceeding wary. For I deem it most
      like that she will ask thee what thou hast seen in the wood, and then if thou falter, or thy
      face change, then she will have an inkling of what hath befallen, to wit, that thou hast seen
      someone; and then will she be minded to question thy skin. But if thou keep countenance
      valiantly, then presently will her doubt run off her, and she will cease grudging, and will
      grow mild with thee and meddle not. This is the first rede, and is for today; and now for the
      second, which is for days yet unborn. Thou hast in thy mind to flee away from her; and even so
      shalt thou do one day, though it may be by way of Weeping Cross; for she is sly and wise and
      grim, though sooth it is that she hateth thee not utterly. Now thou must note that nowise she
      hindereth thee from faring in this wood, and that is because she wotteth, as I do, that by
      this way there is no outgoing for thee. Wherefore look thou to it that it is by the way of the
      water that thou shalt fare to the land of men-folk. Belike this may seem marvellous to thee;
      but so it is; and belike I may tell thee more hereof when time serveth. Now cometh the last
      word of my rede. Maybe if thou come often to the wood, we shall whiles happen on each other;
      but if thou have occasion for me, and wouldst see me at once, come hither, and make fire, and
      burn a hair of my head therein, and I will be with thee: here is for thee a tress of mine
      hair; now thou art clad, thou mayst take a knife from thy pouch and shear it from off me.
Even so did Birdalone, and set the tress in her pouch; and therewith they kissed and
      embraced each other, and Birdalone went her ways home to the house, but Habundia went back
      into the wood as she had come.
