Chapter VII ~ Birdalone Cometh to Greenford, and Hears of the Wasting of the Castle of the
      Quest
Now came Birdalone riding into Greenford an hour before sunset on a day of the latter end of
      May; and she had no doubt but to go straight to the hostelry, and that the less as she had not
      abided there before, as hath been told. To them that served her she told the tale of her vow,
      that she might not do off her sallet that seven days; and some trowed her, and some deemed her
      a woman, but whereas she seemed by her raiment to be of condition none meddled with her.
      Moreover, as she told her intent to ride on betimes in the morning, it mattered the less unto
      them: withal she gave out that she came from foreign parts, as sooth it was.
In the evening she sat in the hall, and with her were three chapmen travelling with their
      wares, and two good men of the town sitting; and they were talking together, and were
      courteous and blithe, and amidst their talk they threw many a glance at the slim and fair
      young squire, as Birdalone seemed, and were fain to speak unto him, but refrained them for
      courtesy’s sake. For her part, Birdalone longed sore to ask them somewhat of the Castle of the
      Quest, but the words clave to her throat for very fear; and she sat restless and ill at ease.
      However at last said a townsman to a chapman: Art thou for the Red Hold, Master Peter, when
      thou art done here? Birdalone turned very pale at that word; and Master Peter spake: Yea,
      surely, neighbour, if the folk leave aught in my packs for others to buy. He spake in a jovial
      voice, as if he were merry, and the others all laughed together, as though they were well
      pleased and in good contentment. And now, deemed Birdalone, would be her time to speak if she
      would learn aught; so she constrained herself at last, and spake, though in a quavering voice:
      Meseems then, masters, this good town is thriving as now? This I ask because I am a stranger
      in these parts this long while, and now I am come back hither fain were I to find the land in
      good peace; for I may chance to take up my abode hereby.
The goodmen turned to her and smiled kindly when they heard the sweetness of her voice; and
      one of them said: Sir of the sallet, ye shall be content with the peace in this land, and the
      thriving of its folk; the very villeins hereabout live as well as franklins in most lands, and
      the yeomen and vavassours are clad as if they were knights of a good lord’s household.
      Forsooth their houses are both goodly and easy to enter; and well is that, whereas there lacks
      never good meat and drink on the board therein. And moreover their women are for ever seeking
      whatso is fair and goodly, whatso is far-fetched and dear-bought, whereof we chapmen also
      thrive, as thou mayst well deem. Ah! it is a goodly land now!
The others nodded and smiled. But Birdalone spake, hardening her heart thereto for very
      need: Belike then there is a change of days here, for when I last knew of the land there was
      little peace therein. And that will not be so long agone, said a townsman, smiling, for I
      doubt we should see no grey hair in thine head if thy sallet were off it. Birdalone reddened:
      It will be some five years agone, said she. Yea, yea, said the townsman, we were beginning to
      end the unpeace then, and it was the darkest hour before the dawn; for five years agone we and
      the good knights of the Castle of the Quest were lying before the walls of the Red Hold.
      Forsooth we cleared out that den of devils then and there. What betid unto it after ye won it?
      said Birdalone, and she trembled withal. Said the townsman: Heard ye never of the Black
      Squire, a very valiant knight, since thou sayest that thou hast known this country-side? She
      bowed a yeasay, for this time she found it hard to speak.
Well, said the townsman, we held garrison in the Red Hold for some three months, and
      thereafter we craved of him to come and be our captain therein; for, even after the Hold was
      won, there was yet a sort of runagates that haunted the country-side, men who had no craft
      save lifting and slaying. And forsooth we knew this Lord Arthur for the keenest and deftest of
      men-at-arms; so he yeasaid our asking, and did all he might herein, and forsooth that was all
      there was to do; for he was ever in the saddle, and at the work. Forsooth he was not a merry
      man, save when he was at his busiest; and little he spake in hall or chamber, else had he been
      better beloved. But at least by no man better might the land have been served.
There was silence a little, and Birdalone waxed deadly pale; then she strove with herself
      and said: Thou sayest he was and he was; is he dead then? Said the townsman: Not to our
      knowledge. When he had brought the land into good peace, which is some three years and a half
      agone, he went his ways from the Red Hold all alone, and we saw him no more. But some folk
      deem that he hath entered into religion.
Birdalone’s heart sickened, and she thought to herself that now all was to begin again; yet
      she felt that the worst was over since he was not dead, and she was able to think what she
      should do. So she said: Mayhappen he hath gone back to the Castle of the Quest? Nay, nay, said
      the townsman, that may not be; for waste is that house now; there is none dwelleth there,
      save, it may be, now and again a wandering carle or carline abideth there a day or two. Said
      Birdalone: How hath that befallen? or where is gone Sir Hugh, the Green Knight? Said the
      townsman: We knew the Green Knight well; frank and free and joyous was he; all men loved him;
      and his lady and speech-friend, none ever saw a lovelier, and as kind as was he. But we might
      not keep them with us; they are gone into their own country. Sir Hugh left the Castle of the
      Quest some three months after the Black Squire came to us for captain, and he gave over the
      castle to Sir Geoffrey of Lea, an old and wise man of war. But not many months thereafter we
      heard that he also had departed, leaving it ungarnished of men; and we deem that the cause
      thereof is that something uncouth is seen and heard therein, which folk may not endure. Is it
      not so, my masters?
They all yeasaid that, and the talk went on to other matters. As for Birdalone, though her
      hope to come amongst friends was so utterly overthrown, yet she saw not what to do save to go
      her ways to the Castle of the Quest, and see if perchance she might find any tidings there.
      And she said to herself, that if the worst came to the worst, she would herself dwell there as
      an hermit of love; or, maybe, to face those uncouth things and see if any tidings might be
      compelled out of them.
