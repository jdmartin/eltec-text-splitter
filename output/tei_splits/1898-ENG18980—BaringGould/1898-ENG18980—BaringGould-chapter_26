CHAPTER XXVI.INTERMEZZO.
 The dramatic composer has this great advantage over the novelist, that when he has to allow
      for a certain amount of time,—it may be for years—to elapse between the parts of his play, he
      lowers the curtain, the first or second act is concluded, ices, oranges are taken round in the
      stalls; the orchestra strikes up an overture, the gentlemen retire to the promenade gallery
      for a cigar, and the ladies discuss their acquaintances, and the toilette of those in the
      boxes, after having explored the theatre with their glasses. 
 At Munich and Bayreuth, at the performance of Wagner’s operas, the space allowed between
      the acts is sufficient for a walk and for a meal. Thus the lapse of time between the parts of
      a drama is given a real expression, and the minds of those who have followed the first part of
      the story are prepared to accept a change in the conditions of the performers, such as could
      be brought about solely by the passage of time. 
 But a novelist has no such assistance, he is not able to produce such an illusion; even
      when his story appears in a serial, he is without this advantage, for the movement of his
      tale, when it is rapid, is artificially delayed by the limitations laid down by the editors of
      the magazines, and the space allotted to him, and when
      he does require a pause to allow for the gliding away of a certain number of
      years, that pause consists of precisely the same number of days as intervened in the serial
      publication, between chapters in which the action should have been continuous. 
 The writer must, therefore, throw himself on the indulgence of the reader, and plead to be
      allowed like a Greek chorus to stand forward and narrate what has taken place, during a period
      of time concerning which he proposes to pass over without detailed account, before he resumes
      the thread of his narrative. 
 When Vespasian was hailed Emperor by the troops he was aged sixty-one, and none supposed
      that his reign would be long. He associated his eldest son Titus with him in government, but
      would not allow the younger, Domitian, any power. 
 When the Emperor reached the capital, he learned the misuse Domitian had made of that which
      he had arrogated to himself, or which had been granted to him by the Senate, in his father’s
      absence. The old Emperor was vastly displeased at the misconduct of his younger son, and would
      perhaps have dealt severely with him, had he not been dissuaded from so doing by Titus, who
      pointed out, that as he himself had no son, in all probability Domitian would at some time
      succeed to the purple. 
 The young man, kept in the background, not even allowed the command in any military
      expedition, carefully watched and restrained from giving vent to his natural disposition,
      chafed at his enforced inactivity, and at the marked manner in which he was set behind his
      elder brother, a man who, by the capture of Jerusalem, had gained a name, and had attached the sol
      diery to him. Domitian was known to the military only by his abortive attempt to
      pluck the laurels in Germany from the brow of his kinsman Cerealis, for the adornment of his
      own head. 
 Domitian was granted none of the titles that indicated association in the Empire. He was
      not suffered to take part in public affairs. His insolence in neglecting the duties of prætor
      of the city, as beneath his dignity, was punished in this manner. When Titus celebrated his
      triumph after the Jewish war, with unusual magnificence, he and his father rode in chariots of
      state, but Domitian was made to follow on horseback. When Vespasian and his eldest son showed
      themselves in public, they were carried on thrones, whereas Domitian was made to attend in the
      rear in a litter. 
 The envious, ambitious young prince, under this treatment was driven to wear a mask, and he
      affected a love of literature, and indifference to the affairs of state. Titus, who knew less
      of him than his father, was deceived, but Vespasian was too well aware of the radically evil
      heart of his younger son to trust him in any way. 
 Domitia was unable to escape from compulsary association with this imperial cub. Vespasian
      was unwilling to undo the past, and have the scandal raked up again, and public attention
      called to it. The minds of the volatile Romans had forgotten the circumstances and were
      occupied with new matters of gossip. Domitian married Domitia Longina, and the old Emperor
      after some consideration concluded that she should remain his wife. 
 But the relations between her and the prince were
      strained. She hated him for what he had done, and she made no attempt to affect a
      liking she did not feel. 
 Lamia remained unmarried; he had cared for no other woman, and he felt that there was not
      to be found one who could ever be to him what he had hoped Domitia would have proved. 
 Once Titus asked him his reason for not marrying. 
 “Why do you inquire?” said Lamia, with a bitter smile, “do you also wish to carry off my
      wife?” 
 On the death of the old Emperor, Titus succeeded without any difficulties being raised. His
      father had already associated him in the Empire and had gradually transferred the conduct of
      affairs to his hands. 
 Hitherto the brothers had lived on very good terms with each other, at all events in
      appearance, and Domitian had been sufficiently prudent to veil his jealousy of Titus, who had
      shown himself kindly disposed towards his younger brother. 
 On the accession of Titus, Domitian hoped to be associated with him in government in the
      same manner as Titus had been with his father. In this he was disappointed, his disappointment
      got the better of his prudence, and he declared that his brother had falsified the will of
      Vespasian, who had divided the power equally between them. 
 On the first day of his reign, Titus designated Domitian as his successor, but he allowed
      him no independent power; and the young prince at once involved himself in intrigues and
      sought to rouse the troops to revolt, and to proclaim him in place of Titus. 
 The condition of Domitia would have been more intolerable than it was, but that Vespasian,
      up to his
      death, retained his younger son about his person, in Rome, and it was but rarely
      that the prince was able to escape to his villa, at Albanum, where Domitia remained in
      seclusion. And his visits there were not only few and far between, but also brief. 
 He was in bad humor when there, at liberty to vent his irritation at the manner in which he
      was treated by his father, and the behavior towards him of Domitia was not calculated to
      dispel his vapors. 
 A considerable change had come over her face. The expression had altered; it had been full
      of sweetness, and the muscles had been flexible. Now it was hard-set and stern. 
 Domitian cursed her for the fascination she still exercised over him. It was perhaps her
      unyielding temper, her openly expressed scorn, and her biting sarcasms which stung him to
      maintain his grip on her, knowing that this was to her torture. Yet her beauty exercised over
      him a hold from which he could not escape. His feelings towards her were a mixture of
      passionate admiration and savage resentment. From every one else he met with adulation, or at
      least respect, from her neither. His will was a law to a legion of sycophants, to her it was
      something she seemed to find a pleasure in defying. 
 Domitia nursed her resentment, and this soured her nature and reflected itself in her
      features. 
 In the long Chiaramonte Gallery of the Vatican Museum is an exquisite and uninjured bust of
      Domitia Longina as a girl; the face is one that holds the passer-by, it is so sweet, so
      beautiful, so full of a glorious soul. 
 In the Florence Gallery is one of the same woman
      after Domitian had snatched her away from Lamia, and hidden her in his Alban
      villa. Lovely the face is still, but the beautiful soul has lost its light, the softness has
      gone out of the face, and the shadow of a darkened life broods over it. 
 At Albanum the solitary Domitia had the satisfaction of being attended by her servant
      Euphrosyne, and the faithful Eboracus was also allowed to be there as her minister. 
 She occasionally visited her mother in Rome, but the chasm between them widened. Duilia
      could not understand her daughter’s refusal to accept the inevitable and failure to lay hold
      of her opportunities, and, as she termed it, “eat her rat.” The older Duilia grew, the less
      inclined she was to acknowledge her age, and the more frivolous and scheming she became. She
      was never weary of weaving little webs of mystery and of contriving plans; and the initiating
      of all these was a supper. She was well off, liked ostentation, yet was withal of a frugal
      mind, and never ordered costly dishes, or broached her best wine without calculation that they
      would lead to valuable results. 
 It was possible that Vespasian might have interfered in favor of Domitia, had he been made
      to understand how strongly she disliked the union, but Domitia herself was never able to
      obtain an interview with the aged Emperor, and Duilia took pains to assure him that the
      marriage had been contracted entirely with her approval, that the union with Lamia had been
      entered on without feeling on either side, in obedience to an expressed wish of Corbulo before
      his death, and that her daughter was quite content to be released. 
 The period was not one in which the personal feel
      ings of a girl were counted as deserving of much thought, certainly not of being
      considered by an Emperor, and Vespasian took no steps to relieve Domitia. Titus was better
      aware of the facts, and had some notion of the wrench it had been to the young married people,
      but he was not desirous of having the matter reopened. It would not conduce to the credit of
      the Flavian house, and that was in his eyes a matter of paramount consideration—as the process
      of deification of the Flavians had already begun.
