CHAPTER VI.FOR THE PEOPLE.
 Domitia was at Gabii. Cornelia, the Vestal Great Mother had sent her thither in her own
      litter, and attended by her own servants, but with the assistance of the knight Celer, who had
      gone before to Gabii to make preparations. 
 Gabii had none of the natural beauties of Albanum, but Domitia cared little for that. It
      was a seat that had belonged to her father and here his ashes reposed. The villa was by no
      means splendid; but then—nor had been that of Albanum when she was first carried thither.
      Domitian had bought it immediately after the proclamation of his father, and it had then been
      a modest, but very charming country residence. Since then, he had lavished vast sums upon it,
      and had converted it into a palace, without having really improved it thereby. To Albanum he
      had become greatly attached; to it he retired in his moody fits, when resentful of his
      treatment by his father, envious of his brother, and suspicious of his first cousin Sabinus.
      There he had vented his spleen in harassing his masons, bullying his slaves, and in sticking
      pins through flies. 
 But if Gabii was less beautiful and less sumptuous, it had the immeasurable advantage of
      not being occupied by Domitian. There, for a while, Domitia was
      free from his hateful society, his endearments and his insults, alike odious to
      her. 
 And she enjoyed the rest; she found real soothing to her sore heart in wandering about the
      garden, and by the lake, and visiting familiar nooks. 
 Only into the temple of Isis she did not penetrate, the recollection of the vision there
      seen was too painful to be revived. 
 On the third day after she had been in the Gabian villa, Celer came out from Rome. He was a
      plain middle-aged man with a bald head, and a short brusque manner, but such a man as Domitia
      felt she could trust. 
 He informed her that Cornelia had been before the Augustus and had entreated him to allow
      his wife to absent herself from the palace, and from his company. She had made the plea that
      Domitia Longina was out of health, overstrained by the hurry of exciting events, and that she
      needed complete rest. 
 “But I demand more than that,” said she. 
 “Madam, more than that, my cousin, the Great Mother, dared not ask. The prince was in a
      rough mood, he was highly incensed at your having withdrawn without his leave, and he saw
      behind Cornelia’s words the real signification. He behaved to her with great ill-humor, and
      would give no answer one way or the other—and that means that here you are to remain, till it
      is his pleasure to recall you.” 
 “And may that never be,” sighed Domitia. 
 “The Augustus is moreover much engaged at present.” 
 “What has he been doing? But stay—tell me now—is there news concerning Sabinus?” 

 “Ah lady! he has been.” 
 “I knew it would be so. On what charge?” 
 “The Augustus was incensed against him, because under the god Vespasian he had put his
      servant in the white livery, when Flavius Sabinus was elected to serve as consul for the
      ensuing year. Unhappily, the herald in announcing his election gave him the title of Emperor
      in place of consul, through a mere slip of the tongue. But it was made an occasion of
      delation. Messalinus snapped at the opportunity, and at once the noble Sabinus was found
      guilty of High Treason, and sentenced to death.” 
 “And what has become of Julia, daughter of the god Titus, the wife of Sabinus?” 
 “She has been brought by the Augustus to the Palatine.” 
 Next day, the slave Euphrosyne arrived. She had been sent for by Domitia, and was allowed
      to go to her mistress. She also brought news. 
 The town was in agitation. It was rumored that the Emperor was about to divorce Domitia,
      and to marry his niece. 
 “It would be welcome to me were this to take place,” said Domitia. “Come, now, Euphrosyne,
      bring me spindle and distaff, I will be as a spinster of old.” 
 So days passed, occasionally tidings came from Rome, but these were uncertain rumors.
      Domitia was enjoying absolute peace and freedom from annoyance in the country. And she had in
      Euphrosyne one with whom she talked with pleasure, for the girl had much to say that showed
      novelty, springing out of a mind very different in texture from that usual among slaves. 
 “It is a delight to me to be still. Child!—I can well
      think it, after a toilsome and discouraging life, it is pleasant to fold the
      hands, lay the head on the sod, and go to sleep, without a wish to further keep awake.” 
 “Yes, when there is a prospect of waking again.” 
 “But even without that, is life so pleasant that one would incline to renew it? Not I for
      one.” 
 Domitia looked up at the fresco of the Quest of Pleasure, and said—“Once I wondered at that
      picture yonder, and that all pleasure attained should resolve itself into a sense of
      disappointment. It is quite true that we pursue the butterfly, after we have ceased to value
      it, but that is because we must pursue something, not that we value that which is attained or
      to be attained.” 
 “Ah, lady, we must pursue something. That is in our nature—it is a necessity.” 
 “It is so; and what else is there to follow after except pleasure?” 
 “There is knowledge.” 
 “Knowledge! the froth-whipping of philosophers, the smoke clouds raised by the magicians,
      the dreams and fancies of astronomers—pshaw! I have no stomach for such knowledge. No! I want
      nothing but to be left alone, to dream away my remainder of life.” 
 “No, lady, that would not content you. You must seek. We are made to be seekers, as the
      bird is made to fly, and the fish to swim.” 
 “If we do not seek one thing, we seek another, and in every one, find—what the pinched
      butterfly is—dust.” 
 “No, mistress, not if we seek the truth. The knowledge of the truth, the Summum
       Bonum.” 
 “But where, how are we to seek it?” 

 “In God,” answered the slave. 
 “The Gods! of them we know only idle tales, and in place of the tales, when taken away,
      there remains but guesswork. There again—the pinch of dust.” 
 “Lady, if we are created to seek, as the fish to swim, there must be an element in which to
      pursue our quest, an end to attain. That is inevitable, unless we be made by a freakish
      malevolent power that plants in us desire that can feed only on dust, ever, ever dust. No,
      that cannot be, the soul runs because it sees its goal—” 
 “And that?—” 
 A bustle, and in a moment, in sailed Longa Duilia, very much painted, very yellow in hair,
      and with saffron eyelashes and brows. 
 “Little fool!” said the mother. “Come, let me embrace thee, yet gently lest you crumple me,
      and be cautious of thy kisses, lest thou take off the bloom of my cheek. Thou art ever
      boisterous in thy demonstrations. There, give me a seat, I must put up my feet. As the Gods
      love me! what a hole this Gabii is! How dingy, how dirty, how shabby it all looks! As the
      Gods—but how art thou? some say ill, some say sulky, some say turned adrift. As the Gods love
      me! that last is a lie, and I can swear it. The Augustus distills with love, like a dripping
      honeycomb. You must positively come back with me. I have come—not alone. Messalinus is with
      me—a charming man—but blind, blind as a beetle.” 
 “What, that fourfolder!”


 “Now, now, no slang! I detest it, it is vulgar. Besides, they all do it, and what all do
      can’t be wrong. One must live, and the world is so contrived that one lives upon another;
      consequently, it must be right.” 
 “Well have the Egyptians represented the God who made men as a beetle—blind, and this world
      as a pellet of dung rolled about blindly by him.” 
 “My dear, I am not a philosopher and never wish to be one. Come, we have brought the
      Imperial retinue for taking you back.” 
 “Whither? To your house in the Carinæ?” 
 “Oh, my Domitia! How ridiculous! Of course you go to the Palatine, to your proper place. My
      dear, you will be proclaimed Augusta, and receive worship as a divinity. The Senate are only
      pausing to adjudge you a goddess, to know whether the Emperor intends to repudiate you or no.
      It is absolutely necessary that you come back with me.” 
 “My godhead is determined by the question whether I be divorced or not!” exclaimed Domitia
      contemptuously. “I cannot go with you, mother.” 
 “Then,” said Duilia, looking carefully about, “that jade, big-boned and ugly as a mule—you
      know to whom I refer, will get the upper hand, and your nose will be broken.” 
 “Mother, I ask but to be left alone.” 
 “I will not suffer it. By my maternal authority——” 
 “Alas, mother! I have passed out of that—I did so at my marriage.” 
 “Well then, in your own interest.” 
 “If I consider that I remain here.” 
 “Avaunt nonsense! Your position, your opportu
      nities! Just think! There is cousin Cnæus must be given a help up. He is a
      fool—but that don’t matter, you must get him a proconsulship. Then there is Fulvia, you must
      exert yourself to find her a wealthy husband. As the Gods love me! you can push up all your
      father’s family, and mine to boot. Come, get the girls to dress you becomingly and make
      haste.” 
 “I cannot go.” 
 “You must. The Augustus wills it.” 
 “And if I refuse?” 
 “You cannot refuse.” 
 “I do so now.” 
 “My dear, by the Good Event! you shall come. You can no more refuse him than you can
      Destiny.” 
 “Let him send his lictors and lead me to death.” 
 “Lead you to—how can you talk such rubbish? You must come. This is how the matter stands.
      There has been a good deal of disturbance in Rome. As the Gods love me! I do not know why it
      is, but the people like thee vastly, and the rumor has got about that thou wast about to be
      repudiated, and that raw-boned filly taken in your place. First there were murmurings, then
      pasquinades affixed to the statues of the august Domitian. Then bands of rioters passed under
      his windows howling out mocking songs and blasphemies against his majesty, and next they
      clustered in knots, and that Insula of Castor and Pollux is a nest of insubordination. In
      fact, return you must to quiet men’s minds. You know what a disturbance in Rome is, we have
      gone through several. By Jupiter! I shall never forget the rocking I went through that night
      of the Lectisternium. These sort of things are only unobjectionable when seen from a distance.
      But they
      leave a taste of blood behind them. When the riot is over, then come
      proscription; the delators have a fine time of it, and the rich and noble are made to suffer.” 
 “But, mother, let Julia do what she will, I care not.” 
 “Rome does. The Roman rabble will not have it so. You have been familiar with the base and
      vile multitude. Can’t think how you could do it! However, it has succeeded this time and
      turned out a good move, for the people are clamorous for your return. The Augustus is but
      recently proclaimed and allegiance is still fresh—and I believe his cousin Ursus has been at
      him to have you back so as to humor the public.” 
 “Yet, if I refuse to gratify him.” 
 “Then, my dear, of course, it will be a pity, and all that sort of thing; but they all do
      it, and it must be right. The Augustus would prefer not to use severity—but if severe he must
      be, he will put down this disturbance with a hand of iron. He bears no actor’s sword, the
      blade of which is innocuous. I will call in Messalinus. He will tell you more.” 
 She clapped her hands; in obedience to her order a slave went outside the villa, and
      presently returned with the blind man. 
 He entered, working his sharp nose about, and then made a cringing bow towards the wall—not
      knowing where stood Domitia. 
 “Catullus Messalinus,” said Duilia, “have the goodness to inform my daughter of the
      intentions of the Augustus relative to the rabble in the Insula of Castor and Pollux, whence
      all the agitation proceeds.” 
 “Madam,” said the blind informer, “my god-like prince has already given command to clear
      the streets
      by means of the prætorian swords. As to that herd in the block of Castor and
      Pollux, they are reserved for condign punishment, unless my dear lady return at once. They
      will all—men, women and children, be driven into the circus. There are a pair of British war
      chariots, with scythes affixed to the axles, and the green drivers will be commanded to hustle
      round the ring at full speed among this rebellious rabble, to trample them down, and mow them
      as barley with the scythes—till not one remains alive as a seed of disaffection. What I say
      is—if a thing has to be done, do it thoroughly. It is true kindness in the end. Of course some
      must suffer, and one may praise the Gods that in this case it is only the common people.” 
 “The common people,” gasped Domitia. 
 Her eyes were glazed with horror. She saw the Insula, its crowds of
      busy, kindly, happy people, so good to one another, so affectionate to Glyceria, so grateful
      to her for visiting among them. And it was she, she by winning their love who was
      bringing this punishment upon them. In their blind, foolish way, they had misconceived her
      flight, and in their blind and stupid way, had resented an imaginary wrong offered to her, and
      because of their generous championship—they must suffer. 
 With bursting heart, and with a scalding rush of tears over her cheeks, Domitia extended
      her hand to her mother:— 
 “I go back,” she said, “My people! my poor people, my dear people! It must be so.—For their
       sake—pro populo.”
