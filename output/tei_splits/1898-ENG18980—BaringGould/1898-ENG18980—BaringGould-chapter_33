CHAPTER VII.“THE BLUES HAVE IT!”
 On her return to Rome and the palace, Domitia did not see the Emperor, but he sent her
      notice to be prepared to appear with him in public at the opening of the Circensian Games that
      he gave to the people in honor of his accession to the principate. This was to take place on
      the morrow. The games began at an early hour and lasted all day, with an interruption for the
       cena or supper at two o’clock. 
 The Circus was close under the Palatine Hill and occupied the valley between it and the
      Aventine. The site has now been taken possession of for gas-works. 
 It was a long structure, with one end like a horseshoe, the other was straight, or rather
      diagonal, a contrivance to enable horses and chariots when starting abreast to have equal
      lengths to run, which would not have been the case had the end been drawn straight across the
      circus. 
 This end was dignified with two towers, with a central gate between them and four arched
      doors on each side closed with ornamental wooden gates. 
 The seats of the spectators rose in tiers on all sides, except that of the straight side,
      where above the great entrance was the seat of the director of the sports. On one side of the
      Circus near the winning post was the imperial box. 

 Down the middle of the course ran a wall with statues planted on it, but at each end was a
      peculiar structure; that near the winning post sustaining seven white balls like eggs, that at
      the other extremity supporting as many bronze dolphins. 
 Each race consisted of seven circuits of the course, and a servant of the management at
      each end attended to the number of rounds made, and as each concluded, an egg was removed at
      one end, and a dolphin turned round at the other. 
 There was a separate entrance, with waiting-room for the prince and his party. Domitia with
      her train arrived first, and remained in the waiting-room till his arrival. 
 She was dressed in blue, with gold woven into the garment, and her hair was tied up with
      blue. She looked very lovely, slender and delicate in color, with large earnest indigo eyes,
      the darkest blue points about her. The sadness of her expression could not be dissipated by
      forced smiles. 
 In the waiting-chamber she could hear the mutter of voices in the circus; all Rome would be
      there. As she had descended from the Palatine she had seen scarce a soul in the forum or the
      streets, save watchmen and beggars. 
 Now pealed the trumpets, and next moment the prince, attended by his lictors, and with his
      niece Julia at his side, entered. He scowled at Domitia, and beckoned her to approach, then,
      without another word he went out of the door into the Imperial box. Hitherto it had been
      customary for the Empress to sit with the Vestal Virgins. But Nero had broken this rule and
      Domitian, the more to emphasize his reconciliation
      with Domitia, so as to please the people, followed the example of Nero. 
 Domitia entered and moved to the seat on his right; Julia, that on his left. Behind them
      poured a glittering retinue of lictors and soldiers, officers of the guard, and officials of
      the city and chamberlains. At once the whole concourse stood, and thundering cheers with
      clapping of hands rose from the circus. The Emperor made a hasty, ungracious sign of
      acknowledgment and took his seat. 
 The applause, however, did not die away, it broke out afresh, in spurts of enthusiasm, and
      the name of the Empress was audible—whereupon the cheers were prolonged with immense
      vehemence. 
 Domitian heard it. His brow darkened and his face flushed blood-red. He made a signal with
      his hand, at once three priests attended by men bearing pick and shovel entered the course,
      and directed their way to the end of the dividing wall or spine; there they threw up the soil,
      till a buried altar was reached, on which at once burning coals were placed, and all the
      concourse rose whilst incense and a libation and prayers were offered to the God Consus. 
 That ended, the fire was extinguished by the earth being thrown over it. Again the altar
      was buried, and the soil stamped above it. 
 This ceremony was hardly complete before the great central gates were thrown open, to a
      peal of trumpets, and heralds entered to proclaim the opening of the sports given by the
      Emperor, the Cæsar Domitian, the Augustus, son of the God Vespasian, high priest, holder of
      the tribunician power, consul, perpetual Censor, and father of his country; sports given for
      the
      pleasure of his well-beloved, the citizens of Rome, senators, knights, and people
      generally, and of such strangers as might at the time be in Rome, the centre of the world. 
 Again rose a roar of approbation, men stood up, stamped, jumped on their seats, and clapped
      their hands. 
 Then through the Triumphal Gate came the Circensian procession. This was properly a
      ceremonial of the 13th September; but in honor of the proclamation of the accession of
      Domitian to the throne, and to his giving the shows at his own charge, it was now again
      produced. 
 First came boys on horseback and on foot, gayly clothed, and immediately behind them the
      jockeys and runners who were to take part in the games. The racers were divided into four
      classes, each wearing the color of one season of the year. Green stood for spring, red for
      summer, blue for autumn, and white for winter. The riders and drivers were dressed according
      to the class to which they belonged. The chariots were drawn by four horses abreast, and each
      furnished with an outrider in the same colors, armed with a whip. At once cries rose from all
      sides, for every jockey and every horse was known by name, some cheered the drivers, some
      shouted the names of the horses, some proposed bets and others booked such as they had made. 
 Then came huntsmen with hounds, armed with lances, and behind them dancing soldiers, who
      clashed shields and swords in rhythm, accompanying their dance with choric song. 
 Next entered a set of men dressed in sheep’s and
      goats’ skins, and with fluttering ribbons, and lastly images of the gods on
      biers. The “pomp,” though a quaint and pretty sight, was looked on with some impatience, as
      wanting in novelty, and as but a prelude to the more exciting races. 
 The procession having made the circuit of the arena, retired, and with great rapidity the
      first four racing chariots were got into their caveæ, the vaults on the
      right side of the entrance with four doors opening on to the circus. 
 And now a chalked line was rapidly stretched across the course in front of the gates. A
      trumpet sounded, the gates were thrown open and the four chariots issued forth and were drawn
      up abreast behind the line, and lots cast to determine their positions. 
 Then Domitian stretching forth his hand, threw a white napkin into the arena, the white
      cord fell, and instantly the chariots started. 
 The spectators swayed and quivered, shouted and roared, women waved their veils, men
      clashed potsherds; some yelled out bets, and one or two from behind stumbled forward and fell
      among the occupants of the benches in front. 
 At the further end, where the circus described a horseshoe, a gallery of wood projected
      over the heads of those on the lower stages, to accommodate still more spectators; and these
      hammering on the boards with feet and fists greatly increased the din. 
 The roar of voices rolled like a wave along the right side of the circus, then broke into a
      billow at the curved end, and then surged down to the further extremity, again to swell and
      run and revolve, as an egg was dismounted, and a dolphin turned. 

 At each end of the spine, detached from it, were three obelisks, or conical masses of
      stone, sculptured like clipped yew trees. These were the Metæ. 
 Attending every charioteer was, as already said, an outrider in his colors, to lash the
      horses, and to assist in case of accident. Moreover, boys stood about with pitchers of water,
      to dash over the axles of the wheels when they became heated, or to wash away blood stains,
      should there be an accident. 
 Domitia sat watching the race, at first with inattention. Yet the general excitement was
      irresistible, it caught and carried her out of herself, and the color mounted into her ivory
      cheek. 
 The Emperor paid no attention to her, he studiously avoided speaking to her, and addressed
      his conversation to Julia alone—who was constrained to be present notwithstanding that the
      execution of her husband had taken place but a few days previously. But her heavy face gave no
      indication of acute sorrow. It was due to her position and relationship to the prince to be
      there, and when he commanded her attendance, it did not occur to her to show opposition. 
 The keenest rivalry existed between the parties of the circus, at a time when
      political partisanship was dangerous except to the sycophants of the regnant prince, all
      faction feeling was concentrated on the colors of the race-course. Caligula had championed the
      green, so had Nero, who had even strewn the course with green sand when he himself, in a green
      suit, had driven on it. And now Domitian accepted the green as the color that it comported
      with the dignity of his parvenu dynasty to favor. It was also generally
      preferred to the other, at any rate in the betting, be
      cause it was known that the Imperial favorites were allowed to win the majority
      of the races. 
 Yet the jockeys and horses and chariots belonged to different and rival companies, and were
      hired by the givers of games. It was not in the interest of the other colors to be beaten too
      frequently. They therefore arranged among themselves how many and which races were, as a
      matter of course, to be won by the green, and the rest of the races were open to be fairly
      contested. But the public generally were not let into the secret; though indeed the secret was
      usually sold to a few book-makers. 
 Hah! down went the red. In turning the metæ at the further end, the
      wheel had caught in that of the white, throwing the latter out, but not upsetting the chariot,
      whereas the car of the red jockey overturned, one horse went down, sprang up again, and would
      have dragged the driver along, had he not dextrously whipped a curved knife out of his girdle
      and cut the reins. This was necessary, as the reins of all four horses were thrown over the
      shoulder and wrapped round the body. Consequently a fall was certain to be fatal unless the
      driver had time and presence of mind at once to shear through the leathers. 
 “He is out! the red is out!” roared the mob. Then, “The white! the white is lagging—he
      cannot catch up!—the red did for him? Out of the way! Out ye two! ye cumber the course.” 
 The white struggled on, driver and outrider lashed the steeds, they strained every muscle,
      but there was no recovering from the loss of time caused by the lock of wheels, and on
      reaching the doors on the right, which were at once swung open, both chariots retreated into
      the caveæ, amidst the groans of such as had bets on their
      favor. 
 “It lies now between green and blue!” was the general shout. “On with the Panfaracus!”
      “Nay! hit the off horse, he sulks, Euprepes!” “Well done, Nereus! Pull well, Auster! Brave
      horses! brave greens! greens for ever! The Gods befriend the greens!” 
 Then some one looking in the direction of the imperial box noticed Domitia in her blue
      habit, with her blue eyes wide distended, and the blue ribbons in her hair. Suddenly in a
      clear voice he cried,— 
 “The blue! the blue! It is the color of the Augusta! The blue! Sabaste! I swear by her
      divinity! I invoke her aid! The blue will win.” 
 Like an electric shock there went a throb through the vast concourse—there were nearly
      three hundred thousand persons present. At once there rose a roar, it was loud, thrilling,
      imperious:— 
 “The blue! It shall win! The color of the Augusta! of the divine Augusta, the friend of the
      Roman people! The blue! the blue! we will have the blue!” 
 The drivers lashed furiously, the outriders swung themselves in their saddles to beat the
      horses. But the gallant steeds needed no scourging, they were as keen in their rivalry as were
      their drivers and their supporters. 
 “The last egg! the last dolphin! Again! the green is ahead!” a groan broken by only a few
      cheers. Wonderful! In the sudden contagion even those who had betted on the green, cheered the
      rival color. 
 “Who was that cried out for the blue?” asked
      Domitian, turning sharply about. “Find him, cast him to the dogs to be torn.”

 His kinsman Ursus whispered in his ear,— 
 “It is the actor Paris. Yet do nothing now. It would be inauspicious.” 
 The command was grudgingly withdrawn. 
 A gasp—stillness, the extreme meta had been turned; then a restless,
      quivering sound, men, women, too agitated to shout, held their breath, but muttered and moved
      their feet—the blue! the blue gains; nay! the green is forging ahead—Ha! Ha! at the last
      moment in swung the blue, across the white line, one stride ahead of the green. 
 Then there rolled up a thunder of applause. 
 “The blue! the dear blue! the blue of the Augusta has it! Ye Gods be praised! I vow a pig
      to Eppona! The blue has it. All hail to the Augusta! to heaven’s blue!” 
 Domitian turned with a look of hate at his wife, and whispered:— 
 Nevertheless she shall come in second.
