CHAPTER VIII.THE SWORD OF THE DEAD.
 “It is well done,” said Eboracus in an undertone to the physician; “Otherwise there had
      been the cross for you and me. The thong broke.” 
 “I severed it,” said Luke. 
 “That I saw,” said the slave, “I shall report that it yielded. One must obey a master even
      to the risk of the cross. Did’st see the noble Lamia, how ready he was? He assumed the mask of
      my dead master and we have slipped by and sent a shiver through the whole company of the
      Trireme, and the August too, I trow,—for they have thought us the Ship of the Dead.” 
 After a pause he said,—“In my home we hold that all souls go to sea in a phantom vessel;
      and sail away to the West, to the Isles of the Blessed. At night a dark ship with a sail as a
      thundercloud comes to the shore, and those near can hear the dead in trains go over the beach
      and enter the ghostly vessel, till she is laden, and then she departs.” 
 The Artemis made her way without disaster to Rhegium, and thence coasted up Italy to the
      port of Rome. She had gained on the Imperial vessel, that was delayed at Brundusium to collect
      the scattered fleet. Nero would not land until he reached Neapolis, and then not till all his
      wreaths and golden apples, as
      well as his entire wardrobe of costumes and properties had arrived. 
 Then only did he come ashore, and he did so to commence a triumphal progress through the
      Peninsula, the like of which was never seen before nor will be seen again. 
 This was on the 19th March, the anniversary of the murder of his mother. On the same day a
      letter was put into his hands announcing the revolt of the legions in Gaul and the
      proclamation of Galba, at that time Governor of Spain. 
 So engrossed, however, was his mind with preparation for his theatrical procession, that he
      paid no heed to the news, nor was he roused till he read the address of Vindex, who led the
      revolt, denouncing him as a “miserable fiddler.” 
 This touched him to the quick, and he addressed an indignant despatch to the Senate,
      demanding that Vindex should be chastised, and appealed to the prizes he had gained as
      testimony to his musical abilities. 
 So he started for Rome. 
 Eighteen hundred and eight heralds strutted before him, bearing in their hands the crowns
      that had been awarded him and announcing when and how he had succeeded in winning the award. 
 He entered Rome in this leisurely manner, in a triumphal chariot, wearing a purple robe,
      embroidered with gold, an olive garland about his head. Beside him a harper struck his
      instrument and chanted his praises. 
 The houses were decorated with festoons, the streets were strewn with saffron; singing
      birds, comfits, flowers were scattered by the people before him. If the Sen
      ate expected that now the prince was in Rome, he would attend to business, it was
      vastly mistaken. His first concern was to arrange for a splendid exhibition in which he might
      gratify the public with a finished study of his acting and singing. 
 Solicitude about his triumph, his voice, his reception, had so completely filled the
      shallow mind of Nero, that he gave no further thought to the vessel that had shot out of the
      darkness, nearly fouled his galley, and which had been apparently commanded by one of his
      noblest victims. 
 Longa Duilia arrived on the Gabian estate, with the corpse of her husband, her daughter,
      Lucius Lamia, and her entire “family,” as the company of household slaves was termed, without
      accident and without deter. 
 Gabii lay eleven miles from Rome at the foot of one of the spurs of the Alban mountains.
      The town stood on a small knoll rising out of the Campagna. The stone of which it was built
      was dark, being a volcanic peperino; it was perhaps one of the least attractive sites for a
      country residence, which a Roman noble could have selected; but this was not without its
      advantage, when Emperors acted as did Ahab, and cut off those whose villas and vineyards
      attracted their covetous eyes. 
 A lake occupied the crater of an extinct volcano; the water was dark as ink, but this was
      due rather to the character of the bottom, than to depth, which was inconsiderable. 
 The villa and its gardens lay by the water’s edge. The old city not flourishing, but
      maintaining a languid existence, was famous for nothing but a peculiarity in girding the toga
      adopted by the men, by the dingi
      ness of its building stone, and by its temple of Juno, an object of pilgrimage
      when the deities of other shrines had proved unwilling or unable to help, a sort of pis-aller
      of devotion. 
 Longa Duilia hated the place; it was dull, and she would never have frequented it, had it
      not been the fashion at the period for all people of good family to affect a love of
      retirement into the country, and to pretend a taste for simplicity of rural life. Some fine
      fops had their “chambers of poverty” to which on occasions they retired, to lie on mats upon
      the ground, and eat pulse out of common earthenware. Such periods of self-denial added zest to
      luxury. 
 Domitia, on the other hand, was attached to the place. It was associated with the innocent
      pleasures of earliest childhood. Its spring flowers were the loveliest she had ever culled,
      its June strawberries the most delicious she had ever eaten. And the lake teeming with char
      gave opportunities for boating and fishing. 
 Here was the family burial-place; and here Corbulo was to be burnt, and then his ashes
      collected and consigned to the mausoleum. 
 Messengers had been sent forth to invite the attendance of all relations, acquaintances and
      dependents. 
 The invitation was couched, according to unalterable custom, in antiquated terms, hardly
      intelligible. When on the day appointed for the ceremony, vast numbers were collected, the
      funeral procession started. 
 First went the musicians under the conduct of a Master of the Ceremonies. By law, the
      number of flautists was limited to ten. 
 Then followed the professional mourners, hired for the occasion from the temple of
      Libitina, the priests
      of which were the licensed undertakers. These mourners chanted the
      nænia, a lament composed for the purpose of lauding the acts of the deceased and of reciting
      his honors. When they paused at the conclusion of a strophe, horns and trumpets brayed.
      Immediately after the wailers walked a train of actors, one of whom was dressed in the
      insignia of the deceased and wore a mask representing him. He endeavored to mimic each
      peculiarity of the man he personated, and buffoons around by their antics and jests provoked
      the spectators to laughter. This farcical exhibition was calculated to moderate the excessive
      grief superinduced by the lament of the wailers. 
 Then came the grand procession of the ancestors, especially dear to the heart of the
       widow. Not only did the effigies of the direct forefathers appear, but all
      related families trotted out their ancestors, to attend the illustrious dead, so that there
      cannot have been less than a hundred present. 
 As already mentioned, the wax masks of the dead of a family ornamented every nobleman’s
      hall, usually enclosed in boxes with the titles of the defunct inscribed on them in gold
      characters. These were now produced. The mimes were costumed appropriately, as senators,
      generals, magistrates, with their attendants, wearing the wax masks, and artificial heads of
      hair. 
 The idea represented was that of the ancestors having returned from the land of Shadows to
      fetch their descendant and accompany him to the nether world. The corpse, that lay on a bier
      in the hall, was now taken up, and carried forth to a loud cry from all in the house of “Vale!
      Farewell! Fare thee well!” Between the lips of the dead man was a coin, placed there as
      payment
      of the toll across the River of Death in the ferry-boat of Charon. On each side of
      the bier walked attendants carrying lighted torches. In ancient times all funerals had been
      conducted at night. Now the only reminiscence of this custom was in the bearing of lights; but
      the torches served as well a practical purpose, as they were employed to kindle the pyre. 
 Before the dead were carried the insignia of his offices, pictures of the battles he had
      won and statues of the kings and chiefs he had conquered. The corpse was followed by a number
      of manumitted slaves, all wearing the cap of liberty, in token of their freedom. Finally came
      the members of the family, friends, retainers, and the sympathizing public. 
 Longa Duilia and Domitia Longina walked in their proper place, with dishevelled hair,
      unveiled heads, and in the ricinium or black garment thrown over their
      tunics; the men all wore the pænula, or short travelling cloak. 
 The procession advanced into the marketplace of Gabii, where Lucius Lamia ascended the
       rostrum to pronounce the funeral oration. 
 Immediately, ivory chairs and inlaid stools were ranged in a crescent before him, and on
      these the ancestors seated themselves, the bier being placed before them. 
 The panegyric was addressed to the crowd outside the circle of mimes with wax faces. Lamia
      had a gift of natural eloquence, his feelings were engaged, but his freedom of speech was
      hampered by necessity of caution in allusion to the death of Corbulo, lest some word should be
      let slip which might be caught up and tortured into a treasonable reference to Nero. 

 The Laudation ended, the entire assembly arose and re-formed in procession to the place of
      burning, which by law must be sixty feet from any building. There a pit had been excavated and
      a grating placed above it. On this grating the pyre was erected, consisting of precious woods,
      sprinkled with gums and spices. 
 To this the corpse was conveyed. But, previous to its being placed on the fagots, a surgeon
      amputated one of the fingers, which was preserved for burial, and then a handful of earth was
      thrown over the face of the deceased. 
 Anciently the Roman dead had been buried, and when the fashion for incineration came in, a
      trace of the earlier usage remained in the burial of a member and the covering of the face
      with soil. 
 And now ensued a repulsive scene, one without which no great man’s funeral would have been
      considered as properly performed. 
 Through the crowd pushed two small parties of gladiators, three in each, hired for the
      occasion of a company that let them out. Then ensued a fight—not mimic, but very real, in
      front and round the pyre. Now a hard-pressed gladiator ran and was pursued, turned sharply and
      hacked at his follower. This was continued till three men had fallen and had been stabbed in
      the breast. Whereupon, the survivors sheathed their swords, bowed and withdrew. 
 The torches were now put into the hands of Duilia and Domitia, and with averted faces they
      applied the fire to the fagot, and a sheet of flame roared up and enveloped the dead man. 
 And now the mourners raised their loudest cries, tore their hair, scarified their cheeks
      with their nails;
      pipes, flutes, horns were blown. In a paroxysm of distress, partly real, partly
      feigned, a rush was made to the pyre, and all who got near cast some offering into the
      flames—cakes, flowers, precious stuffs, rings, bracelets, and coins. 
 Duilia, in tragic woe, disengaged a mass of artificial hair from her head, and cast it into
      the fire. Then rang out the sacramental cry:—“I, licet! You are permitted
      to retire,” and gladly, sick at heart and faint, Domitia was supported rather than walked
      home. 
 Some hours later, when the ashes of the defunct had been collected and deposited in an urn,
      which was conveyed to the mausoleum, Lucius Lamia came to the house and inquired for the
      ladies. 
 He was informed that the widow was too much overcome by her feelings to see any one, but
      that Domitia was in the tablinum and would receive him. 
 He at once entered the hall and stepped up into the apartment where she was seated, looking
      pale and worn, with tear-reddened eyes. 
 She rose, and with a sweet sad smile, extended her hand to Lamia. 
 “No, Domitia,” said he gently, “as your dear father gave me permission on the wharf at
      Cenchræa, I will claim the same privilege now.” 
 She held her cold, tear-stained cheek to him without a word, then returned to and sank on
      her stool. 
 “I thank you, dear friend, and almost brother,” she said. “You spoke nobly of my father,
      though not more nobly than he deserved. Here, my Lucius, is a present for you, I intrust it to
      you—his sword, which he used so gallantly, on which he fell, and still marked with his blood.”
