Lady Theodosia's Pets

Dearest Mamma,—You might have prepared me for what Lady Theodosia looks like, because when I
     arrived yesterday and was shown into her boudoir, and found her lying on the sofa, covered with
     dogs and cats, I as nearly as possible laughed out loud, and it would have been so rude. She
     had evidently been asleep, and it looked like a mountain having an earthquake when she got up,
     and animals rolled off her in all directions. A poodle, two fox terriers, a toy Spitz, and a
     cat and kitten, had all been sleeping in the nooks her outline makes. They all barked in
     different keys, and between saying, "Down, Hector!" "Quiet, Fluff!" "Hush, hush, Fanny!" "Did
     um know it was a stranger?" etc., etc., she got in that she was glad to see me, and hoped you
     were better. When she stands up she is colossal! Her body dressed in the last fashion,
     and then the queerest face with no neck, and lemon-coloured hair parted down the middle, and
     not matching a bit with the chignon of thick plaits at the back. It looks as if it were
     strapped on with a black velvet band that comes across her forehead, like in the pictures on
     the nursery screen at home that the Great-aunts made when they were children. She seems as kind
     as possible, and has the fattest wheezy voice.

"Clever Darlings"

Her room is appalling; it is full of Early Victorian furniture, and horrid alabaster
     statuette things, under glass cases, and then a few modern armchairs covered in gorgeous
     brocade, but it is all clawed by the cats, and soiled by the dogs' muddy feet, and you are
     unable to make up your mind where it will be safe to sit. When tea came in, which it did
     immediately, you can't think what it was like! A St. Bernard and another poodle joined the
     party, and while we were trying to get something to eat and drink, they all begged or barked or
     pushed their noses under the muffin dish lid, or took cakes from the side table; and Lady
     Theodosia kept saying, "Clever darlings; see, they know where their favourite bits are." It is
     impossible to have a connected conversation with her, because between every few words she puts
     in ejaculations about the dogs. I was obliged to simply bolt my crumpet like a Frenchman, to
     keep it from being snatched from me. Just as we were finishing tea, Mr. Doran and three men
     came in. He is a teeny-weeny man with a big head and rather weak eyes, and he and she do look
     odd together. What could it have been like when they trotted down the aisle after getting
     married!
It is a mercy Lady Theodosia is only your second cousin, and that her shape has not descended
     to our branch of the family. All the "children"—as she calls the animals—barked again when the
     men came in. There was only a miserable tea left, and, when Mr. Doran ventured to say
     the dogs had made things rather messy, Lady Theodosia annihilated him. It was as if he had
     insulted her nearest and dearest! But one of the men got quietly to the bell, and when the
     footmen came they grasped the situation and brought some clean things, so tea finished better
     than it had begun. Just before they went to dress Lady Theodosia remembered to introduce them.
     The only young one is Mr. Roper, the great shot, and the other two are Sir Augustus Grant and
     Captain Fieldin; they are oldish.
When they had gone, Lady Theodosia said to me that men were a great nuisance as a rule, but
     that she had a pet friend, a "dear docile creature, so useful with the dogs," and he was coming
     back by the 6.30 train. You would have laughed, if you could have seen him when he did arrive!
     A fair humble thing, with a squeaky voice and obsequious manners. He had been up to town to get
     the dogs new muzzles, as the muzzling order has just been put in force in this county. It
     appears Lady Theodosia has him always here, and he attends to the dogs for a home, but I would
     rather be a stable—boy, wouldn't you, Mamma? His name is Frederick Harrington, and Lady
     Theodosia calls him "Frederick" when she is pleased, and "Harrington" if anything puts her out.
     And as she says it, "Harrington" sounds the fattest word you ever heard. I was glad to get to
     my room!
Most of the house that I have yet seen, which was not refurnished when she married in 1870,
     is really fine, with beautiful old furniture and china; only everything within reach is
     scratched and spoilt by the "children." It must make the family portraits turn in their frames
     to see Fluff eating one of their tapestry footstools, or the cats clawing the Venetian velvet
     chairs.

Feeding the Aborigines

There was a dinner party in the evening. As we went upstairs to dress, Lady Theodosia told me
     about it. She said she was obliged to entertain all the Aborigines twice a year, and that most
     people gave them garden parties; but she found that too fatiguing, so she had two dinners in
     the shooting season, and two at Easter, to which she asked every one. She just puts all their
     names in a bag, and counts out twelve couples for each party, and then she makes up the number
     to thirty-six with odd creatures, daughters and old maids, and sons and curates, etc., and
     she finds it a capital plan. She said, "I give 'em plenty to eat and drink, and they draw for
     partners, and all go home as happy as possible feeling there has been no favouritism!"
She explained that the lawyers and doctors enjoyed having their food with the earls and
     baronets much more than just prancing about lawns. And when I asked her how the earls and
     baronets liked it, she said there were only three or four, and they had to put up with it or
     stay at home; she had done it now for thirty years, and they were accustomed to it; besides,
     she had the best chef in England, and anyway it was a nice change for people not
     knowing who they were going to be put next to. It took her such a long time to tell me all
     this, and to see me to my room, that I was almost late, and she did not get into the state
     drawing-room until all the guests had arrived.
You never saw anything so funny as it was, Mamma. Mr. Doran was trying to be polite to the
     odd collection, evidently not quite knowing which was which. Old Lord and Lady Devnant were
     glaring at the rest of the company from the hearth-rug, with a look of "You invade this mat at
     your peril!" Sir Christopher Harford paying extravagant compliments to the parson's wife (I
     knew which they were because I heard them announced), and the "Squire" and Mrs. de Lacy—who
     came over with the Conqueror—standing apart with their skinny daughters, all holding their
     noses in the air. Everybody seemed to be in their best clothes, and most of the women had
     flowers and tulle or little black feathers sticking up in their hair, and bare red arms, and
     skirts inches off the ground in front; you know the look. But everything seemed to be going
     beautifully after Lady Theodosia rolled in (she does not walk, like ordinary people)!

Drawing for Partners

Mr. Doran did the handing round of the drawing-papers, and they were "Marshall and
     Snelgrove," and "Lewis and Allenby," and "Debenham and Freebody," etc., and if you drew
     "Lewis" you went in with whoever drew "Allenby," and so on; it was a capital plan, only for one
     incident. I was near Lady Theodosia when Mr. Harrington rushed from the other end of the room,
     and whispered to her in an agitated voice that the "Dickens" of Lady Devnant's "Jones" was Dr.
     Pluffield. She was not on speaking terms with him, having quarrelled with him for sending her
     teething powders by mistake, when it ought to have been something for her nerves. All Lady
     Theodosia said was—
"Harrington, you're a fool. What are their little differences to me? I give 'em the best
     dinner in England, and they must settle the rest themselves!"
So poor Mr. Harrington had to go back and smooth down Lady Devnant as best he could; and
     presently we all started for the banqueting-hall. There were several really decent county
     people there, of course, but they all looked much the same as the others, except that they had
     diamonds on. Old Admiral Brudnell, who has a crimson face, was taking in the younger Miss de
     Lacy, and just in front of him were Dr. Pluffield and Lady Devnant, whom the Admiral hates. I
     heard him say, getting purple like a gobbler, "Come on, come on, I don't mean to let that old
     catamaran get in front of me!" And he dragged Miss de Lacy through the doorway, bumping the
     others to get past; and she told me afterwards her funny-bone had got such a knock that she
     could hardly hold her soup spoon!

Marshall and Snelgrove

It was quainter even than the frumps' dinner that Godmamma gave. I had a very nervous young
     man with red hair and glasses to take me in; I drew "Snelgrove," so he was "Marshall." He
     evidently had not understood a bit about the drawing, and kept calling me "Miss Snelgrove,"
     until I was obliged to say to him, "But my name is not Snelgrove any more than yours is
     Marshall."
"But my name is Marshall," he said, "and I was told to find a lady of the name of
     'Snelgrove,' and I wondered at the strange coincidence."
He looked so dreadfully distressed that I had to explain to him; and he got so nervous at his
     mistake that he hardly spoke for the rest of dinner.
The dishes were exquisite, and Lady Theodosia enjoyed them all, in spite of "Fanny" (that is
     the Spitz) constantly falling off her lap, and having to be fished for by her own footman, who
     always stands behind her chair, ready for these emergencies. I call it very plucky of the dog
     to go on trying; for what lap Lady Theodosia has is so steep it must be like trying to sleep on
     the dome of St. Paul's. Mr. Roper sat at my other side, and after a while he talked to me; he
     said he came every year to shoot partridges, and it was always the same. On the night he
     arrived there was always this dinner party, and some years the most absurd things had happened,
     but Lady Theodosia did not care a button. He thought there were a good many advantages in being
     a Duke's daughter; they don't dare to offend her, he said, although they are ready to tear one
     another's eyes out when they are put with the wrong people. Lady Theodosia puffed a good deal
     as dinner went on, I could hear her from where I sat. She is in slight mourning, so below her
     diamond necklace—which is magnificent, but has not been cleaned for years—she had a set of five
     lockets, on a chain all made of bog oak, and afterwards I found each locket had a portrait of
     some pet animal who is dead in it, and a piece of its hair. You would never guess that she is
     Lady Cecilia's sister, except for the bulgy eyes. Towards the end of dinner Mr. Doran got so
     gay, he talked and laughed so you would not have recognised him, as ordinarily he is a timid
     little thing.

After Dinner

When we returned to the great drawing-room, it was really comic. Lady Theodosia did not make
     any pretence of talking to the people. Her whole attention was with the "children," who had
     just been let loose from her boudoir, where her maid had been keeping them company while we
     dined. They were as jealous as possible of Fanny, who never leaves any part of Lady Theodosia
     she can stick on to. She is so small that she gets lots of nice rides asleep on the folds of
     her velvet train. Most of the company were terrified at this avalanche of dogs, and kept
     saying, when they came and sniffed and barked at them, "poor doggie," "nice doggie," "good
     doggie," etc., in different keys of nervousness. I felt glad Agnès had insisted that I should
     not put on one of my best dresses. She highly disapproves of this place. As well spend the time
     in the Jardin des Plantes with the cage doors undone, she says!
Now and then, when Lady Theodosia could bring herself to remember she had a party, she would
     make a dash at some one, and as likely as not call them by a wrong name. Lady Devnant and Mrs.
     de Lacy and the few more county people made a little ring with her by themselves, and gradually
     the doctors', and parsons', and lawyers' families got together, and so things settled down, and
     we were getting on quite nicely when the men came in. It did all seem queer after the extreme
     ceremony and politeness in France. When she had fed them, Lady Theodosia seemed to think her
     duty to her guests had ended.
Mr. Doran was still as gay as possible, and insisted upon Mrs. Pluffield singing; it was a
     love-and-tombstone kind of song, and sounded so silly and old-fashioned. And after that lots of
     people had to sing, and I felt so sorry for them; but soon their carriages came, and they were
     able to go home; if I were they nothing would induce me to come again.
I got up early to write this as the post goes at an unearthly hour, so now I must go down to
     breakfast.—Good-bye, dear Mamma, your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.
Retby,

September 22nd.

Settling Down

Dearest Mamma,—I was surprised yesterday when I got down to breakfast to find Lady Theodosia
     already there. She is awfully active, and puffs about everywhere like a steam-engine. She will
     pour out the tea and coffee herself, and there is just the one long table, not a lot of little
     ones like at Nazeby; but our party is quite small, the four other guns were to come from the
     neighbourhood. Lady Theodosia asks you if you take sugar and cream, and then perhaps a dog
     takes off her attention, and as likely as not, when she remembers the pouring out, you get just
     what you have said you don't take. I wonder she does not leave it to the servants.
Mr. Doran was as quiet as a mouse, and said he had a bad headache. The three other men had
     enormous breakfasts, and did not speak much, except that Captain Fieldin asked if we were not
     coming out to lunch; and Lady Theodosia said of course we were—she intended to drive me in her
     pony carriage. When they had all started, she took me back to the boudoir, as it was a
     Wednesday, and the state apartments were on show, and she hates meeting the tourists from
     Bradford. I think it must be dreadful having to let everybody look through your home, just
     because you have fine pictures, and it is historical, and a prince got murdered there a hundred
     years ago. Mr. Doran inherited it through his mother, I think you said, as there are no Lord
     Retbys left.

A Show Place

I went to get the photograph of you I always have on my dressing-table, to show it to Lady
     Theodosia, and I met quite a troop of tourists on the stairs, and all the place railed off with
     fat red cords, and everything being explained to them by a guide who has the appearance of a
     very haughty butler, and lives here just to do this, and look after the things. The tourists
     stared at me because I was inside the rope, just as if I had been a Royalty, and whispered and
     nudged one another, and one said, "Is that Lady Theodosia?" and I felt inclined to call out
     "No, not by twelve stone." It was funny seeing them. The housekeeper hates it; she says it
     takes six housemaids the rest of the day removing their traces, and getting rid of the smell.
     And as for the Bank Holiday ones, they have no respect for the house at all. Lady Theodosia
     told me the housekeeper came to her nearly weeping after the last one. "Oh, my lady," she said,
     "they treats us as if we was ruins."
Mr. Harrington had not been allowed to shoot, because the St. Bernard and Fluff hated their
     muzzles so, when they were tried on, that he had to go in to the local harness-maker and have
     them altered under his own eye. He got back just as we were starting for lunch, and Lady
     Theodosia made him come with us, and sent the groom on with the lunch carts. She drives one of
     those old-fashioned, very low pony-shays, with a seat up behind for the groom, and two such
     ducks of ponies. There hardly seemed room for me beside her, and the springs seemed dreadfully
     down on her side. She generally sits in the middle when alone, Mr. Harrington told me
     afterwards. She noticed about the springs herself, and said, "Frederick, you must lean all your
     weight on the other side." We must have looked odd going along; I squashed in beside her with a
     poodle and Fanny at my feet, and poor Mr. Harrington clinging to one side like grim death, so
     as to try and get the balance more level. It seemed quite a long drive, and lunch was laid out
     on a trestle table in a farmhouse garden, and was a splendid repast, with hot entrées,
     and Lady Theodosia had some of them all.

Mr. Doran's Philanthropy

It appears Captain Fieldin and Sir Augustus Grant are constantly staying here; they help to
     ride Mr. Doran's horses and shoot his birds. They are all old friends, and rather hard up, so
     Mr. Doran just keeps them. He—Mr. Doran—seems different after meals; from being as quiet as a
     lamb, he gets quite coarse and blunt. The rest of the party were just the kind of neighbours
     that always come to shoot. Mr. Roper told me they never have smart parties, with only the best
     shots, and heaps of beautiful ladies. Mr. Doran asks just any one he likes, or he happens to
     meet, and the shooting is some of the best in England, and awfully well preserved.
Lady Theodosia had a very short tweed skirt on, a black velvet jacket with bugles, and a
     boat-shaped hat and cocks' feathers; but she always wears the black velvet band round her
     forehead. Her ankles seemed to be falling over the tops of her boots, and as she only walked
     from the carriage to the lunch table, I don't think her skirt need have been so short; do you,
     Mamma? But although she was got up like an old gipsy you could not help seeing through it all
     that she really is well-bred; I don't think even Agnès would dare to be uppish with her. They
     live here at Retby all the year round. The town house is only opened for three days, when Lady
     Theodosia comes up for the Drawing-room. And they seem to have a lot of these rather dull,
     oldish men friends who make long visits.
Going home after lunch Lady Theodosia took several of the pies and joints to poor people in
     the cottages near, and she was so nice to them, and so friendly; she knows them all and all
     their affairs, and never makes mistakes with their names, or is rude and discourteous as she
     was to the people at the dinner party. They all adore her. She hates the middle classes, she
     says, she would like to live in Russia, where there are only the upper and lower.

Croquet under Difficulties

When we got back, Lord and Lady Tyneville had arrived with their two daughters. They are
     about my age, and quite nice and pretty; but their mother dresses them so queerly, they look
     rather guys. I am glad, Mamma, that you have none of those silly ideas, and that I have not got
     to have my hair in a large bun with ribbons twisted in it for dinner. They seem quite
     accustomed to stay here, and know all the dogs and their ways. They are much nicer than French
     girls, but not so attractive as Miss La Touche. We had an early tea in the hall, and after tea
     we played croquet until it got dark, though one could not get on very well as the dogs
     constantly carried off the balls in their mouths, and one had to guess where to put them back,
     and in that way Lady Theodosia, who was my partner, managed to get through three hoops she
     wouldn't have otherwise. It isn't much fun playing so late in the year, as it gets so cold.
I think the elder Miss Everleigh is in love with Mr. Roper, because she blushed, just as they
     do in books, when he came in, and from being quiet and nice, got rather gigglish. I hope I
     shan't do that when I am in love.
We had quite a gay dinner; Lady Tyneville talks all the time, and says such funny things.
I am really enjoying myself very much in spite of there being no excitements, like the
     Marquis and the Vicomte. To-day we are going to make an excursion into Hernminster to see the
     Cathedral, and to-morrow they shoot again.—Good-bye, dear Mamma, with love from your
     affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.
Retby, Thursday.
Dearest Mamma,—I don't think I care about looking at churches much. They don't smell here as
     they do in France, but on the other hand they look deserted, and as if no one cared a pin, and
     there are generally repairs going on or monuments piled up at the side waiting to be put back
     or something that doesn't look tidy—in the big ones I mean, like York and Hernminster that we
     saw yesterday. Mr. Doran drove us in on the coach, and Lady Theodosia sat on the box beside
     him. It was too wonderful to see her climbing up, and from the near side she completely hid Mr.
     Doran; the reins looked as if they were staying up by themselves, you could not see even his
     hands, her mountainous outline blocked all the space. Miss Everleigh and Mr. Roper and I and
     Sir Augustus sat in the seat behind the box seat, and the other Everleigh sat with her father
     in the back, while Mr. Harrington had to go inside with Lady Tyneville as she was afraid of the
     cold wind. They must have had a nice time, for both poodles were in there too, and one terrier,
     and we could hear them barking constantly. Fanny, who has a wonderful sense of balance, was
     poised somewhere on Lady Theodosia. The horses are beauties and we went at a splendid pace.

An Agreeable Drive

Sir Augustus doesn't seem so old when he is sitting by you; he said a lot of nice things to
     me. We went straight to the "Red Lion" and had lunch, and it was a horrid meal, everything over
     or underdone, and messy and nasty. The dinner at a teeny place like Caudebec in France was
     delicious. I wonder why food at country hotels in England is so bad? At Retby Lady Theodosia
     won't touch anything unless it is absolutely perfect. She sent a dish away yesterday just
     because a whiff of some flavouring she does not like came to her, but at the "Red Lion" she did
     not grumble at all; it must be for the same reason that wetting their feet doesn't give French
     people cold if it is at a national sport, that made her put up with the lunch because it was
     English and had always been the same.
I was glad to have a nice piece of cheese. All the time I was with Godmamma I was not allowed
     to, as it isn't considered proper for girls there, and when I asked Victorine why one day, she
     told me it gave ideas, and was too exciting, whatever that could mean. So at the "Red Lion" I
     just had two helpings to see, as this is the first chance I have had, as you don't care for
     cheese at home. But nothing happened, I did not feel at all excited, so it must be because they
     are French. Mustn't it?

Country Shopping

First we went to a curiosity shop before going to the Cathedral, and there was such an odd
     man owned it. "My good Griggson," Lady Theodosia called him; he seemed quite pleased—although
     we none of us bought anything—and so friendly with Lady Theodosia. When we had finished
     trotting about looking at the old streets and the Cathedral, we went to buy some mauve silk to
     line a cushion that Lady Tyneville has embroidered as a present to Lady Theodosia. It is so
     funny in these country shops, they always bring you what you don't want. Lady Tyneville said
     she wanted mauve, and showed her pattern, and after some time the girl who served her came back
     and said, "Oh! we are out of mauve, but green is being very much worn."
We went back to the "Red Lion" and Mr. Doran and Captain Fieldin joined us. They had been at
     the Club all the time, and were full of local news about the cub hunting, etc. On the way
     back to Retby Sir Augustus told me he was struck with me the moment he came into Lady
     Theodosia's boudoir, and he tried to take hold of my hand. I call it very queer, don't you? I
     suppose it is because they think I am young and want encouraging, but I simply detest it, and I
     told him so. I said, "Why should you want to hold my hand?" and when he looked foolish and
     mumbled some answer, I just said, "Because if you are afraid of falling, and it is to hold on,
     there is the outside rail of the coach for you; I hate being pawed." He said I was a
     disagreeable little thing, and would never get on in life. But you can see, Mamma, how
     everything has changed since you were young.

Mr. Harrington's Fault

Lady Theodosia put on such a splendid purple brocade tea-gown for tea, but Fluff would jump
     up at the tray, and succeeded at last in upsetting a whole jug of cream over her. She was
     sitting in a very low chair that it is difficult to get out of, and she looked quite piteous
     with billows of cream rolling off her; it got into Fanny's nose and made her sneeze, and that
     annoyed the other dogs, and they all began to fight, and the St. Bernard joined in, and in his
     excitement he overturned the whole table and tray. You never saw such a catastrophe! The dogs
     got quite wild with joy, and left off fighting to gobble cakes, and when Mr. Harrington, who
     had been away writing letters, rushed in to see what the commotion was, he did catch it! We
     extricated Lady Theodosia from masses of broken china and dribbles of jam, in the most awful
     rage. She said it was entirely Mr. Harrington's fault for not being there to look after the
     dogs. Considering she had sent him to write about their muzzles, I do call it hard, don't you?
     Mr. Doran came in, and when he saw the best Crown Derby smashed on the floor, and the teapot
     all bent, he became quite transformed, and swore dreadfully. He said such rude words,
     Mamma, that I cannot even write them, and it ended up with,
"If you keep a d----d puppy to look after your other d----d puppies, why the devil don't you
     see he does it!"
I hope you aren't awfully shocked, Mamma, at me writing that; I was obliged to, to show you
     what awful creatures men really are underneath, even if their outsides look as meek as Mr.
     Doran's. Lady Theodosia burst into tears, and it was altogether a fearful scene if it had not
     been so funny to look at. We none of us got any tea, for by the time Lady Theodosia had been
     got to dry her eyes, and things were cleared up, we were all only too glad to disperse. I am
     sure a lot of children could not be so naughty as these dogs are.

A prudent Retirement

Dinner began by being rather strained, but gradually got quite gay. Mr. Doran would have up
     three different brands of champagne for every one to try, and the men seemed to like them very
     much. By dessert everything was lively again, and dinner ended by Mr. Doran singing "The hounds
     of the Meynell," with one foot on the table as gay as a lark. But wasn't it tiresome, Mamma?
     when we got into the drawing-room, Lady Theodosia said we had had a long day, and must be
     tired, and she packed the two Everleighs and me off to bed before the men came in, and so here
     I am writing to you, because it is ridiculous to suppose I am going to sleep at this hour.
     Agnès and I leave by the early train on Saturday morning, so good-bye till then, dear Mamma;
     love from your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.
