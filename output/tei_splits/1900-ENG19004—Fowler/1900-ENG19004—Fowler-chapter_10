Why did you take all I said for certain
When I so gleefully threw the glove?
Couldn't you see that I made a curtain
Out of my laughter to hide my love?

"My dear," said Miss Farringdon, when Elisabeth came down one morning to breakfast, "there is
     sad news to-day."
Miss Farringdon was never late in a morning. She regarded early rising as a virtue on a par
     with faith and charity; while to appear at the breakfast-table after the breakfast itself had
     already appeared thereon was, in her eyes, as the sin of witchcraft.
"What is the matter?" asked Elisabeth, somewhat breathlessly. She had run downstairs at full
     speed in order to enter the dining-room before the dishes, completing her toilet as she fled;
     and she had only beaten the bacon by a neck.
"Richard Smallwood has had a paralytic stroke. Christopher sent up word the first thing this
     morning."
"Oh! I am so sorry. Mr. Smallwood is such a dear old man, and used to be so kind to
     Christopher and me when we were little."
"I am very sorry, too, Elisabeth. I have known
      Richard Smallwood all my life, and he was a valued friend of my dear father's, as
     well as being his right hand in all matters of business. Both my father and uncle thought very
     highly of Richard's opinion, and considered that they owed much of their commercial success to
     his advice and assistance."
"Poor Christopher! I wonder if he will mind much?"
"Of course he will mind, my dear. What a strange child you are, and what peculiar things you
     say! Mr. Smallwood is Christopher's only living relative, and when anything happens to him
     Christopher will be entirely alone in the world. It is sad for any one to be quite alone; and
     especially for young people, who have a natural craving for companionship and sympathy." Miss
     Farringdon sighed. She had spent most of her life in the wilderness and on the mountain-tops,
     and she knew how cold was the climate and how dreary the prospect there.
Elisabeth's eyes filled with tears, and her heart swelled with a strange new feeling she had
     never felt before. For the first time in her life Christopher (unconsciously on his part) made
     a direct appeal to her pity, and her heart responded to the appeal. His perspective, from her
     point of view, was suddenly changed; he was no longer the kindly, easy-going comrade with whom
     she had laughed and quarrelled and made it up again ever since she could remember, and with
     whom she was on a footing of such familiar intimacy; instead, he had become a man standing in
     the shadow of a great sorrow, whose solitary grief commanded her respect and at the same time
     claimed her tenderness. All through breakfast, and the prayers which followed, Elisabeth's
     thoughts ran on this new Christopher, who was so much more
     interesting and yet so much farther off than the old one. She wondered how he
     would look and what he would say when next she saw him; and she longed to see him again, and
     yet felt frightened at the thought of doing so. At prayers that morning Miss Farringdon read
     the lament of David over Saul and Jonathan; and while the words of undying pathos sounded in
     her ears, Elisabeth wondered whether Christopher would mourn as David did if his uncle were to
     die, and whether he would let her comfort him.
When prayers were over, Miss Farringdon bade Elisabeth accompany her to Mr. Smallwood's; and
     all the way there the girl's heart was beating so fast that it almost choked her, with mingled
     fear of and tenderness for this new Christopher who had taken the place of her old playmate. As
     they sat waiting for him in the oak-panelled dining-room, a fresh wave of pity swept over
     Elisabeth as she realized for the first time—though she had sat there over and over again—what
     a cheerless home this was in which to spend one's childhood and youth, and how pluckily
     Christopher had always made the best of things, and had never confessed—even to her—what a
     dreary lot was his. Then he came downstairs; and as she heard his familiar footstep crossing
     the hall her heart beat faster than ever, and there was a mist before her eyes; but when he
     entered the room and shook hands, first with Miss Farringdon and then with her, she was quite
     surprised to see that he looked very much as he always looked, only his face was pale and his
     eyes heavy for want of sleep; and his smile was as kind as ever as it lighted upon her.
"It is very good of you to come to me so quickly," he said, addressing Miss Farringdon but
     looking at Elisabeth.
     
"Not at all, Christopher," replied Miss Maria; "those who have friends must show themselves
     friendly, and your uncle has certainly proved himself of the sort that sticketh closer than a
     brother. No son could have done more for my father—no brother could have done more for me—than
     he has done; and therefore his affliction is my affliction, and his loss is my loss."
"You are very kind." And Christopher's voice shook a little.
Elisabeth did not speak. She was struggling with a feeling of uncontrollable shyness which
     completely tied her usually fluent tongue.
"Is he very ill?" Miss Farringdon asked.
"Yes," Christopher replied, "I'm afraid it's a bad job altogether. The doctor thinks he will
     last only a few days; but if he lives he will never regain the use of his speech or of his
     brain; and I don't know that life under such conditions is a boon to be desired."
"I do not think it is. Yet we poor mortals long to keep our beloved ones with us, even though
     it is but the semblance of their former selves that remain."
Christopher did not answer. There suddenly rushed over him the memory of all that his uncle
     had been to him, and of how that uncle still treated him as a little child; and with it came
     the consciousness that, when his uncle was gone, nobody would ever treat him as a little child
     any more. Life is somewhat dreary when the time comes for us to be grown-up to everybody; so
     Christopher looked (and did not see) out of the window, instead of speaking.
"Of course," Miss Farringdon continued, "you will take his place, should he be—as I fear is
     inevitable—unable to resume work at the Osierfield; and I have such a high opinion
     of you, Christopher, that I have no doubt you will do your uncle's work as well as he has done
     it, and there could not be higher praise. Nevertheless, it saddens me to know that another of
     the old landmarks has been swept away, and that now I only am left of what used to be the
     Osierfield forty years ago. The work may be done as well by the new hands and brains as by the
     old ones; but after one has crossed the summit of the mountain and begun to go downhill, it is
     sorry work exchanging old lamps for new. The new lamps may give brighter light, perchance; but
     their light is too strong for tired old eyes; and we grow homesick for the things to which we
     are accustomed." And Miss Farringdon took off her spectacles and wiped them.
There was silence for a few seconds, while Christopher manfully struggled with his feelings
     and Miss Maria decorously gave vent to hers. Christopher was vexed with himself for so nearly
     breaking down before Elisabeth, and throwing the shadow of his sorrow across the sunshine of
     her path. He did not know that the mother-heart in her was yearning over him with a tenderness
     almost too powerful to be resisted, and that his weakness was constraining her as his strength
     had never done. He was rather surprised that she did not speak to him; but with the patient
     simplicity of a strong man he accepted her behaviour without questioning it. Her mere presence
     in the room somehow changed everything, and made him feel that no world which contained
     Elisabeth could ever be an entirely sorrowful world. Of course he knew nothing about the new
     Christopher which had suddenly arisen above Elisabeth's horizon; he was far too masculine to
     understand that his own
      pathos could be pathetic, or his own suffering dramatic. It is only women—or men
     who have much of the woman in their composition—who can say:

"Here I and sorrow sit,
This is my throne; let kings come bow to it."

The thoroughly manly man is incapable of seeing the picturesque effect of his own misery.
So Christopher pulled himself together and tried to talk of trivial things; and Miss
     Farringdon, having walked through the dark valley herself, knew the comfort of the commonplace
     therein, and fell in with his mood, discussing nurses and remedies and domestic arrangements
     and the like. Elisabeth, however, was distinctly disappointed in Christopher, because he could
     bring himself down to dwell upon these trifling matters when the Angel of Death had crossed the
     lintel of his doorway only last night, and was still hovering round with overshadowing wings.
     It was just like him, she said to herself, to give his attention to surface details, and to
     miss the deeper thing. She had yet to learn that it was because he felt so much, and not
     because he felt so little, that Christopher found it hard to utter the inmost thoughts of his
     heart.
But when Miss Farringdon had made every possible arrangement for Mr. Smallwood's comfort, and
     they rose to leave, Elisabeth's heart smote her for her passing impatience; so she lingered
     behind after her cousin had left the room, and, slipping her hand into Christopher's, she
     whispered—
"Chris, dear, I'm so dreadfully sorry!"
It was a poor little speech for the usually eloquent Elisabeth to make; in cold blood she
     herself would have been ashamed of it; but Christopher was
      quite content. For a second he forgot that he had decided not to let Elisabeth
     know that he loved her until he was in a position to marry her, and he very nearly took her in
     his strong arms and kissed her there and then; but before he had time to do this, his good
     angel (or perhaps his bad one, for it is often difficult to ascertain how one's two guardian
     spirits divide their work) reminded him that it was his duty to leave Elisabeth free to live
     her own life, unhampered by the knowledge of a love which might possibly find no fulfilment in
     this world where money is considered the one thing needful; so he merely returned the pressure
     of her hand, and said in a queer, strained sort of voice—
"Thanks awfully, dear. It isn't half so rough on a fellow when he knows you are sorry." And
     Elisabeth also was content.
Contrary to the doctor's expectations, Richard Smallwood did not die: he had lost all power
     of thought or speech, and never regained them, but lived on for years a living corpse; and the
     burden of his illness lay heavily on Christopher's young shoulders. Life was specially dark to
     poor Christopher just then. His uncle's utter break-down effectually closed the door on all
     chances of escape from the drudgery of the Osierfield to a higher and wider sphere; for, until
     now, he had continued to hope against hope that he might induce that uncle to start him in some
     other walk of life, where the winning of Elisabeth would enter into the region of practical
     politics. But now all chance of this was over; Richard Smallwood was beyond the reach of the
     entreaties and arguments which hitherto he had so firmly resisted. There was nothing left for
     Christopher to do but to step into his uncle's shoes, and try to make the best of his life
      as general manager of the Osierfield, handicapped still further by the charge of
     that uncle, which made it impossible for him to dream of bringing home a wife to the big old
     house in the High Street.
There was only one drop of sweetness in the bitterness of his cup—one ray of light in the
     darkness of his outlook; and that was the consciousness that he could still go on seeing and
     loving and serving Elisabeth, although he might never be able to tell her he was doing so. He
     hoped that she would understand; but here he was too sanguine; Elisabeth was as yet incapable
     of comprehending any emotion until she had seen it reduced to a prescription.
So Christopher lived on in the gloomy house, and looked after his uncle as tenderly as a
     mother looks after a sick child. To all intents and purposes Richard was a child again; he
     could not speak or think, but he still loved his nephew, the only one of his own flesh and
     blood; and he smiled like a child every time that Christopher came into his room, and cried
     like a child ever; time that Christopher went away.
Elisabeth was very sorry for Christopher at first, and very tender toward him; but after a
     time the coldness, which he felt it his duty to show toward her in the changed state of
     affairs, had its natural effect, and she decided that it was foolish to waste her sympathy upon
     any one who obviously needed and valued it so little. Moreover, she had not forgotten that
     strange, new feeling which disturbed her heart the morning after Mr. Smallwood was taken ill;
     and she experienced, half unconsciously, a thoroughly feminine resentment against the man who
     had called into being such an emotion, and then apparently had found no use for it. So
     Elisabeth in her heart of hearts was at war with Christopher—that
      slumbering, smouldering sort of warfare which is ready to break out into fire and
     battle at the slightest provocation; and this state of affairs did not tend to make life any
     the easier for him. He felt he could have cheerfully borne it all if only Elisabeth had been
     kind and had understood; but Elisabeth did not understand him in the least, and was
     consequently unkind—far more unkind than she, in her careless, light-hearted philosophy,
     dreamed of.
She, too, had her disappointments to bear just then. The artist-soul in her had grown up, and
     was crying out for expression; and she vainly prayed her cousin to let her go to the Slade
     School, and there learn to develop the power that was in her. But Miss Farringdon belonged to
     the generation which regarded art purely as a recreation—such as fancy-work, croquet, and the
     like—and she considered that young women should be trained for the more serious things of life;
     by which she meant the ordering of suitable dinners for the rich and the manufacturing of
     seemly garments for the poor. So Elisabeth had to endure the agony which none but an artist can
     know—the agony of being dumb when one has an angel-whispered secret to tell forth—of being
     bound hand and foot when one has a God-sent message to write upon the wall.
Now and then Miss Maria took her young cousin up to town for a few weeks, and thus Elisabeth
     came to have a bowing acquaintanceship with London; but of London as an ever-fascinating,
     never-wearying friend she knew nothing. There are people who tell us that "London is delightful
     in the season," and that "the country is very pretty in the summer," and we smile at them as a
     man would smile at those who said that his mother was "a pleasant person," or his
      heart's dearest "a charming girl." Those who know London and the country, as
     London and the country deserve to be known, do not talk in this way, for they have learned that
     there is no end to the wonder or the interest or the mystery of either.
The year following Richard Smallwood's break-down, a new interest came into Elisabeth's life.
     A son and heir was born at the Moat House; and Elisabeth was one of the women who are
     predestined to the worship of babies. Very tightly did the tiny fingers twine themselves round
     her somewhat empty heart; for Elisabeth was meant to love much, and at present her supply of
     the article was greatly in excess of the demand made upon it. So she poured the surplus—which
     no one else seemed to need—upon the innocent head of Felicia's baby; and she found that the
     baby never misjudged her nor disappointed her, as older people seemed so apt to do. One of her
     most devout fellow-worshippers was Mrs. Herbert, who derived comfort from the fact that little
     Willie was not ashamed of her as little Willie's mother was; so—like many a disappointed woman
     before them—both Mrs. Herbert and Elisabeth discovered the healing power which lies in the
     touch of a baby's hand. Felicia loved the child, too, in her way; but she was of the type of
     woman to whom the husband is always dearer than the children. But Alan's cup was filled to
     overflowing, and he loved his son as he loved his own soul.
One of Christopher's expedients for hiding the meditations of his heart from Elisabeth's
     curious eyes was the discussion with her of what people call "general subjects"; and this tried
     her temper to the utmost. She regarded it as a sign of superficiality to talk of superficial
     things; and she hardly ever went
      in to dinner with a man without arriving at the discussion of abstract love and
     the second entrée simultaneously. It had never yet dawned upon her that as a rule it
     is because one has not experienced a feeling that one is able to describe it; she reasoned in
     the contrary direction, and came to the conclusion that those persons have no hearts at all
     whose sleeves are unadorned with the same. Therefore it was intolerable to her when
     Christopher—who had played with her as a child, and had once very nearly made her grow up into
     a woman—talked to her about the contents of the newspapers.
"I never look at the papers," she answered crossly one day, in reply to some unexceptionable
     and uninteresting comment of his upon such history as was just then in the raw material; "I
     hate them."
"Why do you hate them?" Christopher was surprised at her vehemence.
"Because there is cholera in the South of France, and I never look at the papers when there
     is cholera about, it frightens me so." Elisabeth had all the pity of a thoroughly healthy
     person for the suffering that could not touch her, and the unreasoning terror of a thoroughly
     healthy person for the suffering which could.
"But there is nothing to frighten you in that," said Christopher, in his most comforting
     tone; "France is such a beastly dirty hole that they are bound to have diseases going on there,
     such as could never trouble clean, local-boarded, old England. And then it's so far away, too.
     I'd never worry about that, if I were you."
"Wouldn't you?" Elisabeth was at war with him, but she was not insensible to the consolation
     he never failed to afford her when things went wrong.
     
"Good gracious, no! England is so well looked after, with county councils and such, that even
     if an epidemic came here they'd stamp it out like one o'clock. Don't frighten yourself with
     bogeys, Elisabeth, there's a good girl!"
"I feel just the same about newspapers now that I used to feel about Lalla Rookh," said
     Elisabeth confidentially.
Christopher was puzzled. "I'm afraid I don't see quite the connection, but I have no doubt it
     is there, like Mrs. Wilfer's petticoat."
"In Cousin Maria's copy of Lalla Rookh there is a most awful picture of the Veiled Prophet of
     Khorassan; and when I was little I went nearly mad with terror of that picture. I used to go
     and look at it when nobody was about, and it frightened me more and more every time."
"Why on earth didn't you tell me about it?"
"I don't know. I felt I wouldn't tell anybody for worlds, but must keep it a ghastly secret.
     Sometimes I used to hide the book, and try to forget where I'd hidden it. But I never could
     forget, and in the end I always went and found it, and peeped at the picture and nearly died of
     terror. The mere outside of the book had a horrible fascination for me. I used to look at it
     all the time I was in the drawing-room, and then pretend I wasn't looking at it; yet if the
     housemaid had moved it an inch in dusting the table where it lay, I always knew."
"Poor little silly child! If only you'd have told me, I'd have asked Miss Farringdon to put
     it away where you couldn't get at it."
"But I couldn't have told you, Chris—I couldn't have told anybody. There seemed to be some
     terrible bond between that dreadful book and me which
      I was bound to keep secret. Of course it doesn't frighten me any longer, though I
     shall always hate it; but the newspapers frighten me just in the same way when there are
     horrible things in them."
"Why, Betty, I am ashamed of you! And such a clever girl as you, too, to be taken in by the
     romancing of penny-a-liners! They always make the worst of things in newspapers in order to
     sell them."
"Oh! then you think things aren't as bad as newspapers say?"
"Nothing like; but they must write something for people to read, and the more sensational it
     is the better people like it."
Elisabeth was comforted; and she never knew that Christopher did not leave the house that day
     without asking Miss Farringdon if, for a few weeks, the daily paper might be delivered at the
     works and sent up to the Willows afterward, as he wanted to see the trade-reports the first
     thing in the morning. This was done; and sometimes Christopher remembered to send the papers on
     to the house, and sometimes he did not. On these latter occasions Miss Farringdon severely
     reproved him, and told him that he would never be as capable a man as his uncle had been, if he
     did not endeavour to cultivate his memory; whereat Chris was inwardly tickled, but was
     outwardly very penitent and apologetic, promising to try to be less forgetful in future. And he
     kept his word; for not once—while the epidemic in the South of France lasted—did he forget to
     forget to send the newspaper up to the Willows when there was anything in it calculated to
     alarm the most timid reader.
"Cousin Maria," said Elisabeth, a few days after
      this, "I hear that Coulson's circus is coming to Burlingham, and I want to go and
     see it."
Miss Farringdon looked up over the tops of her gold-rimmed spectacles. "Do you, my dear?
     Well, I see no reason why you should not. I have been brought up to disapprove of theatres, and
     I always shall disapprove of them; but I confess I have never seen any harm in going to a
     circus."
It is always interesting to note where people draw the line between right and wrong in
     dealing with forms of amusement; and it is doubtful whether two separate lines are ever quite
     identical in their curves.
"Christopher could take me," Elisabeth continued; "and if he couldn't, I'm sure Alan
     would."
"I should prefer you to go with Christopher, my dear; he is more thoughtful and dependable
     than Alan Tremaine. I always feel perfectly happy about you when you have Christopher to take
     care of you."
Elisabeth laughed her cousin to scorn. She did not want anybody to take care of her, she
     thought; she was perfectly able to take care of herself. But Miss Farringdon belonged to a time
     when single women of forty were supposed to require careful supervision; and Elisabeth was but
     four-and-twenty.
Christopher, when consulted, fell into the arrangement with alacrity; and it was arranged for
     him to take Elisabeth over to Burlingham on the one day that Coulson's circus was on exhibition
     there. Elisabeth looked forward to the treat like a child; for she was by nature extremely fond
     of pleasure, and by circumstance little accustomed to it.
Great then was her disappointment when the morning of the day arrived, to receive a short
     note from Christopher saying that he was extremely sorry to inconvenience her, but that his
     business
     engagements made it impossible for him to take her to Burlingham that day; and
     adding various apologies and hopes that she would not be too angry with him. She had so few
     treats that her disappointment at losing one was really acute for the moment; but what hurt her
     far more than the disappointment was the consciousness that Chris had obeyed the calls of
     business rather than her behest—had thought less of her pleasure than of the claims of the
     Osierfield. All Elisabeth's pride (or was it her vanity?) rose up in arms at the slight which
     Christopher had thus put upon her; and she felt angrier with him than she had ever felt with
     anybody in her life before. She began to pour out the vials of her wrath in the presence of
     Miss Farringdon; but that good lady was so much pleased to find a young man who cared more for
     business than for pleasure, or even for a young woman, that she accorded Elisabeth but scant
     sympathy. So Elisabeth possessed her wounded soul in extreme impatience, until such time as the
     offender himself should appear upon the scene, ready to receive those vials which had been
     specially prepared for his destruction.
He duly appeared about tea-time, and found Elisabeth consuming the smoke of her anger in the
     garden.
"I hope you are not very angry with me," he began in a humble tone, sitting down beside her
     on the old rustic seat; "but I found myself obliged to disappoint you as soon as I got to the
     works this morning; and I am sure you know me well enough to understand that it wasn't my
     fault, and that I couldn't help myself."
"I don't know you well enough for anything of the kind," replied Elisabeth, flashing a pair
     of very bright eyes upon his discomfited face; "but I know
      you well enough to understand that you are just a mass of selfishness and
     horridness, and that you care for nothing but just what interests and pleases yourself."
Christopher was startled. "Elisabeth, you don't mean that; you know you don't."
"Yes; I do. I mean that I have always hated you, and that I hate you more than ever to-day.
     It was just like you to care more for the business than you did for me, and never to mind about
     my disappointment as long as that nasty old ironworks was satisfied. I tell you I hate you, and
     I hate the works, and I hate everything connected with you."
Christopher looked utterly astonished. He had no idea, he said to himself, that Elisabeth
     cared so much about going to Coulson's circus; and he could not see anything in the frustration
     of a day's excursion to account for such a storm of indignation as this. He did not realize
     that it was the rage of a monarch whose kingdom was in a state of rebellion, and whose dominion
     seemed in danger of slipping away altogether. Elisabeth might not understand Christopher; but
     Christopher was not always guiltless of misunderstanding Elisabeth.
"And it was just like you," Elisabeth went on, "not to let me know till the last minute, when
     it was too late for anything to be done. If you had only had the consideration—I may say the
     mere civility—to send word last night that your royal highness could not be bothered with me
     and my affairs to-day, I could have arranged with Alan Tremaine to take me. He is always able
     to turn his attention for a time from his own pleasure to other people's."
"But I thought I told you that it was not until I got to the works this morning that I
     discovered it
      would be impossible for me to take you to Burlingham to-day."
"Then you ought to have found it out sooner."
"Hang it all! I really can not find out things before they occur. Clever as I am, I am not
     quite clever enough for that. If I were, I should soon make my own fortune by telling other
     people theirs."
But Elisabeth was too angry to be flippant. "The fact is you care for nothing but yourself
     and your horrid old business. I always told you how it would be."
"You did. For whatever faults you may have to blame yourself, over-indulgence toward mine
     will never be one of them. You can make your conscience quite clear on that score." Christopher
     was as determined to treat the quarrel lightly as Elisabeth was to deal with it on serious
     grounds.
"You have grown into a regular, commonplace, money-grubbing, business man, with no thoughts
     for anything higher than making iron and money and vulgar things like that."
"And making you angry—that is a source of distinct pleasure to me. You have no idea how
     charming you are when you are—well, for the sake of euphony we will say slightly ruffled, Miss
     Elisabeth Farringdon."
Elisabeth stamped her foot. "I wish to goodness you'd be serious sometimes! Frivolity is
     positively loathsome in a man."
"Then I repent it in dust and ashes, and shall rely upon your more sedate and serious mind to
     correct this tendency in me. Besides, as you generally blame me for erring in the opposite
     direction, it is a relief to find you smiting me on the other cheek
      as a change. It keeps up my mental circulation better."
"You are both too frivolous and too serious."
Christopher was unwise enough to laugh. "My dear child, I seem to make what is called 'a
     corner' in vices; but even I can not reconcile the conflicting ones."
Then Elisabeth's anger settled down into the quiet stage. "If you think it gentlemanly to
     disappoint a lady and then insult her, pray go on doing so; I can only say that I don't."
"What on earth do you mean, Elisabeth? Do you really believe that I meant to vex you?" The
     laughter had entirely died out of Christopher's face, and his voice was hoarse.
"I don't know what you meant, and I am afraid I don't much mind. All I know is that you did
     disappoint me and did insult me, and that is enough for me. The purity of your motives is not
     my concern; I merely resent the impertinence of your behaviour."
Christopher rose from his seat; he was serious enough now. "You are unjust to me, Elisabeth,
     but I can not and will not attempt to justify myself. Good afternoon."
For a second the misery on his face penetrated the thunder-clouds of Elisabeth's indignation.
     "Won't you have some tea before you go?" she asked. It seemed brutal—even to her outraged
     feelings—to send so old a friend empty away.
Christopher's smile was very bitter as he answered. "No, thank you. I am afraid, after the
     things you have said to me, I should hardly be able graciously to accept hospitality at your
     hands; and rather than accept it ungraciously, I will not
      accept it at all." And he turned on his heel and left her.
As she watched his retreating figure, one spasm of remorse shot through Elisabeth's heart;
     but it was speedily stifled by the recollection that, for the first time in her life,
     Christopher had failed her, and had shown her plainly that there were, in his eyes, more
     important matters than Miss Elisabeth Farringdon and her whims and fancies. And what woman,
     worthy of the name, could extend mercy to a man who had openly displayed so flagrant a want of
     taste and discernment as this? Certainly not Elisabeth, nor any other fashioned after her
     pattern. She felt that she had as much right to be angry as had the prophet, when Almighty
     Wisdom saw fit to save the great city in which he was not particularly interested, and to
     destroy the gourd in which he was. And so, probably, she had.
For several days after this she kept clear of Christopher, nursing her anger in her heart;
     and he was so hurt and sore from the lashing which her tongue had given him, that he felt no
     inclination to come within the radius of that tongue's bitterness again.
But one day, when Elisabeth was sitting on the floor of the Moat House drawing-room, playing
     with the baby and discussing new gowns with Felicia between times, Alan came in and
     remarked—
"It was wise of you to give up your excursion to Coulson's circus last week, Elisabeth; as it
     has turned out it was chiefly a scare, and the case was greatly exaggerated; but it might have
     made you feel uncomfortable if you had gone. I suppose you saw the notice of the outbreak in
     that morning's paper, and so gave it up at the last moment."
     
Elisabeth ceased from her free translation of the baby's gurglings and her laudable
     endeavours suitably to reply to the same, and gave her whole attention to the baby's father. "I
     don't know what you mean. What scare and what outbreak are you talking about?"
"Didn't you see," replied Alan, "that there was an outbreak of cholera at Coulson's circus,
     and a frightful scare all through Burlingham in consequence? Of course the newspapers greatly
     exaggerated the danger, and so increased the scare; and I don't know that I blame them for
     that. I am not sure that the sensational way in which the press announces possible dangers to
     the community is not a safeguard for the community at large. To be alive to a danger is nine
     times out of ten to avoid a danger; and it is far better to be more frightened than hurt than
     to be more hurt than frightened—certainly for communities if not for individuals."
"But tell me about it. I never saw any account in the papers; and I'm glad I didn't, for it
     would have frightened me out of my wits."
"It broke out among a troupe of acrobats who had just come straight from the South of France,
     and evidently brought the infection with them. They were at once isolated, and such prompt and
     efficient measures were taken to prevent the spread of the disease, that there have been no
     more cases, either in the circus or in the town. Now, I should imagine, all danger of its
     spreading is practically over; but, of course, it made everybody in the neighbourhood, and
     everybody who had been to the circus, very nervous and uncomfortable for a few days. The local
     authorities, however, omitted no possible precaution which should assist them in stamping out
     the
      epidemic, should those few cases have started an epidemic—which was, of course,
     possible, though hardly likely."
And then Alan proceeded to expound his views on the matter of sanitary authorities in general
     and of those of Burlingham in particular, to which Felicia listened with absorbing attention
     and Elisabeth did not listen at all.
Soon after this she took her leave; and all along the homeward walk through Badgering Woods
     she was conscious of feeling ashamed of herself—a very rare sensation with Elisabeth, and by no
     means an agreeable one. She was by nature so self-reliant and so irresponsible that she seldom
     regretted anything that she had done; if she had acted wisely, all was well; and if she had not
     acted wisely, it was over and done with, and what was the use of bothering any more about it?
     This was her usual point of view, and it proved as a rule a most comfortable one. But now she
     could not fail to see that she had been in the wrong—hopelessly and flagrantly in the wrong—and
     that she had behaved abominably to Christopher into the bargain. She had to climb down, as
     other ruling powers have had to climb down before now; and the act of climbing down is neither
     a becoming nor an exhilarating form of exercise to ruling powers. But at the back of her humble
     contrition there was a feeling of gladness in the knowledge that Christopher had not really
     failed her after all, and that her kingdom was still her own as it had been in her childish
     days; and there was also a nobler feeling of higher joy in the consciousness that—quite apart
     from his attitude toward her—Christopher was still the Christopher that she had always in her
     inmost soul believed him to be; that she was not wrong in
      the idea she had formed of him long ago. It is very human to be glad on our own
     account when people are as fond of us as we expected them to be; but it is divine to be glad,
     solely for their sakes, when they act up to their own ideals, quite apart from us. And there
     was a touch of divinity in Elisabeth's gladness just then, though the rest of her was extremely
     human—and feminine at that.
On her way home she encountered Caleb Bateson going back to work after dinner, and she told
     him to ask Mr. Thornley to come up to the Willows that afternoon, as she wanted to see him. She
     preferred to send a verbal message, as by so doing she postponed for a few hours that
     climbing-down process which she so much disliked; although it is frequently easier to climb
     down by means of one's pen than by means of one's tongue.
Christopher felt no pleasure in receiving her message. He was not angry with her, although he
     marvelled at the unreasonableness and injustice of a sex that thinks more of a day's pleasure
     than a life's devotion; he did not know that it was over the life's devotion and not the day's
     pleasure that Elisabeth had fought so hard that day; but his encounter with her had strangely
     tired him, and taken the zest out of his life, and he had no appetite for any more of such
     disastrous and inglorious warfare.
But he obeyed her mandate all the same, having learned the important political lesson that
     the fact of a Government's being in the wrong is no excuse for not obeying the orders of that
     Government; and he waited for her in the drawing-room at the Willows, looking out toward the
     sunset and wondering how hard upon him Elisabeth was going to be. And his thoughts were so full
     of her that he
      did not hear her come into the room until she clasped both her hands round his
     arm and looked up into his gloomy face, saying—
"Oh! Chris, I'm so dreadfully ashamed of myself."
The clouds were dispelled at once, and Christopher smiled as he had not smiled for a week.
     "Never mind," he said, patting the hands that were on his arm; "it's all right."
But Elisabeth, having set out upon the descent, was prepared to climb down handsomely. "It
     isn't all right; it's all wrong. I was simply fiendish to you, and I shall never forgive
     myself—never."
"Oh, yes; you will. And for goodness' sake don't worry over it. I'm glad you have found out
     that I wasn't quite the selfish brute that I seemed; and that's the end of the matter."
"Dear me! no; it isn't. It is only the beginning. I want to tell you how dreadfully sorry I
     am, and to ask you to forgive me."
"I've nothing to forgive."
"Yes, you have; lots." And Elisabeth was nearer the mark than Christopher.
"I haven't. Of course you were angry with me when I seemed so disagreeable and unkind; any
     girl would have been," replied Chris, forgetting how very unreasonable her anger had seemed
     only five minutes ago. But five minutes can make such a difference—sometimes.
Elisabeth cheerfully caught at this straw of comfort; she was always ready to take a lenient
     view of her own shortcomings. If Christopher had been wise he would not have encouraged such
     leniency; but who is wise and in love at the same time?
"Of course it did seem rather unkind of you,"
      she admitted; "you see, I thought you had thrown me over just for the sake of
     some tiresome business arrangement, and that you didn't care about me and my disappointment a
     bit."
A little quiver crept into Christopher's voice. "I think you might have known me better than
     that."
"Yes, I might; in fact, I ought to have done," agreed Elisabeth with some truth. "But why
     didn't you tell me the real reason?"
"Because I thought it might worry and frighten you. Not that there really was anything to be
     frightened about," Christopher hastened to add; "but you might have imagined things, and been
     upset; you have such a tremendous imagination, you know."
"I'm afraid I have; and it sometimes imagines vain things at your expense, Chris dear."
"How did you find me out?" Chris asked.
"Alan told me about the cholera scare at Burlingham, and I guessed the rest."
"Then Alan was an ass. What business had he to go frightening you, I should like to know,
     with a lot of fiction that is just trumped up to sell the papers?"
"But, Chris, I want you to understand how sorry I am that I was so vile to you. I really was
     vile, wasn't I?" Elisabeth was the type of woman for whom the confessional will always have its
     fascinations.
"You were distinctly down on me, I must confess; but you needn't worry about that now."
"And you quite forgive me?"
"As I said before, I've nothing to forgive. You were perfectly right to be annoyed with a man
     who appeared to be so careless and inconsiderate; but
      I'm glad you've found out that I wasn't quite as selfish as you thought."
Elisabeth stroked his coat sleeve affectionately. "You are not selfish at all, Chris; you're
     simply the nicest, thoughtfullest, most unselfish person in the world; and I'm utterly wretched
     because I was so unkind to you."
"Don't be wretched, there's a dear! Your wretchedness is the one thing I can't and won't
     stand; so please leave off at once."
To Christopher remorse for wrong done would always be an agony; he had yet to learn that to
     some temperaments, whereof Elisabeth's was one, it partook of the nature of a luxury—the sort
     of luxury which tempts one to pay half a guinea to be allowed to swell up one's eyes and redden
     one's nose over imaginary woes in a London theatre.
"Did you mind very much when I was so cross?" Elisabeth asked thoughtfully.
Christopher was torn between a loyal wish to do homage to his idol and a laudable desire to
     save that idol pain. "Of course I minded pretty considerably; but why bother about that
     now?"
"Because it interests me immensely. I often think that your only fault is that you don't mind
     things enough; and so, naturally, I want to find out how great your minding capacity is."
"I see. Your powers of scientific research are indeed remarkable; but did it never strike you
     that even vivisection might be carried too far—too far for the comfort of the vivisected, I
     mean; not for the enjoyment of the vivisector?"
"It is awfully good for people to feel things," persisted Elisabeth.
"Is it? Well, I suppose it is good—in fact,
      necessary—for some poor beggars to have their arms or legs cut off; but you can't
     expect me to be consumed with envy of the same?"
"Please tell me how much you minded," Elisabeth coaxed.
"I can't tell you; and I wouldn't if I could. If I were a rabbit that had been cut into
     living pieces to satisfy the scientific yearnings of a learned professor, do you think I would
     leave behind me—for my executors to publish and make large fortunes thereby—confidential
     letters and private diaries accurately describing all the tortures I had endured, for the
     recreation of the reading public in general and the said professor in particular? Not I."
"I should. I should leave a full, true, and particular account of all that I had suffered,
     and exactly how much it hurt. It would interest the professor most tremendously."
Christopher shook his head. "Oh, dear! no; it wouldn't."
"Why not?"
"Because I should have knocked his brains out long before that for having dared to hurt you
     at all."
