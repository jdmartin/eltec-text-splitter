THE POOL OF IMMORTALITY
"Hârâ! Hârî! Hârî! Hârâ!"
The cry was incessant now, for there was a glint of light in the east; and the hosts of
     pilgrims to the 'Cradle of the Gods' were cramming, almost to solidity, each street and alley
     in Eshwara which could be said, by however long and tortuous a detour, to give access to that
     small tank where, at dawn, the miraculous waters of cleansing would rise, as they always did on
     this, the great Day of Atonement. In the sea of slightly upturned faces, upturned in the vain
     hope of seeing over the heads of those in front, the most noticeable thing was the expression
     of mingled eagerness and patience. And this was most noticeable in those who stood nearest to
     the bamboo railing which had been erected (in a square some four feet from the first step
     downwards) as a precaution against a dangerous rush on all sides; and in consequence, a
     dangerous crush on those steep steps. The only entrance to them, therefore, was by a sort of
     double sheep-pen at the end nearest the town, by means of which, when the time came, some fifty
     bathers would be admitted to the railed square from the inner pen, their places in which would
     be taken by the fifty in the outer one; their places, in turn, being filled by fifty from the
     general crowd. By which double check no more than fifty could stand at one time with no barrier
     between their mortality and immortality! The railing itself was guarded every two yards by a
     yellow-legged constable, and at the sheep-pens stood the two European police-officers in whose
     hands the peace and order of the vast crowd lay. Their assistant stood at the exit gate at the
     other end, and their three white helmets showed strangely conspicuous amongst the bare or
     saffron-turbaned heads.
The two at the sheep-pens were talking and laughing to each other as Englishmen will before
     business begins; talking and laughing London talk, for one of them was fresh from home
     furlough, and had only been detailed for this special duty, on his way up country.
"Yes! I had a jolly day," he was saying. "The dear old Heath was looking just as it always
     did. It was like being born again to come back to the whole caboodle--Aunt Sallies, Tommy Dods,
     Welshers, and the lot--and then the enclosure--" A sudden sway in the crowd made him look round
     hastily at his own. It was all correct; so many yards this way, so many that, with yellow legs
     marking the yards, and those three white helmets marking the limits within which regeneration
     was legal.
The sway ceased. The moment had not yet come, though slowly, surely, the light grew, to give
     the great mass of bronze faces a greyish, corpse-like tint, while, half way up the sky behind
     them, the serrated edge of the sacred snows grew pale, and cold, and stern, like the very face
     of Death itself.
"Hârî! Hârâ! Hârâ! Hârî!"
There was a note of anxiety in the cry now; for the shadow thrown by the tall houses which
     hemmed in the wide courtyard was growing paler, and in another minute, at most, the twelve-foot
     square of cleansing water, which was all the Gods vouchsafed, must surely begin to rise and
     show at the bottom of those worn stone steps--worn by generations on generations of golden-shod
     feet seeking immortality.
"Stand back, please! Not yet!" came an English voice, inaudible for the rhythmic roar of the
     multitude; but the raised riding whip was sufficient. The eagerness died out for a moment from
     those nearest faces, lost in a cheerful obedience, a respectful salaam or two, a
     general acquiescence.
"I wish those devils of priests would turn on the tap," remarked the other Englishman with a
     yawn.
"Yes!" answered the first speaker; "if you are on duty, next year, I'd insist on the curtain
     being rung up at the bill time. It is rough on the audience; especially when they don't
     cat-call!"
He gave an imitation of a London gallery's sign of impatience, which made some of the
     golden-shod ones stare; for the rhythmic roar had died down in one of those sudden silences
     which seize upon humanity even when in masses. So that a faint
      "rumpa-tum-tum-rumpa-tum-tum" was distinctly audible from far. It was the
      tom-tom of the old Brahmin, whom Lance Carlyon had seen selling the endless circles
     of cut papers as a whole pantheon of Gods.
It is an eminently disturbing sound, that ceaseless, insistent throb of a tom-tom,
     which has no end, no beginning; which holds ever in its beat the necessity for something more;
     for another repetition, and yet another.
So, on its ceaselessness, broke in again that swaying, pulsing roar of many voices.
"Hârî! Hârâ! Life-Death-Creator-Destroyer!"
"Something must have gone wrong with the ball-cock, and as usual, the plumber will be 'in
      directly from another little job,'" said the man who had just come out from England,
     reminiscently. He had gone there to settle his wife and bairns in a jerry-built villa near
     London; so the memory of something beyond the iniquities of the plumber--those Borgias of
     modern life, dealing death unchecked, undiscovered--made his eyes pass beyond the crowd, pass
     the spires of the clustered temples, and settle on the still dark, western sky, over whose
     curved edge lay the goal of his solitary feet, the end of his pilgrimage, the
     cradle of his divinities.
"Stand back, please! not yet!" came his order again; and once more eagerness died down to
     obedience. Once more that cry on the Creator, the Destroyer, ended in that insistent, restless
     beat of the old god-selling Brahmin's drum.
It was a strange scene. Above, was the growing light of day; below, the square stone font of
     immortality, and between them a clamouring crowd, a careless few.
And between them what?
A light railing of bamboo, the dignity that doth hedge an empire. That was all.
And now, with a sudden access of light, came the quick indrawing breath of thousands to voice
     a sort of sharp, short sob, followed by an instant's silence.
Then, long, soft, with the hush in it of some huge wave far out at sea which swallows up a
     lesser one, the out-going breath of those thousands voiced a sigh.
For the pool was still empty, though the dawn had come.
Something was wrong.
Seriously wrong, to judge by one English face, as it turned to give a look round, then
     settled on another English face. "There's something up--God knows what--the Commissioner feared
     a row, you know. You'd better go to the Fort and ask Dering to send us down every man he can;
     men, you understand, not sabres--as yet. And tell Pidar Narâyan, he's a host in himself with
     these pilgrims,--Ramanund too, you might get him,--we want anyone who can help the crowd to
     keep its temper, though I don't expect he'd be much good--and there's no one else. Inspector!"
     here the police officer turned to a silver-laced turban beside the outer pen, "leave that in
     charge of Govinda and Suchet--Stay! Shiv-deo will be better; he is a high-caste Brahmin. And
     you go and send every twice-born constable you've got, and can trust, to every alley
     and street that leads here; for there will be an awful crush when those in front don't move on.
     And--" he wrinkled his forehead in hasty thought--"have we anyone connected with the temple
     priests, someone they can trust? Ah! Annant, of course,--the very man! Send him to find out if
     there is anything really wrong; and--" he lowered his voice, "if it is anything to do with the
     siphon, or whatever it is, get workmen and set it straight--pour water down--anything! Only
     there must be a miracle. And be quick. If this crowd gets impatient--God help it!"
The last was to himself as he looked round the solid packed mass of humanity. There was no
     sigh of impatience in it as yet; only eagerness.
"And mind," he added, "no truncheons drawn till I myself give the order."
The word passed in a low tone round the square of authority, and that done, the head of it
     pulled out his cigar case. He might as well smoke while he could.
The crowd watched him, vaguely interested at his lack of interest in what was coming, until a
     faint forward sweep, a half-hearted shout came from behind; from those upturned faces which
     could not even see an Englishman lighting his cigar.
"Not yet! Stand back!" said the latter again, as the pressure on the sheep pen grew. And they
     stood back, all save a miserable-looking, dirt-clad, wild-eyed mendicant, who had wormed his
     way to the front, and now feared to lose it.
"Lo! brother," said big Govinda, a Sikh from Patiala, as he thrust him back gently, "have
     patience awhile. Give the Gods time. There is not water to wash a babe yet."
Shiv-deo, taller even than Govinda, a Saraswati Brahmin, if ever there was one, at the other
     side of the pen, twirled his mustache airily, and laughed. "Nay, Govinda," he called, "let the
     beggar in. He seeks but to drown vermin."
The rude jest served its turn, after the manner of policemen's jokes all over the world. The
     crowd close at hand tittered, caught up the cue, amused itself with additions; and those behind
     forgot the great question in curiosity. But not for long.
"Hârâ! Hârî! Hârî! Hârâ!"
The roar of relief rose up tumultuously, the mass of people swayed with that curious sidelong
     motion of a forward crowd, as, in the clear light, a trickle of water showed through the
     crevices of the paving stones at the bottom of the tank.
"Look out!" shouted the Englishman; but remonstrance in words was useless in that storm of
     sound. So big Govinda promptly snatched two intruders out of his pen, like puppies, by the
     scruff of their necks, one in each hand; and Shiv-deo, choosing out the nearest low-caste man
     unerringly, caught him in his arms like a baby, and literally tossed him on to the heads of the
     crowd, with a shout which, even in that uproar, could be heard of some in that nearest
     crush.
"Brahmins first, washerman! Thy sort can bathe in the suds of our clothes!"
And those who heard, ducked, and when the victim--who was not a washerman--fell
     amongst them, hustled and silenced him, and nodded to the big man whose claim to dignity was
     writ so plain upon his face.
But despite ready wit and sheer strength, one determined fellow would have made good his
     entrance, and so served as a bell-wether to that overwhelming flock, if a white hand and arm
     with silver buttons on the cuff--holding a silver-mounted hunting-crop, clubbed savagely
     short--had not come down-glinting in the first sunray like a sword--clear on the bare head as
     it ducked under the barrier.
The intruder, a big burly devotee, dropped on his face like a stone; then, to the striker's
     relief, sat up, and apparently howled; apparently, because that rhythmic roar smothered all
     individual sound.
"Hârâ! Hârî! Hârâ! Hârî!"
Suddenly, as it had begun, it stopped; for that faint inrush of water had stopped also;
     stopped, hesitated, then sunk out of sight again with a sort of drowning gurgle that came as an
     accompaniment to the only other sound; the insistent throbbing of the old God-maker's drum in
     the distance.
"Not enough pressure!" murmured the police officer to himself, judging that an attempt had
     been made to fill the tank in some new way. Then he frowned. There would be pressure enough and
     to spare among the crowd soon, most likely. What could be done to prevent it?
"Halt! by your right--single file!"
The order came, far back, from the widest street, and it was full ten minutes ere Lance
     Carlyon, with a following of Sikh pioneers, armed with spades and picks, could edge through the
     crowd, though it still yielded room to authority without a murmur. He had been on his way with
     a fatigue party to finish clearing the camp, when the assistant superintendent of police had
     met him, in the bazaar, and told him he was wanted.
"Send four of your men to clear the mud from the crevices of the stones," said the police
     officer, seizing on a possible diversion gladly, "it will serve to keep the crowd amused till
     Dering brings his men down."
As the four stalwart pioneers stepped to their work of making miracles, a stir of expectation
     ran through those first rows who could see. "Surely," they said to each other, "if the Masters
     took the job in hand, the Gods must needs send the water."
"Of a surety!" said Shiv-deo, catching the comment. "Do not the Gods always befriend the
     bold? Do not we, of Harriana, find the sacred river which the devils hid, though we have to dig
     three-hundred-feet wells to find it?"
This allusion to the extraordinarily deep wells dug by the peasantry in the almost rainless
     tract beneath which, so the legend goes, the river Saraswati still runs, passed from mouth to
     mouth consolingly.
Yea, if devils hid water, men found it.
Why not these men? since nothing was impossible to a miracle.
The sun was shining broadly now, as if it had been up for hours, and showed, far as the eye
     could reach down every lane and street and alley, nothing but that sea of upturned faces
     converging to one centre; wonderfully still, wonderfully patient.
"I wish someone would stop that cursed drum," said Lance, suddenly, "it's enough to give
     anyone the fidgets. I feel myself--" he broke off, and his memory going back to his jesting
     remark to Erda, his young face clouded. Was it possible he should never see her again? Was it
     possible that the Reverend David was to claim his paradise? He felt savage at the very thought,
     impatient, full of an almost righteous anger at everything, especially the drum-banger for
     making such an infernal noise.
And now, far back as before, an English voice could be heard giving an order. It was to
     loosen scabbards this time, and the police officer looked up hastily. It meant that, for the
     first time, the crowd must be hesitating in its quick obedience to command; perhaps because
     most of the troopers were Mahomedans.
"I hope they'll get through without using them," said the man responsible for peace and
     order, "but, steady! please, in case of a rush. Remember that if we yield more foot-room,
     someone must fall; then there will be the devil to pay. At present they are so tight
     packed they can't."
That, indeed, was the position. So long as authority could prevent those few yards of clear
     space about the pool being encroached upon, there was safety. So the barrier of men waited
     anxiously.
But no rush came; the reason of this being made clear when the file of troopers appeared, led
     by old Pidar Narâyan, who had joined the party at the crucial moment, and piloted them through
     the crowd, which gave way to his well-known figure with absolute alacrity. He turned at the
     entrance, to hold up his hand in priestly fashion.
"Patience, my children!" he said sternly. "Tarry ye the Lord's leisure! Let Him do what
     seemeth Him good!"
The idea, familiar to the least of them, brought instant assent and a sort of relieved sigh
     from those who heard it. Here was something they could understand. A man, set apart from others
     by his dress, his life, his invariable assumption of authority, his unquestioned claim to be
     mediator between the dim, inaccessible Creator and his creatures, to be interpreter of the
     hidden Mind.
But the police officer heaved his sigh of relief over the appearance of more matter.
     His barrier could now be one of men, standing shoulder to shoulder.
And such a barrier would soon be needed, since this latest contingent brought discouraging
     news. The priests were helpless. The secret supply had somehow been tampered with, but where,
     not even they could tell without help. And though they had sent, long before dawn, to both
     Am-ma and Gu-gu--the only two men likely to know anything or be able to do anything--neither
     could be found.
"And won't be," interrupted Vincent, suddenly remembering, as he listened, what he had seen
     the night before. "They are most likely in the plot; one of them, at any rate, was going up the
     Hâri in a dug-out late last night."
"Not Am-ma," put in Lance. "He started before that to go up the Hâra and pilot down a raft
     for the forest officer. I met him as I came back to dinner."
"Well, he is not get-at-able anyhow, and that's all we have to consider," said the police
     officer. "Briefly, the miracle is off the bill. Now, how the deuce are we to get the audience
     to go away peacefully?"
"Perhaps if I, as a fellow-countryman, and a Brahmin, were to address them--" began Ramanund,
     who had come down with Pidar Narâyan, feeling important at being summoned.
The latter turned to the man, whom he knew had long since rejected the faith of his fathers,
     and, so to speak, thrown the Almighty overboard to lighten his ship.
"You cannot argue with that, my son!" he said gently, pointing to the sea of patient, yet
     eager, faces. "No one of your sort ever has, in all the history of the world. That
     does not reason. It feels. Show it another miracle, and it will worship. Give it a cause, and
     it will espouse it. Give it a lead, and it will follow; but words--never!"
"Well, I hope to God no one will supply it with the wrong lead!" put in the police officer.
     "For the rest, we must hold the fort, I suppose. Inspector! when is the show--the miracle, I
     mean,--supposed to end?"
"Not till sunset, sir," said the man, salaaming.
"And it's now about six, I suppose. Eleven hours!" He took out his cigar-case and counted.
     "Yes! I'll last through. Inspector! Close your men in, and let them stand at ease. Captain
     Dering, if you can spare yours till then, I shall be obliged."
"Certainly. I left a troop with Roshan Khân, and orders to send word of any disturbance; and
     I wired to Dillon in case--"
Father Ninian shook his head. "There is no fear till this is settled." He pointed to the
     Pool.
And he was right. All through the long hot hours the crowd waited. Sometimes the cry,
      "Hârâ! Hârî!" burst out, to be followed by a faint rush. Sometimes the great mass
     stood silent, listening to the insistent throbbing of the old God-maker's drum in the distance,
     but through it all the note was patience. And it was patience, also, in the square enclosure of
     authority. Sometimes a would-be intruder would be lifted like a puppy, and chucked back to his
     fellows. Once or twice an English arm would go up, and come down on some more wilful head; but
     that was all.
And far away at the Fort the gong chimed the hours regularly up to twelve, and begun at one
     again.
But there was no fuss, no noise. The crowd stood their ground, giving no inch, and authority
     stood its ground and yielded none, since in that lay safety for all.
So, with a horrible slowness, the day dragged on, until at last the red sun sank behind the
     levels beyond the gaol; and the strain was over!
"I'll take a biscuit in my pocket next time," said the police officer, cheerfully, as, bit by
     bit, the stones of the courtyard began to show between the golden-shod feet. "Inspector! send
     your men to quarters, and let them eat their food." Then he walked over and looked down into
     the deep empty tank.
"It might have been full up," he said. "We couldn't have stopped them for a moment if they
     had had any sort of a lead over. And from what you told the Commissioner, sir,"--he turned to
     Father Ninian--"I was afraid of one."
The old priest stood watching the crowd disperse for a moment in silence.
"So was I," he said, "but I was mistaken, so far. Still, there is danger in the air. I feel
     it. I hear it."
And as he spoke, above the hum of the crowd, silent no longer, rose that insistent throbbing
     of the old God-maker's drum.
