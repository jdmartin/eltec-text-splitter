A MONOPOLY
Lance Carlyon was right in trusting Dr. Dillon's power of doing without help until Providence
     chose to send some. This was the easier task, in that he had made up his mind deliberately
     beforehand as to what his best course of action would be should an alarm of this sort occur.
     Therefore that imperative kling-kling of the telegraph bell which roused him in a
     second from his bed, where, ready dressed for any such emergency, he was sleeping the sleep of
     the just, found him alert, prepared for anything and everything.
So it has come, he thought, as he hastily wired back the comprehensive reply, "All right,
      await you." He felt as a doctor does when a dangerous symptom which he has foreseen as a
     possibility, shows itself. He had been on the lookout for this for days, but as the dawn would
     end the period during which it might be expected, he had, as in the outbreak of the cholera,
     had hopes that danger was over. His last thought, as he slept, had been this; he woke to find
     that the complication must be faced. Woke with a strong regret, but a stronger instinct of
     fight. So he slipped his feet into his shoes, jammed his big mushroom hat on his head out of
     pure habit, and so, armed cap-à-pie, with a brain quick to work, and a body ready to
     follow and obey, he ran across the sandy road to the Smiths' bungalow, realizing as he did so
     that a dust-storm was just beginning. That would delay both attack and relief. On the whole,
     this would be an advantage, since, once things were secure, half an hour or so would make no
     difference in the latter; whereas, he wanted every minute he could get now for preparation.
He had not warned Eugene Smith of his fears. There was never any use alarming people by mere
     probabilities, unless by so doing you could forearm them. And this was not the case here; since
     the safest--in fact the only--place of refuge for Mrs. Smith and the child, should trouble
     arise, was the semi-fortified roof above the gate of the gaol; and that he knew to be ready for
     use. He had, therefore, only to wake them, as quietly as might be, so as not to give the alarm
     to the servants. Fortune favoured him in this; for, just outside the verandah, he ran full tilt
     upon Eugene himself, tall, gaunt, in his sleeping-suit, carrying a roll of bedding on his back
     like a snail's shell. The heat of the evening had enticed him to sleep outside, as he
     preferred, à la Robinson Crusoe, and the dust-storm was sending him in.
"Hello, Dillon!" he cried, "what's up?--nothing wrong with my wife or the child--I
     hope--No!--" he gave a sigh of relief, "then it's the beastly dust-storm disturbed you, I
     suppose. Isn't it sickening to think how many times in the next six months we shall have to
     take up our beds and walk."
"H'm! Hope I shall have the chance," replied the doctor, dryly, recovering his breath. "No,
     it isn't the storm. They're going to try a row, Smith. Just had a wire from the Fort. There's a
     plot on, to come here and set the prisoners free, and that's dangerous. So, till the troops
     come, I think you'd better bring Mrs. Smith and Gladys to the gate--it's the safest place, and
     I've got everything ready. It mayn't be much; but the devils, whoever they are, might turn and
     rend you--especially if they fail with me."
Eugene Smith had dropped his snail-shell and sat down on it, aghast, in surprise; but he was
     up again before the doctor finished.
"By Jove!" he said rapidly, calmly as the doctor himself. "That's a taking up one's bed with
     a vengeance. I'll have 'em both ready in a jiffy--anything else?"
"No. I'll rummage round till you return--one forgets things to the last, sometimes. And I
     shall want your Remington and such like--I know where to find 'em."
A moment after he was striking a match to light the tall floor-lamp in Mrs. Smith's
     drawing-room. She had turned it out herself a few hours before, thinking, as she looked round
     the room, full of soft rose-shaded light, how pretty, how cosey it was. It had the same air of
     refined security now. Everything, down to a copy of the last 'Queen' lying on an
     inlaid table by her favourite chair, was so exactly what one would have expected to find in her
     room; the room of a delicate, cultivated, civilized, society woman.
And now?
Now the delicacy, the culture, the civilization, the society, and the security belonging to
     them, had been invaded in an instant. By what?
The dust--you could almost see it springing into the air in these sandy stretches--had
     already settled thick over the dainty furniture, and as Dr. Dillon, standing by the table in
     the pink glow of the lamp, asked himself the question, he yielded to the imperious fascination
     which a smooth sand-surface has for humanity. But he did not write his name upon it; only the
     idle answer to the question.
"God knows."
The writing lay upon the table beside the latest fashions, staring up into the pink paper
     shade, after George Dillon had passed rapidly to Eugene's office to choose this, that, and the
     other, and make them into a bundle with a table-cloth.
When he returned to the drawing-room, Muriel Smith was standing by that writing in the sand:
     a fragile figure in a blue dressing-gown, all frilled and embroidered like the pictures in the
     paper. She looked more forlorn than frightened; forlorn and pathetic.
"Is it warm enough?" said the doctor, as he entered. "Your dress, I mean. There's a storm on,
     and it generally brings rain."
"It is flannel," she answered, and he nodded.
There was no excitement, no heroics. Only that. That, and the writing on the sand, and her
     forlornness--the forlornness of a delicate Dresden shepherdess set to drive a flock of real
     sheep to the shambles. But the needlessness, the pity of it, made Dr. Dillon set his teeth.
"Eugene will be here directly with Gladys," she said. "We thought it best not to wake her,
     and he said we had better start at once; for you see I can't walk nearly so fast as he
     does."
There was no trace of fear in her voice, but there was none of resistance either, and she
     turned at the door to look back with an almost reproachful acquiescence.
"Poor room," she said softly, "it seems so strange--such a pity; but I suppose it can't be
     helped." She turned to the darkness again with a little shiver, and went on, "Vincent sent the
     wire, I suppose."
"I didn't ask," replied Dr. Dillon curtly; then, repenting him, added, "I suppose so. He will
     be here directly I expect. And--and we will all take care of you and Gladys, as long as we can.
     You know that; and we can't do more--can we?"
She smiled quite tenderly. "Of course you will. And I am really not a bit afraid--except of
     being in the way."
She seemed to accept the necessity of this; perhaps rightly. For the storm itself was no joke
     in these desert stretches, where the sand rose in choking clouds, yet left enough to make each
     step a toil. Muriel stumbled along breathlessly, but so slowly that, when her husband joined
     them, striding along with Gladys, still sleeping, wrapped in a blanket in his arms, the doctor
     bade them come at their leisure and wait until he gave the signal before entering, then ran on
     swiftly to the gaol. For there was no time to lose; though, on the other hand, there was very
     little to be done. The less the better, if his plan was to be successful; since that involved
     the utmost quiet, and the keeping of the prisoners from all knowledge of what was going on as
     long as possible.
As he faced the choking darkness, the hot blasts of causeless wind, blowing all ways at once,
     George Dillon reckoned up his chances fairly. The storm would certainly make it easier to keep
     such knowledge from those within, and make it more difficult for those without to establish
     communication with the former. So far, good. On the other hand, no amount of the light at his
     command would enable him to see, even from his coign of vantage on the gateway roof, what was
     going on, either outside or inside. And darkness was the diggers' best friend; while digging
     was the recognized enemy of mud walls. Especially of those inside walls which divided the gaol
     into sections. Yet the best, the only chance of keeping the prisoners quiet, lay in preserving
     their segregation into companies.
For the gaol was of the cart-wheel pattern. That is, a huge circle of outside wall, thick as
     an earthwork, the felloes of the wheel, as it were. Then a small central cylinder of brick,
     like a lime kiln, the nave of the wheel, as it were. Between these two the spokes. Spokes of
     twelve feet high mud wall, dividing the whole into seven wedges of prison, absolutely distinct,
     blank, aperture-less, save for one heavily stanchioned door in the apex of each wedge, leading
     into the central tower. Exit or entry was therefore impossible to six of these wedges, except
     through the tower; that is the citadel, the key, as it were, of the gaol proper.
The seventh wedge, however, gave, at its wider end, on the entrance-gate, which was a square,
     semi-fortified building, pierced by a tunnel, gated at each end, and further protected by an
     outside yard, or roofless porch, also gated. The inmost of these three gates opened on to a
     small courtyard, and this narrowed again into an alley which gave access to the central tower.
     Briefly then the whole gaol consisted of six wedges opening, by a door in their narrow end,
     into the central cylinder; and a seventh wedge split in two by an alley leading between high
     mud walls from the gateway to that central tower; the key to the position.
In the two halves of the split wedge lay the warders' barracks, the solitary cells, the cook
     rooms, the hospital; and the entry to these was by a door on either side of the little
     courtyard, just beyond the inner gate. From the corner of this, also, rose the outside stair
     leading to the roof of the square, brick gateway.
Thus the fifteen hundred prisoners were broken up into companies of about two hundred each,
     and were absolutely without possibility of communication so long as the central tower was in
     the hands of authority. Unless there was time to undermine the mud walls, and tools, also,
     wherewith to work. Of these, however, there were none in the gaol. Nothing, even, that could be
     used to take their place, except in that seventh section which held the executive of the gaol;
     and there Dr. Dillon meant to leave no hands to use them, if he could compass it.
As he pulled up to regain his breath before walking up to the gate and giving the
     countersign, the whole place lay quiet and dark. So far, good. There was the risk, however, of
     the plot being known, and of the sentry refusing him entrance. It was not, however, and the
     next moment, calmly as if he was merely on one of his not infrequent rounds of unexpected night
     inspections, Dr. Dillon passed from the outer porch to the tunnel, and told the sentry at the
     inner gate to light the lamp in the little office room to one side.
"Call the superintendent," he said to the first man, "and you can tell him I am going to
     inspect the solitary cells."
He added this because he knew it would give time, since the superintendent would be sure to
     give a private look round, first, to see all was in order, and remove possible traces of
     tobacco or opium,--those luxuries out of which so much money can be made by gaol officials.
No sooner, however, had the first sentry gone through the door to the left section, than he
     sent the second one on a similar message to the right, where the hospital lay. Then, the coast
     being clear, he rapidly unlocked the private safe in the office which held his set of keys in
     case of accidents, and locked both the right and left doors. Secure for a moment, therefore,
     from interruption, he ran outside, saw that the tool rooms, etc., were closed, gave the signal
     to Eugene Smith, hurried the refugees up the stairs; and then, after unlocking the two doors
     again on his way back to the office, sat down in his usual chair and began to look over a
     register.
He was engaged in this calm occupation when, a minute or two after, the native
     superintendent--a big, dignified person, in a blatant undress due largely to his bulk--arrived
     breathless.
"Darogah-jee!" began Dr. Dillon, instantly, and the mere tone of the title made the
     man quiver, "I've had constantly to complain of the tobacco and opium smuggling that is going
     on among the warders, and I mean to stop it. I've had information to-night which will clinch
     the business. So take the night guard, rouse every warder, bring everyone here, even those on
     guard in the sections--the hospital orderlies--everyone, in fact, who is free to go out of the
     gaol. They are to come at once. No time allowed for arrangements. If they are not all here in
     five minutes I shall think you are in league with the smugglers."
The darogah's fat flesh shook, yet he winked as he went off. If the
      doctor-sahib expected to find anything in this fashion except, maybe, a smell of the
     forbidden drugs, he was mistaken. On such a night, too, when the dust was in everyone's eyes.
     Well! it might have been worse; for, though he knew nothing definitely of any plot, he could
     not fail to know that there was more to excite men in the gaol, that night, than tobacco or
     opium! So he went about his summons with a sigh of relief, and before the five minutes were
     over had his posse of minor officials together, including a file of unfettered prisoners, with
     good conduct badges, who were used as gang leaders. He himself finally coming down the alley,
     with a stupendous bunch of keys, followed by the little group of night warders he had collected
     from the other sections.
"All here?" asked Dr. Dillon, lighting a cigar. "The register, please, darogah. They
     will answer to their names, pass out through the wicket into the porch, and stay there until
     I've tallied the lot. I'm going to have it pakka[11]
     this time."
Some of the men grinned, some looked uneasy, and some few frowned; but all obeyed, though
     they cuddled themselves into their blankets as they slipped through the wicket, and faced the
     whirling, swirling storm in the open porch, the doors of which were barred, not solid.
"Kishen Rao?" came Dr. Dillon's voice, after a long series of names, followed by brief
      "presents!" and swift exits. There was no answer. He turned to the darogah
     for explanation.
"Absent!" explained the latter, timorously.
A little more decision might have saved him the quick question, "With or without leave?"
"Huzoor" palpitated the fat man, "he went out to bathe in the Holy Pool by
     permission this morning. He is of the utmost sobriety. A Brahmin, promoted by your Honour to,
     as your Honour knows, general head ward-keeper. He is not to be suspected."
"Leave till 5 P.M.," commented the doctor, looking over the register. "Mark him down absent
     without leave. Go on."
So, rapidly, the last man ducked under the wicket.
"Is that the lot?"
"Everyone, Protector of the Poor," protested the burly official, with smiles. "The prison is
     empty of the unfettered."
"Then let it remain so for the present," said Dr. Dillon, coolly, as he stepped forward,
     closed the wicket, slid the bolt to its place, and turned on the darogah, all in one
     swift sequence.
"Now, then!" he went on sharply, "you and I have to settle a bit of business. Your keys--" he
     took out a revolver, and laid it on the table beside him--"every key you have; duplicates,
     triplicates, everything! I'm going to keep this gaol myself for a bit. Do you understand?"
"Huzoor!" bleated the man, helplessly, putting his big bunch on the table.
Dr. Dillon smiled sarcastically. "Won't do, my friend. I want the lot by the list. Where's
     the register?"
When it came he ticked them off rapidly by it. "Sections B and C, warder's duplicate; where's
     that?" he asked.
The official grew green. "Kishen Rao--" he began--"but he is of the utmost--"
Dr. Dillon turned on him like lightning. "You're a damned scoundrel, sir! What else is
     missing?" He ran over the rest swiftly, then looked up suddenly with a scowl that made the man
     literally collapse. "So that's it, is it? Duplicate of B and C sections missing, and duplicate
     of the alley doors. A pretty little game!" he laughed sardonically.
"Kishen Rao--" gurgled the darogah--"by your Honour's promotion--of the
     utmost--"
"But it won't play, my friend; it won't play!" went on the doctor, with a curious elation. "I
     hold the thirteenth trump, now. You go in there,"--he pointed to an inner store-room behind the
     slip of an office; a windowless place, pitch dark, where the clothes in which the prisoners
     arrived awaited their release in piles--"and thank your stars you're in such good
     quarters."
All but that brief order, "You go in there," was spoken in English, as a sort of outlet for
     the intense satisfaction which was filling him at his own success,--so far.
The next minute he had turned the key on the darogah, and was up the stairs calling
     Eugene Smith in a low voice to come down and help to bolt and bar; but to come as quietly as he
     could.
"I've got rid of the lot," he said joyously, after he had explained the position in a few
     rapid words; "there isn't a soul in this section except the solitary cellers--who, of course,
     are ironed--a few sick people, and the assistant surgeon; but baboo-jee is an
     agnostic, and is so confoundedly afraid of the possibility of a future life that he may be
     trusted to go into green collapse if he hears a shot fired."
So, rapidly, the two men set to work, undisturbed by more than a protesting "Huzoor,
     what shall we do?" from the posse outside the first gate, and a low knocking at the wicket.
There were double doors here, however, and of the sort which it would need time to negotiate,
     without powder.
"They will hold out for an hour, at least," said the doctor; "then there will be the inner
     one, and after that the alley door--unless--" he remembered Kishen Rao, and frowned. That was
     the only weak spot in his armour. "We can count on an hour and a half, at least," he continued,
     carefully allowing for the worst; "longer, perhaps. Now then, Smith, for the toughest job! I've
     got a couple of crowbars here. Those first six steps--eight if we can--of the stairs must come
     down. There aren't enough of us to hold them."
So, for fully a quarter of an hour, no sound was heard above the curious vibration of the
     storm except the grinding and crushing of the bricks as they were rapidly eased out, one by
     one, from the mud mortar. The light of one of the office lamps, set on the ground, showed by
     that time a sheer drop of eight or ten feet, and Eugene Smith, working above, jammed his
     crowbar into a crevice of the wall against which the steps clung like a swallow's nest, and
     gave Dr. Dillon, who had been working below, a rope and a hand up.
The latter set down the keys and the lamp he had brought up with him, and deliberately dusted
     the knees of his trousers.
"There, that's done," he said. "Couldn't be better."
"Yes, it seems pretty safe," assented Eugene Smith, a trifle dubiously.
"Safe!" echoed the doctor, enthusiastically, "I haven't felt so safe for the last fortnight.
     Hullo! what's that?"
That was a sudden bugle-call. The doctor's face fell. "What, already! I didn't expect relief
     so soon. However, it can't be helped. I'll just go up and tell Dering what I've done, so that
     he may be prepared for the locked out ones!"
He took the light in his hand and crossed to the outer parapet.
"Hello, Dering!" he began, peering down. Then a couple of shots whizzed past his head and he
     ducked. At the same moment, as if roused by the concussion, the first crackling thunderclap of
     the dust-storm, sounding muffled through the thick air, followed like a roll-call, and
     reverberated dully, sluggishly, through the black darkness.
When it passed, Dr. Dillon's voice rose quietly.
"There will be no relief, Smith; those are the troopers, and they're against us. So
     now--we've got it to ourselves, Smith, for some time."
There was a certain satisfaction at the monopoly in his voice.
