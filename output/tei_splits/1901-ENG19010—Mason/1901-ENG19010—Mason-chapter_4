CHAPTER IV
M. Chateaudoux, the chamberlain, was a little portly person with a round, red face like a
     cherub's. He was a creature of the house, one that walked with delicate steps, a conductor of
     ceremonies, an expert in the subtleties of etiquette; and once he held his wand of office in
     his hand, there was nowhere to be found a being so precise and consequential. But out of doors
     he had the timidity of a cat. He lived, however, by rule and rote, and since it had always been
     his habit to take the air between three and four of the afternoon, he was to be seen between
     those hours at Innspruck on any fine day mincing along the avenue of trees before the villa in
     which his mistress was held prisoner.
On one afternoon during the month of October he passed a hawker, who, tired with his day's
     tramp, was resting on a bench in the avenue, and who carried upon his arm a half-empty basket
     of cheap wares. The man was ragged; his toes were thrusting through his shoes; it was evident
     that he wore no linen, and a week's growth of beard dirtily stubbled his chin,—in a word, he
     was a man from whom M. Chateaudoux's prim soul positively shrank. M. Chateaudoux went quickly
     by, fearing
      to be pestered for alms. The hawker, however, remained seated upon the bench,
     drawing idle patterns upon the gravel with a hazel stick stolen from a hedgerow.
The next afternoon the hawker was in the avenue again, only this time on a bench at the
     opposite end; and again he paid no heed to M. Chateaudoux, but sat moodily scraping the gravel
     with his stick.
On the third afternoon M. Chateaudoux found the hawker seated in the middle of the avenue and
     over against the door of the guarded villa. M. Chateaudoux, when his timidity slept, was
     capable of good nature. There was a soldier with a loaded musket in full view. The hawker,
     besides, had not pestered him. He determined to buy some small thing,—a mirror, perhaps, which
     was always useful,—and he approached the hawker, who for his part wearily flicked the gravel
     with his stick and drew a curve here and a line there until, as M. Chateaudoux stopped before
     the bench, there lay sketched at his feet the rude semblance of a crown. The stick swept over
     it the next instant and left the gravel smooth.
But M. Chateaudoux had seen, and his heart fluttered and sank. For here were plots, possibly
     dangers, most certainly trepidations. He turned his back as though he had seen nothing, and
     constraining himself to a slow pace walked towards the door of the villa. But the hawker was
     now at his side, whining in execrable German and a strong French accent the remarkable value of
     his wares.
      There were samplers most exquisitely worked, jewels for the most noble gentleman's
     honoured sweetheart, and purses which emperors would give a deal to buy. Chateaudoux was urged
     to take notice that emperors would give sums to lay a hand on the hawker's purses.
M. Chateaudoux pretended not to hear.
"I want nothing," he said, "nothing in the world;" and he repeated the statement in order to
     drown the other's voice.
"A purse, good gentleman," persisted the hawker, and he dangled one before Chateaudoux's
     eyes. Not for anything would Chateaudoux take that purse.
"Go away," he cried; "I have a sufficiency of purses, and I will not be plagued by you."
They were now at the steps of the villa, and the sentry, lifting the butt of his musket,
     roughly thrust the hawker back.
"What have you there? Bring your basket here," said he; and to Chateaudoux's consternation
     the hawker immediately offered the purse to the sentinel.
"It is only the poor who have kind hearts," he said; "here's the proper purse for a soldier.
     It is so hard to get the money out that a man is saved an ocean of drink."
The hawker's readiness destroyed any suspicions the sentinel may have felt.
"Go away," he said, "quick!"
"You will buy the purse?"

The sentinel raised his musket again.
"Then the kind gentleman will," said the hawker, and he thrust the purse into M.
     Chateaudoux's reluctant hand. Chateaudoux could feel within the purse a folded paper. He was
     committed now without a doubt, and in an extreme alarm he flung a coin into the roadway and got
     him into the house. The sentinel carelessly dropped the butt of his musket on the coin.
"Go," said he, and with a sudden kick he lifted the hawker half across the road. The hawker
     happened to be Charles Wogan, who took a little matter like that with the necessary philosophy.
     He picked himself up and limped off.
Now the next day a remarkable thing happened. M. Chateaudoux swerved from the regularity of
     his habits. He walked along the avenue, it is true; but at the end of it he tripped down a
     street and turned out of that into another which brought him to the arcades. He did not appear
     to enjoy his walk; indeed, any hurrying footsteps behind startled him exceedingly and made his
     face turn white and red, and his body hot and cold. However, he proceeded along the arcades to
     the cathedral, which he entered; and just as the clock struck half-past three, in a dark corner
     opposite to the third of the great statues he drew his handkerchief from his pocket.
The handkerchief flipped out a letter which fell onto the ground. In the gloom it was barely
     visible; and M. Chateaudoux walked on, apparently
      unconscious of his loss. But a comfortable citizen in a snuff-coloured suit picked
     it up and walked straight out of the cathedral to the Golden Fleece Inn in the Hochstrasse,
     where he lodged. He went up into his room and examined the letter. It was superscribed "To M.
     Chateaudoux," and the seal was broken. Nevertheless, the finder did not scruple to read it. It
     was a love-letter to the little gentleman from one Friederika.
"I am heart-broken," wrote Friederika, "but my fidelity to my Chateaudoux has not faltered,
     nor will not, whatever I may be called upon to endure. I cannot, however, be so undutiful as to
     accept my Chateaudoux's addresses without my father's consent; and my mother, who is of the
     same mind with me, insists that even with that consent a runaway marriage is not to be thought
     of unless my Chateaudoux can provide me with a suitable woman for an attendant."
These conditions fulfilled, Friederika was willing to follow her Chateaudoux to the world's
     end. The comfortable citizen in the snuff-coloured suit sat for some while over that letter
     with a strange light upon his face and a smile of great happiness. The comfortable citizen was
     Charles Wogan, and he could dissociate the obstructions of the mother from the willingness of
     the girl.
The October evening wove its veils from the mountain crests across the valleys; the sun and
     the daylight had gone from the room before Wogan tore that letter up and wrote another to the
     Chevalier
      at Bologna, telling him that the Princess Clementina would venture herself gladly
     if he could secure the consent of Prince Sobieski, her father. And the next morning he drove
     out in a carriage towards Ohlau in Silesia.
It was as the Chevalier Warner that he had first journeyed thither to solicit for his King
     the Princess Clementina's hand. Consequently he used the name again. Winter came upon him as he
     went; the snow gathered thick upon the hills and crept down into the valleys, encumbering his
     path. The cold nipped his bones; he drove beneath great clouds and through a stinging air, but
     of these discomforts he was not sensible. For the mission he was set upon filled his thoughts
     and ran like a fever in his blood. He lay awake at nights inventing schemes of evasion, and
     each morning showed a flaw, and the schemes crumbled. Not that his faith faltered. At some one
     moment he felt sure the perfect plan, swift and secret, would be revealed to him, and he lived
     to seize the moment. The people with whom he spoke became as shadows; the inns where he rested
     were confused into a common semblance. He was like a man in a trance, seeing ever before his
     eyes the guarded villa at Innspruck, and behind the walls, patient and watchful, the face of
     the chosen woman; so that it was almost with surprise that he looked down one afternoon from
     the brim of a pass in the hills and saw beneath him, hooded with snow, the roofs and towers of
     Ohlau.
At Ohlau Wogan came to the end of his luck.
      From the moment when he presented his letter he was aware of it. The Prince was
     broken by his humiliation and the sufferings of his wife and daughter. He was even inclined to
     resent them at the expense of the Chevalier, for in his welcome to Wogan there was a measure of
     embarrassment. His shoulders, which had before been erect, now stooped, his eyes were veiled,
     the fire had burnt out in him; he was an old man visibly ageing to his grave. He read the
     letter and re-read it.
"No," said he, impatiently; "I must now think of my daughter. Her dignity and her birth
     forbid that she should run like a criminal in fear of capture, and at the peril very likely of
     her life, to a king who, after all, is as yet without a crown." And then seeing Wogan flush at
     the words, he softened them. "I frankly say to you, Mr. Warner, that I know no one to whom I
     would sooner entrust my daughter than yourself, were I persuaded to this project. But it is
     doomed to fail. It would make us the laughing-stock of Europe, and I ask you to forget it. Do
     you fancy the Emperor guards my daughter so ill that you, single-handed, can take her from
     beneath his hand?"
"Your Highness, I shall choose some tried friends to help me."
"There is no single chance of success. I ask you to forget it and to pass your Christmas here
     as my very good friend. The sight is longer in age, Mr. Warner, than in youth, and I see far
     enough now to know that the days of Don Quixote are dead.
      Here is a matter where all Europe is ranged and alert on one side or the other.
     You cannot practise secrecy. At Ohlau your face is known, your incognito too. Mr. Warner came
     to Ohlau once before, and the business on which he came is common knowledge. The motive of your
     visit now, which I tell you openly is very grateful to me, will surely be suspected."
Wogan had reason that night to acknowledge the justice of the Prince's argument. He accepted
     his hospitality, thinking that with time he would persuade him to allow the attempt; and after
     supper, while making riddles in verse to amuse some of the ladies of the court, one of them,
     the Countess of Berg, came forward from a corner where she had been busy with pencil and paper
     and said, "It is our turn now. Here, Mr. Warner, is an acrostic which I ask you to solve for
     me." And with a smile which held a spice of malice she handed him the paper. Upon it there were
     ten rhymed couplets. Wogan solved the first four, and found that the initial letters of the
     words were C, L, E, M. The answer to the acrostic was "Clementina." Wogan gave the paper
     back.
"I can make neither head nor tail of it," said he. "The attempt is beyond my powers."
"Ah," said she, drily, "you own as much? I would never have believed you would have owned
     it."
"But what is the answer?" asked a voice at which Wogan started.

"The answer," replied the Countess, "is Mary, Queen of Scots, who was most unjustly
     imprisoned in Fotheringay," and she tore the paper into tiny pieces.
Wogan turned towards the voice which had so startled him and saw the gossamer lady whom he
     had befriended on the road from Florence. At once he rose and bowed to her.
"I should have presented you before to my friend, Lady Featherstone," said the Countess, "but
     it seems you are already acquainted."
"Indeed, Mr. Warner did me a great service at a pinch," said Lady Featherstone. "He was my
     postillion, though I never paid him, as I do now in thanks."
"Your postillion!" cried one or two of the ladies, and they gathered about the great stove as
     Lady Featherstone told the story of Wogan's charioting.
"I bade him hurry," said she, "and he outsped my bidding. Never was there a postillion so
     considerately inconsiderate. I was tossed like a tennis ball, I was one black bruise, I bounced
     from cushion to cushion; and then he drew up with a jerk, sprang off his horse, vanished into a
     house and left me, panting and dishevelled, a twist of torn ribbons and lace, alone in my
     carriage in the streets of Bologna."
"Bologna. Ah!" said the Countess, with a smile of significance at Wogan.
Wogan was looking at Lady Featherstone. His curiosity, thrust into the back of his mind by
     the
      more important matter of his mission now revived. What had been this lady's
     business who travelled alone to Bologna and in such desperate haste?
"Your Ladyship, I remember," he said, "gave me to understand that you were sorely put to it
     to reach Bologna."
Her Ladyship turned her blue eyes frankly upon Wogan. Then she lowered them.
"My brother," she explained, "lay at death's door in Venice. I had just landed at Leghorn,
     where I left my maid to recover from the sea, and hurrying across Italy as I did, I still
     feared that I should not see him alive."
The explanation was made readily in a low voice natural to one remembering a great distress,
     but without any affectation of gesture or so much as a glance sideways to note whether Wogan
     received it trustfully or not. Wogan, indeed, was reassured in a great measure. True, the
     Countess of Berg was now his declared enemy, but he need not join all her friends in that
     hostility.
"I was able, most happily," continued Lady Featherstone, "to send my brother homewards in a
     ship a fortnight back, and so to stay with my friend here on my way to Vienna, for we English
     are all bitten with the madness of travel. Mr. Warner will bear me out?"
"To be sure I will," said Wogan, stoutly. "For here am I in the depths of winter journeying
     to the carnival in Italy."
The Countess smiled, all disbelief and amusement,
      and Lady Featherstone turned quickly towards him.
"For my frankness I claim a like frankness in return," said she, with a pretty
     imperiousness.
Wogan was a little startled. He suddenly remembered that he had pretended to know no English
     on the road to Bologna, nor had he given any reason for his haste. But it was upon neither of
     these matters that she desired to question him.
"You spoke in parables," said she, "which are detestable things. You said you would not lose
     your black horse for the world because the lady you were to marry would ride upon it into your
     city of dreams. There's a saying that has a provoking prettiness. I claim a frank answer."
Wogan was silent, and his face took on the look of a dreamer.
"Come," said one. It was the Princess Charlotte, the second daughter of the Prince Sobieski,
     who spoke. "We shall not let you off," said she.
Wogan knew that she would not. She was a girl who was never checked by any inconvenience her
     speech might cause. Her tongue was a watchman's rattle, and she never spoke but she laughed to
     point the speech.
"Be frank," said the Countess; "it is a matter of the heart, and so proper food for
     women."
"True," answered Wogan, lightly, "it is a matter of the heart, and in such matters can one be
     frank—even to oneself?"
Wogan was immediately puzzled by the curious
      look Lady Featherstone gave him. The words were a mere excuse, yet she seemed to
     take them very seriously. Her eyes sounded him.
"Yes," she said slowly; "are you frank, even to yourself?" and she spoke as though a
     knowledge of the answer would make a task easier to her.
Wogan's speculations, however, were interrupted by the entrance of Princess Casimira,
     Sobieski's eldest daughter. Wogan welcomed her coming for the first time in all his life, for
     she was a kill-joy, a person of an extraordinary decorum. According to Wogan, she was "that
     black care upon the horseman's back which the poets write about." Her first question if she was
     spoken to was whether the speaker was from top to toe fitly attired; her second, whether the
     words spoken were well-bred. At this moment, however, her mere presence put an end to the
     demands for an explanation of Wogan's saying about his horse, and in a grateful mood to her he
     slipped from the room.
This evening was but one of many during that Christmastide. Wogan must wear an easy
     countenance, though his heart grew heavy as lead. The Countess of Berg was the Prince
     Constantine's favourite; and Wogan was not slow to discover that her smiling face and quiet
     eyes hid the most masterful woman at that court. He made himself her assiduous servant, whether
     in hunting amid the snow or in the entertainments at the palace, but a quizzical deliberate
     word would now and again show him that she was still his enemy. With the
      Princess Casimira he was a profound critic of observances: he invented a new
     cravat and was most careful that there should never be a wrinkle in his stockings; with the
     Princess Charlotte he laughed till his head sang. He played all manner of parts; the palace
     might have been the stage of a pantomime and himself the harlequin. But for all his efforts it
     did not seem that he advanced his cause; and if he made headway one evening with the Prince,
     the next morning he had lost it, and so Christmas came and passed.
But two days after Christmas a courier brought a letter to the castle. He came in the
     evening, and the letter was carried to Wogan while he was at table. He noticed at once that it
     was in his King's hand, and he slipped it quickly into his pocket. It may have been something
     precipitate in his manner, or it may have been merely that all were on the alert to mark his
     actions, but at once curiosity was aroused. No plain words were said; but here and there heads
     nodded together and whispered, and while some eyed Wogan suspiciously, a few women whose hearts
     were tuned to a sympathy with the Princess in her imprisonment, or touched with the notion of a
     romantic attachment, smiled upon him their encouragement. The Countess of Berg for once was
     unobservant, however.
Wogan made his escape from the company as soon as he could, and going up to his apartments
     read the letter. The moon was at its full, and what with the clear, frosty air, and the snow
     stretched
      over the world like a white counterpane, he was able to read the letter by the
     window without the light of a candle. It was written in the Chevalier's own cipher and hand; it
     asked anxiously for news and gave some. Wogan had had occasion before to learn that cipher by
     heart. He stood by the window and spelled the meaning. Then he turned to go down; but at the
     door his foot slipped upon the polished boards, and he stumbled onto his knee. He picked
     himself up, and thinking no more of the matter rejoined the company in a room where the
     Countess of Berg was playing upon a harp.
"The King," said Wogan, drawing the Prince apart, "leaves Bologna for Rome."
"So the letter came from him?" asked the Prince, with an eagerness which could not but seem
     hopeful to his companion.
"And in his own hand," replied Wogan.
The Prince shuffled and hesitated as though he was curious to hear particulars. Wogan thought
     it wise to provoke his curiosity by disregarding it. It seemed that there was wisdom in his
     reticence, for a little later the Prince took him aside while the Countess of Berg was still
     playing upon her harp, and said,—
"Single-handed you could do nothing. You would need friends."
Wogan took a slip of paper from his pocket and gave it to the Prince.
"On that slip," said he, "I wrote down the
      names of all the friends whom I could trust, and by the side of the names the
     places where I could lay my hands upon them. One after the other I erased the names until only
     three remained."
The Prince nodded and read out the names.
"Gaydon, Misset, O'Toole. They are good men?"
"The flower of Ireland. Those three names have been my comfort these last three weeks."
"And all the three at Schlestadt. How comes that about?"
"Your Highness, they are all three officers in Dillon's Irish regiment, and so have that
     further advantage."
"Advantage?"
"Your Highness," said Wogan, "Schlestadt is near to Strasbourg, which again is not far from
     Innspruck, and being in French territory would be the most convenient place to set off
     from."
There was a sound of a door shutting; the Prince started, looked at Wogan, and laughed. He
     had been upon the verge of yielding; but for that door Wogan felt sure he would have yielded.
     Now, however, he merely walked away to the Countess of Berg, and sitting beside her asked her
     to play a particular tune. But he still held the slip of paper in his hand and paid but a
     scanty heed to the music, now and then looking doubtfully towards Wogan, now and then scanning
     that long list of names. His lips, too, moved as though he was framing the three selected
     names, Gaydon, Misset, O'Toole, and
      "Schlestadt" as a bracket uniting them. Then he suddenly rose up and crossed the
     room to Wogan.
"My daughter wrote that a woman must attend her. It is a necessary provision."
"Your Highness, Misset has a wife, and the wife matches him."
"They are warned to be ready?"
"At your Highness's first word that slip of paper travels to Schlestadt. It is unsigned, it
     imperils no one, it betrays nothing. But it will tell its story none the less surely to those
     three men, for Gaydon knows my hand."
The Prince smiled in approval.
"You have prudence, Mr. Warner, as well as audacity," said he. He gave the paper back,
     listened for a little to the Countess, who was bending over her harp-strings, and then
     remarked, "The Prince's letter was in his own hand too?"
"But in cipher."
"Ah!"
The Prince was silent for a while. He balanced himself first on one foot, then on the
     other.
"Ciphers," said he, "are curious things, compelling to the imagination and a provocation to
     the intellect."
Mr. Wogan kept a grave face and he replied with unconcern, though his heart beat quick; for
     if the Prince had so much desire to see the Chevalier's letter, he must be well upon his way to
     consenting to Wogan's plan.

"If your Highness will do me the honour to look at this cipher. It has baffled the most
     expert."
His Highness condescended to be pleased with Wogan's suggestion. Wogan crossed the room
     towards the door; but before he reached it, the Countess of Berg suddenly took her fingers from
     her harp-strings with a gesture of annoyance.
"Mr. Warner," she said, "will you do me the favour to screw this wire tighter?" And once or
     twice she struck it with her fingers.
"May I claim that privilege?" said the Prince.
"Your Highness does me too much honour," said the Countess, but the Prince was already at her
     side. At once she pointed out to him the particular string. Wogan went from the room and up the
     great staircase. He was lodged in a wing of the palace. From the head of the staircase he
     proceeded down a long passage. Towards the end of this passage another short passage branched
     off at a right angle on the left-hand side. At the corner of the two passages stood a table
     with a lamp and some candlesticks. This time Wogan took a candle, and lighting it at the lamp
     turned into the short passage. It was dark but for the light of Wogan's candle, and at the end
     of it facing him were two doors side by side. Both doors were closed, and of these the one on
     the left gave onto his room.
Wogan had walked perhaps halfway from the corner to his door before he stopped. He stopped
     suddenly and held his breath. Then he shaded his candle with the palm of his hand and looked
     forward.
      Immediately he turned, and walking on tiptoe came silently back into the big
     passage. Even this was not well lighted; it stretched away upon his right and left, full of
     shadows. But it was silent. The only sounds which reached Wogan as he stood there and listened
     were the sounds of people moving and speaking at a great distance. He blew out his candle,
     cautiously replaced it on the table, and crept down again towards his room. There was no window
     in this small passage, there was no light there at all except a gleam of silver in front of him
     and close to the ground. That gleam of silver was the moonlight shining between the bottom of
     one of the doors and the boards of the passage. And that door was not the door of Wogan's room,
     but the room beside it. Where his door stood, there might have been no door at all.
Yet the moon which shone through the windows of one room must needs also shine into the
     other, unless, indeed, the curtains were drawn. But earlier in the evening Wogan had read a
     letter by the moonlight at his window; the curtains were not drawn. There was, therefore, a
     rug, an obstruction of some sort against the bottom of the door. But earlier in the evening
     Wogan's foot had slipped upon the polished boards; there had been no mat or skin at all. It had
     been pushed there since. Wogan could not doubt for what reason. It was to conceal the light of
     a lamp or candle within the room. Someone, in a word, was prying in Wogan's room, and Wogan
     began to
      consider who. It was not the Countess, who was engaged upon her harp, but the
     Countess had tried to detain him. Wogan was startled as he understood the reason of her harp
     becoming so suddenly untuned. She had spoken to him with so natural a spontaneity, she had
     accepted the Prince's aid with so complete an absence of embarrassment; but none the less Wogan
     was sure that she knew. Moreover, a door had shut—yes, while he was speaking to the Prince a
     door had shut.
So far Wogan's speculations had travelled when the moonlight streamed out beneath his door
     too. It made now a silver line across the passage broken at the middle by the wall between the
     rooms. The mat had been removed, the candle put out, the prying was at an end; in another
     moment the door would surely open. Now Wogan, however anxious to discover who it was that
     spied, was yet more anxious that the spy should not discover that the spying was detected. He
     himself knew, and so was armed; he did not wish to arm his enemies with a like knowledge. There
     was no corner in the passage to conceal him; there was no other door behind which he could
     slip. When the spy came out, Wogan would inevitably be discovered. He made up his mind on the
     instant. He crept back quickly and silently out of the mouth of the passage, then he made a
     noise with his feet, turned again into the passage, and walked loudly towards his door. Even so
     he was only just in
      time. Had he waited a moment longer, he would have been detected. For even as he
     turned the corner there was already a vertical line of silver on the passage wall; the door had
     been already opened. But as his footsteps sounded on the boards, that line disappeared.
He walked slowly, giving his spy time to replace the letter, time to hide. He purposely
     carried no candle, he reached his door and opened it. The room to all seeming was empty. Wogan
     crossed to a table, looking neither to the right nor the left, above all not looking towards
     the bed hangings. He found the letter upon the table just as he had left it. It could convey no
     knowledge of his mission, he was sure. It had not even the appearance of a letter in cipher; it
     might have been a mere expression of Christmas good wishes from one friend to another. But to
     make his certainty more sure, and at the same time to show that he had no suspicion anyone was
     hiding in the room, he carried the letter over to the window, and at once he was aware of the
     spy's hiding-place. It was not the bed hangings, but close at his side the heavy window curtain
     bulged. The spy was at his very elbow; he had but to lift his arm—and of a sudden the letter
     slipped from his hand to the floor. He did not drop it on purpose, he was fairly surprised; for
     looking down to read the letter he had seen protruding from the curtain a jewelled shoe buckle,
     and the foot which the buckle adorned seemed too small and slender for a man's.

Wogan had an opportunity to make certain. He knelt down and picked up the letter; the foot
     was a woman's. As he rose up again, the curtain ever so slightly stirred. Wogan pretended to
     have remarked nothing; he stood easily by the window with his eyes upon his letter and his mind
     busy with guessing what woman his spy might be. And he remained on purpose for some while in
     this attitude, designing it as a punishment. So long as he stood by the window that unknown
     woman cheek by jowl with him must hold her breath, must never stir, must silently endure an
     agony of fear at each movement that he made.
At last he moved, and as he turned away he saw something so unexpected that it startled him.
     Indeed, for the moment it did more than startle him, it chilled him. He understood that slight
     stirring of the curtain. The woman now held a dagger in her hand, and the point of the blade
     stuck out and shone in the moonlight like a flame.
Wogan became angry. It was all very well for the woman to come spying into his room; but to
     take a dagger to him, to think a dagger in a woman's hand could cope with him,—that was too
     preposterous. Wogan felt very much inclined to sweep that curtain aside and tell his visitor
     how he had escaped from Newgate and played hide-and-seek amongst the chimney-pots. And although
     he restrained himself from that, he allowed his anger to get the better of his prudence. Under
     the impulse of his anger he acted. It was a whimsical
      thing that he did, and though he suffered for it he could never afterwards bring
     himself to regret it. He deliberately knelt down and kissed the instep of the foot which
     protruded from the curtain. He felt the muscles of the foot tighten, but the foot was not
     withdrawn. The curtain shivered and shook, but no cry came from behind it, and again the
     curtain hung motionless. Wogan went out of the room and carried the letter to the Prince. The
     Countess of Berg was still playing upon her harp, and she gave no sign that she remarked his
     entrance. She did not so much as shoot one glance of curiosity towards him. The Prince carried
     the letter off to his cabinet, while Wogan sat down beside the Countess and looked about the
     room.
"I have not seen Lady Featherstone this evening," said he.
"Have you not?" asked the Countess, easily.
"Not so much as her foot," replied Wogan.
The conviction came upon him suddenly. Her hurried journey to Bologna and her presence at
     Ohlau were explained to him now by her absence from the room. His own arrival at Bologna had
     not remained so secret as he had imagined. The fragile and gossamer lady, too flowerlike for
     the world's rough usage, was the woman who had spied in his room and who had possessed the
     courage to stand silent and motionless behind the curtain after her presence there had been
     discovered. Wogan had a picture before his eyes of the dagger she had held. It was plain that
     she would stop at nothing
      to hinder this marriage, to prevent the success of his design; and somehow the
     contrast between her appearance and her actions had something uncanny about it. Wogan was
     inclined to shiver as he sat chatting with the Countess. He was not reassured when Lady
     Featherstone boldly entered the room; she meant to face him out. He remarked, however, with a
     trifle of satisfaction that for the first time she wore rouge upon her cheeks.
