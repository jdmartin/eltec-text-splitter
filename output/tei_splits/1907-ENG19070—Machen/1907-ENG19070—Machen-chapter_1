I
There was a glow in the sky as if great furnace doors were opened.
But all the afternoon his eyes had looked on glamour; he had strayed in fairyland. The
     holidays were nearly done, and Lucian Taylor had gone out resolved to lose himself, to discover
     strange hills and prospects that he had never seen before. The air was still, breathless,
     exhausted after heavy rain, and the clouds looked as if they had been molded of lead. No breeze
     blew upon the hill, and down in the well of the valley not a dry leaf stirred, not a bough
     shook in all the dark January woods.
About a mile from the rectory he had diverged from the main road by an opening that promised
     mystery and adventure. It was an old neglected lane, little more than a ditch, worn ten feet
     deep by its winter waters, and shadowed by great untrimmed hedges, densely woven together. On
     each side were turbid streams, and here and there a torrent of water gushed down the banks,
     flooding the lane. It was so deep and dark that he could not get a glimpse of the country
     through which he was passing, but the way went down and down to some unconjectured hollow.
Perhaps he walked two miles between the high walls of the lane before its descent ceased, but
     he thrilled with the sense of having journeyed very far, all the long way from the know to the
     unknown. He had come as it were into the bottom of a bowl amongst the hills, and black woods
     shut out the world. From the road behind him, from the road before him, from the unseen wells
     beneath the trees, rivulets of waters swelled and streamed down towards the center to the brook
     that crossed the lane. Amid the dead and wearied silence of the air, beneath leaden and
     motionless clouds, it was strange to hear such a tumult of gurgling and rushing water, and he
     stood for a while on the quivering footbridge and watched the rush of dead wood and torn
     branches and wisps of straw, all hurrying madly past him, to plunge into the heaped spume, the
     barmy froth that had gathered against a fallen tree.
Then he climbed again, and went up between limestone rocks, higher and higher, till the noise
     of waters became indistinct, a faint humming of swarming hives in summer. He walked some
     distance on level ground, till there was a break in the banks and a stile on which he could
     lean and look out. He found himself, as he had hoped, afar and forlorn; he had strayed into
     outland and occult territory. From the eminence of the lane, skirting the brow of a hill, he
     looked down into deep valleys and dingles, and beyond, across the trees, to remoter country,
     wild bare hills and dark wooded lands meeting the grey still sky. Immediately beneath his feet
     the ground sloped steep down to the valley, a hillside of close grass patched with dead
     bracken, and dotted here and there with stunted thorns, and below there were deep oak woods,
     all still and silent, and lonely as if no one ever passed that way. The grass and bracken and
     thorns and woods, all were brown and grey beneath the leaden sky, and as Lucian looked he was
     amazed, as though he were reading a wonderful story, the meaning of which was a little greater
     than his understanding. Then, like the hero of a fairy-book, he went on and on, catching now
     and again glimpses of the amazing country into which he had penetrated, and perceiving rather
     than seeing that as the day waned everything grew more grey and somber. As he advanced he heard
     the evening sounds of the farms, the low of the cattle, and the barking of the sheepdogs; a
     faint thin noise from far away. It was growing late, and as the shadows blackened he walked
     faster, till once more the lane began to descend, there was a sharp turn, and he found himself,
     with a good deal of relief, and a little disappointment, on familiar ground. He had nearly
     described a circle, and knew this end of the lane very well; it was not much more than a mile
     from home. He walked smartly down the hill; the air was all glimmering and indistinct,
     transmuting trees and hedges into ghostly shapes, and the walls of the White House Farm
     flickered on the hillside, as if they were moving towards him. Then a change came. First, a
     little breath of wind brushed with a dry whispering sound through the hedges, the few leaves
     left on the boughs began to stir, and one or two danced madly, and as the wind freshened and
     came up from a new quarter, the sapless branches above rattled against one another like bones.
     The growing breeze seemed to clear the air and lighten it. He was passing the stile where a
     path led to old Mrs. Gibbon's desolate little cottage, in the middle of the fields, at some
     distance even from the lane, and he saw the light blue smoke of her chimney rise distinct above
     the gaunt greengage trees, against a pale band that was broadening along the horizon. As he
     passed the stile with his head bent, and his eyes on the ground, something white started out
     from the black shadow of the hedge, and in the strange twilight, now tinged with a flush from
     the west, a figure seemed to swim past him and disappear. For a moment he wondered who it could
     be, the light was so flickering and unsteady, so unlike the real atmosphere of the day, when he
     recollected it was only Annie Morgan, old Morgan's daughter at the White House. She was three
     years older than he, and it annoyed him to find that though she was only fifteen, there had
     been a dreadful increase in her height since the summer holidays. He had got to the bottom of
     the hill, and, lifting up his eyes, saw the strange changes of the sky. The pale band had
     broadened into a clear vast space of light, and above, the heavy leaden clouds were breaking
     apart and driving across the heaven before the wind. He stopped to watch, and looked up at the
     great mound that jutted out from the hills into mid-valley. It was a natural formation, and
     always it must have had something of the form of a fort, but its steepness had been increased
     by Roman art, and there were high banks on the summit which Lucian's father had told him were
     the vallum of the camp, and a deep ditch had been dug to the north to sever it from
     the hillside. On this summit oaks had grown, queer stunted-looking trees with twisted and
     contorted trunks, and writhing branches; and these now stood out black against the lighted sky.
     And then the air changed once more; the flush increased, and a spot like blood appeared in the
     pond by the gate, and all the clouds were touched with fiery spots and dapples of flame; here
     and there it looked as if awful furnace doors were being opened.
The wind blew wildly, and it came up through the woods with a noise like a scream, and a
     great oak by the roadside ground its boughs together with a dismal grating jar. As the red
     gained in the sky, the earth and all upon it glowed, even the grey winter fields and the bare
     hillsides crimsoned, the waterpools were cisterns of molten brass, and the very road glittered.
     He was wonder-struck, almost aghast, before the scarlet magic of the afterglow. The old Roman
     fort was invested with fire; flames from heaven were smitten about its walls, and above there
     was a dark floating cloud, like fume of smoke, and every haggard writhing tree showed as black
     as midnight against the black of the furnace.
When he got home he heard his mother's voice calling: "Here's Lucian at last. Mary, Master
     Lucian has come, you can get the tea ready." He told a long tale of his adventures, and felt
     somewhat mortified when his father seemed perfectly acquainted with the whole course of the
     lane, and knew the names of the wild woods through which he had passed in awe.
"You must have gone by the Darren, I suppose"â€”that was all he said. "Yes, I noticed the
     sunset; we shall have some stormy weather. I don't expect to see many in church tomorrow."
There was buttered toast for tea "because it was holidays." The red curtains were drawn, and
     a bright fire was burning, and there was the old familiar furniture, a little shabby, but
     charming from association. It was much pleasanter than the cold and squalid schoolroom; and
     much better to be reading Chambers's Journal than learning Euclid; and better to talk
     to his father and mother than to be answering such remarks as: "I say, Taylor, I've torn my
     trousers; how much do you charge for mending?" "Lucy, dear, come quick and sew this button on
     my shirt."
That night the storm woke him, and he groped with his hands amongst the bedclothes, and sat
     up, shuddering, not knowing where he was. He had seen himself, in a dream, within the Roman
     fort, working some dark horror, and the furnace doors were opened and a blast of flame from
     heaven was smitten upon him.
Lucian went slowly, but not discreditably, up the school, gaining prizes now and again, and
     falling in love more and more with useless reading and unlikely knowledge. He did his elegiacs
     and iambics well enough, but he preferred exercising himself in the rhymed Latin of the middle
     ages. He liked history, but he loved to meditate on a land laid waste, Britain deserted by the
     legions, the rare pavements riven by frost, Celtic magic still brooding on the wild hills and
     in the black depths of the forest, the rosy marbles stained with rain, and the walls growing
     grey. The masters did not encourage these researches; a pure enthusiasm, they felt, should be
     for cricket and football, the dilettanti might even play fives and read Shakespeare
     without blame, but healthy English boys should have nothing to do with decadent periods. He was
     once found guilty of recommending Villon to a school-fellow named Barnes. Barnes tried to
     extract unpleasantness from the text during preparation, and rioted in his place, owing to his
     incapacity for the language. The matter was a serious one; the headmaster had never heard of
     Villon, and the culprit gave up the name of his literary admirer without remorse. Hence, sorrow
     for Lucian, and complete immunity for the miserable illiterate Barnes, who resolved to confine
     his researches to the Old Testament, a book which the headmaster knew well. As for Lucian, he
     plodded on, learning his work decently, and sometimes doing very creditable Latin and Greek
     prose. His school-fellows thought him quite mad, and tolerated him, and indeed were very kind
     to him in their barbarous manner. He often remembered in after life acts of generosity and good
     nature done by wretches like Barnes, who had no care for old French nor for curious meters, and
     such recollections always moved him to emotion. Travelers tell such tales; cast upon cruel
     shores amongst savage races, they have found no little kindness and warmth of hospitality.
He looked forward to the holidays as joyfully as the rest of them. Barnes and his friend
     Duscot used to tell him their plans and anticipation; they were going home to brothers and
     sisters, and to cricket, more cricket, or to football, more football, and in the winter there
     were parties and jollities of all sorts. In return he would announce his intention of studying
     the Hebrew language, or perhaps Provençal, with a walk up a bare and desolate mountain by way
     of open-air amusement, and on a rainy day for choice. Whereupon Barnes would impart to Duscot
     his confident belief that old Taylor was quite cracked. It was a queer, funny life that of
     school, and so very unlike anything in Tom Brown. He once saw the headmaster patting
     the head of the bishop's little boy, while he called him "my little man," and smiled hideously.
     He told the tale grotesquely in the lower fifth room the same day, and earned much applause,
     but forfeited all liking directly by proposing a voluntary course of scholastic logic. One
     barbarian threw him to the ground and another jumped on him, but it was done very pleasantly.
     There were, indeed, some few of a worse class in the school, solemn sycophants, prigs perfected
     from tender years, who thought life already "serious," and yet, as the headmaster said, were
     "joyous, manly young fellows." Some of these dressed for dinner at home, and talked of dances
     when they came back in January. But this virulent sort was comparatively infrequent, and
     achieved great success in after life. Taking his school days as a whole, he always spoke up for
     the system, and years afterward he described with enthusiasm the strong beer at a roadside
     tavern, some way out of the town. But he always maintained that the taste for tobacco, acquired
     in early life, was the great life, was the great note of the English Public School.
Three years after Lucian's discovery of the narrow lane and the vision of the flaming fort,
     the August holidays brought him home at a time of great heat. It was one of those memorable
     years of English weather, when some Provençal spell seems wreathed round the island in the
     northern sea, and the grasshoppers chirp loudly as the cicadas, the hills smell of rosemary,
     and white walls of the old farmhouses blaze in the sunlight as if they stood in Arles or
     Avignon or famed Tarascon by Rhone.
Lucian's father was late at the station, and consequently Lucian bought the Confessions
      of an English Opium Eater which he saw on the bookstall. When his father did drive up,
     Lucian noticed that the old trap had had a new coat of dark paint, and that the pony looked
     advanced in years.
"I was afraid that I should be late, Lucian," said his father, "though I made old Polly go
     like anything. I was just going to tell George to put her into the trap when young Philip
     Harris came to me in a terrible state. He said his father fell down 'all of a sudden like' in
     the middle of the field, and they couldn't make him speak, and would I please to come and see
     him. So I had to go, though I couldn't do anything for the poor fellow. They had sent for Dr.
     Burrows, and I am afraid he will find it a bad case of sunstroke. The old people say they never
     remember such a heat before."
The pony jogged steadily along the burning turnpike road, taking revenge for the hurrying on
     the way to the station. The hedges were white with the limestone dust, and the vapor of heat
     palpitated over the fields. Lucian showed his Confessions to his father, and began to
     talk of the beautiful bits he had already found. Mr. Taylor knew the book wellâ€”had read it
     many years before. Indeed he was almost as difficult to surprise as that character in Daudet,
     who had one formula for all the chances of life, and when he saw the drowned Academician
     dragged out of the river, merely observed "J'ai vu tout ça." Mr. Taylor the parson, as
     his parishioners called him, had read the fine books and loved the hills and woods, and now
     knew no more of pleasant or sensational surprises. Indeed the living was much depreciated in
     value, and his own private means were reduced almost to vanishing point, and under such
     circumstances the great style loses many of its finer savors. He was very fond of Lucian, and
     cheered by his return, but in the evening he would be a sad man again, with his head resting on
     one hand, and eyes reproaching sorry fortune.
Nobody called out "Here's your master with Master Lucian; you can get tea ready," when the
     pony jogged up to the front door. His mother had been dead a year, and a cousin kept house. She
     was a respectable person called Deacon, of middle age, and ordinary standards; and,
     consequently, there was cold mutton on the table. There was a cake, but nothing of flour, baked
     in ovens, would rise at Miss Deacon's evocation. Still, the meal was laid in the beloved
     "parlor," with the view of hills and valleys and climbing woods from the open window, and the
     old furniture was still pleasant to see, and the old books in the shelves had many memories.
     One of the most respected of the armchairs had become weak in the castors and had to be
     artfully propped up, but Lucian found it very comfortable after the hard forms. When tea was
     over he went out and strolled in the garden and orchards, and looked over the stile down into
     the brake, where foxgloves and bracken and broom mingled with the hazel undergrowth, where he
     knew of secret glades and untracked recesses, deep in the woven green, the cabinets for many
     years of his lonely meditations. Every path about his home, every field and hedgerow had dear
     and friendly memories for him; and the odor of the meadowsweet was better than the incense
     steaming in the sunshine. He loitered, and hung over the stile till the far-off woods began to
     turn purple, till the white mists were wreathing in the valley.
Day after day, through all that August, morning and evening were wrapped in haze; day after
     day the earth shimmered in the heat, and the air was strange, unfamiliar. As he wandered in the
     lanes and sauntered by the cool sweet verge of the woods, he saw and felt that nothing was
     common or accustomed, for the sunlight transfigured the meadows and changed all the form of the
     earth. Under the violent Provençal sun, the elms and beeches looked exotic trees, and in the
     early morning, when the mists were thick, the hills had put on an unearthly shape.
The one adventure of the holidays was the visit to the Roman fort, to that fantastic hill
     about whose steep bastions and haggard oaks he had seen the flames of sunset writhing nearly
     three years before. Ever since that Saturday evening in January, the lonely valley had been a
     desirable place to him; he had watched the green battlements in summer and winter weather, had
     seen the heaped mounds rising dimly amidst the drifting rain, had marked the violent height
     swim up from the ice-white mists of summer evenings, had watched the fairy bulwarks glimmer and
     vanish in hovering April twilight. In the hedge of the lane there was a gate on which he used
     to lean and look down south to where the hill surged up so suddenly, its summit defined on
     summer evenings not only by the rounded ramparts but by the ring of dense green foliage that
     marked the circle of oak trees. Higher up the lane, on the way he had come that Saturday
     afternoon, one could see the white walls of Morgan's farm on the hillside to the north, and on
     the south there was the stile with the view of old Mrs. Gibbon's cottage smoke; but down in the
     hollow, looking over the gate, there was no hint of human work, except those green and antique
     battlements, on which the oaks stood in circle, guarding the inner wood.
The ring of the fort drew him with stronger fascination during that hot August weather.
     Standing, or as his headmaster would have said, "mooning" by the gate, and looking into that
     enclosed and secret valley, it seemed to his fancy as if there were a halo about the hill, an
     aureole that played like flame around it. One afternoon as he gazed from his station by the
     gate the sheer sides and the swelling bulwarks were more than ever things of enchantment; the
     green oak ring stood out against the sky as still and bright as in a picture, and Lucian, in
     spite of his respect for the law of trespass, slid over the gate. The farmers and their men
     were busy on the uplands with the harvest, and the adventure was irresistible. At first he
     stole along by the brook in the shadow of the alders, where the grass and the flowers of wet
     meadows grew richly; but as he drew nearer to the fort, and its height now rose sheer above
     him, he left all shelter, and began desperately to mount. There was not a breath of wind; the
     sunlight shone down on the bare hillside; the loud chirp of the grasshoppers was the only
     sound. It was a steep ascent and grew steeper as the valley sank away. He turned for a moment,
     and looked down towards the stream which now seemed to wind remote between the alders; above
     the valley there were small dark figures moving in the cornfield, and now and again there came
     the faint echo of a high-pitched voice singing through the air as on a wire. He was wet with
     heat; the sweat streamed off his face, and he could feel it trickling all over his body. But
     above him the green bastions rose defiant, and the dark ring of oaks promised coolness. He
     pressed on, and higher, and at last began to crawl up the vallum, on hands and knees,
     grasping the turf and here and there the roots that had burst through the red earth. And then
     he lay, panting with deep breaths, on the summit.
Within the fort it was all dusky and cool and hollow; it was as if one stood at the bottom of
     a great cup. Within, the wall seemed higher than without, and the ring of oaks curved up like a
     dark green vault. There were nettles growing thick and rank in the foss; they looked different
     from the common nettles in the lanes, and Lucian, letting his hand touch a leaf by accident,
     felt the sting burn like fire. Beyond the ditch there was an undergrowth, a dense thicket of
     trees, stunted and old, crooked and withered by the winds into awkward and ugly forms; beech
     and oak and hazel and ash and yew twisted and so shortened and deformed that each seemed, like
     the nettle, of no common kind. He began to fight his way through the ugly growth, stumbling and
     getting hard knocks from the rebound of twisted boughs. His foot struck once or twice against
     something harder than wood, and looking down he saw stones white with the leprosy of age, but
     still showing the work of the axe. And farther, the roots of the stunted trees gripped the
     foot-high relics of a wall; and a round heap of fallen stones nourished rank, unknown herbs,
     that smelt poisonous. The earth was black and unctuous, and bubbling under the feet, left no
     track behind. From it, in the darkest places where the shadow was thickest, swelled the growth
     of an abominable fungus, making the still air sick with its corrupt odor, and he shuddered as
     he felt the horrible thing pulped beneath his feet. Then there was a gleam of sunlight, and as
     he thrust the last boughs apart, he stumbled into the open space in the heart of the camp. It
     was a lawn of sweet close turf in the center of the matted brake, of clean firm earth from
     which no shameful growth sprouted, and near the middle of the glade was a stump of a felled
     yew-tree, left untrimmed by the woodman. Lucian thought it must have been made for a seat; a
     crooked bough through which a little sap still ran was a support for the back, and he sat down
     and rested after his toil. It was not really so comfortable a seat as one of the school forms,
     but the satisfaction was to find anything at all that would serve for a chair. He sat there,
     still panting after the climb and his struggle through the dank and jungle-like thicket, and he
     felt as if he were growing hotter and hotter; the sting of the nettle was burning his hand, and
     the tingling fire seemed to spread all over his body.
Suddenly, he knew that he was alone. Not merely solitary; that he had often been amongst the
     woods and deep in the lanes; but now it was a wholly different and a very strange sensation. He
     thought of the valley winding far below him, all its fields by the brook green and peaceful and
     still, without path or track. Then he had climbed the abrupt surge of the hill, and passing the
     green and swelling battlements, the ring of oaks, and the matted thicket, had come to the
     central space. And behind there were, he knew, many desolate fields, wild as common, untrodden,
     unvisited. He was utterly alone. He still grew hotter as he sat on the stump, and at last lay
     down at full length on the soft grass, and more at his ease felt the waves of heat pass over
     his body.
And then he began to dream, to let his fancies stray over half-imagined, delicious things,
     indulging a virgin mind in its wanderings. The hot air seemed to beat upon him in palpable
     waves, and the nettle sting tingled and itched intolerably; and he was alone upon the fairy
     hill, within the great mounds, within the ring of oaks, deep in the heart of the matted
     thicket. Slowly and timidly he began to untie his boots, fumbling with the laces, and glancing
     all the while on every side at the ugly misshapen trees that hedged the lawn. Not a branch was
     straight, not one was free, but all were interlaced and grew one about another; and just above
     ground, where the cankered stems joined the protuberant roots, there were forms that imitated
     the human shape, and faces and twining limbs that amazed him. Green mosses were hair, and
     tresses were stark in grey lichen; a twisted root swelled into a limb; in the hollows of the
     rotted bark he saw the masks of men. His eyes were fixed and fascinated by the simulacra of the
     wood, and could not see his hands, and so at last, and suddenly, it seemed, he lay in the
     sunlight, beautiful with his olive skin, dark haired, dark eyed, the gleaming bodily vision of
     a strayed faun.
Quick flames now quivered in the substance of his nerves, hints of mysteries, secrets of life
     passed trembling through his brain, unknown desires stung him. As he gazed across the turf and
     into the thicket, the sunshine seemed really to become green, and the contrast between the
     bright glow poured on the lawn and the black shadow of the brake made an odd flickering light,
     in which all the grotesque postures of stem and root began to stir; the wood was alive. The
     turf beneath him heaved and sank as with the deep swell of the sea. He fell asleep, and lay
     still on the grass, in the midst of the thicket.
He found out afterwards that he must have slept for nearly an hour. The shadows had changed
     when he awoke; his senses came to him with a sudden shock, and he sat up and stared at his bare
     limbs in stupid amazement. He huddled on his clothes and laced his boots, wondering what folly
     had beset him. Then, while he stood indecisive, hesitating, his brain a whirl of puzzled
     thought, his body trembling, his hands shaking; as with electric heat, sudden remembrance
     possessed him. A flaming blush shone red on his cheeks, and glowed and thrilled through his
     limbs. As he awoke, a brief and slight breeze had stirred in a nook of the matted boughs, and
     there was a glinting that might have been the flash of sudden sunlight across shadow, and the
     branches rustled and murmured for a moment, perhaps at the wind's passage.
He stretched out his hands, and cried to his visitant to return; he entreated the dark eyes
     that had shone over him, and the scarlet lips that had kissed him. And then panic fear rushed
     into his heart, and he ran blindly, dashing through the wood. He climbed the vallum,
     and looked out, crouching, lest anybody should see him. Only the shadows were changed, and a
     breath of cooler air mounted from the brook; the fields were still and peaceful, the black
     figures moved, far away, amidst the corn, and the faint echo of the high-pitched voices sang
     thin and distant on the evening wind. Across the stream, in the cleft on the hill, opposite to
     the fort, the blue wood smoke stole up a spiral pillar from the chimney of old Mrs. Gibbon's
     cottage. He began to run full tilt down the steep surge of the hill, and never stopped till he
     was over the gate and in the lane again. As he looked back, down the valley to the south, and
     saw the violent ascent, the green swelling bulwarks, and the dark ring of oaks; the sunlight
     seemed to play about the fort with an aureole of flame.
"Where on earth have you been all this time, Lucian?" said his cousin when he got home. "Why,
     you look quite ill. It is really madness of you to go walking in such weather as this. I wonder
     you haven't got a sunstroke. And the tea must be nearly cold. I couldn't keep your father
     waiting, you know."
He muttered something about being rather tired, and sat down to his tea. It was not cold, for
     the "cozy" had been put over the pot, but it was black and bitter strong, as his cousin
     expressed it. The draught was unpalatable, but it did him good, and the thought came with great
     consolation that he had only been asleep and dreaming queer, nightmarish dreams. He shook off
     all his fancies with resolution, and thought the loneliness of the camp, and the burning
     sunlight, and possibly the nettle sting, which still tingled most abominably, must have been
     the only factors in his farrago of impossible recollections. He remembered that when he had
     felt the sting, he had seized a nettle with thick folds of his handkerchief, and having twisted
     off a good length, and put it in his pocket to show his father. Mr. Taylor was almost
     interested when he came in from his evening stroll about the garden and saw the specimen.
"Where did you manage to come across that, Lucian?" he said. "You haven't been to Caermaen,
     have you?"
"No. I got it in the Roman fort by the common."
"Oh, the twyn. You must have been trespassing then. Do you know what it is?"
"No. I thought it looked different from the common nettles."
"Yes; it's a Roman nettleâ€”arctic pilulifera. It's a rare plant. Burrows says it's
     to be found at Caermaen, but I was never able to come across it. I must add it to the
      flora of the parish."
Mr. Taylor had begun to compile a flora accompanied by a hortus siccus, but
     both stayed on high shelves dusty and fragmentary. He put the specimen on his desk, intending
     to fasten it in the book, but the maid swept it away, dry and withered, in a day or two.
Lucian tossed and cried out in his sleep that night, and the awakening in the morning was, in
     a measure, a renewal of the awakening in the fort. But the impression was not so strong, and in
     a plain room it seemed all delirium, a phantasmagoria. He had to go down to Caermaen in the
     afternoon, for Mrs. Dixon, the vicar's wife, had "commanded" his presence at tea. Mr. Dixon,
     though fat and short and clean shaven, ruddy of face, was a safe man, with no extreme views on
     anything. He "deplored" all extreme party convictions, and thought the great needs of our
     beloved Church were conciliation, moderation, and above all "amolgamation"â€”so he pronounced
     the word. Mrs. Dixon was tall, imposing, splendid, well fitted for the Episcopal order, with
     gifts that would have shone at the palace. There were daughters, who studied German Literature,
     and thought Miss Frances Ridley Havergal wrote poetry, but Lucian had no fear of them; he
     dreaded the boys. Everybody said they were such fine, manly fellows, such gentlemanly boys,
     with such a good manner, sure to get on in the world. Lucian had said "Bother!" in a very
     violent manner when the gracious invitation was conveyed to him, but there was no getting out
     of it. Miss Deacon did her best to make him look smart; his ties were all so disgraceful that
     she had to supply the want with a narrow ribbon of a sky-blue tint; and she brushed him so long
     and so violently that he quite understood why a horse sometimes bites and sometimes kicks the
     groom. He set out between two and three in a gloomy frame of mind; he knew too well what
     spending the afternoon with honest manly boys meant. He found the reality more lurid than his
     anticipation. The boys were in the field, and the first remark he heard when he got in sight of
     the group was:
"Hullo, Lucian, how much for the tie?" "Fine tie," another, a stranger, observed. "You bagged
     it from the kitten, didn't you?"
Then they made up a game of cricket, and he was put in first. He was l.b.w. in his second
     over, so they all said, and had to field for the rest of the afternoon. Arthur Dixon, who was
     about his own age, forgetting all the laws of hospitality, told him he was a beastly muff when
     he missed a catch, rather a difficult catch. He missed several catches, and it seemed as if he
     were always panting after balls, which, as Edward Dixon said, any fool, even a baby, could have
     stopped. At last the game broke up, solely from Lucian's lack of skill, as everybody declared.
     Edward Dixon, who was thirteen, and had a swollen red face and a projecting eye, wanted to
     fight him for spoiling the game, and the others agreed that he funked the fight in a rather
     dirty manner. The strange boy, who was called De Carti, and was understood to be faintly
     related to Lord De Carti of M'Carthytown, said openly that the fellows at his place wouldn't
     stand such a sneak for five minutes. So the afternoon passed off very pleasantly indeed, till
     it was time to go into the vicarage for weak tea, homemade cake, and unripe plums. He got away
     at last. As he went out at the gate, he heard De Carti's final observation:
"We like to dress well at our place. His governor must be beastly poor to let him go about
     like that. D'y' see his trousers are all ragged at heel? Is old Taylor a gentleman?"
It had been a very gentlemanly afternoon, but there was a certain relief when the vicarage
     was far behind, and the evening smoke of the little town, once the glorious capital of Siluria,
     hung haze-like over the ragged roofs and mingled with the river mist. He looked down from the
     height of the road on the huddled houses, saw the points of light start out suddenly from the
     cottages on the hillside beyond, and gazed at the long lovely valley fading in the twilight,
     till the darkness came and all that remained was the somber ridge of the forest. The way was
     pleasant through the solemn scented lane, with glimpses of dim country, the vague mystery of
     night overshadowing the woods and meadows. A warm wind blew gusts of odor from the meadowsweet
     by the brook, now and then bee and beetle span homeward through the air, booming a deep note as
     from a great organ far away, and from the verge of the wood came the "who-oo, who-oo, who-oo"
     of the owls, a wild strange sound that mingled with the whirr and rattle of the night-jar, deep
     in the bracken. The moon swam up through the films of misty cloud, and hung, a golden glorious
     lantern, in mid-air; and, set in the dusky hedge, the little green fires of the glowworms
     appeared. He sauntered slowly up the lane, drinking in the religion of the scene, and thinking
     the country by night as mystic and wonderful as a dimly-lit cathedral. He had quite forgotten
     the "manly young fellows" and their sports, and only wished as the land began to shimmer and
     gleam in the moonlight that he knew by some medium of words or color how to represent the
     loveliness about his way.
"Had a pleasant evening, Lucian?" said his father when he came in.
"Yes, I had a nice walk home. Oh, in the afternoon we played cricket. I didn't care for it
     much. There was a boy named De Carti there; he is staying with the Dixons. Mrs. Dixon whispered
     to me when we were going in to tea, 'He's a second cousin of Lord De Carti's,' and she looked
     quite grave as if she were in church."
The parson grinned grimly and lit his old pipe.
"Baron De Carti's great-grandfather was a Dublin attorney," he remarked. "Which his name was
     Jeremiah M'Carthy. His prejudiced fellow-citizens called him the Unjust Steward, also the
     Bloody Attorney, and I believe that 'to hell with M'Carthy' was quite a popular cry about the
     time of the Union."
Mr. Taylor was a man of very wide and irregular reading and a tenacious memory; he often used
     to wonder why he had not risen in the Church. He had once told Mr. Dixon a singular and
      drolatique anecdote concerning the bishop's college days, and he never discovered why
     the prelate did not bow according to his custom when the name of Taylor was called at the next
     visitation. Some people said the reason was lighted candles, but that was impossible, as the
     Reverend and Honorable Smallwood Stafford, Lord Beamys's son, who had a cure of souls in the
     cathedral city, was well known to burn no end of candles, and with him the bishop was on the
     best of terms. Indeed the bishop often stayed at Coplesey (pronounced "Copsey") Hall, Lord
     Beamys's place in the west.
Lucian had mentioned the name of De Carti with intention, and had perhaps exaggerated a
     little Mrs. Dixon's respectful manner. He knew such incidents cheered his father, who could
     never look at these subjects from a proper point of view, and, as people said, sometimes made
     the strangest remarks for a clergyman. This irreverent way of treating serious things was one
     of the great bonds between father and son, but it tended to increase their isolation. People
     said they would often have liked to asked Mr. Taylor to garden-parties, and tea-parties, and
     other cheap entertainments, if only he had not been such an extreme man and so
      queer. Indeed, a year before, Mr. Taylor had gone to a garden-party at the Castle,
     Caermaen, and had made such fun of the bishop's recent address on missions to the Portuguese,
     that the Gervases and Dixons and all who heard him were quite shocked and annoyed. And, as Mrs.
     Meyrick of Lanyravon observed, his black coat was perfectly green with age; so on the
     whole the Gervases did not like to invite Mr. Taylor again. As for the son, nobody cared to
     have him; Mrs. Dixon, as she said to her husband, really asked him out of charity.
"I am afraid he seldom gets a real meal at home," she remarked, "so I thought he would enjoy
     a good wholesome tea for once in a way. But he is such an unsatisfactory boy, he would
     only have one slice of that nice plain cake, and I couldn't get him to take more than two
     plums. They were really quite ripe too, and boys are usually so fond of fruit."
Thus Lucian was forced to spend his holidays chiefly in his own company, and make the best he
     could of the ripe peaches on the south wall of the rectory garden. There was a certain corner
     where the heat of that hot August seemed concentrated, reverberated from one wall to the other,
     and here he liked to linger of mornings, when the mists were still thick in the valleys,
     "mooning," meditating, extending his walk from the quince to the medlar and back again, beside
     the moldering walls of mellowed brick. He was full of a certain wonder and awe, not unmixed
     with a swell of strange exultation, and wished more and more to be alone, to think over that
     wonderful afternoon within the fort. In spite of himself the impression was fading; he could
     not understand that feeling of mad panic terror that drove him through the thicket and down the
     steep hillside; yet, he had experienced so clearly the physical shame and reluctance of the
     flesh; he recollected that for a few seconds after his awakening the sight of his own body had
     made him shudder and writhe as if it had suffered some profoundest degradation. He saw before
     him a vision of two forms; a faun with tingling and prickling flesh lay expectant in the
     sunlight, and there was also the likeness of a miserable shamed boy, standing with trembling
     body and shaking, unsteady hands. It was all confused, a procession of blurred images, now of
     rapture and ecstasy, and now of terror and shame, floating in a light that was altogether
     phantasmal and unreal. He dared not approach the fort again; he lingered in the road to
     Caermaen that passed behind it, but a mile away, and separated by the wild land and a strip of
     wood from the towering battlements. Here he was looking over a gate one day, doubtful and
     wondering, when he heard a heavy step behind him, and glancing round quickly saw it was old
     Morgan of the White House.
"Good afternoon, Master Lucian," he began. "Mr. Taylor pretty well, I suppose? I be goin' to
     the house a minute; the men in the fields are wantin' some more cider. Would you come and taste
     a drop of cider, Master Lucian? It's very good, sir, indeed."
Lucian did not want any cider, but he thought it would please old Morgan if he took some, so
     he said he should like to taste the cider very much indeed. Morgan was a sturdy, thick-set old
     man of the ancient stock; a stiff churchman, who breakfasted regularly on fat broth and
     Caerphilly cheese in the fashion of his ancestors; hot, spiced elder wine was for winter
     nights, and gin for festal seasons. The farm had always been the freehold of the family, and
     when Lucian, in the wake of the yeoman, passed through the deep porch by the oaken door, down
     into the long dark kitchen, he felt as though the seventeenth century still lingered on. One
     mullioned window, set deep in the sloping wall, gave all the light there was through quarries
     of thick glass in which there were whorls and circles, so that the lapping rose-branch and the
     garden and the fields beyond were distorted to the sight. Two heavy beams, oaken but
     whitewashed, ran across the ceiling; a little glow of fire sparkled in the great fireplace, and
     a curl of blue smoke fled up the cavern of the chimney. Here was the genuine chimney-corner of
     our fathers; there were seats on each side of the fireplace where one could sit snug and
     sheltered on December nights, warm and merry in the blazing light, and listen to the battle of
     the storm, and hear the flame spit and hiss at the falling snowflakes. At the back of the fire
     were great blackened tiles with raised initials and a date.â€”I.M., 1684.
"Sit down, Master Lucian, sit down, sir," said Morgan.
"Annie," he called through one of the numerous doors, "here's Master Lucian, the parson,
     would like a drop of cider. Fetch a jug, will you, directly?"
"Very well, father," came the voice from the dairy and presently the girl entered, wiping the
     jug she held. In his boyish way Lucian had been a good deal disturbed by Annie Morgan; he could
     see her on Sundays from his seat in church, and her skin, curiously pale, her lips that seemed
     as though they were stained with some brilliant pigment, her black hair, and the quivering
     black eyes, gave him odd fancies which he had hardly shaped to himself. Annie had grown into a
     woman in three years, and he was still a boy. She came into the kitchen, curtsying and
     smiling.
"Good-day, Master Lucian, and how is Mr. Taylor, sir?"
"Pretty well, thank you. I hope you are well."
"Nicely, sir, thank you. How nice your voice do sound in church, Master Lucian, to be sure. I
     was telling father about it last Sunday." 
Lucian grinned and felt uncomfortable, and the girl set down the jug on the round table and
     brought a glass from the dresser. She bent close over him as she poured out the green oily
     cider, fragrant of the orchard; her hand touched his shoulder for a moment, and she said, "I
     beg your pardon, sir," very prettily. He looked up eagerly at her face; the black eyes, a
     little oval in shape, were shining, and the lips smiled. Annie wore a plain dress of some black
     stuff, open at the throat; her skin was beautiful. For a moment the ghost of a fancy hovered
     unsubstantial in his mind; and then Annie curtsied as she handed him the cider, and replied to
     his thanks with, "And welcome kindly, sir."
The drink was really good; not thin, nor sweet, but round and full and generous, with a fine
     yellow flame twinkling through the green when one held it up to the light. It was like a stray
     sunbeam hovering on the grass in a deep orchard, and he swallowed the glassful with relish, and
     had some more, warmly commending it. Mr. Morgan was touched.
"I see you do know a good thing, sir," he said. "Is, indeed, now, it's good stuff, though
     it's my own makin'. My old grandfather he planted the trees in the time of the wars, and he was
     a very good judge of an apple in his day and generation. And a famous grafter he was, to be
     sure. You will never see no swelling in the trees he grafted at all whatever. Now there's James
     Morris, Penyrhaul, he's a famous grafter, too, and yet them Redstreaks he grafted for me five
     year ago, they be all swollen-like below the graft already. Would you like to taste a Blemmin
     pippin, now, Master Lucian? there be a few left in the loft, I believe."
Lucian said he should like an apple very much, and the farmer went out by another door, and
     Annie stayed in the kitchen talking. She said Mrs. Trevor, her married sister, was coming to
     them soon to spend a few days.
"She's got such a beautiful baby," said Annie, "and he's quite sensible-like already, though
     he's only nine months old. Mary would like to see you, sir, if you would be so kind as to step
     in; that is, if it's not troubling you at all, Master Lucian. I suppose you must be getting a
     fine scholar now, sir?"
"I am doing pretty well, thank you," said the boy. "I was first in my form last term."
"Fancy! To think of that! D'you hear, father, what a scholar Master Lucian be getting?" 
"He be a rare grammarian, I'm sure," said the farmer. "You do take after your father, sir; I
     always do say that nobody have got such a good deliverance in the pulpit."
Lucian did not find the Blenheim Orange as good as the cider, but he ate it with all the
     appearance of relish, and put another, with thanks, in his pocket. He thanked the farmer again
     when he got up to go; and Annie curtsied and smiled, and wished him good-day, and welcome,
     kindly.
Lucian heard her saying to her father as he went out what a nice-mannered young gentleman he
     was getting, to be sure; and he went on his way, thinking that Annie was really very pretty,
     and speculating as to whether he would have the courage to kiss her, if they met in a dark
     lane. He was quite sure she would only laugh, and say, "Oh, Master Lucian!"
For many months he had occasional fits of recollection, both cold and hot; but the bridge of
     time, gradually lengthening, made those dreadful and delicious images grow more and more
     indistinct, till at last they all passed into that wonderland which a youth looks back upon in
     amazement, not knowing why this used to be a symbol of terror or that of joy. At the end of
     each term he would come home and find his father a little more despondent, and harder to cheer
     even for a moment; and the wall paper and the furniture grew more and more dingy and shabby.
     The two cats, loved and ancient beasts, that he remembered when he was quite a little boy,
     before he went to school, died miserably, one after the other. Old Polly, the pony, at last
     fell down in the stable from the weakness of old age, and had to be killed there; the battered
     old trap ran no longer along the well-remembered lanes. There was long meadow grass on the
     lawn, and the trained fruit trees on the wall had got quite out of hand. At last, when Lucian
     was seventeen, his father was obliged to take him from school; he could no longer afford the
     fees. This was the sorry ending of many hopes, and dreams of a double-first, a fellowship,
     distinction and glory that the poor parson had long entertained for his son, and the two moped
     together, in the shabby room, one on each side of the sulky fire, thinking of dead days and
     finished plans, and seeing a grey future in the years that advanced towards them. At one time
     there seemed some chance of a distant relative coming forward to Lucian's assistance; and
     indeed it was quite settled that he should go up to London with certain definite aims. Mr.
     Taylor told the good news to his acquaintancesâ€”his coat was too green now for any pretence of
     friendship; and Lucian himself spoke of his plans to Burrows the doctor and Mr. Dixon, and one
     or two others. Then the whole scheme fell through, and the parson and his son suffered much
     sympathy. People, of course, had to say they were sorry, but in reality the news was received
     with high spirits, with the joy with which one sees a stone, as it rolls down a steep place,
     give yet another bounding leap towards the pool beneath. Mrs. Dixon heard the pleasant tidings
     from Mrs. Colley, who came in to talk about the Mothers' Meeting and the Band of Hope. Mrs.
     Dixon was nursing little Athelwig, or some such name, at the time, and made many affecting
     observations on the general righteousness with which the world was governed. Indeed, poor
     Lucian's disappointment seemed distinctly to increase her faith in the Divine Order, as if it
     had been some example in Butler's Analogy.
"Aren't Mr. Taylor's views very extreme?" she said to her husband the same
     evening.
"I am afraid they are," he replied. "I was quite grieved at the last Diocesan
     Conference at the way in which he spoke. The dear old bishop had given an address on Auricular
     Confession; he was forced to do so, you know, after what had happened, and I must say
     that I never felt prouder of our beloved Church."
Mr. Dixon told all the Homeric story of the conference, reciting the achievements of the
     champions, "deploring" this and applauding that. It seemed that Mr. Taylor had had the audacity
     to quote authorities which the bishop could not very well repudiate, though they were directly
     opposed to the "safe" Episcopal pronouncement.
Mrs. Dixon of course was grieved; it was "sad" to think of a clergyman behaving so
     shamefully.
"But you know, dear," she proceeded, "I have been thinking about that unfortunate Taylor boy
     and his disappointments, and after what you've just told me, I am sure it's some kind of
     judgment on them both. Has Mr. Taylor forgotten the vows he took at his ordination? But don't
     you think, dear, I am right, and that he has been punished: 'The sins of the fathers'?"
Somehow or other Lucian divined the atmosphere of threatenings and judgments, and shrank more
     and more from the small society of the countryside. For his part, when he was not "mooning" in
     the beloved fields and woods of happy memory, he shut himself up with books, reading whatever
     could be found on the shelves, and amassing a store of incongruous and obsolete knowledge. Long
     did he linger with the men of the seventeenth century; delaying the gay sunlit streets with
     Pepys, and listening to the charmed sound of the Restoration Revel; roaming by peaceful streams
     with Izaak Walton, and the great Catholic divines; enchanted with the portrait of Herbert the
     loving ascetic; awed by the mystic breath of Crashaw. Then the cavalier poets sang their
     gallant songs; and Herrick made Dean Prior magic ground by the holy incantation of a verse. And
     in the old proverbs and homely sayings of the time he found the good and beautiful English
     life, a time full of grace and dignity and rich merriment. He dived deeper and deeper into his
     books; he had taken all obsolescence to be his province; in his disgust at the stupid usual
     questions, "Will it pay?" "What good is it?" and so forth, he would only read what was uncouth
     and useless. The strange pomp and symbolism of the Cabala, with its hint of more terrible
     things; the Rosicrucian mysteries of Fludd, the enigmas of Vaughan, dreams of alchemistsâ€”all
     these were his delight. Such were his companions, with the hills and hanging woods, the brooks
     and lonely waterpools; books, the thoughts of books, the stirrings of imagination, all fused
     into one phantasy by the magic of the outland country. He held himself aloof from the walls of
     the fort; he was content to see the heaped mounds, the violent height with faerie bulwarks,
     from the gate in the lane, and to leave all within the ring of oaks in the mystery of his
     boyhood's vision. He professed to laugh at himself and at his fancies of that hot August
     afternoon, when sleep came to him within the thicket, but in his heart of hearts there was
     something that never fadedâ€”something that glowed like the red glint of a gypsy's fire seen
     from afar across the hills and mists of the night, and known to be burning in a wild land.
     Sometimes, when he was sunken in his books, the flame of delight shot up, and showed him a
     whole province and continent of his nature, all shining and aglow; and in the midst of the
     exultation and triumph he would draw back, a little afraid. He had become ascetic in his
     studious and melancholy isolation, and the vision of such ecstasies frightened him. He began to
     write a little; at first very tentatively and feebly, and then with more confidence. He showed
     some of his verses to his father, who told him with a sigh that he had once hoped to writeâ€”in
     the old days at Oxford, he added.
"They are very nicely done," said the parson; "but I'm afraid you won't find anybody to print
     them, my boy."
So he pottered on; reading everything, imitating what struck his fancy, attempting the effect
     of the classic meters in English verse, trying his hand at a masque, a Restoration comedy,
     forming impossible plans for books which rarely got beyond half a dozen lines on a sheet of
     paper; beset with splendid fancies which refused to abide before the pen. But the vain joy of
     conception was not altogether vain, for it gave him some armor about his heart.
The months went by, monotonous, and sometimes blotted with despair. He wrote and planned and
     filled the waste-paper basket with hopeless efforts. Now and then he sent verses or prose
     articles to magazines, in pathetic ignorance of the trade. He felt the immense difficulty of
     the career of literature without clearly understanding it; the battle was happily in a mist, so
     that the host of the enemy, terribly arrayed, was to some extent hidden. Yet there was enough
     of difficulty to appall; from following the intricate course of little nameless brooks, from
     hushed twilight woods, from the vision of the mountains, and the breath of the great wind,
     passing from deep to deep, he would come home filled with thoughts and emotions, mystic fancies
     which he yearned to translate into the written word. And the result of the effort seemed always
     to be bathos! Wooden sentences, a portentous stilted style, obscurity, and awkwardness clogged
     the pen; it seemed impossible to win the great secret of language; the stars glittered only in
     the darkness, and vanished away in clearer light. The periods of despair were often long and
     heavy, the victories very few and trifling; night after night he sat writing after his father
     had knocked out his last pipe, filling a page with difficulty in an hour, and usually forced to
     thrust the stuff away in despair, and go unhappily to bed, conscious that after all his labor
     he had done nothing. And these were moments when the accustomed vision of the land alarmed him,
     and the wild domed hills and darkling woods seemed symbols of some terrible secret in the inner
     life of that strangerâ€”himself. Sometimes when he was deep in his books and papers, sometimes
     on a lonely walk, sometimes amidst the tiresome chatter of Caermaen "society," he would thrill
     with a sudden sense of awful hidden things, and there ran that quivering flame through his
     nerves that brought back the recollection of the matted thicket, and that earlier appearance of
     the bare black boughs enwrapped with flames. Indeed, though he avoided the solitary lane, and
     the sight of the sheer height, with its ring of oaks and molded mounds, the image of it grew
     more intense as the symbol of certain hints and suggestions. The exultant and insurgent flesh
     seemed to have its temple and castle within those olden walls, and he longed with all his heart
     to escape, to set himself free in the wilderness of London, and to be secure amidst the murmur
     of modern streets.
