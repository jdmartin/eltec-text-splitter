POINTS OF VIEW
 On the following morning, the ominous Friday of this disastrous week, there was a letter for
     Mr. Upton on the breakfast-table down in Leicestershire. This circumstance was not so usual as
     it sounds, because Mr. Upton conducted all his correspondence from his office at the works. If
     you simply put the name of the village, as he did on his stationery, to the works it went; it
     was necessary to direct your letter to the hall if you wished it to be delivered there; and few
     there were who had anything to say to Mr. Upton, on paper, unless it was on business too. His
     youngest son, however, had furnished the more impressive address to Dr. Bompas, whose hurried
     hand it was that dealt the first blow. 
 It so happened that a letter from Dr. Bompas had been expected; this made the letter he
     wrote especially upsetting, and for the following reason. Mrs. Upton had been so shaken by her
     vivid dream on the Thursday morning, that her husband had telegraphed to Bompas, somewhat
     against his own judgment, to know how he found their son. The reply had been: “Better expecting
     him again to-day will write”—which prepared the family for still more reassuring accounts in
     the morning. Lettice
      felt relieved as the original discoverer of Dr. Bompas. Horace found his views
     confirmed as to the systematic exaggeration of a touch of asthma, and Fred was only prevented
     by absence from entirely agreeing with Horace. Mr. Upton thought no more about the matter. But
     poor Mrs. Upton lay upstairs looking forward to a letter which it was quite impossible to show
     her now that it had come. 
 Mr. Upton read it more than once without a word; and it was not his way to keep a family
     matter to himself at his own table; but on this occasion he triumphed over temperament with an
     extraordinary instinct for what was in the air. 
 “The most infernal letter I ever had in my life!” was his only comment as he thrust it in
     his pocket out of sight. Lettice, however, might have seen that her father was far more
     distressed than angry had not Horace promptly angered him by saying he was not surprised. The
     young fellow's face and the old one's neck were redder before the last was heard of that
     remark. A garbled paraphrase of the letter was eventually vouchsafed; the boy had made very
     little improvement, and was not likely to make more while he remained at a school where he was
     allowed to use any remedy he liked; in fact, until he was taken away from school, and placed
     under his own immediate control in town, Dr. Bompas declined to persevere with the case. 

 “Blighter!” said Horace impartially, as though now there were two of them. Such was, in
     fact, the sum of his observations to Lettice when their father had taken himself and his letter
     upstairs. Young Tony was not “playing the game”; but then he never did play it to the expert
     satisfaction of Fred and Horace. 
 Upstairs the husband gave a more elaborate version of his letter, and told a lie. He said he
     had destroyed the letter in his indignation. He had destroyed it, but solely to escape any
     question of his showing it to his wife. He said a happier thing by chance; he said that for two
     pins he would motor over to the school and see for himself how the boy really was; then perhaps
     he would be in a position to consider the entreaty which Mrs. Upton added to the specialist's
     demand, that his patient should be placed under his eye in town. Mr. Upton went so far,
     however, without much immediate intention of taking so strong a measure. 
 He wished to discuss the matter with Horace; he might be quite justified in his fears. He
     was sorry he had let them lead to words with his eldest son. There were aspects of the case, as
     it presented itself to his mind, which he could hardly thresh out with Lettice, and her mother
     must not know of his anxiety on any account. Horace, however, had gone off earlier than usual
     in his dudgeon. 

 Mr. Upton was not long in following him to the works. 
 It was a charming garden that he passed through on his way; it charmed its owner all the
     more from his having made it himself out of a few rolling meadows. The rhododendrons were at
     the climax of their June glory. The new red gravel (his own colouring to a shade) appealed to
     an eye which had never looked longer than necessary in the glass. Lawn-tennis courts were
     marked out snowily on a shaven lawn; the only eyesore the good man encountered was poor
     Pocket's snob-wickets painted on a buttress in the back premises; his own belching
     blast-furnaces, corroding and defiling acres and acres within a few hundred yards of his garden
     wall, were but another form of beauty to the sturdy Briton who had made them too. 
 Horace was called into the private office and speedily propitiated. “I was more anxious than
     I could tell you at the time,” his father said; “the fact is, I concealed half the fellow's
     letter on account of Lettice. But it's a man's matter, and you ought to know.” 
 Of course the letter had stated that the erratic patient had failed to keep his appointment
     on the morning of writing; but if it had drawn the line of information there, it is highly
     improbable that Mr. Upton would have exercised so wise a discretion
      at table and in his wife's room. It now appeared that as a busy professional man
     the outspoken Bompas had gone far out of his way to play Mahomet to his patient's mountain.
     Tony had told him where he hoped to stay in London, which Bompas particularly wished to know on
     account of some special prescription the boy was to try that night. On his failure to appear at
     the appointed time, the doctor had telephoned to the address in question, only to learn that
     the boy had not stayed there at all. He had been given another address with the same result,
     except that from the second house he gathered that the young gentleman had gone on to some
     hotel. Horace was left to imagine a professional opinion of such proceedings, and asked for his
     own on the facts as a man of the world. 
 “Exactly like young Tony!” quoth Horace, never afraid to say what he thought. 
 “What! Like a lad of sixteen to go and put up at some hotel?” 
 “Like Tony,” repeated Horace significantly. “Trust him to do what nobody else ever did.” 
 “But how could Spearman give him the chance?” 
 “Heaven knows! Fred and I never got it.” 
 “I thought he was to stay at Coverley's?” 
 “So I heard.” 
 “I don't like it! It's all wrong at his age,” said Mr. Upton. He had his notions of life and
     its
      temptations, and he was blunt enough with his elder sons, yet it was not without
     some hesitation that he added: “You don't think there's any question of bad company, do you?” 
 And though Horace had “no use for” his so-called pocket edition, he answered without any
     hesitation at all: “Not for a moment, from what I know of Tony.” 
 Mr. Upton was sorry he had said so much. He excused himself by mentioning his wife's dream,
     now family property, which had been on his mind all this time. Horace, however, had no
     hesitation in informing him that nobody nowadays believed in dreams. 
 “Well, I never have, certainly,” said Mr. Upton. “But what can it be?” 
 “He probably went up to Lord's, and forgot all about his doctor.” 
 “I hope not! You're too down on him, Horace.” 
 “If there was nobody to put him up it was the game to go back to school.” 
 “But he's said to have gone to some hotel.” 
 “I don't suppose he did,” said Horace. “I expect he got back somehow.” 
 The question was still under discussion when a telegram from Mr. Spearman settled it. Where
     was Tony? He had not returned when due the day before, and his friends in London wired that
     they knew nothing about him. 

 “What friends?” cried Mr. Upton, in a fury. “Why the devil couldn't Spearman give their
     names or Bompas the addresses he talked about?” 
 Horace could only think of Mr. Coverley or “that Knaggs crowd.” Neither he nor Fred had been
     at Coverley's school, and young Tony's friends were by no means theirs. 
 Mr. Upton thought Lettice would know, and was going to speak to her on the telephone when
     Horace reminded him of his own remark about its being “a man's matter”; it was beginning to
     look, even to Horace, like a serious one as well, and in his opinion it was much better that
     neither his mother nor his sister should know anything at all about it before it was absolutely
     necessary. Horace now quoted his mother's dream as the devil did Scripture, but adduced sounder
     arguments besides; he was speaking quite nicely of them both, for instance, when he declared
     that Lettice was wrapped up in Tony, and would be beside herself if she thought any evil had
     overtaken him. It would be simply impossible for her to hide her anxiety from the mother on
     whom she also waited hand and foot. Mr. Upton disagreed a little there; he had good reason to
     believe in Lettice's power of suppressing her own feelings; but for her own sake, and
     particularly in view of that discredited dream, he now decided to keep his daughter in the dark
     as long as his wife. 

 It was his first decision; his next was to motor over to the school, as he had fortunately
     told his wife he might, and have a word with Mr. Spearman, who deserved hanging for the whole
     thing! The mischief was done, however, and it was now a matter in which home and school
     authorities must act together. A clerk was instructed to telephone to the garage for the car to
     come straight to the works. And the ironmaster stood waiting at his office window in a fever of
     anxiety. 
 The grimy scene on which he looked had a constant charm for him, and yet to-day it almost
     added to the bitterness of his heart. His was the brain that had conceived those broad effects
     of smoke and flame, and blackened faces lit by the light of molten metal; his the strong hand
     and the stout heart which had brought his conception into being. Those were his trucks bringing
     in his ore from his mines; that was his consequential little locomotive fussing in front of
     them. His men, dwellers in his cottages on the brow of that hill, which was also his, happened
     to be tapping one of his furnaces at the moment; that was his pig-iron running out into the
     moulds as magically as an electric advertisement writes itself upon the London sky at night.
     The sense of possession is the foible of many who have won all they have; the ironmaster almost
     looked upon the hot air dancing over the
      white-hot bars as his too. The whole sulphurous prospect, once a green pasture,
     had long been his to all intents and purposes, and no second soul would ever take his pride in
     it; to his children it would never be more than the means of livelihood; and how had it repaid
     even him for a life's devotion? With a house of sorrow in the next valley! With a stricken
     wife, and sons whose right hands kept their cunning for the cricket-field, and one of whom the
     very thought had become a sudden madness! 
 Yet he could think of nothing else, except his wife, even in the great green car that
     whisked him westward in a dancing cloud of dust; for he did not drive himself, and the rush
     through the iced fragrance of the summer's day was a mental stimulant that did its work only
     too well. Now it recalled the ailing infancy of the missing boy—bronchitis it had been in the
     early stages—and how his mother had taken him to Hastings three successive winters, and wrapped
     him up far too much. Old family jokes cropped up in a new light, dimming the eyes without an
     instant's warning. On one of those flittings south the solicitous mother had placed the
     uncomplaining child on a footwarmer, and forgotten him until a cascade of perspiration apprised
     her of the effect: poor Mr. Upton had never thought of the incident without laughter, until
     to-day. Without
      doubt she had coddled him, and all for this, and she herself too ill to hear a
     word about it! 
 His mind harked back to his wife. In her sad case there was no uncertainty. He thought of
     thirty years ago when he had seen her first. There had been drama and colour in their meeting;
     the most celebrated of the neighbouring packs had run a fox to earth on his works, indeed in
     his very slag-heap! The author of cancerous furnaces in the green heart of a grass country had
     never been a popular personage with the hunting folk; but he was master of the situation that
     memorable day. It was his terrier that went into the slag-heap like a ferret, and came out
     bloody with a moribund fox; his pocket-knife that shore through the brush, his hand that
     presented it across the wall to the only young lady in at the death. The men in pink looking
     over, the hunt servants with their work cut out on the other side, the tongue of molten slag
     sticking out of the furnace mouth—the momentary contact of the industrial and the sporting
     world—it was that strange and yet significant scene which had first endeared its dingy setting
     to the ironmaster's heart. But he had made the contact permanent by falling in love with the
     young lady of the brush and marrying her under all the guns of her countified kith and kin. And
     now she was a stricken invalid, and their youngest-born was God knew where! 

 Of course there were no tidings of him at the school, where the now distracted father spent
     a more explosive hour than he cared to think about as he flew on to town in the car. He was
     afraid he had been very rude to Mr. Spearman; but then Spearman had been rash enough to
     repudiate his obvious responsibility in the matter. It was not his fault that the boy went up
     to town so often to see his doctor and stay the night. He had his own opinion of that
     arrangement, but it had become his business to see it carried out. Mr. Upton got in a sharp
     thrust here, to which the house-master retorted that if a boy of seventeen could not be trusted
     to keep his word, he should like to know who could! Tony had promised him faithfully to return
     that same night, failing friends whom he had mentioned as certain to put him up; their names
     Mr. Upton was able to demand at last as though they were so much blood; and he could not have
     cursed them more freely if Spearman had been a layman like himself. But that was all the
     information forthcoming from this quarter; for, happening to ask what the head master thought
     of the affair, Mr. Upton was calmly informed that it had still to reach his ears; at which he
     stared, and then merely remarked that he was not surprised, but in such a tone that Spearman
     sprang up and led him straight into the presence. 

 Now the Benevolent Despot of this particular seat of learning was an astute pedagogue who
     could handle men as well as boys. He explained to Mr. Upton that the safe-keeping of the unit
     was the house-master's concern, but agreed it was time that he himself was made acquainted with
     the present case. He took it as seriously, too, as Mr. Upton could have wished, but quite as
     frankly from his own point of view as his two visitors did from each of theirs. He had no doubt
     the boy would turn up, but when he did it would be necessary for him to give a satisfactory
     account of his proceedings before he could be received back into the school. 
 “Bother the school!” cried Mr. Upton, diluting the anathema with difficulty. “Let me find my
     lad alive and well; then you can do what you like.” 
 “But how do you propose to find him?” inquired the head master, with only a dry smile (which
     disappointed Spearman) by way of rejoinder. 
 “First I shall have a word with these infernal people who, on their own showing, refused the
     boy a bed. I'll give them a bit of my mind, I promise you! Then there's the hotel they seem to
     have driven him to; it may be the one we always stay at, or one they've recommended. If I can't
     hear anything of him there, I suppose there'll be nothing for it but to call in the police.” 
 “My dear sir,” exclaimed the head master,
      “you may as well call in the public at once! It will be in the papers before you
     know where you are; and that, I need hardly point out to you, is as undesirable from our point
     of view as I should have thought it would be from yours.” 
 “It's more so from mine!” cried Mr. Upton, in fresh alarm and indignation. “You think about
     your school. I think about my wife and boy; it might kill her to hear about this before he's
     found. But if I don't go to the police, who am I to go to?” The head master leant back in his
     chair, and joined his finger-tips judicially. 
 “There was a man we had down here to investigate an extraordinary case of dishonesty, in
     which I was actually threatened with legal proceedings on behalf of a certain boy. But this man
     Thrush came down and solved the mystery within twenty-four hours, and saved the school a public
     scandal.” 
 “He may save you another,” said Mr. Upton, “if he can find my boy. What did you say the name
     was?” 
 “Thrush—Eugene Thrush—quite a remarkable man, and, I think, a gentleman,” said the head
     master impressively. Further particulars, including an address in Glasshouse Street, were
     readily supplied from an advertisement in that day's Times, in which Mr. Thrush
     was described as an “inquiry agent,” capable alike of “delicate investigations” and
     “confidential negotiations.” 

 That was the very man for Mr. Upton, as he himself agreed. And he departed both on speaking
     terms with Mr. Spearman, who said a final word for his own behaviour in the matter, and grimly
     at one with the head master on the importance of keeping it out of the papers.
