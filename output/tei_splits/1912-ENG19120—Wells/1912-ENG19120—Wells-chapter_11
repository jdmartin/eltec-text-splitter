CHAPTER THE THIRD
The Pilgrimage to Lonely Hut

Marjorie was surprised to find how easy it was at
       last to part from her children and go with Trafford.
"I am not sorry," she said, "not a bit sorry—but I am fearfully afraid. I shall dream they
      are ill.... Apart from that, it's strange how you grip me and they don't...."
In the train to Liverpool she watched Trafford with the queer feeling which comes to all
      husbands and wives at times that that other partner is indeed an undiscovered stranger, just
      beginning to show perplexing traits,—full of inconceivable possibilities.
For some reason his tearing her up by the roots in this fashion had fascinated her
      imagination. She felt a strange new wonder at him that had in it just a pleasant faint flavour
      of fear. Always before she had felt a curious aversion and contempt for those servile women
      who are said to seek a master, to want to be mastered, to be eager even for the physical
      subjugations of brute force. Now she could at least understand, sympathize even with them. Not
      only Trafford surprised her but herself. She found she was in an unwonted perplexing series of
      moods. All her feelings struck her now as being incorrect as well as unexpected; not only had
      life become suddenly full of novelty but she was making novel responses. She felt that she
      ought to be resentful and tragically sorry for her home and children. She felt this departure
      ought to have the quality of an immense sacrifice, a desperate and heroic undertaking for
      Trafford's sake. Instead she could detect little beyond
       an adventurous exhilaration when presently she walked the deck of the steamer
      that was to take her to St. John's. She had visited her cabin, seen her luggage stowed away,
      and now she surveyed the Mersey and its shipping with a renewed freshness of mind. She was
      reminded of the day, now nearly nine years ago, when she had crossed the sea for the first
      time—to Italy. Then, too, Trafford had seemed a being of infinitely wonderful
      possibilities.... What were the children doing?—that ought to have been her preoccupation. She
      didn't know; she didn't care! Trafford came and stood beside her, pointed out this and that
      upon the landing stage, no longer heavily sullen, but alert, interested, almost gay....
Neither of them could find any way to the great discussion they had set out upon, in this
      voyage to St. John's. But there was plenty of time before them. Plenty of time! They were both
      the prey of that uneasy distraction which seems the inevitable quality of a passenger
      steamship. They surveyed and criticized their fellow travellers, and prowled up and down
      through the long swaying days and the cold dark nights. They slept uneasily amidst fog-horn
      hootings and the startling sounds of waves swirling against the ports. Marjorie had never had
      a long sea voyage before; for the first time in her life she saw all the world, through a
      succession of days, as a circle of endless blue waters, with the stars and planets and sun and
      moon rising sharply from its rim. Until one has had a voyage no one really understands that
      old Earth is a watery globe.... They ran into thirty hours of storm, which subsided, and then
      came a slow time among icebergs, and a hooting, dreary passage through fog. The first three
      icebergs were marvels, the rest bores; a passing collier out of her
       course and pitching heavily, a lonely black and dirty ship with a manner almost
      derelict, filled their thoughts for half a day. Their minds were in a state of tedious
      inactivity, eager for such small interests and only capable of such small interests. There was
      no hurry to talk, they agreed, no hurry at all, until they were settled away ahead there among
      the snows. "There we shall have plenty of time for everything...."
Came the landfall and then St. John's, and they found themselves side by side watching the
      town draw near. The thought of landing and transference to another ship refreshed them
      both....
They were going, Trafford said, in search of God, but it was far more like two children
      starting out upon a holiday.

There was trouble and procrastination about the half-breed guides that Trafford had arranged
      should meet them at St. John's, and it was three weeks from their reaching Newfoundland before
      they got themselves and their guides and equipment and general stores aboard the boat for Port
      Dupré. Thence he had planned they should go in the Gibson schooner to Manivikovik, the Marconi
      station at the mouth of the Green River, and thence past the new pulp-mills up river to the
      wilderness. There were delays and a few trivial, troublesome complications in carrying out
      this scheme, but at last a day came when Trafford could wave good-bye to the seven people and
      eleven dogs which constituted the population of Peter Hammond's, that last rude outpost of
      civilization twenty miles above the pulp-mill, and turn his face in good earnest towards the
      wilderness.
Neither he nor Marjorie looked back at the headland
       for a last glimpse of the little settlement they were leaving. Each stared ahead
      over the broad, smooth sweep of water, broken by one transverse bar of foaming shallows, and
      scanned the low, tree-clad hills beyond that drew together at last in the distant gorge out of
      which the river came. The morning was warm and full of the promise of a hot noon, so that the
      veils they wore against the assaults of sand-flies and mosquitoes were already a little
      inconvenient. It seemed incredible in this morning glow that the wooded slopes along the shore
      of the lake were the border of a land in which nearly half the inhabitants die of starvation.
      The deep-laden canoes swept almost noiselessly through the water with a rhythmic alternation
      of rush and pause as the dripping paddles drove and returned. Altogether there were four long
      canoes and five Indian breeds in their party, and when they came to pass through shallows both
      Marjorie and Trafford took a paddle.
They came to the throat of the gorge towards noon, and found strong flowing deep water
      between its high purple cliffs. All hands had to paddle again, and it was only when they came
      to rest in a pool to eat a mid-day meal and afterwards to land upon a mossy corner for a
      stretch and a smoke, that Marjorie discovered the peculiar beauty of the rock about them. On
      the dull purplish-grey surfaces played the most extraordinary mist of luminous iridescence. It
      fascinated her. Here was a land whose common substance had this gemlike opalescence. But her
      attention was very soon withdrawn from these glancing splendours.
She had had to put aside her veil to eat, and presently she felt the vividly painful stabs
      of the black-fly and discovered blood upon her face. A bigger fly, the size and something of
      the appearance of a
       small wasp, with an evil buzz, also assailed her and Trafford. It was a bad
      corner for flies; the breeds even were slapping their wrists and swearing under the torment,
      and every one was glad to embark and push on up the winding gorge. It opened out for a time,
      and then the wooded shores crept in again, and in another half-hour they saw ahead of them a
      long rush of foaming waters among tumbled rocks that poured down from a brimming, splashing
      line of light against the sky. They crossed the river, ran the canoes into an eddy under the
      shelter of a big stone and began to unload. They had reached their first portage.
The rest of the first day was spent in packing and lugging first the cargoes and then the
      canoes up through thickets and over boulders and across stretches of reindeer moss for the
      better part of two miles to a camping ground about half-way up the rapids. Marjorie and
      Trafford tried to help with the carrying, but this evidently shocked and distressed the men
      too much, so they desisted and set to work cutting wood and gathering moss for the fires and
      bedding for the camp. When the iron stove was brought up the man who had carried it showed
      them how to put it up on stakes and start a fire in it, and then Trafford went to the river to
      get water, and Marjorie made a kind of flour cake in the frying-pan in the manner an American
      woman from the wilderness had once shown her, and boiled water for tea. The twilight had
      deepened to night while the men were still stumbling up the trail with the last two
      canoes.
It gave Marjorie a curiously homeless feeling to stand there in the open with the sunset
      dying away below the black scrubby outlines of the treetops uphill to the northwest, and to
      realize the nearest roof was already a day's toilsome journey away. The
       cool night breeze blew upon her bare face and arms—for now the insects had
      ceased from troubling and she had cast aside gloves and veil and turned up her sleeves to
      cook—and the air was full of the tumult of the rapids tearing seaward over the rocks below.
      Struggling through the bushes towards her was an immense, headless quadruped with unsteady
      legs and hesitating paces, two of the men carrying the last canoe. Two others were now
      assisting Trafford to put up the little tent that was to shelter her, and the fifth was
      kneeling beside her very solemnly and respectfully cutting slices of bacon for her to fry. The
      air was very sweet, and she wished she could sleep not in the tent but under the open sky.
It was queer, she thought, how much of the wrappings of civilization had slipped from them
      already. Every day of the journey from London had released them or deprived them—she hardly
      knew which—of a multitude of petty comforts and easy accessibilities. The afternoon toil
      uphill intensified the effect of having clambered up out of things—to this loneliness, this
      twilight openness, this simplicity.
The men ate apart at a fire they made for themselves, and after Trafford and Marjorie had
      supped on damper, bacon and tea, he smoked. They were both too healthily tired to talk very
      much. There was no moon but a frosty brilliance of stars, the air which had been hot and
      sultry at mid-day grew keen and penetrating, and after she had made him tell her the names of
      constellations she had forgotten, she suddenly perceived the wisdom of the tent, went into
      it—it was sweet and wonderful with sprigs of the Labrador tea-shrub—undressed, and had hardly
      rolled herself up into a cocoon of blankets before she was fast asleep.
She was awakened by a blaze of sunshine pouring
       into the tent, a smell of fried bacon and Trafford's voice telling her to get
      up. "They've gone on with the first loads," he said. "Get up, wrap yourself in a blanket, and
      come and bathe in the river. It's as cold as ice."
She blinked at him. "Aren't you stiff?" she asked.
"I was stiffer before I bathed," he said.
She took the tin he offered her. (They weren't to see china cups again for a year.) "It's
      woman's work getting tea," she said as she drank.
"You can't be a squaw all at once," said Trafford.

After Marjorie had taken her dip, dried roughly behind a bush, twisted her hair into a
      pigtail and coiled it under her hat, she amused herself and Trafford as they clambered up
      through rocks and willows to the tent again by cataloguing her apparatus of bath and toilette
      at Sussex Square and tracing just when and how she had parted from each item on the way to
      this place.
"But I say!" she cried, with a sudden, sharp note of dismay, "we haven't soap! This
      is our last cake almost. I never thought of soap."
"Nor I," said Trafford.
He spoke again presently. "We don't turn back for soap," he said.
"We don't turn back for anything," said Marjorie. "Still—I didn't count on a soapless
      winter."
"I'll manage something," said Trafford, a little doubtfully. "Trust a chemist...."
That day they finished the portage and came out upon a wide lake with sloping shores and a
      distant view of snow-topped mountains, a lake so shallow that
       at times their loaded canoes scraped on the glaciated rock below and they had to
      alter their course. They camped in a lurid sunset; the night was warm and mosquitoes were
      troublesome, and towards morning came a thunderstorm and wind and rain.
The dawn broke upon a tearing race of waves and a wild drift of slanting rain sweeping
      across the lake before a gale. Marjorie peered out at this as one peers out under the edge of
      an umbrella. It was manifestly impossible to go on, and they did nothing that day but run up a
      canvas shelter for the men and shift the tent behind a thicket of trees out of the full force
      of the wind. The men squatted stoically, and smoked and yarned. Everything got coldly wet, and
      for the most part the Traffords sat under the tent and stared blankly at this summer day in
      Labrador.
"Now," said Trafford, "we ought to begin talking."
"There's nothing much to do else," said Marjorie.
"Only one can't begin," said Trafford.
He was silent for a time. "We're getting out of things," he said....
The next day began with a fine drizzle through which the sun broke suddenly about ten
      o'clock. They made a start at once, and got a good dozen miles up the lake before it was
      necessary to camp again. Both Marjorie and Trafford felt stiff and weary and uncomfortable all
      day, and secretly a little doubtful now of their own endurance. They camped on an island on
      turf amidst slippery rocks, and the next day were in a foaming difficult river again, with
      glittering shallows that obliged every one to get out at times to wade and push. All through
      the afternoon they were greatly beset by flies. And so they worked their way on through a
      third days' journey
       towards the silent inland of Labrador.
Day followed day of toilsome and often tedious travel; they fought rapids, they waited while
      the men stumbled up long portages under vast loads, going and returning, they camped and
      discussed difficulties and alternatives. The flies sustained an unrelenting persecution, until
      faces were scarred in spite of veils and smoke fires, until wrists and necks were swollen and
      the blood in a fever. As they got higher and higher towards the central plateau, the mid-day
      heat increased and the nights grew colder, until they would find themselves toiling, wet with
      perspiration, over rocks that sheltered a fringe of ice beneath their shadows. The first
      fatigues and lassitudes, the shrinking from cold water, the ache of muscular effort, gave
      place to a tougher and tougher endurance; skin seemed to have lost half its capacity for pain
      without losing a tithe of its discrimination, muscles attained a steely resilience; they were
      getting seasoned. "I don't feel philosophical," said Trafford, "but I feel well."
"We're getting out of things."
"Suppose we are getting out of our problems!..."
One day as they paddled across a mile-long pool, they saw three bears prowling in single
      file high up on the hillside. "Look," said the man, and pointed with his paddle at the big,
      soft, furry black shapes, magnified and startling in the clear air. All the canoes rippled to
      a stop, the men, at first still, whispered softly. One passed a gun to Trafford, who hesitated
      and looked at Marjorie.
The air of tranquil assurance about these three huge loafing monsters had a queer effect on
      Marjorie's mind. They made her feel that they were at home and that she was an intruder. She
      had never
       in her life seen any big wild animals except in a menagerie. She had developed a
      sort of unconscious belief that all big wild animals were in menageries nowadays, and this
      spectacle of beasts entirely at large startled her. There was never a bar between these
      creatures, she felt, and her sleeping self. They might, she thought, do any desperate thing to
      feeble men and women who came their way.
"Shall I take a shot?" asked Trafford.
"No," said Marjorie, pervaded by the desire for mutual toleration. "Let them be."
The big brutes disappeared in a gully, reappeared, came out against the skyline one by one
      and vanished.
"Too long a shot," said Trafford, handing back the gun....
Their journey lasted altogether a month. Never once did they come upon any human being save
      themselves, though in one place they passed the poles—for the most part overthrown—of an old
      Indian encampment. But this desolation was by no means lifeless. They saw great quantities of
      waterbirds, geese, divers, Arctic partridge and the like, they became familiar with the
      banshee cry of the loon. They lived very largely on geese and partridge. Then for a time about
      a string of lakes, the country was alive with migrating deer going south, and the men found
      traces of a wolf. They killed six caribou, and stayed to skin and cut them up and dry the meat
      to replace the bacon they had consumed, caught, fried and ate great quantities of trout, and
      became accustomed to the mysterious dance of the northern lights as the sunset afterglow
      faded.
Everywhere, except in the river gorges, the country displayed the low hummocky lines and
      tarn-like pools of intensely glaciated land; everywhere it was carpeted with reindeer moss
      growing upon peat
       and variegated by bushes of flowering, sweet-smelling Labrador tea. In places
      this was starred with little harebells and diversified by tussocks of heather and rough grass,
      and over the rocks trailed delicate dwarf shrubs and a very pretty and fragrant pink-flowered
      plant of which neither she nor Trafford knew the name. There was an astonishing amount of wild
      fruit, raspberries, cranberries, and a white kind of strawberry that was very delightful. The
      weather, after its first outbreak, remained brightly serene....
And at last it seemed fit to Trafford to halt and choose his winter quarters. He chose a
      place on the side of a low, razor-hacked rocky mountain ridge, about fifty feet above the
      river—which had now dwindled to a thirty-foot stream. His site was near a tributary rivulet
      that gave convenient water, in a kind of lap that sheltered between two rocky knees, each
      bearing thickets of willow and balsam. Not a dozen miles away from them now they reckoned was
      the Height of Land, the low watershed between the waters that go to the Atlantic and those
      that go to Hudson's Bay. Close beside the site he had chosen a shelf of rock ran out and gave
      a glimpse up the narrow rocky valley of the Green River's upper waters and a broad prospect of
      hill and tarn towards the south-east. North and north-east of them the country rose to a line
      of low crests, with here and there a yellowing patch of last year's snow, and across the
      valley were slopes covered in places by woods of stunted pine. It had an empty spaciousness of
      effect; the one continually living thing seemed to be the Green River, hurrying headlong,
      noisily, perpetually, in an eternal flight from this high desolation. Birds were rare here,
      and the insects that buzzed and shrilled and tormented among the rocks and willows in the
      gorge came but sparingly up the
       slopes to them.
"Here presently," said Trafford, "we shall be in peace."
"It is very lonely," said Marjorie.
"The nearer to God."
"Think! Not one of these hills has ever had a name."
"Well?"
"It might be in some other planet."
"Oh!—we'll christen them. That shall be Marjorie Ridge, and that Rag Valley. This space
      shall be—oh! Bayswater! Before we've done with it, this place and every feature of it will be
      as familiar as Sussex Square. More so,—for half the houses there would be stranger to us, if
      we could see inside them, than anything in this wilderness.... As familiar, say—as your
      drawing-room. That's better."
Marjorie made no answer, but her eyes went from the reindeer moss and scrub and thickets of
      the foreground to the low rocky ridges that bounded the view north and east of them. The
      scattered boulders, the tangles of wood, the barren upper slopes, the dust-soiled survivals of
      the winter's snowfall, all contributed to an effect at once carelessly desert and hopelessly
      untidy. She looked westward, and her memory was full of interminable streaming rapids, wastes
      of ice-striated rocks, tiresome struggles through woods and wild, wide stretches of tundra and
      tarn, trackless and treeless, infinitely desolate. It seemed to her that the sea coast was but
      a step from London and ten thousand miles away from her.

The men had engaged to build the framework of hut and store shed before returning, and to
      this under Trafford's direction they now set themselves. They
       were all half-breeds, mingling with Indian with Scottish or French blood, sober
      and experienced men. Three were named Mackenzie, two brothers and a cousin, and another,
      Raymond Noyes, was a relation and acquaintance of that George Elson who was with Wallace and
      Leonidas Hubbard, and afterwards guided Mrs. Hubbard in her crossing of Labrador. The fifth
      was a boy of eighteen named Lean. They were all familiar with the idea of summer travel in
      this country; quite a number, a score or so that is to say, of adventurous people, including
      three or four women, had ventured far in the wake of the Hubbards into these great
      wildernesses during the decade that followed that first tragic experiment in which Hubbard
      died. But that any one not of Indian or Esquimaux blood should propose to face out the
      Labrador winter was a new thing to them. They were really very sceptical at the outset whether
      these two highly civilized-looking people would ever get up to the Height of Land at all, and
      it was still with manifest incredulity that they set about the building of the hut and the
      construction of the sleeping bunks for which they had brought up planking. A stream of
      speculative talk had flowed along beside Marjorie and Trafford ever since they had entered the
      Green River; and it didn't so much come to an end as get cut off at last by the necessity of
      their departure.
Noyes would stand, holding a hammer and staring at the narrow little berth he was fixing
      together.
"You'll not sleep in this," he said.
"I will," replied Marjorie.
"You'll come back with us."
"Not me."
"There'll be wolves come and howl."
"Let 'em."
"They'll come right up to the door here. Winter
       makes 'em hidjus bold."
Marjorie shrugged her shoulders.
"It's that cold I've known a man have his nose froze while he lay in bed," said Noyes.
"Up here?"
"Down the coast. But they say it's 'most as cold up here. Many's the man it's starved and
      froze."...
He and his companions told stories,—very circumstantial and pitiful stories, of Indian
      disasters. They were all tales of weariness and starvation, of the cessation of food, because
      the fishing gave out, because the caribou did not migrate by the customary route, because the
      man of a family group broke his wrist, and then of the start of all or some of the party to
      the coast to get help and provisions, of the straining, starving fugitives caught by
      blizzards, losing the track, devouring small vermin raw, gnawing their own skin garments until
      they toiled half-naked in the snow,—becoming cannibals, becoming delirious, lying down to die.
      Once there was an epidemic of influenza, and three families of seven and twenty people just
      gave up and starved and died in their lodges, and were found, still partly frozen, a patient,
      pitiful company, by trappers in the spring....
Such they said, were the common things that happened in a Labrador winter. Did the Traffords
      wish to run such risks?
A sort of propagandist enthusiasm grew up in the men. They felt it incumbent upon them to
      persuade the Traffords to return. They reasoned with them rather as one does with wilful
      children. They tried to remind them of the delights and securities of the world they were
      deserting. Noyes drew fancy pictures of the pleasures of London by way of contrast to the
      bitter days before them. "You've got everything there, everything. Suppose you feel a
       bit ill, you go out, and every block there's a drug store got everything—all the
      new rem'dies—p'raps twenty, thirty sorts of rem'dy. Lit up, nice. And chaps in collars—like
      gentlemen. Or you feel a bit dully and you go into the streets and there's people. Why! when I
      was in New York I used to spend hours looking at the people. Hours! And everything lit up,
      too. Sky signs! Readin' everywhere. You can spend hours and hours in New York——"
"London," said Marjorie.
"Well, London—just going about and reading the things they stick up. Every blamed sort of
      thing. Or you say, let's go somewhere. Let's go out and be a bit lively. See? Up you get on a
      car and there you are! Great big restaurants, blazing with lights, and you can't think of a
      thing to eat they haven't got. Waiters all round you, dressed tremendous, fair asking you to
      have more. Or you say, let's go to a theatre. Very likely," said Noyes, letting his
      imagination soar, "you order up one of these automobillies."
"By telephone," helped Trafford.
"By telephone," confirmed Noyes. "When I was in New York there was a telephone in each room
      in the hotel. Each room. I didn't use it ever, except once when they didn't answer—but there
      it was. I know about telephones all right...."
Why had they come here? None of the men were clear about that. Marjorie and Trafford would
      overhear them discussing this question at their fire night after night; they seemed to talk of
      nothing else. They indulged in the boldest hypotheses, even in the theory that Trafford knew
      of deposits of diamonds and gold, and would trust no one but his wife with the secret. They
      seemed also attracted by the idea that our two young people had "done something."
       Lean, with memories of some tattered sixpenny novel that had drifted into his
      hands from England, had even some notion of an elopement, of a pursuing husband or a
      vindictive wife. He was young and romantic, but it seemed incredible he should suggest that
      Marjorie was a royal princess. Yet there were moments when his manner betrayed a more than
      personal respect....
One night after a hard day's portage Mackenzie was inspired by a brilliant idea. "They got
      no children," he said, in a hoarse, exceptionally audible whisper. "It worries them. Them as
      is Catholics goes pilgrimages, but these ain't Catholics. See?"
"I can't stand that," said Marjorie. "It touches my pride. I've stood a good deal. Mr.
      Mackenzie!... Mr.... Mackenzie."
The voice at the men's fire stopped and a black head turned around. "What is it, Mrs.
      Trafford?" asked Mackenzie.
She held up four fingers. "Four!" she said.
"Eh?"
"Three sons and a daughter," said Marjorie.
Mackenzie did not take it in until his younger brother had repeated her words.
"And you've come from them to this.... Sir, what have you come for?"
"We want to be here," shouted Trafford to their listening pause. Their silence was
      incredulous.
"We wanted to be alone together. There was too much—over there—too much everything."
Mackenzie, in silhouette against the fire, shook his head, entirely dissatisfied. He could
      not understand how there could be too much of anything. It was beyond a trapper's
      philosophy.
"Come back with us sir," said Noyes. "You'll
       weary of it...."
Noyes clung to the idea of dissuasion to the end. "I don't care to leave ye," he said, and
      made a sort of byword of it that served when there was nothing else to say.
He made it almost his last words. He turned back for another handclasp as the others under
      their light returning packs were filing down the hill.
"I don't care to leave ye," he said.
"Good luck!" said Trafford.
"You'll need it," said Noyes, and looked at Marjorie very gravely and intently before he
      turned about and marched off after his fellows....
Both Marjorie and Trafford felt a queer emotion, a sense of loss and desertion, a swelling
      in the throat, as that file of men receded over the rocky slopes, went down into a dip,
      reappeared presently small and remote cresting another spur, going on towards the little wood
      that hid the head of the rapids. They halted for a moment on the edge of the wood and looked
      back, then turned again one by one and melted stride by stride into the trees. Noyes was the
      last to go. He stood, in an attitude that spoke as plainly as words, "I don't care to leave
      ye." Something white waved and flickered; he had whipped out the letters they had given him
      for England, and he was waving them. Then, as if by an effort, he set himself to follow the
      others, and the two still watchers on the height above saw him no more.
