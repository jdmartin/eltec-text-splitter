CHAPTER THE FIFTH
The Trail to the Sea

One astonishing afternoon in January a man
       came out of the wilderness to Lonely Hut. He was a French-Indian half-breed, a
      trapper up and down the Green River and across the Height of Land to Sea Lake. He arrived in a
      sort of shy silence, and squatted amiably on a log to thaw. "Much snow," he said, "and little
      fur."
After he had sat at their fire for an hour and eaten and drunk, his purpose in coming thawed
      out. He explained he had just come on to them to see how they were. He was, he said, a planter
      furring; he had a line of traps, about a hundred and twenty miles in length. The nearest trap
      in his path before he turned northward over the divide was a good forty miles down the river.
      He had come on from there. Just to have a look. His name, he said, was Louis Napoleon
      Partington. He had carried a big pack, a rifle and a dead marten,—they lay beside him—and out
      of his shapeless mass of caribou skins and woolen clothing and wrappings, peeped a genial,
      oily, brown face, very dirty, with a strand of blue-black hair across one eye, irregular teeth
      in its friendly smile, and little, squeezed-up eyes.
Conversation developed. There had been doubts of his linguistic range at first, but he had
      an understanding expression, and his English seemed guttural rather than really bad.
He was told the tremendous story of Trafford's leg; was shown it, and felt it; he
      interpolated thick and whistling noises to show how completely he followed
       their explanations, and then suddenly he began a speech that made all his
      earlier taciturnity seem but the dam of a great reservoir of mixed and partly incomprehensible
      English. He complimented Marjorie so effusively and relentlessly and shamelessly as to produce
      a pause when he had done. "Yes," he said, and nodded to button up the whole. He sucked his
      pipe, well satisfied with his eloquence. Trafford spoke in his silence. "We are coming down,"
      he said.
("I thought, perhaps——" whispered Louis Napoleon.)
"Yes," said Trafford, "we are coming down with you. Why not? We can get a sledge over the
      snow now? It's hard? I mean a flat sledge—like this. See? Like this." He got up and
      dragged Marjorie's old arrangement into view. "We shall bring all the stuff we can down with
      us, grub, blankets—not the tent, it's too bulky; we'll leave a lot of the heavy gear."
"You'd have to leave the tent," said Louis Napoleon.
"I said leave the tent."
"And you'd have to leave ... some of those tins."
"Nearly all of them."
"And the ammunition, there;—except just a little."
"Just enough for the journey down."
"Perhaps a gun?"
"No, not a gun. Though, after all,—well, we'd return one of the guns. Give it you to bring
      back here."
"Bring back here?"
"If you liked."
For some moments Louis Napoleon was intently silent. When he spoke his voice was guttural
      with
       emotion. "After," he said thoughtfully and paused, and then resolved to have it
      over forthwith, "all you leave will be mine? Eh?"
Trafford said that was the idea.
Louis Napoleon's eye brightened, but his face preserved its Indian calm.
"I will take you right to Hammond's," he said, "Where they have dogs. And then I can come
      back here...."

They had talked out nearly every particular of their return before they slept that night;
      they yarned away three hours over the first generous meal that any one of them had eaten for
      many weeks. Louis Napoleon stayed in the hut as a matter of course, and reposed with snores
      and choking upon Marjorie's sledge and within a yard of her. It struck her as she lay awake
      and listened that the housemaids in Sussex Square would have thought things a little congested
      for a lady's bedroom, and then she reflected that after all it wasn't much worse than a
      crowded carriage in an all-night train from Switzerland. She tried to count how many people
      there had been in that compartment, and failed. How stuffy that had been—the smell of cheese
      and all! And with that, after a dream that she was whaling and had harpooned a particularly
      short-winded whale she fell very peacefully into oblivion.
Next day was spent in the careful preparation of the two sledges. They intended to take a
      full provision for six weeks, although they reckoned that with good weather they ought to be
      down at Hammond's in four.
The day after was Sunday, and Louis Napoleon
       would not look at the sledges or packing. Instead he held a kind of religious
      service which consisted partly in making Trafford read aloud out of a very oily old New
      Testament he produced, a selected passage from the book of Corinthians, and partly in moaning
      rather than singing several hymns. He was rather disappointed that they did not join in with
      him. In the afternoon he heated some water, went into the tent with it and it would appear
      partially washed his face. In the evening, after they had supped, he discussed religion, being
      curious by this time about their beliefs and procedure.
He spread his mental and spiritual equipment before them very artlessly. Their isolation and
      their immense concentration on each other had made them sensitive to personal quality, and
      they listened to the broken English and the queer tangential starts into new topics of this
      dirty mongrel creature with the keenest appreciation of its quality. It was inconsistent,
      miscellaneous, simple, honest, and human. It was as touching as the medley in the pocket of a
      dead schoolboy. He was superstitious and sceptical and sensual and spiritual, and very, very
      earnest. The things he believed, even if they were just beliefs about the weather or drying
      venison or filling pipes, he believed with emotion. He flushed as he told them. For all his
      intellectual muddle they felt he knew how to live honestly and die if need be very finely.
He was more than a little distressed at their apparent ignorance of the truths of revealed
      religion as it is taught in the Moravian schools upon the coast, and indeed it was manifest
      that he had had far more careful and infinitely more sincere religious teaching than either
      Trafford or Marjorie. For a time the missionary spirit inspired him, and then he quite forgot
      his solicitude for their conversion in a number
       of increasingly tall anecdotes about hunters and fishermen, illustrating at
      first the extreme dangers of any departure from a rigid Sabbatarianism, but presently becoming
      just stories illustrating the uncertainty of life. Thence he branched off to the general topic
      of life upon the coast and the relative advantages of "planter" and fisherman.
And then with a kindling eye he spoke of women, and how that some day he would marry. His
      voice softened, and he addressed himself more particularly to Marjorie. He didn't so much
      introduce the topic of the lady as allow the destined young woman suddenly to pervade his
      discourse. She was, it seemed, a servant, an Esquimaux girl at the Moravian Mission station at
      Manivikovik. He had been plighted to her for nine years. He described a gramophone he had
      purchased down at Port Dupré and brought back to her three hundred miles up the coast—it
      seemed to Marjorie an odd gift for an Esquimaux maiden—and he gave his views upon its
      mechanism. He said God was with the man who invented the gramophone "truly." They would have
      found one a very great relief to the tediums of their sojourn at Lonely Hut. The gramophone he
      had given his betrothed possessed records of the Rev. Capel Gumm's preaching and of Madame
      Melba's singing, a revival hymn called "Sowing the Seed," and a comic song—they could not make
      out his pronunciation of the title—that made you die with laughter. "It goes gobble, gobble,
      gobble," he said, with a solemn appreciative reflection of those distant joys.
"It's good to be jolly at times," he said with his bright eyes scanning Marjorie's face a
      little doubtfully, as if such ideas were better left for week-day expression.

Their return was a very different journey from the
       toilsome ascent of the summer. An immense abundance of snow masked the world,
      snow that made them regret acutely they had not equipped themselves with ski. With ski and a
      good circulation, a man may go about Labrador in winter, six times more easily than by the
      canoes and slow trudging of summer travel. As it was they were glad of their Canadian snow
      shoes. One needs only shelters after the Alpine Club hut fashion, and all that vast solitary
      country would be open in the wintertime. Its shortest day is no shorter than the shortest day
      in Cumberland or Dublin.
This is no place to tell of the beauty and wonder of snow and ice, the soft contours of
      gentle slopes, the rippling of fine snow under a steady wind, the long shadow ridges of
      shining powder on the lee of trees and stones and rocks, the delicate wind streaks over broad
      surfaces like the marks of a chisel in marble, the crests and cornices, the vivid brightness
      of edges in the sun, the glowing yellowish light on sunlit surfaces, the long blue shadows,
      the flush of sunset and sunrise and the pallid unearthly desolation of snow beneath the moon.
      Nor need the broken snow in woods and amidst tumbled stony slopes be described, nor the vast
      soft overhanging crests on every outstanding rock beside the icebound river, nor the huge
      stalactites and stalagmites of green-blue ice below the cliffs, nor trees burdened and broken
      by frost and snow, nor snow upon ice, nor the blue pools at mid-day upon the surface of the
      ice-stream. Across the smooth wind-swept ice of the open tarns they would find a growth of ice
      flowers, six-rayed and complicated, more abundant and more beautiful than the Alpine
       summer flowers.
But the wind was very bitter, and the sun had scarcely passed its zenith before the thought
      of fuel and shelter came back into their minds.
As they approached Partington's tilt, at the point where his trapping ground turned out of
      the Green River gorge, he became greatly obsessed by the thought of his traps. He began to
      talk of all that he might find in them, all he hoped to find, and the "dallars" that might
      ensue. They slept the third night, Marjorie within and the two men under the lee of the little
      cabin, and Partington was up and away before dawn to a trap towards the ridge. He had infected
      Marjorie and Trafford with a sympathetic keenness, but when they saw his killing of a marten
      that was still alive in its trap, they suddenly conceived a distaste for trapping.
They insisted they must witness no more. They would wait while he went to a trap....
"Think what he's doing!" said Trafford, as they sat together under the lee of a rock waiting
      for him. "We imagined this was a free, simple-souled man leading an unsophisticated life on
      the very edge of humanity, and really he is as much a dependant of your woman's world,
      Marjorie, as any sweated seamstress in a Marylebone slum. Lord! how far those pretty wasteful
      hands of women reach! All these poor broken and starving beasts he finds and slaughters are,
      from the point of view of our world, just furs. Furs! Poor little snarling unfortunates! Their
      pelts will be dressed and prepared because women who have never dreamt of this bleak
      wilderness desire them. They will get at last into Regent Street shops, and Bond Street shops,
      and shops in Fifth Avenue and in Paris and Berlin, they will make delightful deep muffs, with
      scent and little bags and powder puffs and all
       sorts of things tucked away inside, and long wraps for tall women, and jolly
      little frames of soft fur for pretty faces, and dainty coats and rugs for expensive little
      babies in Kensington Gardens."...
"I wonder," reflected Marjorie, "if I could buy one perhaps. As a memento."
He looked at her with eyes of quiet amusement.
"Oh!" she cried, "I didn't mean to! The old Eve!"
"The old Adam is with her," said Trafford. "He's wanting to give it her.... We don't cease
      to be human, Madge, you know, because we've got an idea now of just where we are. I wonder,
      which would you like? I dare say we could arrange it."
"No," said Marjorie, and thought. "It would be jolly," she said. "All the same, you know—and
      just to show you—I'm not going to let you buy me that fur."
"I'd like to," said Trafford.
"No," said Marjorie, with a decision that was almost fierce. "I mean it. I've got more to do
      than you in the way of reforming. It's just because always I've let my life be made up of such
      little things that I mustn't. Indeed I mustn't. Don't make things hard for me."
He looked at her for a moment. "Very well," he said. "But I'd have liked to."...
"You're right," he added, five seconds later.
"Oh! I'm right."

One day Louis Napoleon sent them on along the trail while he went up the mountain to a trap
      among the trees. He rejoined them—not as his custom was, shouting inaudible conversation for
      the last hundred
       yards or so, but in silence. They wondered at that, and at the one clumsy
      gesture that flourished something darkly grey at them. What had happened to the man? Whatever
      he had caught he was hugging it as one hugs a cat, and stroking it. "Ugh!" he said deeply,
      drawing near. "Oh!" A solemn joy irradiated his face, and almost religious ecstasy found
      expression.
He had got a silver fox, a beautifully marked silver fox, the best luck of Labrador! One
      goes for years without one, in hope, and when it comes, it pays the trapper's debts, it clears
      his life—for years!
They tried poor inadequate congratulation....
As they sat about the fire that night a silence came upon Louis Napoleon. It was manifest
      that his mind was preoccupied. He got up, walked about, inspected the miracle of fur that had
      happened to him, returned, regarded them. "'M'm," he said, and stroked his chin with his
      forefinger. A certain diffidence and yet a certain dignity of assurance mingled in his manner.
      It wasn't so much a doubt of his own correctness as of some possible ignorance of the finer
      shades on their part that might embarrass him. He coughed a curt preface, and intimated he had
      a request to make. Behind the Indian calm of his face glowed tremendous feeling, like the
      light of a foundry furnace shining through chinks in the door. He spoke in a small flat voice,
      exercising great self-control. His wish, he said, in view of all that had happened, was a
      little thing.... This was nearly a perfect day for him, and one thing only remained....
      "Well," he said, and hung. "Well," said Trafford. He plunged. Just simply this. Would they
      give him the brandy bottle and let him get drunk? Mr. Grenfell was a good man, a very good
      man, but he had made brandy dear—dear beyond the reach of common
       men altogether—along the coast....
He explained, dear bundle of clothes and dirt! that he was always perfectly respectable when
      he was drunk.

It seemed strange to Trafford that now that Marjorie was going home, a wild impatience to
      see her children should possess her. So long as it had been probable that they would stay out
      their year in Labrador, that separation had seemed mainly a sentimental trouble; now at times
      it was like an animal craving. She would talk of them for hours at a stretch, and when she was
      not talking he could see her eyes fixed ahead, and knew that she was anticipating a meeting.
      And for the first time it seemed the idea of possible misadventure troubled her....
They reached Hammond's in one and twenty days from Lonely Hut, three days they had been
      forced to camp because of a blizzard, and three because Louis Napoleon was rigidly
      Sabbatarian. They parted from him reluctantly, and the next day Hammond's produced its dogs,
      twelve stout but extremely hungry dogs, and sent the Traffords on to the Green River
      pulp-mills, where there were good beds and a copious supply of hot water. Thence they went to
      Manivikovik, and thence the new Marconi station sent their inquiries home, inquiries that were
      answered next day with matter-of-fact brevity: "Everyone well, love from all."
When the operator hurried with that to Marjorie she received it off-handedly, glanced at it
      carelessly, asked him to smoke, remarked that wireless telegraphy was a wonderful thing, and
      then, in the midst of some unfinished commonplace about the temperature,
       broke down and wept wildly and uncontrollably....

Then came the long, wonderful ride southward day after day along the coast to Port Dupré, a
      ride from headland to headland across the frozen bays behind long teams of straining, furry
      dogs, that leapt and yelped as they ran. Sometimes over the land the brutes shirked and
      loitered and called for the whip; they were a quarrelsome crew to keep waiting; but across the
      sea-ice they went like the wind, and downhill the komatic chased their waving tails. The
      sledges swayed and leapt depressions, and shot athwart icy stretches. The Traffords,
      spectacled and wrapped to their noses, had all the sensations then of hunting an unknown
      quarry behind a pack of wolves. The snow blazed under the sun, out to sea beyond the ice the
      water glittered, and it wasn't so much air they breathed as a sort of joyous hunger.
One day their teams insisted upon racing.
Marjorie's team was the heavier, her driver more skillful, and her sledge the lighter, and
      she led in that wild chase from start to finish, but ever and again Trafford made wild spurts
      that brought him almost level. Once, as he came alongside, she heard him laughing
      joyously.
"Marjorie," he shouted, "d'you remember? Old donkey cart?"
Her team yawed away, and as he swept near again, behind his pack of whimpering, straining,
      furious dogs, she heard him shouting, "You know, that old cart! Under the overhanging trees!
      So thick and green they met overhead! You know! When you and I had our first talk together! In
      the lane. It wasn't
       so fast as this, eh?"...

At Port Dupré they stayed ten days—days that Marjorie could only make tolerable by knitting
      absurd garments for the children (her knitting was atrocious), and then one afternoon they
      heard the gun of the Grenfell, the new winter steamer from St. John's, signalling as
      it came in through the fog, very slowly, from that great wasteful world of men and women
      beyond the seaward grey.
THE END
