CHAPTER XIII
The next morning found Paul de Virieu walking up and down platform No. 9 of the Gare du Nord,
     waiting for Mrs. Bailey's train, which was due to arrive from Lacville at eleven o'clock.
Though he looked as if he hadn't a care in the world save the pleasant care of enjoying the
     present and looking forward to the future, life was very grey just now to the young
     Frenchman.
To a Parisian, Paris in hot weather is a depressing place, even under the pleasantest of
     circumstances, and the Count felt an alien and an outcast in the city where he had spent much
     of his careless and happy youth.
His sister, the Duchesse d'Eglemont, who had journeyed all the way from Brittany to see him
     for two or three days, had received him with that touch of painful affection which the kindly
     and the prosperous so often bestow on those whom they feel to be at once beloved and
     prodigal.
When with his dear Marie-Anne, Paul de Virieu always felt as though he had been condemned to
     be guillotined, and as if she were doing everything to make his last days on earth as pleasant
     as possible.
When he had proposed that his sister should ask his new friend, this English widow he had met
     at Lacville, to luncheon—nay more, when he had asked Marie-Anne to lend Mrs. Bailey a riding
     habit, and to arrange that one of the Duc's horses should come over every morning in order that
     he and Mrs. Bailey might ride together—the kind Duchesse had at once assented, almost too
     eagerly, to his requests. And she had asked her brother no tiresome, indiscreet questions as to
     his relations with the young Englishwoman,—whether, for instance, he was really fond of Sylvia,
     whether it was conceivably possible that he was thinking of marrying her?
And, truth to tell, Paul de Virieu would have found it very difficult to give an honest
     answer to the question. He was in a strange, debatable state of mind about Sylvia—beautiful,
     simple, unsophisticated Sylvia Bailey.
He told himself, and that very often, that the young Englishwoman, with her absurd, touching
     lack of worldly knowledge, had no business to be living in such a place as Lacville, wasting
     her money at the Baccarat tables, and knowing such queer people as were—well, yes, even Anna
     Wolsky was queer—Madame Wolsky and the Wachners!
But if Sylvia Bailey had no business to be at Lacville, he, Paul de Virieu, had no business
     to be flirting with her as he was doing—for though Sylvia was honestly unaware of the fact, the
     Count was carrying on what he well knew to be a very agreeable flirtation with the lady he
     called in his own mind his "petite amie Anglaise," and very much he was enjoying the
     experience—when his conscience allowed him to enjoy it.
Till the last few weeks Paul de Virieu had supposed himself to have come to that time of life
     when a man can no longer feel the delicious tremors of love. Now no man, least of all a
     Frenchman, likes to feel that this time has come, and it was inexpressibly delightful to him to
     know that he had been mistaken—that he could still enjoy the most absorbing and enchanting
     sensation vouchsafed to poor humanity.
He was in love! In love for the first time for many years, and with a sweet, happy-natured
     woman, who became more intimately dear to him every moment that went by. Indeed, he knew that
     the real reason why he had felt so depressed last night and even this morning was because he
     was parted from Sylvia.
But where was it all to end? True, he had told Mrs. Bailey the truth about himself very early
     in their acquaintance—in fact, amazingly soon, and he had been prompted to do so by a feeling
     which defied analysis.
But still, did Sylvia, even now, realise what that truth was? Did she in the least understand
     what it meant for a man to be bound and gagged, as he was bound and gagged, lashed to the
     chariot of the Goddess of Chance? No, of course she did not realise it—how could such a woman
     as was Sylvia Bailey possibly do so?
Walking up and down the long platform, chewing the cud of bitter reflection, Paul de Virieu
     told himself that the part of an honest man, to say nothing of that of an honourable gentleman,
     would be to leave Lacville before matters had gone any further between them. Yes, that was what
     he was bound to do by every code of honour.
And then, just as he had taken the heroic resolution of going back to Brittany with his
     sister, as Marie-Anne had begged him to do only that morning, the Lacville train steamed into
     the station—and with the sight of Sylvia's lovely face all his good resolutions flew to the
     winds.
She stepped down from the high railway carriage, and looked round her with a rather
     bewildered air, for a crowd of people were surging round her, and she had not yet caught sight
     of Count Paul.
Wearing a pinkish mauve cotton gown and a large black tulle hat, Sylvia looked enchantingly
     pretty. And if the Count's critical French eyes objected to the alliance of a cotton gown and
     tulle hat, and to the wearing of a string of large pearls in the morning, he was in the state
     of mind when a man of fastidious taste forgives even a lack of taste in the woman to whom he is
     acting as guide, philosopher, and friend.
He told himself that Sylvia Bailey could not be left alone in a place like Lacville, and that
     it was his positive duty to stay on there and look after her....
Suddenly their eyes met. Sylvia blushed—Heavens! how adorable she looked when there came that
     vivid rose-red blush over her rounded cheeks. And she was adorable in a simple, unsophisticated
     way, which appealed to Paul de Virieu as nothing in woman had ever appealed to him before.
He could not help enjoying the thought of how surprised his sister would be. Marie-Anne had
     doubtless pictured Mrs. Bailey as belonging to the rather hard, self-assertive type of young
     Englishwoman of whom Paris sees a great deal. But Sylvia looked girlishly simple, timid, and
     confiding.
As he greeted her, Paul de Virieu's manner was serious, almost solemn. But none the less,
     while they walked side by side in a quiet, leisurely fashion through the great grey station,
     Sylvia felt as if she had indeed passed through the shining portals of fairyland.
In the covered courtyard stood the Duchesse's carriage. Count Paul motioned the footman aside
     and stood bareheaded while Sylvia took her place in the victoria. As he sat down by her side he
     suddenly observed, "My brother-in-law does not like motor-cars," and Sylvia felt secret,
     shame-faced gratitude to the Duc d'Eglemont, for, thanks to this prejudice of his, the moments
     now being spent by her alone with Count Paul were trebled.
As the carriage drove with swift, gondola-like motion through the hot streets, Sylvia felt
     more than ever as if she were in a new, enchanted country—that dear country called Romance,
     and, as if to prolong the illusion, the Count began to talk what seemed to her the language of
     that country.
"Every Frenchman," he exclaimed, abruptly, "is in love with love, and when you hear—as you
     may do sometimes, Madame—that a Frenchman is rarely in love with his own wife, pray answer that
     this is quite untrue! For it often happens that in his wife a Frenchman discovers the love he
     has sought elsewhere in vain."
He looked straight before him as he added: "As for marriage—well, marriage is in my country
     regarded as a very serious matter indeed! No Frenchman goes into marriage as light-heartedly as
     does the average Englishman, and as have done, for instance, so many of my own English
     schoolfellows. No, to a Frenchman his marriage means everything or nothing, and if he loved a
     woman it would appear to him a dastardly action to ask her to share his life if he did not
     believe that life to be what would be likely to satisfy her, to bring her honour and
     happiness."
Sylvia turned to him, and, rather marvelling at her own temerity, she asked a fateful
     question:
"But would love ever make the kind of Frenchman you describe give up a way of life that was
     likely to make his wife unhappy?"
Count Paul looked straight into the blue eyes which told him so much more than their owner
     knew they told.
"Yes! He might easily give up that life for the sake of a beloved woman. But would he remain
     always faithful in his renunciation? That is the question which none, least of all himself, can
     answer!"
The victoria was now crossing one of the bridges which are, perhaps, the noblest possession
     of outdoor Paris.
Count Paul changed the subject. He had seen with mingled pain and joy how much his last
     honest words had troubled her.
"My brother-in-law has never cared to move west, as so many of his friends have done," he
     observed. "He prefers to remain in the old family house that was built by his great-grandfather
     before the French Revolution."
Soon they were bowling along a quiet, sunny street, edged with high walls overhung with
     trees. The street bore the name of Babylon.
And indeed there was something almost Babylonian, something very splendid in the vast
     courtyard which formed the centre of what appeared, to Sylvia's fascinated eyes, a grey stone
     palace. The long rows of high, narrow windows which now encompassed her were all closed, but
     with the clatter of the horses' hoofs on the huge paving-stones the great house stirred into
     life.
The carriage drew up. Count Paul jumped out and gave Sylvia his hand. Huge iron doors, that
     looked as if they could shut out an invading army, were flung open, and after a moment's pause,
     Paul de Virieu led Sylvia Bailey across the threshold of the historic Hôtel d'Eglemont.
She had never seen, she had never imagined, such pomp, such solemn state, as that which
     greeted her, and there came across her a childish wish that Anna Wolsky and the Wachners could
     witness the scene—the hall hung with tapestries given to an ancestor of the Duc d'Eglemont by
     Louis the Fourteenth, the line of powdered footmen, and the solemn major-domo who ushered them
     up the wide staircase, at the head of which there stood a slender, white-clad young woman, with
     a sweet, eager face.
This was the first time Sylvia Bailey had met a duchess, and she was perhaps a little
     surprised to see how very unpretentious a duchess could be!
Marie-Anne d'Eglemont spoke in a low, almost timid voice, her English being far less good
     than her brother's, and yet how truly kind and highly-bred she at once showed herself, putting
     Sylvia at her ease, and appearing to think there was nothing at all unusual in Mrs. Bailey's
     friendship with Paul de Virieu!
And then, after they had lunched in an octagon room of which each panel had been painted by
     Van Loo, and which opened on a garden where the green glades and high trees looked as if they
     must be far from a great city, there suddenly glided in a tiny old lady, dressed in a sweeping
     black gown and little frilled lace cap.
Count Paul bowing low before her, kissed her waxen-looking right hand.
"My dear godmother, let me present to you Mrs. Bailey," and Sylvia felt herself being
     closely, rather pitilessly, inspected by shrewd though not unkindly eyes—eyes sunken, dimmed by
     age, yet seeing more, perhaps, than younger eyes would have seen.
The old Marquise beckoned to Count Paul, and together they slowly walked through into the
     garden and paced away down a shaded alley. For the first time Sylvia and Marie-Anne d'Eglemont
     were alone together.
"I wish to thank you for your kindness to my poor Paul," the Duchesse spoke in a low,
     hesitating voice. "You have so much influence over him, Madame."
Sylvia shook her head.
"Ah! But yes, you have!" She looked imploringly at Sylvia. "You know what I mean? You know
     what I would ask you to do? My husband could give Paul work in the country, work he would love,
     for he adores horses, if only he could be rescued from this terrible infatuation, this passion
     for play."
She stopped abruptly, for the Count and his little, fairy-like godmother had turned round,
     and were now coming towards them.
Sylvia rose instinctively to her feet, for the tiny Marquise was very imposing.
"Sit down, Madame," she said imperiously, and Sylvia meekly obeyed.
The old lady fixed her eyes with an appraising gaze on her godson's English friend.
"Permit me to embrace you," she exclaimed suddenly. "You are a very pretty creature! And
     though no doubt young lips often tell you this, the compliments of the old have the merit of
     being quite sincere!"
She bent down, and Sylvia, to her confusion and surprise, felt her cheeks lightly kissed by
     the withered lips of Paul de Virieu's godmother.
"Madame Bailey's rouge is natural; it does not come off!" the old lady exclaimed, and a smile
     crept over her parchment-coloured face. "Not but what a great deal of nonsense is talked about
     the usage of rouge, my dear children! There is no harm in supplementing the niggardly gifts of
     nature. You, for instance, Marie-Anne, would look all the better for a little rouge!" She spoke
     in a high, quavering voice.
The Duchesse smiled. Her brother had always been the old Marquise's favourite.
"But I should feel so ashamed if it came off," she said lightly; "if, for instance, I felt
     one of my cheeks growing pale while the other remained bright red?"
"That would never happen if you used what I have often told you is the only rouge a lady
     should use, that is, the sap of the geranium blossom—that gives an absolutely natural tint to
     the skin, and my own dear mother always used it. You remember how Louis XVIII. complimented her
     on her beautiful complexion at the first Royal ball held after the Restoration? Well, the
     Sovereign's gracious words were entirely owing to the geranium blossom!"
