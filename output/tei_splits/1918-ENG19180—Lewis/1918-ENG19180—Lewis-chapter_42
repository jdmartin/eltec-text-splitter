CHAPTER I
Bertha was still being taken in carefully prepared doses of an hour a day: from half-past
      four to a quarter to six. Any one else would have found this much of Bertha insupportable
      under any conditions. But Tarr’s eccentric soul had been used to such far greater doses that
      this was the minimum he considered necessary for a cure.
Tarr came to her every day with the regularity of an old gentleman at a German “Bad”
      taking his spring water at the regulation hour. But the cure was finishing. There were signs
      of a new robustness, (hateful to her) equivalent to a springy walk and a contented and sunny
      eye, that heralded departure. His daily visits, with their brutal regularity, did her as much
      harm as they did him good.
The news of Soltyk’s death, then Kreisler’s, affected the readily melodramatic side of her
      nature peculiarly. Death had made himself de la partie. Kreisler had left her alone
      for a few days. This is what had occupied him. The sensational news, without actually pushing
      her to imitation, made her own case, and her own tragic sensations, more real. They
      had received, in an indirect and cousin-thrice-removed sort of way, the authority of Death.
      Death — real living Death — was somewhere on the scene. His 
       presence was announced, was felt. He had struck down somebody among them.
In the meantime this disposed of Kreisler for ever. Tarr as well appeared to feel that they
      were left in tête-à-tête. A sort of chaperon had been lost in Kreisler. His official
      post as protector or passive “obstacle” had been a definite status. If he stayed on, it
      would have to be as something else. On the day on which the news of Kreisler’s end arrived,
      he talked of leaving for England. Her more drawn face, longer silences, sharp glances, once
      more embarrassed him.
He did not go to England at once. In the week or two succeeding his meeting with Anastasya
      in the restaurant he saw her frequently. So a chaperon was found. Bertha was officially
      presented to her successor. When she learnt that Anastasya had been chosen, her energy
      reformed. She braced herself for a substantial struggle.
The apparition at the window of the restaurant was her first revived activity.
