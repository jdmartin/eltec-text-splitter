CHAPTER X
THE DWELLER ALONE
"
     
Well, Sarah Brown, here we are," said the witch, her Byronic hair flying as she
     sat perilously on the rail of the deck. The distant flying buttresses of New York were
     supporting a shining sky, and north and east lay the harbour and sea, and many ships moving
     with the glad gait of home-comers after perilous voyaging.
Every minute upon the sea is a magic minute, but the voyage of the witch and Sarah Brown had
     been unmarked by any supernatural activities on the part of the witch. She had been more or
     less extinguished by the presence of five hundred Americans, not one of whom had ever heard the
     word "magic" used, except by advertisers in connection with their wares.
Miss Ford had been left behind, cured for ever of nerve-storms. She had become unexpectedly
     engaged to Mr. Bernard Tovey while looking for a porter on Lime Street Station, Liverpool, and
     had returned with him to London to celebrate the event by means of a Super-Wednesday. The Mayor
     also had failed to embark. Indeed the unfortunate man had not been heard of since
     his seizure on the night of the fire, and I believe that the London police are still trying to
     arrest him as a German spy.
"Here we are," said the witch to Sarah Brown. "At least, I suppose this City on its Tiptoes
     is New York. Do you think I ought to call the attention of the Captain to that largish lady on
     our left, who seems to be marooned upon a rock, and signalling to us for help?"
"That is the Statue of Liberty," said three neighbouring Americans in chorus.
"How d'you mean — Liberty?" asked the witch.
The three Americans froze her with three glances.
"America is the home of Liberty," they said all together.
"Oh yes, of course, how stupid of me," said the witch. "I ought to have remembered that every
     country is the Home of Liberty. Such a pity that Liberty never seems to begin at home. Every
     big shop in London, you know, is labelled Patronised by Royalty,
     yet I have bought haberdashery by the hour without running across a single queen.
     I suppose if you didn't have this big label sticking up in your harbour, you Americans might
     forget that America is the Home of Liberty. I know quite a lot about America from a grey
     squirrel who rents my may-tree on Mitten Island. It is a long time since he came over, but he
     still chitters with a strong New England accent. He came away because he was a socialist. I
     gather America is too full of Liberty to leave room for socialism, isn't that so? My squirrel
     says there are only two parties in America, Republicans and Sinners — at least I think that was
     what he said — and anybody who belongs to neither of these parties is given penal servitude for
     life. So I understood, but I may be wrong. I am not very good at politics. Anyway, my squirrel
     had to leave the Home of Liberty and come to England, so as to be able to say what he thought.
     I wish I were there too. Sarah Brown, I don't yet know why you brought me here."
"I brought you here to escape the Law," said Sarah Brown.
     
"How d'you mean — escape the Law? Didn't you know that all magic lives and thrives on the
     wrath of the Law? Have you forgotten our heroic tradition of martyrdom and the stake? Isn't the
     world tame enough already? What do you want Magic to become? A branch of the Civil
     Service?"
"I spent all I had in bringing you here," said Sarah Brown. "I left all I loved to bring you
     here. I am as if dead in England now. Nobody there will ever think of me again, except as a
     thing that has been heard the last of."
The witch looked kindly at her. "You know," she said, "when you first told me to go away,
     after Harold made that bad landing on a policeman, I thought perhaps you were a sort of cinema
     villainess, driving me away from my house and heritage. At first I thought of arguing the
     matter, but then I remembered that villains always have a rotten time, without being bullied
     and persecuted by the rest of us. Besides solid things are never worth fighting over. So I have
     been patient with you all this time, and have fallen in courteously with all your fiendish
     plans — as I thought — and now I am
     glad I was patient, for I see you meant well. Dear Sarah Brown, you did mean well.
     How sad it is that people who have once lived in the House of Living Alone can never make a
     success of friendship. You say you left all you loved — what business have you with love? Thank
     you, my dear, for meaning so well, and for these fair days at sea. But I mustn't stay with you.
     I mustn't set foot on this land — I can smell cleverness and un-magic even from here. I must go
     back to my little Spring island, and my parish of Faery...."
"Ah, witch, don't leave me, don't leave me like this, ill and bewildered and so far from
     home...."
"How can you ever be far from home, you, a dweller in the greatest home of all. Did you think
     you had destroyed the House of Living Alone? Did you think you could escape from it?"
Sarah Brown said nothing. She watched the witch call Harold her Broomstick to her, and adjust
     the saddle and tighten the strap round his middle. She watched her mount and embark upon the
     sunny air. The three Americans were talking politics, and did
     not notice anything but each other. The witch alighted for a moment on one spike
     of the crown of Liberty, and climbing carefully down on to the lady's parting, was seen by
     Sarah Brown to bend down till her head hung apoplectically upside down, and gaze long and
     curiously into that impassive bronze eye. Presently she remounted Harold, and, with a flippant
     and ambiguous gesture of her foot, launched herself eastward. She disappeared without looking
     back.
The dock was reached. Sarah Brown collected David her Dog, and Humphrey her Suit-case. Hers
     was a very wieldy family. An official asked her something, using one side of his mouth only to
     do so, in the alarming manner of American officials.
"I cannot hear you," said Sarah Brown. "I am stone deaf."
And she stepped over the threshold of the greater House of Living Alone.
