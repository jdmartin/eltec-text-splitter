CHAPTER II
The mating of William and Griselda might be called an ideal mating; theirs were indeed two
     hearts that beat as one. With each day they were happier in each other's company; their minds
     as it were flowed together and intermingled joyously—minds so alike and akin that it would have
     been difficult, without hearing the voice that spoke it, to distinguish an utterance of
     Griselda from an idea formulated by William. Their prominent blue eyes—they both had prominent
     blue eyes—looked out upon the world from exactly the same point of view; and as they had been
     trained by the same influences and were incapable of forming an independent judgment, it would
     not have been easy to find cause of disagreement between them. There are men and women not a
     few who find their complement in their contrast; but of such were not William and Griselda.
     Their standard of conduct was rigid and their views were pronounced; those who did not share
     their views and act in conformity with their standards were outside the pale of their liking.
     And this not because they were abnormally or essentially uncharitable, but because they had
     lived for so long less as individuals than as members of organizations—a form of existence
     which will end by sucking charity out of the sweetest heart alive.
It was well for them, therefore, that their creed, like their code of manners and morals, was
     identical or practically identical. It was a simple creed and they held to it loyally and
     faithfully. They believed in a large, vague and beautifully undefined identity, called by
     William the People, and by Griselda, Woman; who in the time to come was to accomplish much
     beautiful and undefined Good; and in whose service they were prepared meanwhile to suffer any
     amount of obloquy and talk any amount of nonsense. They believed that Society could be
     straightened and set right by the well-meaning efforts of well-meaning souls like
     themselves—aided by the Ballot, the Voice of the People, and Woman. They believed, in defiance
     of the teachings of history, that Democracy is another word for peace and goodwill towards men.
     They believed (quite rightly) in the purity of their own intentions; and concluded (quite
     wrongly) that the intentions of all persons who did not agree with them must therefore be evil
     and impure.... They were, in short, very honest and devout sectarians—cocksure, contemptuous,
     intolerant, self-sacrificing after the manner of their kind.
They held, as I have said, to their own opinions strongly and would have died rather than
     renounce, or seem to renounce, them—which did not restrain them from resenting the same
     attitude of mind and heart in others. What in themselves they admired as loyalty, they
     denounced in others as interested and malignant stubbornness. More—it did not prevent them from
     disliking and despising many excellent persons whose opinions, if analysed, would have proved
     nearly akin to their own. William, for instance, would all but foam at the mouth when
     compulsory service in the army was the subject of conversation, and "militarism," to him, was
     the blackest of all the works of the devil; but he was bitter, and violently bitter, against
     the blackleg who objected to compulsory service in a Trade Union, and had spoken, times without
     number, in hearty encouragement of that form of siege warfare which is commonly known as a
     Strike. He was a pacifist of the type which seeks peace and ensues it by insisting firmly, and
     even to blood, that it is the other side's duty to give way.
Griselda also was a pacifist—when it suited her and when she had got her way. She believed in
     a future World-Amity, brought about chiefly by Woman; meanwhile, she exulted loudly and
     frequently in the fighting qualities of her sex. Like William, she had no quarrel with
     Continental nations; on the contrary, what she had seen of Continental nations during a
     fortnight's stay at Interlaken had inclined her to look on them with favour. Like William, her
     combatant instincts were concentrated on antagonists nearer home; she knew them better and
     therefore disliked them more. It is a mistake to suppose that either nations or individuals
     will necessarily like the people they see most of; if you must know a man in order to love him,
     you seldom hate a man with whom you have not acquaintance. Nothing could have been more ideally
     peaceful than the relations of China and England during the Middle Ages—for the simple reason
     that China and England knew absolutely nothing of each other. In the same way, if in a lesser
     degree, Griselda and William had a friendly feeling for Germany and the German people. They had
     never been to Germany and knew nothing of her history or politics; but they had heard of the
     Germans as intelligent people addicted to spectacles, beer and sonatas, and established on the
     banks of the Rhine. And—the Rhine being some way off—they liked them.
As internationalists they had no words too strong for standing armies and their methods; but
     upon military operations against domestic tyrants they looked with less disapproval. There
     existed, I believe, in the back of their minds some ill-defined distinction between bloodshed
     perpetrated by persons clad in uniform and by persons not so clad—between fighting with
     bayonets and fighting with bombs and brickbats. The one was militarism and unjustifiable; the
     other heroism and holy. Had you been unkind enough to pen them into a corner and force them to
     acknowledge that there are many born warriors out of khaki, they would have ended probably by
     declaring that one should take arms only against tyranny and in a righteous cause—and so have
     found themselves in entire agreement not only with their adversary but with the Tory Party, the
     German Emperor, the professional soldier and poor humanity in general. The elect, when one
     comes to examine them, are not always so very elect. The difficulty would have been to persuade
     them that there could be two opinions concerning a cause they espoused; their little vision was
     as narrow as it was pure, and their little minds were so seldom exhausted by thinking. Apostles
     of the reign of Woman and of International Amity, they might have been summed up as the perfect
     type of aggressor.
With regard to what used to be called culture (before August 1914), the attainments of
     William and Griselda were very much on a level. They read newspapers written by persons who
     wholly agreed with their views; they read pamphlets issued, and books recommended, by societies
     of which they were members. From these they quoted, in public and imposingly, with absolute
     faith in their statements. Of history and science, of literature and art, they knew nothing, or
     next to nothing; and, their ignorance being mutual, neither bored the other by straying away
     from the subjects in which both were interested.... As I have said, their mating was an ideal
     mating.
The period of their engagement was not without its beauty; an ever-present consciousness of
     their mission to mankind did not prevent them from being blissful as loving young couples are
     blissful—it merely coloured their relations and spiritualized them. One evening, not long
     before their wedding, they sat together in Battersea Park on a bench and dedicated their mutual
     lives to the service of Progress and Humanity. They had invented a suitable formula for the
     occasion and repeated it softly, one after the other, holding each other's hands. Griselda's
     voice trembled as she vowed, in semi-ecclesiastical phraseology, that not even her great love
     for William should wean her from her life's work; and William's voice shook back as he vowed in
     his turn that not even Griselda, the woman of his dreams, should make him neglectful of the
     call of Mankind and his duty to the holiest of causes. It was a very solemn little moment; man
     and woman, affianced lovers, they dedicated themselves to their mission, the uplifting of the
     human race. They were spared the doubts which would have assailed wiser heads as to the manner
     of accomplishing their mission; and as they sat side by side on the bench, with their hands
     clasped, they knew themselves for acceptable types and forerunners of the world they were
     helping to create.... Man and Woman, side by side, vowed to service.
"We shall never forget this evening," Griselda whispered as the sun dipped down in glory. "In
     all our lives there can be nothing more beautiful than this."
She was right; the two best gifts of life are love and an approving conscience. These twain,
     William and Griselda, loved each other sincerely—if not with the tempestuous passion of a Romeo
     and a Juliet, with an honest and healthy affection; they had for each other an attraction which
     could set their pulses beating and start them dreaming dreams. That evening, on the bench in
     Battersea Park, they had dreamed their dreams—while their consciences looked on and smiled.
     They foreshadowed their home not only as a nest where they two and their children should dwell,
     but as a centre of light and duty—as they understood duty and light; a meeting-place for the
     like-minded, where fresh courage could be gathered for the strife with prejudice and evil. They
     pictured themselves (this was in June 1914) as what they would have called Powers—as a man and
     a woman working for progress and destined to leave their mark. The sense of their destiny awed
     and elated them—and they walked away from Battersea Park with their hearts too full for
     speech.
On the way home a flaring headline distracted Griselda temporarily from her dreams. "Who's
     this Archduke that's been assassinated?" she asked. (Her morning's reading had been confined to
      The Suffragette.)
"Austrian," William informed her. (He had read the Daily Herald.) "Franz Joseph—no,
     Franz Ferdinand—the heir to the Austrian throne."
"Who assassinated him?" his betrothed inquired, not very much interested.
"I can't remember their names," William admitted, "but there seem to have been several in it.
     Anyhow, he's been assassinated. Somewhere in the Balkans. With bombs."
"Oh!" said Griselda, ceasing to be interested at all. Her mind had turned from traffic in
     strange archdukes and was running on a high resolve; the solemn vow of service was translating
     itself into action.
"I shall go to the meeting to-morrow," she announced, "and make my protest."
William knew what was passing in her mind and made no effort to dissuade her. No more than
     she dared he let their mutual happiness enervate them—it must urge them to high endeavour, to
     struggle and sacrifice for the Cause.
"I'll go too," he said simply, "if I can manage to get a ticket."
"Oh, I'll get you a ticket," Griselda told him; "they're sure to have some at the office"—and
     thanked him with a squeeze of the fingers that set his pulses beating.
She was as good as her word, and the next night saw him in a Cabinet Minister's audience.
     From his seat in the arena (their seats were not together and the pair had entered separately)
     his eye sought for Griselda and found her easily in the first row of the balcony—most obviously
     composed and with her gloved hands folded on the rail. She was dressed in pale blue, with a
     flowered toque perched on her head; her blue silk blouse, in view of possibilities, was firmly
     connected by safety-pins with the belt of her blue cloth skirt, and her hair secured more
     tightly than usual by an extra allowance of combs. Previous experience had taught her the
     wisdom of these measures. As usual, in accordance with the tradition of her party, she had
     insisted in her costume on the ultra-feminine note; her blouse savoured of Liberty and there
     was a cluster of rosebuds at her breast. She was breathing quickly, so her mouth was more open
     than usual; otherwise she gave no sign of mental or physical trepidation—save a studied
     indifference which might have betrayed her to an eye sufficiently acute. To William she looked
     adorable and his heart swelled with admiration of her courage and determination to sustain her
     in her protest to the uttermost; he vowed to himself to be worthy of such a mate.
He did his best to prove himself worthy when the critical moment came. He waited for that
     moment during more than three-quarters of an hour—for Griselda was not without confederates,
     and three ladies in picture hats and a gentleman in the garb of a Nonconformist minister had
     arisen at intervals to make the running before her voice rang out. All were suppressed, though
     not without excitement; two of the ladies parted with their hats and the clergyman broke a
     chair. The chair and the clergyman having been alike removed, the audience buzzed down into
     silence, and for full five minutes there was peace—until the speaker permitted himself a
     jesting allusion to the recently exported objectors. A man with a steward's rosette in his coat
     was stationed in the gangway close to William; and as the laughter the jest had provoked died
     away, he swore under his breath, "By God, there's another in the balcony!" William swung round,
     saw Griselda on her feet and heard her voice shrill out—to him an inspiration and a clarion, to
     the steward a source of profanity.
"Mr. Chairman, I rise to protest against the speaker's gross insult to the noble women
     who——"
A man in the seat behind clapped his hands on her shoulders and rammed her back into her
     chair—where she writhed vigorously, calling him coward and demanding how he dared! His grip,
     sufficiently hard to be unpleasant, roused her fighting instincts and gave a fillip to her
     conscientious protest; in contact with actual, if not painful, personal violence, she found it
     easier to scream, hit out and struggle. Two stewards, starting from either end of the row of
     chairs, were wedging themselves towards her; she clung to her seat with fingers and toes, and
     shrieked a regulation formula which the meeting drowned in opprobrium. Conscious of rectitude,
     the jeers and hoots but encouraged her and fired her blood; and when her hands were wrenched
     from their hold on the chair she clung and clawed to the shoulder of her next-door neighbour—a
     stout and orthodox Liberal who thrust her from him, snorting indignation. One steward had her
     gripped under the armpits, the other with difficulty mastered her active ankles; and, wriggling
     like a blue silk eel and crowing her indefatigable protest, she was bundled in rapid and
     business-like fashion to a side entrance of the building.
"Cowards!" she ejaculated as she found her feet on the pavement.
"Damned little cat!" was the ungentlemanly rejoinder. "If you come here again I'll pare your
     nasty little nails for you."
And, dabbing a scored left hand with his handkerchief, the steward returned to his
     duties—leaving Griselda in the centre of a jocular crowd attracted to the spot by several
     previous ejections. She was minus her rosebuds, her toque and quite half of her hairpins; on
     the other hand, she held tightly grasped in her fingers a crumpled silk necktie which had once
     been the property of a stout and orthodox Liberal. She was conscious that she had acted with
     perfect dignity as well as with unusual courage—and that consciousness, combined with her
     experience of similar situations, enabled her to sustain with calm contempt the attentions of
     the jocular crowd.
"You'd like a taxi, I suppose, miss?" the constable on duty suggested—having also
     considerable experience of similar situations. Griselda assented and the taxi was duly hailed.
     Before it arrived at the kerb she was joined on the pavement by her lover, who had left the
     meeting by the same door as his betrothed and in much the same manner and condition; he had
     parted with a shoe as well as a hat, and one of his braces was broken. A hearty shove assisted
     him down the steps to the pavement where, to the applause of the unthinking multitude, he fell
     on his knees in an attitude of adoration before Griselda's friend the constable. Recovering his
     equilibrium, he would have turned again to the assault; but his game attempt to re-enter the
     building was frustrated not only by a solidly extended arm of the law but by the intervention
     of Griselda herself.
"You have done enough for to-night, dear," she whispered, taking his arm. "My instructions
     are not to insist on arrest. We have made our protest—we can afford to withdraw."
She led the retreat to the taxi with a dignity born of practice; William, now conscious of
     his snapped brace, following with less deportment. The vehicle once clear of the jeering crowd,
     Griselda put her arms round her lover and kissed his forehead solemnly.
"My dear one," she said, "I am proud of you."
"Oh, Griselda, I'm proud of you," he murmured between their kisses. "How brave you are—how
     wonderful!—how dared they! ... I went nearly mad when I saw them handling you—I hit out, and
     the cowards knocked me down.... A woman raising her voice on the side of justice—and they
     silence her with brutal violence——"
"It's only what we must expect, dear," she whispered back, stroking his rumpled hair.
     "Remember this is War—God knows it's horrible, but we must not shrink from it."
She spoke from her heart, from the profound ignorance of the unread and unimaginative ... and
     once more in the darkness of the taxi the warriors clasped and kissed.
